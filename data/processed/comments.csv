No PRs should be accepted unless the owner of the data (preferably a senior/experienced dev) approves it.* Idempotency, idempotency, idempotency. Probably the most crucial part of any data warehouse pipeline. It is really not that hard to implement these days (most modern pipelines and warehouses have multiple ways to enforce it). Prevents 95%+ of data inconsistency issues in production.* Backwards/forwards compatible transfer protocol. My current favorite is Protobuf (or proto-adjacent forks) for its 'data-contract'-iness behavior, but Avro + schema registry works too (though I personally hate having to manage yet one more cog in the flow)* Monorepo your schemas. Slightly controversial take, but this helps definitions/migrations fail at *compilation time*, which in my experience reduces runtime problems by orders of magnitude.* Pick a database that can be locally initialized via a container, and keep an append-only log of all migrations in git. This makes testing so much more reproducible, and makes it quite rare to have unexpected issues in production you didn't find at the test phase.In my experience following most/all of these makes everything else follow naturally in place.",InsertNickname,2025-09-27 06:52:20,56,dataengineering,t3_1nrnvv3,False,

Only break out separate tables for dimensional models or specific serving use-cases (e.g., a narrow “page\_views” mart), not for raw ingestion.* Identity & causality: require source-side IDs. Minimum viable set: `event_id` (UUID), `user_id` (or `user_pseudo_id`), `device_id`, `session_id`, and a `trace_id`/`parent_event_id` for linking (think W3C Trace Context / OpenTelemetry). If long-lived cookies aren’t allowed, do deterministic or probabilistic sessionization early in the pipeline (sliding time windows, inactivity thresholds). Also emit join keys for common patterns (e.g., `impression_id` on view + `click` carries that id).* At your scale (hundreds of millions/day): append-only raw, dedupe on `(event_id)`; compact small files; enforce a schema registry; backfill via streaming + incremental merge; materialize derived marts for sessions, funnels, and attribution.

We do some redaction and add metadata.Ignoring the Scala part of it since that wasn't the question, the key points (I did this when I was a team of one) are essentially:- `protobuf`/any version controlled schema that supports evolution- A source of truth for permutations (e.g. an ADT/enum/proto) that stays up-to-date- Code gen: Avro schemas from protobufs (`avro4s` and `scalapb` for us) + potentially metadata injection- Generic, re-usable code (e.g., we have a `Pipeline[A <: GeneratedMessage : Redacted]`, rather than a `EventAPipeline`. All all composed services are generic, too)- Tests tests tests (including generic ones that iterate possible permutations)- CI to enforce said tests (e.g., somebody changes the protobuf and introduces an incompatible type, fail their build and have them talk to you)- Naturally, a scalable database to back this - Iceberg has been treating us well, but I'm also a big fan of Clickhouse, which can do some of the aggregation for youThis is a bit outdated but also has some details on what I did: https://ngrok.com/blog-post/how-we-built-ngroks-data-platform#scaling-apache-flink-scala-and-protobuf-to-650-gbday We don't do any pre-aggregation on purpose, but I suppose you could do that if you wanted to.fwiw you might want to solve #2 first and might even consider a vendor product for it.",otter-in-a-suit,2025-09-30 15:27:36,2,dataengineering,t3_1ntp9ry,False,

I saw people doing separate tables for every type of event and I always wondered what's the gain here. You'll end up with one enormous ""views"" table and hundreds of small various size tables. Most queries won't filter by event type. I guess if you're organizing it in a bucket it should follow hierarchy: platform -> date (yyyy-mm-dd) -> event type since most queries will probably be filtering by date and platform.

They wouldn't have extended an offer if they didn't think you could hack it, but if you like more support, it's probably not a good fit* There's likely very little structure around teams, advancement, and growth.

Hadoop/Spark/Hive experience is still okay, but it’s much more “legacy enterprise” skillset. If you want options in NA or EU in a few years, cloud-native experience will open way more doors.2. **Customer-facing product experience:** Working on something that thousands of companies actually use is huge. It shows you can handle scale, real-time systems, and impact—stuff recruiters notice. Internal ETL for business ops at a big company looks nice on a resume but doesn’t scream “can build product-grade systems.”3. **Fast-paced, growth environment:** Yes, it’s stressful and work-life balance might suck a bit, but that’s exactly where you learn the most. You’ll get exposure to data validation, lineage tracking, fraud detection pipelines—these are highly in-demand skills.4. **International opportunities:** The tech stack + product experience will make moving abroad far easier than internal enterprise ops work. People hiring in NA or EU will instantly recognize those skills.If you want a chill ride and don’t care about moving internationally or building the “modern data engineer” skillset, A is fine.

nfyipp7,"I've been designing DW solutions for 30 years. Up until recently, surrogate keys were always defined as int or bigint and to generate them you used a sequential number generator or similar. This meant a couple things. You almost always had to process your dimension before facts (because the dimension table contained the mapping of the business keys to the dw surrogate key assigned). When processing fact tables, for every fk, you would need to lookup the associated surrogate key in the corresponding dimension table. In the old days when we were all using OLTP based database systems like Oracle and SQL Server (on-prem because that is all we had), using integer based surrogates added in performance at query time). Later Dan L came up with Data Vault methodolgy. That is a very different way of modelling with one of the often listed benefits of being able to process in parallel entities that would be come dimensions from those that were facts. To do this, he used hashing (of some sort) so that you didn't necessarily have to process data in a certain order (apologies if I have some of this wrong....I only worked on 1 DV project 14 years ago). The other thing which occurred was columnar database solutions, the cloud and elastic and ultra scalable dbms solutions like Snowflake (and before that Terradata and Netezza). These systems reduce/eliminate the need to worry about defining surrogate keys as integers and using a hash methodology works fine so hence, you now see many practitioners use a fixed length deterministic hash column as the surrogate.BTW: one of the lesser known reasons for using a surrogate (based on a sequential number generator) was that you build in some isolation from the source system. While not common, systems of record have been known to change the key of a source record (probably seldom happens now) so using a surrogate key meant that it was possible to only need to change the relationship of the dimensional business key to the existing surrogate (no need to update the FK in all related fact tables where it occurred. By using a hash, that won't work anymore since the source key fields which might change, will result in a different hash. But since these new systems are so much faster, probably not a big deal (I don't recall ever running into that situation but I recall Ralph Kimball mentioning this in one of his books...I think)apologies for rambling on.",GreyHairedDWGuy,2025-09-24 15:01:52,7,dataengineering,t3_1np45xe,False,

nfwpe8x,"Hash keys are idempotent, so they should always create the same key from the same natural key. There are a few advantages:* Independent processing: You can generate foreign key without needing to do a lookup. So you could create fact records without needing to join to already loaded dimensions, or satellite and link records without joining to hubs. This allows parallel processing that isn't dependent on load order (warning: it can also lead to including a foreign key that doesn't actually exist)* Prevent having to do multi-column joins. For example when you have to do a diff or merge for incremental load, you can join on the hash key. * Records from the same source data will have the same key in all environments. This can help in some testing scenarios.

nfyonvl,"Op here. Summarizing based on what I read here and other sources. Please add or correct. Advantages of using hash function to generate a surrogate key over creating surrogate key from sequence 1. During table load into distributed system, generating sequence could become a bottleneck where as if we use hash function based on business keys, they could be loaded independently parallel much faster. 2. Anonymization: Hashing protects sensitive data by creating a oneway, non reversible key. By using hash keys, you ensure that the vast majority of your data warehouse users—who are simply analyzing metrics—can't even see the sensitive data because it's not present in the tables they access. Usually dimensional tables hold sensitive info like ssn, credit card etc. 3. Efficiency while doing data lookups and data integration. Use of hash keyed surrogates avoid the need for what they call pre-join. Using a sequential key requires a lookup against the dimension table to find the correct key for a given business key. But if we are using hashed surrogates, we can derive this directly from the business keys and avoid pre-join. I think what they mean is an application querying with business keys does not need to go to the dimension tables first to find the sequence number foreign key and then use that to fetch fact table details. Instead, the application querying can directly generate a hash from the business keys that the user entered and query the fact table directly. 4. If data is sourced from different source systems, the hashed key approach ensures the same key will be generated for say the same customer whereas if we use sequence, that will end up creating multiple records for the same customer causing data integrity issues.",tinkerjreddit,2025-09-24 15:30:39,2,dataengineering,t3_1np45xe,True,

nge1l9h,"I've used both in multi-exabyte environments, my thoughts:1. Hive is 'simpler' than iceberg, which is both good and bad: **Good** because there is less involved management of the objects (no snapshots TTLs for example) and it is simpler to reason about the partitions and buckets (to some extent) but **bad** because you lack access to operations such as MERGE, DELETE, UPDATE that simplify the logic of the pipelines. In hive if you want to create a SCD2 you have to do it in more steps and always with the mindset that you have to move data to another temp or staging table in order to do a final insert with the data you want to 'update'. In iceberg you can just MERGE/UPSERT.2. Iceberg has more functionalities that enable you to write efficient tables and queries to access their data: z-order, bloom filters (supported to some extent in hive table format) and hidden partitions are a few of them, but now that I think about it not a lot of people used them to get the most out of the hardware. You can achieve great results while optimizing large tables if you use them in the right way (good sorting to improve compression, adding bloom filters for columns often used in equi-wheres, use the right type of merge (CoW/MoR) depending on how the data lands in the table and is queried, etc)I would prefer iceberg because of the extra functionalities to manipulate data, but without snapshots or at least a very simplified version of it.",crorella,2025-09-26 22:57:41,17,dataengineering,t3_1nqu1v9,False,

The app can still pass the client ID to the API and government governance can still be insured through whatever tool you’re using on the back end, the AI doesn’t need to know anything about your schema and you don’t have to change your ingest or schema at all.All you have to do is teach your AI about your API, use strict templating to constraint output for pre-rolled reports, and, use a more general template and allow the users to request any report their little hearts desire.

I started evangelizing Snowflake as the “single source of truth” which helped with adoption. Now we have a dedicated snowflake schema for each external integration so permissions are handled at the schema level rather than table level and all I have to do is create secure views when they request more.

Explicit flattening and managing columns yourself; the solution you started with is the most traditional and verbose. Makes most benefit of columnar indexing for performance 2. Making raw data as structs. This has the benefit of displaying as a dictionary (represented close to a nested JSON structure), but you must define a fixed structure (schema on write), thus you lose some flexibility.

Even if you use the JSON type, it's still a string.

It’s still stored columnar in BigQuery, so you don’t lose efficiency, but you gain flexibility for evolving event structures. Then, if you need “wide” representations for certain use cases, you can always build views on top of the JSON (and even automate those views from your parameters table if you want).One other thing: I’d avoid using a dedicated “parameters table” as the system of record for what keys exist. That approach tends to push business logic into data tables instead of code, and since tables aren’t version-controlled like your dbt models, it makes changes harder to track or roll back.So in short: \- JSON gives you resilience against schema changes and type mismatches. \- Views let you expose wide tables when needed, without locking into a brittle schema. \- Keeping the logic in dbt models (instead of a parameters table) makes it easier to track history and review changes.This way you’re balancing efficiency with long-term maintainability.",PolicyDecent,2025-09-29 15:52:38,1,dataengineering,t1_ngubq04,False,

There are two main challenges in migrating it to modern systems:* First - modern systems do not speak the language of structured datasets - so you will have to break it down into two parts - ingestion and transformation, and* Second - that typically there are a ton of infa mappings that companies have created over a period of time that becomes a pain to catalog and go through one by one - so bulk migration almost seems like the only way out.Thankfully there is a system that is fully capable of taking on Informatica mapping style pipelines - it is called tabsdata and is an on-prem system that you can run on bare metal or on k8s clusters on the cloud. Bottom line you own it and and run it. This system offers the pub/sub for tables model for ETL. Here is how you use it to migrate infa pipelines:* Step 1: for every input port in the infa pipeline, you create a publisher that reads the input table and creates a tabs data table.* Step 2: for every transform in the infa mapping, you can create a transformer in tabsdata that will take one or more tables within tabsdata and do your join/aggregate/filter etc.* Step 3: once you have created the curated dataset, you add subscribers to it so that they can be loaded into the target platform.While this sounds like more work than one-to-one migration of infa mappings, you will be surprised at the ease and reusability that this approach produces and that itself could cut the pipeline complexity and count significantly.

nh40vd9,"From your description this is either a frontend API which is designed for frontend usage (so not for automations) or just an API which is not designed to be queried for bulk data. If you discovered those endpoints through browser web tools for example, then it's the former, which besides probably breaking the webpage TOS, it is subject to break as those things may change without notice (the same with web crawling). If it's an official API, then it just wasn't designed with bulk data loading in mind.In any case, if you decide to go forward with this you will have to do as you describe: query stuff, cache whatever you can (like product categories which change less often) and create the relationships yourself. So take your time to model *everything*, create proper relationships between entities, build a proper request throttling mechanism for each entity (maybe by using queues) along with a retry mechanism (just check for http error 429 and do exponential backoff for example), write some tests and go with that.A dumb example where let's say the entities are ""product\_summarized"", ""product"", ""region"", ""category"":1. Take note of the rate limits of each entity to configure the request throttling for your script.2. Query the categories & regions once a day to cache their values. 3. Fetch a list of product\_summarized using all the combinations of region and category.4. Fetch one product for each product\_summarized using it's id property.5. Stich up everything together in a main function and run it.Steps 3 & 4 are to be executed under a request throttling mechanism so you don't get rate limited. And if you do, the retry mechanism will resume the operation.Will it be slow? Yeah it will. That's why you need a proper API in the first place.I've been through this a few times and I feel you.

ngtmb3k,"Dataflow doesn’t auto-magically handle schema drift, you have to design for it. Additive changes are easiest: BigQuery accepts new columns if you enable schema updates, and in Beam you can represent rows as maps or generic `Row` objects instead of hard typed classes. If a column disappears, guard against nulls and missing fields in your transforms. Renames or type changes are trickier, treat them as add + drop and keep a mapping or schema registry to track versions.For API ingestion a simple GCP pattern is: Cloud Scheduler or Cloud Functions to fetch data, push raw payloads into Pub/Sub, run Dataflow for parsing and transforms, and land in BigQuery or GCS. That decouples ingestion from processing and gives you autoscaling and retries.Dataproc is worth using only if you already have Spark/Hadoop jobs or need complex iterative workloads. For most ingestion + transform pipelines, Dataflow is simpler.Schema drift across sources follows the same patterns. For APIs, expect variable JSON and parse dynamically. For files, prefer schema-aware formats like Avro or Parquet, or read CSV headers dynamically. For RDBMS, use CDC tools like Datastream and evolve schemas downstream when columns change.How often do you expect schema changes, and do you need real-time ingestion or is batch good enough? That helps decide how strict to be on schema validation.

Always land raw payloads in GCS (Avro/Parquet) for replay. If drift is frequent and you need low latency: use CDC (Datastream or Debezium) to Pub/Sub, a streaming Dataflow job with a mapping table/versioned schema, dead-letter unknowns, and alerts. For APIs: Cloud Run/Workflows pulls -> Pub/Sub -> Dataflow -> BigQuery with idempotent MERGE and throttling. Dataproc only if you already have Spark jobs or need libraries Beam can’t handle well.

The data catalog abstraction is nice since it supports a bunch of backends, and tools like Kedro-Viz make it easier to reason about your DAGs.The tradeoff is you don’t get connectors or managed ingestion out of the box. You’ll be writing Python to pull from sources, handle schema drift, and deal with APIs or CDC. It’s more of a framework than a platform.

But from a management point of view, there is an idea that the person who writes the code is actually responsible for the quality of the results.

It is a daunting task, as in the act of taking the first step is monumental for a lot of folks (and why creating something you deem a 'stupid website hosted on aws with shitty architecture' is FAR more impressive than doing a calculator app (literally anyone can do it and there is not real value/insight to glean from it). It is like trying to do calculus when you can barely add two numbers. If someone wants to make a game without the foundation then they will most likely flounder about cause they are trying to start on step 10 where instead they need to start at step 1 (what language do you know, downloading an IDE etc...)But with the prevalence of AI, the barrier has been reduced down considerably. I condone the idea of 'vibe' coding ie copy/pasting what you see and not digesting (reading what the AI spit out doesnt count). But I do recommend asking thoughtful questions that are small queries to AI (how to do print statement, why is ('hello' + d) not working etc...). And when you get the response back, think about why it is telling you the error is happening. So if ('I said hello' + 10 + 'times') threw an error then the AI might respond you cant add a str to an int. Now think about why that is ie you are adding two incompatible data types (string, int) which should lead you to asking what kind of data types are there and why data formatting is important etc...Work on the proof of concepts, small building blocks first. Even if it is stupid like learning how to add two numbers literally on some scratchpad of your coding IDE that will help you on your journey.

E.g.: I am implementing some logic where the variable “car_speed” should ONLY change when the operation “accelerate()” is executed. If I had them exposed then an ill advised user (coworker extending my code) might change car_speed directly and break my logic. OOP lets me abstract and encapsulate the logic and values. You have a class. It’s very explicit the values that it is concerned with and it exposes only the things others should be concerned. Then you have inheritance and polymorphism, those have to do with how blocks of logic usually repeat. Ideally you don’t want to copy and paste the same code many times, so it’s nice to have a framework on how the same logic can be repeated slightly differently many times",Raioc2436,2025-09-29 17:00:53,4,learnprogramming,t3_1ntmtad,False,

If you can get one, do, if it's not possible, you can still make it, but it will be harder. Everything after is just my opinion, I am self taught, but joined in a much nicer job market, but what worked for me and what all my interviewers talked about was:A) My Github was clean, I followed the basic rules, you don't need green square every day but 3-6 days a week shows you're learning your ass off. Every repo has only one project. Every repo has a README.md that explains what it is, why you built it, how you built it, is it done, where can they see it, and anything else you want. The only repo that breaks these rules is one called ""Practice"" where all your code goes when doing small tutorials, practicing stuff, or just playing around. This folder has a readme that says ""Please Ignore this Repo"" or something so interviewers who check know not to bother. You should also be using proper git branching techniques, create feature branches with good names and good commit messages. Show whoever looks that you know how to work on a team and already know the basics, if you don't know them, learn them. B) My portfolio was nice. I didn't make the standard layer cake design, I also made sure to make it really easy to use, I used very clearly labeled sliding drawers to put all the data they could want on one splash page. I got lots of compliments about it. C) My project was a Recipe app that also included a shopping list and meal planner. Most of the functionality was there, that which wasn't was clearly shown in the readme, the design was terrible as I'm not a designer, but almost every interview talked about it in depth about why I built it, what tech I used, and why. Unfortunately now you also need to get past the AI gatekeepers, this is mostly a ""Stuffing your resume with keywords"" game. If it's in the job ad and you can honestly say you've used it, it should be in your resume and cover letter (if used) somewhere. Don't lie about what you can do, but if your roles have all been Angular, but the ad wants React and you work with React at home sometimes, maybe one of your roles was React...The last thing I'll say that helped me a lot is ""Make a story"". Why are you doing this now instead of earlier. Look at your work history and, true or not, make a story about why you've finally realized Coding is your dream passion, because that's what you need interviewers to believe. You were amazing and doing great but ""lost"", then one day something happened that helped put you on this path to your true dream of becoming a coder. Make a story and build everything around it, your portfolio, your projects, whatever you can, the more the better. Practice answers to the obvious interview questions that explore and explain the story. Humans LOVE stories, especially coherent ones with growth where someone is finally achieving their dream. You need someone to take a chance on you, so you have to appear not to just be the best choice, but to be such an amazing choice that the lack of degree doesn't matter as your code is clean, your github is impeccable, your project shows the knowledge needed, and coding is your dream that you're finally realizing.Sorry for length, you **can** do it, but it will be hard.

You could have a sequence of products: std::vector inventory;And then to find your product, you have to search each element until you find it: for(int i = 0; i < inventory.size(); ++i) { if(inventory[i].ID == query.id) { use(inventory[i]); break; } }This search is O\(N\), you have to search up to as many elements as you have to find it. The more elements you have, the longer you search.What if instead we had a tree? struct node { product p; node *left, *right; }; node *root;Imagine if we built this tree of products, where the `root` contained the middle ID product, and `left` contained all values LESS THAN the ID, and the `right` contained all values GREATER THAN the ID. And repeat this rule for every branch of the tree...Well then, for any given ID, starting from the `root`, you've either A) found the product, B) went down the `left` branch, or C) went down the `right` branch. Now as we established, we start with the middle ID, and we divide the inventory in HALF by both sides of the tree.What this means is you immediately determine which half the ID must be contained in, and you have thus cut your search space IN HALF. We don't have to check N elements, we instead check only O\(log N\) elements. The more elements you have, the more efficient the search. Each iteration cuts the remaining search field by half, every time.Of course, you get this in: std::map inventory; //... use(inventory[id]);You can go faster still with a hash table.---Most of the job is searching, sorting, and transforming data. How you store the data and the algorithms you write to access that storage are intertwined. In C++, we get a few standard data structures, a few standard algorithms that are common, typical. Using a vector, or a map, or a hash table... It's easy to forget that these are both data structures AND algorithms hidden behind some convenient syntax; but a `map` implements a binary tree, and binary search!

All non-trivial programs that we are making nowadays are essentially algorithms to solve problems for which we (almost never) have a truly complete specification. The ""Algorithms"" in algorithms books are simply smaller problems which have been studied thoroughly, for which complete specifications exist.For example, we know 100% what we mean to say whether a sequence is sorted or not, so it's easy to specify that a sorting algorithm takes a sequence for which that property may or may not be true and produces a sequence for which that property is true. Though even in that problem there are sometimes overlooked edge cases. For example, occasionally the difference between stable sort and unstable sort crops up naturally.

Preferably `subprocess.run` with `check=True` so that any errors that occur will get raised into exceptions.

ngnbuqa,"A good example to understand this is to compare an `int` and a `float`. On a typical system, these are both 32-bit types. So the declarations `int x;` and `float y;` will both allocate 4 bytes of memory.But the *interpretation* of those bits/bytes is different depending on the type. So the compiler generates different code to work with them.For instance, the 32- bit pattern `00111110000000000000000000000000` represents the numeric value 0.125 when interpreted as a float, or the integer value 1040187392 when interpreted as an int. And if you want to do something like add the bit patterns representing two numbers, the logic for doing that will be totally different depending on whether they're ints or floats.So if you write the statement `x += 1;`, the compiler generates code to load the value of `x`, perform an *integer* addition, and store the value back into `x`. But if you do `y += 1;`, a *floating-point* addition is performed instead. (And the compiler is smart enough to automatically convert the integer constant `1` into the floating-point constant `1.0` so that the types are compatible.)So in general, the purpose of data types is to help the programmer (and the compiler) keep track of how any given chunk of memory is ""supposed"" to be interpreted.",teraflop,2025-09-28 13:42:37,33,learnprogramming,t3_1nso4uk,False,

Your view is very ""C influenced"", and C has a quite impoverished type system -- so you miss an important part of the picture.The type certainly determines how the compiler translates your code into machine code: how much stack space it allocates for the values, which registers it uses for them, which instructions it has to use, ... all these things.And at the level of assembly languages the types are \*usually\* (certainly with C in its current form) indeed for the most part erased (there are typed assembly languages and there still are some differences between certain data on common architectures, but generally speaking ""it's all just bytes"").That said: the principal purpose of types is to ensure the \*correctness\* of your code. Type systems are essentially logical calculi (in fact typed programs are in a very real sense equivalent to logical proofs), and in writing your code (with types) you build up a logical formula that the compiler then can reason about to some extent (which is ultimately what results in it reserving enough space for your data, using the right instructions etc). There's drastic differences in the ""power"" of those logical systems: with C you're very much on the weak side of things, which means types really are rather ""stupid"". Other languages go far further here, allowing you to encode way more intricate properties via types -- which then for example results in dealing with types that don't have \*any\* possible values, or that have values that have no size in memory at all \[and contrary to what you might initally expect these types turn out to be \*very\* useful in practice\]. (An issue with what you wrote is that `int` is not generally guaranteed to be 4 bytes, but that's more of an issue with C and many introductory resources. If you want to be able to say more about the sizes of your data in memory you'll have to use more specific types like `int32_t`)",SV-97,2025-09-28 15:10:43,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nso4uk,False,

They're binary values to the hardware, but they're whatever you interpret them to be (numbers, characters, something denoting true/false etc.) in your program.At the compiler level they're the primitive building blocks that language creators wanted to provide to users of their programming language, and they have the interface and semantics they define and build into them (e.g. String in Java appears quite different than char \* in C, despite there being an array of character values somewhere in Java's String implementation).At the language user's level, whatever the language says you have. If it says that int will give you a 4 byte number (for example) then it will.So data types are basically a compiler/interpreter level construct that allows you to represent, store, retrieve, and often mutate, data in your programs. Beyond that it's up to the compiler implementer to define what you write, what you can do with each, what you can't. Often it's not specified how a type is stored underneath, because a programmer may not need to know in certain environments (e.g. browsers).",HashDefTrueFalse,2025-09-28 16:36:24,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nso4uk,False,

nfzr24t,"Massively simplified analogy: You need to find the email of Professor Dan to beg him to let you into his full class next semester. There are a number of ways you can go about getting that:1. Ask your current CS teacher what Dan's email is. He says ""I don't know, Professor Smith might know though."" So you go ask Professor Smith what his email is and she says ""I don't know, but Professor Stevens might know."" You go ask Professor Stevens and she says ""I don't know, try Professor Jones."" You keep going down the chain, each person telling you to go talk to someone else, until you reach someone who knows what the email is, and who knows how many people you're going to have to talk to and you just don't want to do that.2. So you realize that oh wait, you can just look him up in the staff directory and find the email that belongs to him. You know he's a CS professor so you can just start with the CS directory instead of scanning down from Dr. Aarons in Academic Advising, and you already know the guy's name is Professor Dan so you can just jump to D.That's basically the difference between finding something in a linked list vs. hash table In reality it's a bit more complicated:3. Suppose you go to the staff directory and it's not in alphabetical or department order -- it seems totally random. Also, it's split into 20,000 pages. So you have no idea where Dan is and you're thinking you've got to just work your way down, and you really don't want to do that. But then you see that the directory is maintained by the department weirdo Dr. Bryant. You go ask Dr. Bryant, who tells you almost immediately ""Dan? He's on page 56."" You ask, astonished: ""You just memorized that???"" Dr. Bryant: ""Nah, I just multiplied the letters of DAN, so 4 \* 1 \* 14 is 56.""4. You go to page 56, and sure enough there's Dan's bio and email. Problem solved! But then the next day you have a realization and go back to Dr. Bryant: ""Wait a minute, what if you hire another guy named Dan? Only one of them can be on page 56, your system won't work anymore."" Bryant goes ""Uh..... wait, I know, his employee ID is 4LBA8F, and his ID is unique so I can just use that instead!""5. Satisfied, you leave his office, then 2 minutes later turn around and go back in. ""But that's not gonna work either, what if you have employee 222 and 22B? Or 2BB? What about 6666, 666F, 66FF?"" Dr. Bryant says he needs to think about that.This is also massively simplified and obviously the actual calculations are more complicated, but that's the general idea: since your data is probably not going to be perfectly ordered, you need to come up with a function to map each item to a numerical value, and that value will be the index to the ""bucket"" of memory that data will go into. You don't want that function to come up with different values because that makes things complicated, but unless you have an infinite amount of space, it's impossible to prevent that completely. All you can do is try to limit how often it happens; there's mathematical theory for the best ways to limit that and various implementations for how to handle whatever collisions do happen.""OK, why not make it ordered then?"" You could do that, but then you'll have to continually fix the order every time you insert new data, instead of just crunching a number for where to insert it.

So a hash table is faster than a linked list only when there are enough entries that looking outside the cache will be slower. On a cpu, that’s about 100 to 1000 items. Tye point is that a linked list gets slower the more items you have. So, for that matter, does a binary tree. A hash table takes the same amount of time no matter how many items you have. So if you need to process or look up a few million items, hash tables are hard to beat. Plus, who cares about performance when you’ve only got a few hundred item?

Very sophisticated CPU caches do have the ability to notice that you're chasing pointers (they correlate values previously loaded with the addresses fetched) but that's most helpful if you repeatedly access shallow data structures.There just isn't much that can be done to hide memory latency when the data structure is really deep.If a linked list is the best choice it's probably because you need a LIFO or FIFO queue and search is rare.Other points in favor of linked lists* concurrent LLs (multiple threads will access at the same time) are easier than concurrent hash tables and compete with concurrent ring buffers* The objects you intend to link are members of some other data structure and the LL acts as an alternate way to access them.

ngpi2lw,"At the root of pointers is understanding how a computer actually works. When a program is running, it has access to its segment of program memory, with each unit of memory (byte, word, dword whatever depending on architecture) having an address.The point of data structures is to store the program's data in memory in a cohesive structure that is fast for your usecase and lets you access it later. Data structures (and pointers) are the tools by which you manage memory for your program.You know that a pointer is an address to a piece of memory. Getting the value of the memory at that address is called *dereferencing* the pointer. Dereferencing uses the \* operator. \*ptr will give the value at pointer ptr.Your queue has an offset to the current last element (called back). This holds the offset of the address of the first free address of the queue. The function enqueue also takes in a queue pointer called q. To access the value of back, you would first have to dereference the queue pointer ""q"", then access its instance variable ""back"". Because dereferencing a pointer to an object to access one of its attributes is such a common occurrence, there is a special operator -> that does exactly that. If q was not a pointer to a queue object but rather the queue object itself, you would access back by doing q.back. but because q is a pointer, you do q->back.Pointers can also be *indexed into* meaning to take the address referenced by pointer p and adding the number in brackets to that address. For example if pointer p had the address 0x00001, then you could reference the value at address 0x00002 by doing p\[1\].To trace your code with all of this understanding is pretty simple. The function first checks if the queue is full (meaning a new element cannot be added) and simply returns in this case.If the queue is empty, set the first element in the queue to newData. The variable val is an instance pointer to the start of the queue. q->val\[0\] refers to the data value at the address at the start of the queue.back, as previously established is the offset from the base of the queue (val) to the next free address in the queue. To add a value to a non-empty queue, the code stores back in a temporary value, idx. The code then stores newData in that address (val\[idx\] is the same thing as saying val\[q->back\]), then increments back by one, ensuring that it continues to be the offset of a free address.",Yarrowleaf,2025-09-28 20:01:51,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nsqaug,False,

ngmgfph,"I will give you some actual code feedback, but the game is actually quite fun :) 1. I like the type\_out() function. 2. You should wrap your code in a main block. In Python this looks like this: `if __name__==""__main__"":` In this way your code will only execute if you actually run the file, not if you import it. 3. I like that you commented everything pretty well. Your comments are not very detailed, but they give me a good idea what a codeblock should do very quickly. 3.5. As a tip for comments: Use docstrings [https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) In many IDEs docstrings show up when you hover over a function, do quickly tell you what it does. 4. In line 150, I would suggest using an object, or a dictionary to store the data, since it's closely related to each other. There will never be a case, where you want to keep the vitals of the old patient, but generate a new name for example. This could be done like this: class Patient(): """""" represents Patient data"""""" def __init__(self, name, id, status, vitals, dialogue, is_expected): self.name = name self.id = id [...] [...] type_out(f""Patient Name: {patient.name}"") You already seem to use a smaller version of this as a dictionary in `generate_expected_patient_list()`, so I think unifying both datastructure would be a good idea, especially if you want to develop this game further. 4.5: You also seem to use the exact same line of code `type_out(f""Name: {p['name']}, ID: {p['id']}"")`quite a few times. This could be rolled into the class I suggested above, giving Patient a method to type\_out their name and id. You would then use it in code as `patient.type_out()` for example. All in all your code is structured okay, but for better readability you could thinnk about moving the actions and the new\_day part of your loop into their own functions. This might not look like a benefit in your codebase right now, but if your game logic gets bigger, like a few thousand lines of code bigger, your game loop really should look roughly like this: while True: new_patient = get_new_patient() action = get_player_action() handle_action(action) check_game_over(strikes) check_new_day(expected_patients)Anyways, good job for a beginner :) Keep it up!",Beregolas,2025-09-28 09:35:28,2,learnprogramming,t3_1nsdfoh,False,

Many high-performance ECS systems represent entities as an Integer and map that to the set of components.I’m not sure if this is incidental or an intentional feature, but ECS can have components added and removed on the fly at runtime, and there’s not a huge amount of scenarios where that’s a requirement(plugin systems), and there are at least some where it’s an anti-pattern.

Keep components as plain data and systems as stateless functions. Batch adds/removes, avoid per-entity allocation, and use versioned IDs to prevent stale references. Start small: convert projectiles or NPC vision to an ECS-style loop and measure. For engines: archetype ECS (DOTS, Bevy, Flecs) is great for dense queries; sparse-set (EnTT) tolerates high churn.

They're just doing different things.For example: take a look at what a [""full adder""](https://www.electrical4u.com/binary-adder-half-and-full-adder/) logic gate circuit looks like. You need quite a few gates just to add two 1-bit numbers. To add 32-bit numbers, you would need an array of 32 full adders.If you were to simulate this 32-bit adder in software, you would need to iterate over each of those logic gates, fetch its inputs, compute its output, and then pass that output to the next gate(s). Your simulation would need hundreds or thousands of CPU instructions to accurately simulate the behavior of the logic circuit.But if all you care about is the *result* of the addition, you could get that with a single `ADD` instruction that's executed directly by your CPU, which would be hundreds or thousands of times faster.In other words, if you're designing a CPU out of logic gates, and you want to make sure that your hardware design will actually behave the way you expect, then you need to use a slow, expensive simulation at the logic gate level. If you just want to model the *desired* behavior of your CPU, you can just write code that emulates what each CPU instruction is *supposed* to do, and that emulation can be much faster.

ng8m6x8,"Hey! I appreciate your genius thanks! A few followups if that’s alright; First note: some of my questions may seem irritatingly dumb and I apologize for that as I’ve just begun my journey into learning programming and computer architecture:>It's not really a ""flaw"" in Logisim, it's just that doing a low-level simulation of logic gates is inherently more expensive than a high-level emulation of the same architecture. They're just doing different things.Q1) When speaking of “higher level emulation” vs “low level”, what do these terms imply?>For example: take a look at what a ""full adder"" logic gate circuit looks like. You need quite a few gates just to add two 1-bit numbers. To add 32-bit numbers, you would need an array of 32 full adders.>If you were to simulate this 32-bit adder in software, you would need to iterate over each of those logic gates, Q2)What do you mean by “iterate over each of these logic gates” (I know what iterate means but not exactly sure what it mean to iterate over a single logic gate)?>fetch its inputs, compute its output, and then pass that output to the next gate(s). Your simulation would need hundreds or thousands of CPU instructions to accurately simulate the behavior of the logic circuit.>But if all you care about is the result of the addition, you could get that with a single ADD instruction that's executed directly by your CPU, which would be hundreds or thousands of times faster.Q3)So the emulator he uses is emulating the logism circuit right? So doesn’t that mean the emulator at some level and up moving thru the same amount of logic gates?>In other words, if you're designing a CPU out of logic gates, and you want to make sure that your hardware design will actually behave the way you expect, then you need to use a slow, expensive simulation at the logic gate level.

But the emulator won't tell you whether or not your logic-gate-level design actually works properly.Q4) Ah ok sort of understanding like 1/3rd of the way now…so both are emulators - one is on logism, one is a “higher level”, but why does this emulator get to skip over all of the logic gates that logism musnt? Q5) And why does the guy’s actual processor itself get to skip over all of those logic gates that logism can’t?Q6) a final conceptual question if it’s OK; when does an emulator no longer get to be considered an emulator if it’s not actually proving your system “works” since it’s skipping tons of steps that actually need to be tested to be able to say your original circuit works? Are some emulators so far removed that we shouldn’t call them emulators? Like this one? Apparently the guy used the emulator to make it 1000x faster!!!

ng8rk9d,"I'm glad it was helpful. Just to clarify, I'm not some kind of genius, this is all pretty standard stuff that would be covered in digital logic and computer architecture courses in a typical CS curriculum.To thoroughly answer your questions I would basically have to teach one of those courses, and I'm not going to try to do that. Instead I'll just try to clarify my previous comment a bit.You have to distinguish between the *simulated* CPU (the custom 16-bit design that the Youtuber you linked came up with) and the *real* CPU that is being used to run the simulation.A real CPU is made out of many millions of physical logic gates. All of those logic gates operate simultaneously. But they work together so that the real CPU executes one ""instruction"" at a time. (This is a massive oversimplification, but it's good enough for this discussion.)Let's say that the simulated CPU needs a few hundred logic gates to make a 32-bit adder. If you write a gate-level software simulation on the real CPU, the simulation will have to process each of those logic gates one at a time. So like I said, it will take many hundreds or thousands of real CPU instructions to *simulate* a single addition operation on the simulated CPU. That's what I meant by ""iterate"". The simulator has to go through each logic gate one at a time to compute its result.If instead, you write an emulator that runs on the real CPU, then when it needs to add two numbers, it can execute a single `ADD` instruction. Now, *physically*, that `ADD` instruction is still implemented within the CPU by many logic gates. But because those gates are real physical things, all operating simultaneously, they don't have to be simulated one at a time. They all happen in parallel. So the execution is much faster. (But the physical arrangement of the CPU's logic gates is fixed in hardware. You can't customize it the way you could customize a gate-level simulation that's performed in software.)I'm just using addition as an example, but the same principle applies to other things too. The 16-bit CPU has lots of other control circuitry that decides *what* instruction to execute at any given time. That control circuitry is made up of many logic gates. But the work that is done by a large number of logic gates can alternatively be implemented by a smaller number of CPU instructions on the real physical CPU, doing the same work directly, without simulating the behavior of all the individual gates.> And why does the guy’s actual processor itself get to skip over all of those logic gates that logism can’t?They're not ""skipped over"". But when you take the logic design that was being simulated in Logisim, and build it out of real physical logic gates, then those gates are all operating in parallel. So you don't have to wait for a software simulation to process them one at a time.----If you want to learn more about this topic, I would suggest going through the free self-guided [Nand2Tetris course.](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)",teraflop,2025-09-26 03:01:54,2,learnprogramming,t1_ng8m6x8,False,

The advice I would give to a beginner would be something more like this:1) Have a specific goal of what you want to accomplish by learning programming2) Make sure that what you're doing is moving you towards that goalSo many people skip (1) when they're asking for advice on what to do, but it's super important. Why *specifically* do you want to learn programing? Is it to make video games? Or is it to automate business processes at your accounting firm? Or is it to hack your smart-fridge? Those are all vastly different skill sets, with different paths you'll need to take in your learning. Knowing what you want to do is so so important to making sure you're learning the right things.Once you've figured out (1) step (2) is a lot easier (still hard though!). Usually, step (2) starts with following one comprehensive course on the relevant programming language / framework / environment. Make sure it's a high quality, modern course on the topic. As you go, make sure you're doing exercises, and writing code independently to test that you're following along. **Once you've finished this course, you should have the ""vernacular""** that you're talking about in your post. At that point, you can start building (small) projects.Oftentimes where people get stuck on (2) is that they jump around between too many different tutorials, they don't learn things on their own, or they don't focus on the learning that will actively help them achieve their goals. But doing a single, high quality course is definitely not ""tutorial hell"".People who suggest doing projects are right that the true, deep learning comes after you've taken the training wheels of a course or tutorial off. There's a lot of important and valuable struggle that comes from putting the pieces together yourself.

Modern HTML-based webapps give just as much ""freedom"" to developers to make actual content as Flash did -- the existence of [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) is proof of this. But that freedom is kept safely within a high-quality sandbox.The difference is in the implementation, not the overall architecture.

The Fitness studio app with the heart rate monitors, looping video, time syncing and audio coordinated with the server was more fun to code than the Enterprise sports venue scheduling app.That scheduling app was mostly a web app and the flash component of it was just the iPad in the lobby so that people could register. But it did take payments. They had different things like lessons and booking courts. The lessons had some kind of special thing for the instructor's schedule. There were calendar interfaces. There were admin features. There was emailing invoices and reminders. And of course credit card transactions. I used the technique of taking the entire Stripe response json and putting it in a database field because you don't need to perform query searches on that kind of info. If you need it, you'll be in that record and can parse that json to make the little invoice again.

nguphv4,"Well from professional point of view my first question would be why are you not building, tagging and publishing your docker image as part of your pipeline and instead of building it on your (production) server. It's kind of hard to track what is actually running in production with your current setup. You don't have any kind of versioning, immutable artifacts. You can't really roll back since you can't really be sure the build is reproducible. Your server is doing multiple things, not running stable artifacts. So obviously your setup isn't really something that would be used in production/professional settings. But if it's enough for you that let's say once a day your server might be updated with new code assuming there is something new in the repo, the cronjob doesn't fail etc. then cronjob keeps it simple, so why not if some or none of the concerns with the setup really matter to you. I'd probably at least consider doing it properly, for experience and learning purposes if nothing else.

ngz7nk2,"Senior engineer here. I wrote lots of our deployment pipeline. Some thoughts:>a cron job that checks out the repo, say, once a day, and if there's anything new, pull and build.Not a good idea, to be honest. Deployment should be a purposeful, manual action. Automation here should be about making deployments a push-button exercise, not actually automatic. You want merges to a (often protected) master/main branch (or whatever) to kick off builds (of containers), tests, etc, but stop right before touching your actual deployment. If everything is good, you push the button. The cron job idea is a recipe for disaster in real environments.>I just want to `git pull` and `docker compose up --build` when I cut a new release.There's nothing wrong with just doing this manually via ssh. You can script it via ssh too so that it's a one-liner. Or have a GH Actions flow do it when you manually run a flow. Usually you'd have automations (pipelines) build your images and put them in a registry, then deployment automation can pull them from there to get containers.",HashDefTrueFalse,2025-09-30 09:19:49,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ntl1j5,False,

That said, if this is a production project, it will eventually be a good idea to run tests before deploying and proper workflows will scale to that more easily than an ad-hoc script.I would not recommend the cron approach, because it bundles multiple changes together into a single unmonitored deploy. Usually people will either do continuous deployment, where every merged commit is automatically verified and then deployed immediately, or they will do manual deployments where post-release validation can be performed. Opinions differ, but I’m in the camp that says continuous deployment is better if you have the level of automated testing and monitoring needed to make it safe. Deploying one change at a time makes it easier to determine what caused breakage when it occurs.With a cron job deployment you’d get the worst of both worlds. A bunch of changes would bet bundled together, making error tracing harder. You probably won’t be verifying the deployment after it occurs, because it’s on a schedule. And it won’t be immediately clear what changes are deployed or not at any given point in time, which can be very frustrating in practice.",josephjnk,2025-09-29 17:41:50,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ntl1j5,False,

I might have been misreading a lot of articles assuming that artifacts were things like logs or intermediate files, things produced by production instead of the production code itself.But if I should be deploying the images themselves, then Github having its own VM to do that building makes more sense.

This is the big skill your assignments are trying to help you develop.Don't feel bad if it's tricky now. It's supposed to be. You're learning a skill.",captainAwesomePants,2025-09-25 01:01:55,1,learnprogramming,t3_1npnpeb,False,
ng2ra7s,"This question is so extremely common nowadays that a simple search through the subreddit would have given you more than plenty answers.When you get an assignment, don't directly start programming. **Plan** before program. Sit down with pencil and paper and work over the assignment. Analyze it, break it down into steps. Solve each of the steps **your** way, don't even think about programming at that stage. Track the steps. Once you have a working solution, test it. Then, when the solution is confirmed, start *implementing* it in code. Ideally, when you've done the breakdown right, the code should come naturally. Use whatever you can think of: bulleted lists, flow charts, pseudo code, anything to write down what the program has to perform.Code is the end, not the beginning. Analysis, breaking down, planning, solving are the beginning. Code comes later.Just *reading* completed code will not help you building the ability to solve problems. Reading code is like looking at a complete car in order to learn to design a new car. You miss everything important: analysis, decisions, considerations, compromises. You might get an understanding of the *immediate* solution, but not the skills to apply this to even slightly different situations.Build your own projects starting from something as small and simple as Tic-Tac-Toe and working your way gradually up to larger and more complex. Yes, this will take time, effort, determination, discipline, and patience, but that's the way to go. Not the easy road to use google, AI or tutorials for everything.Programming is lifelong learning. It takes months to build up basic competence, years to obtain some proficiency and a lifetime for expertise.-----About your task:> i had to create a license plate checker which would output valid or invalid.Well, not much information you give here, but still:What do you need for your program?+ You need some form of getting the license plate - user input+ you need a place to store the license plate - variable+ There are some rules that you need to follow (which you haven't told - so, I'm blind guessing) + most likely, you will need to extract each character from the license plate - you will need a way to split the entered data and a store for it - maybe an array - could just as well be that you only need to loop over each character + you need to perform some action with the character - maybe some summing, multiplication, etc. + At the end, you will get some checksum or some indication+ you will need to verify that indication (conditional)+ you need to output valid or invalidThat's the way to break down a problem.

nfwk09s,"Some companies have a formal process to graduate engineers to senior and beyond as individual technical contributors. But I feel like many go based mostly on feel and perception. If you feel you are stuck and will have a hard time being thought of as senior by your peers because you can't keep up in architecture and design discussions that might hold you back and force you to job hunt.I agree you should talk to your manager and try to feel out how likely it is you can meet their expectations to stay on assuming you enjoy the work aside from the new hoops they want you to jump through.I saw some others suggested asking more questions to keep improving your skills. Many people are afraid to ask dumb questions too often as it can make you seem too dependent on the other engineers. But these days honestly you can try talking to an AI about technical details. Most software design and architecture is very well understood and the AI can easily walk you through design questions and help you understand any parts that don't make sense so the next time you have a discussion you are more clear about what is happening.Just a month back there was a discussion at work explaining a mesh network setup for one of our products. And my networking is super rusty. An hour conversation with the AI and I was following their mesh design much more clearly and asking their team good questions, not the dumb ones where I was unaware of basics or some lingo. Most designs in software aren't super novel or deviant from knowledge the AI has.The AIs can still lie so I do recommend double checking it's statements if you are going to put your reputation on the line defending a claim it made. But I feel like there has never been a better tool to help drill down on some ""dumb"" questions we all have.I will say I am generally perceived as very good at my job and I love software and design discussions. I am totally not immune to feeling stupid or inadequate. Especially on newer projects. Imposter syndrome creeps up on most people unless you have a godly ego. So it's hard to say how you feel really equals no hope of reaching senior in your current role. Also I don't do side projects. Clearly they are great if you can. But software is just a job and I love my kids more than I love my work. Most people I work with take this stance. I put in extra time to make sure stuff works during crunch time. And I do occasionally enjoy software arch videos on YouTube. But otherwise I enjoy my family and my personal free time.

ngklh6p,"Hi, I work with a bunch of H1bs at a reputable software engineering company. Keep in mind that my answers are going to be based on visas from a company that does follow the spirit and letter of the law. There is not a direct pay gap between H1bs and regular employees who are hired at the same level of experience. However, H1bs have much less _leverage_ to negotiate their position particularly as the years go by. This doesn't necessarily lead to them getting underpaid relative to other employees, but it means that they're more likely to accept worse conditions or volunteer (or be voluntold) for work that they might not have to. This is especially bad for people who have to wait a long time to get a green card.Additionally, if you've worked in tech for a while, you'll know that usually the best way to increase your salary is to job hop, and staying at the same company is not typically rewarded- I will get a 7% payrise this year, but I know that if I could switch to another company I'd likely get a 20-30% payrise. It's harder to switch companies as a H1b, so their wages will grow slower than peers in their industry.Companies are required to go through certain steps in order to sponsor a H1b to prevent harming the local economy that a worker is being hired into, the LCA. The LCA effectively requires paying the potential employee the higher of the prevailing wage for the area for the job of that employee, or what that employer would pay other employees with similar experience. Some H1bs do get paid less (but not where I work) because they are a H1b. There are some companies out there that essentially offer you relocation to the US as a job perk and may not pay you well - WITCH companies, mostly. These companies don't have much interest in fair working conditions and will offer relocation to the US to people who I would consider vulnerable, mostly Indians, and will preferentially hire Indians, especially from similar castes as the hiring manager.And, obviously, when you have more people competing for the same position that nominally drives down wages. However, the companies that abuse this system - WITCH companies, again - never intended to hire an American to do the job. An American job is not being displaced by a WITCH company hiring an Indian (although it _is_ still abuse of the H1b system).Simplistic gut-feeling analyses on ""increasing supply"" affecting wages fall short because they don't take into account a whole bunch of things, not least that a more productive economy with more workers generally leads to more job opportunities in the economy as a whole. As an extremely simplified example, a software shop being set up in a city might prompt a starbucks branch being built nearby to capture the market of higher paid engineers, that might otherwise not exist, which means that the hiring of some engineers (of which some might be H1bs) leads to more tax revenue for the locality as well as more job opportunities, just not _the same_ job opportunities.

ngkn2wp,"I used to have an H1B myself. I was paid fairly, but since getting a Green Card took quite the wait, I couldn't just change jobs as I wished without some danger between the time I got PERM vs the time I became an ""applicant for adjustment of status"" (ie, my priority date was due). It was a long time ago, when there was a huge backlog for all countries, not just India and China. So after my green card arrived, i started being able to climb the ladder towards top companies 1-2 years at a time, getting significant raises every time. I was making double in 4 years.Also note that when you are applying for permanent residency, you get labor certification for a certain job description. Moving that job description upwards is kind of risky, as you would not be doing the task you got the certification for. So it might slow down your growth anyway.None of this would actually be relevant if the path from H1B to permanent residency was remotely reasonable.

ngkqor6,"It depends on the company, but the bigger issue is just a general supply issue.If there are 30k software engineering roles available each year and we have 40k software engineers looking for work. it drives everybody's salaries down.Another factor is that folks who are on an H1B face greater consequences if they lose their job. This isn't a big deal if you're actually an expert with in demand skills because there will likely be other openings. However, if you're just a general software engineer in the current job market, you're going to work more hours or take on extra responsibility to avoid having a 60 day count down to going home.The whole premise of the H1B program is to help with situations where we don't have enough qualified people to fill a certain role. When it's used in those situations, it doesn't hurt anybody because H1B holders have enough career mobility to avoid getting underpaid or overworked and US residents won't get pushed out because visa holders are filling a gap, not competing with US workers. If we grant 2000 H1B visas to MDs who want to work in the US, that's fine because we have a shortage of doctors and those visas will benefit the H1B workers without negatively impacting US workers. If we grant 40000 H1B visas to entry level tech workers, which already face high unemployment rates, that not only goes against the goals of the H1B program, it makes the job market worse for all workers involved. Some H1B holders will earn less, some H1B holders will be forced to work under unfair conditions to keep their visa status, supply will exceed demand causing wages to drop, and US workers will have to either accept the unfair conditions or get replaced by an H1B holder who will.Under paying H1B visa holders happens at some consulting companies, but even at companies that pay them the same wage as US workers, it's a problem when the system is abused.",EssenceOfLlama81,2025-09-28 01:12:13,17,cscareerquestions,t3_1nsahrt,False,

ng10ad7,"I live in LES ( a neighborhood in NYC). 120k sounds good very good entry level and fintech is a good space to be. Almost every major fintech has an office here and its the 2nd largest tech hub. It also is the largeast finance hub. Also NYC the sky is the limit so you can really use this as an oppurtunity to spring board.Its very likely you will be making double to tripple what you are currently making within 5 to 8 years.What life style is like in NYC at that salary? 120k in NYC is around a 6500 month net salary (due to city taxes).1. If you want to live somewhere fun for singles in their 20s, you would need to eitehr pick between living alone, living somewhere nice with roomates. You'd qualify a miximum of 3k a budget rent and at that price you can live alone. But you have to choose between living in a nice apartment in jersey/outer areas or in a pre-war shoe box in the nice trendy neighborhood. Nice in NYC is 'mid' in other cities. Its usually means you have a building with some amenities like laundry room or laundry in unit (rarer) and a dishwasher. NYC is a story of under consturction. Most apartments here are 100 years old (prewar) and lack modern conveniences like laundry, dishwasher and central AC. I picked the shoe box, its more fun to be in a good neighborhood if you like to go out and party.2. A lot of people your age would choose to live with roomates in order to be in a nicer apartment in a good location. Generally apartments are a lot mroe cost effective in a 4 bed 2 bath or 3 bed 1 bath situation. If a studio in an apartment building is renting for 4000$, there is a good chance the 3 bed is only 8000$ and the 4 bed is 10,000$. So a very common strategy for young professionals is to just have roomates to live in a nicer apartment in a fun location.3. You can afford to live alone and somewher nice, but it would generally be in outer neighborhoods that are either gentrifying or in places like jersey city, a part of New Jersey that is connected by Manhattan via a subway called path.The biggest cost in NYC is rent. Almost all of the cost of living is real estate. That effects things like entertainment and other stuff, because bars/coffee shops/ restaurants and gyms are paying even more per sq feet than you are. But outside of that the cost is the same its not like Amazon charges more here when they are deliving goods to you. Groceries can be all over the map, but trader joes generally is cost effective as they use national priceTo give oyu some idea what prices are like. Manhattan (you can take off 20 percent for other areas1. Hair cuts 40 to 75$2. Gym depends on which but 50 to 300$. 125 would be mid-tier3. Fast Casual lunch 15 to 20$4. Street food from a take out only operation 8 to 12$.5. Specialty Coffee from a cafe (6$ - 7$ before tax)6. Dinner at sit down casual restaurant with a waiter 40 to 80$ per person. You can easily spend 150$ per person at more upscale. This is assuming no alcohol.7. Alcohol 6 to 10$ for beer, 10-20$ for wine, 16 to 25$ cocktails. Non-alcoholic options will be offered at most bars. NYC has a BIG drinking culture. Tech community in particular has a lot of happy hour networking and social events that they host through apps like Luma, Posh VIP, Super Momos, Partiful. So even if you don't drink a whole lot, its in your interest to go to bars and get some non-alocholic drinks.8. Ubers 20$ per mile in Manhattan south of 96th street, 10$ per mile in Brooklyn/Queens/Bronx without manhattan entry.The other thing thats nice about NYC, because the city is so expensive you won't have pressure to be extravagent which happens in middle cost of living cities. This is a place where people who make 300k a year might live like college students and no one would bat an eye.TLDR: 120k is a great salary for someone your age in NYC in the fin-tech space. You will ahve enough money to go out quite a bit, save adequately for retirment and you can essentially pick where you want to live. It is a place where you will need to budget some and not be extravagent, but you can enjoy some luxuries. From a career perspective its also great, the only city that is better for Tech is SF and NYC is good at multiple industries. Fin-Tech space there is always the option of just transitioning into tech roles in finance and NYC is the capital of finance.

Obviously as a SWE, you deal with all those on a daily basis, but confidently answering 101 + 201 questions are very important in setting the tone for the interview. went through my resume bullet points and wrote down about 2 pages per bullet point going deeper in to depth, answering questions like ""how was this metric you put defined?"" ""go a little deeper in the hardest parts of this problem"" ""give a 30 second pitch on how it was implemented"" etc. Had 1 page written per sample behavior question - ""how do you handle technical disputes - any examples?"" ""how do you normally approach a new technology"". Stuff like that -- not to memorize, just to kind of find the rhythm of your own answer. Find something non-work related but technical and have it in your back pocket for when someone asks ""and how do you stay on top of technical trends?"" - i found in my interview process there is a big difference between ""I try to find ways to learn on the job"" and ""yeah I'm interested in learning about WASM, I have a couple of data-visualization projects I mess around with when I have time, etc"" and have actually put a few hours in to so you have made at least 1 technical decision you can talk about on it.

Either some requirement changes, or maybe there was a miscommunication - but whatever the case, that nice timeline and architecture you had in your head gets absolutely wrecked.

I did not really practice LC - I did a few problems for fun, but in no way would I consider would I did ""grinding"", nor did I make any attempt to memorize the solutions. The 3 LC interviews that I did get were all mediums where I was able to work out non-optimal but reasonable solutions, and I passed the interviews despite my non-optimal solutions.Probably worth mentioning that the non-LC coding interviews I received by and large still required a strong grasp of CS fundamentals like recursion and proper use of data structures. So if you're not solid with that kind of thing, then practicing LC may still help. I would also not say that the non-LC coding interviews are necessarily easier than LC - just that their difficulty is more about turning complex requirements into code than about figuring out ""this one neat trick"", which I do think is a more fair type of difficulty and more reflective of job skills. Also I did not interview with any FAANG companies, and I think they are more notorious for having LC interviews.The vast majority of my interview prep time was spent on practicing systems design and fleshing out my behavioral interview stories, and personally I thought that was a much better use of my time than grinding LC (as a senior candidate).",Oreamnos_americanus,2025-09-28 03:07:36,21,cscareerquestions,t3_1nsbrus,False,

Then it linked leetcode study guides that included practice questions to better udnerstand how to code it. Honestly was a great study guide, not sure why they took it out.

You might get a job that way, but i have found many interviewers can tell when you dont understand the problem and are just copying what similar leetcode problems did. Because they dont mind changing up the problem halfway through if they noticed you got there too quickly. They'll change one little thing in the problem and ask you to re-do it and the way you did it wont work. So there is a lot of having to understand DSA to get the job. Learn how to think outloud because that's what most of them expect. They dont care if you get it right, just how you think. Ive gotten jobs and havent gottent their questions right. Also, tackle problems piece by piece. I have found that once i write one line of code, i am less stressed and tackle the problem better. So usually the first thing i do is tackle the base cases.

ngvt803,"Decided to apply for jobs. Very different experience from u/[IAmBoredAsHell](https://www.reddit.com/user/IAmBoredAsHell/)Keep in mind I have an Ivy League undergrad degree (Columbia Univ) so that might have helped.Applied for jobs. Heard back from many places. LinkedIn claims I applied 28 places (many of which are the same companies like 6 on Roblox, etc). So 15 different companies for the 28 positions. + outside LinkedIn like DataDog, Coinbase.Out of the 15+2 companies, had recruiter calls from 13 companies. The 4 companies that did not reply were Roblox (sucks cause I got interview there before), Affirm (sucks cause I got interview there before), ~~MongoDB (my experience is completely irrelevant to work there)~~, Pinterest (sucks cause I got interview there before), DataDog (my experience is completely irrelevant to work there).In my inbox, have many dozens of recruiters requesting to do an interview. Many well paying desperate firms like Carta, Decagon, Vanta, Valon, TikTok, Meta, DE Shaw, Stubhub, Lyft, Anduril, DoorDash, Ramp, Amazon, etc. And crap ton of AI grift startups/firms which constantly clog up my inbox daily.I got rejected from OpenAI at phone screen this time but I blame the interviewer. System design question was infra side when I have zero understanding of infra. Sucks because I was able to get an offer almost 2 years ago there but thought non-profit + Scam Altman == shares are worth nothing + don't want to deal with insane work hours. Who knew valuations would explode and non-profits become for-profits so easily. I thought Elon Musk would have done something there.It's honestly very difficult from the start to even apply as senior because most jobs are not going to be on the field I work in.In the fields I work in, I get basically 100% response rate. Since I work in the financial side, so jobs like Uber for Financial team, trading firms (absolutely 0 thoughts), etc all respond quick. Pigeonhole life :/. Honestly not interested in the WLB and have no thoughts moving to NYC when I have made my life here right now (maybe in the future).I'm sure if I spray and prayed full stack, infra, databases, etc. roles then my response rate would be garbage as well. But then again, I'm sure if I applied mid level roles for those I would get calls left and right but then why would I?And no. I don't bother with referrals, connections, etc. Not my thing. Never needed to. I was able to get interviews at Netflix, Google, OpenAI, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Snap, Databricks, Citadel, etc in the past without any problems anyway. Ivy League degree helps.Definitely worse than covid era. During covid era, I essentially had 90% response rate at tech firms and near 100% response rate at non tech firms. But then again, I'm not applying for mid level roles so to be expected. Plus, I am a lazy individual who has no thoughts min-maxing my career so that plays a part as well. I've let my experience rot my skills for job market but I don't care. I value life outside work a lot.>Curious if there are any suggestions or comments on day to day learning and interview prep?Just take life chill. Don't overthink. Life is too short to stress these stuff too much.That said, be good at Leetcode. Try to aim for 95% pass rate on coding interviews.And spend time on studying System Design.

If someone was already hired but the recruiter forgot to take the flyer down, it can look like “there was never a real job.” On the flip side, if the recruiter is hiring but chooses not to hang a flyer, it doesn’t mean they aren’t hiring—it just means the posting isn’t public. What truly matters is whether the *requisition* is open and approved as a **headcount**. That’s what determines if someone can be hired.P.S.

West coast means more and better tech opportunities. It's possible you'd have better quality of life in Chicago, especially if you prefer city living (and eventually move out). I don't really consider Chicago to be much of a tech city. If it was, housing would be considerably more expensive. Most of the tech work in the area is tied to finance, consulting, pharma and other corporate flavors. While some tech companies have a presence, it's noticeably smaller. A 1.5 hour commute will be brutal. I worked at a company that did consulting work for Grainger, but I never worked on a project for them. I got the impression their tech was kind of weak. A lot of other companies in that area (far north suburbs, I believe) are dominated by Indian dev teams and management - both local and offshore. The horror stories you read on this sub where an Indian manager comes in and the entire tech team becomes Indian is a big problem with a lot of companies in that area. I can't speak to Grainger, specifically, so you should ask around and try to find more info.

I’m at a similar position in terms of experience, and early in my career I FELT the lack of advanced degree holding me back every day from the opportunities and jobs I wanted to pursue, especially trying to break into Data Science. After 8 years, I don’t feel like it matters nearly as much. There’s definitely still jobs that won’t even look at my resume without an advanced degree. But tbh, those jobs probably still wouldn’t look at me with a Masters, they pay super well and can afford to hire just PhD’s.I think if you want to get into management or entrepreneurship, something like an MBA at a good school where you can network with people who have similar goals or mindsets could be worth it. But if you still want to be on the technical path, Idk I just feel like the time and money you’d have to spend getting the Masters could be spent doing other stuff that might have a bigger impact on career trajectory. Like, for maybe 1/10th the time and money, could you make a point of going to 1 or 2 meetups or conferences related to the jobs you want, and just aggressively network, and get to know everyone in the field so when opportunities pop up, you’ll know people who can help you get those jobs/opportunities?EDIT: I forgot to mention, I think the AI wave/hype is largely dying out. I don’t see the Data Science jobs paying any more than software/data/architecture jobs. In fact a trend I’ve seen recently is, a lot of times the Data Engineering positions are paying more money than the DS positions.

Those were just examples. ""Project Scope"" is the important bit of that section, along with timeline, quotes, project organization, etc.Especially if the company you applied to builds things for customers, and bids on projects, rather than building/running their own product, it seems pretty reasonable that they would be legitimately doing FEED, and the SWE's would be heavily involved since it's a software project they're planning/selling.I have 12 YOE, and I don't recall ever hearing that acronym before... but there's lots of acronyms I haven't heard of. There is a ton of variety in the industry. After looking up what FEED is, I can safely say I've never been involved in such a rigid and thorough project planning stage. I've worked mostly in agile shops where we're fast and loose with timelines, planning, and costs. Joining a company where their planning stage can potentially last months, *or years*, would certainly be a new experience to me.

ngo0nyk,"It takes as long as it takes. Some folks land another job fairly quickly, others it'll take months.The biggest thing you're up against at the moment is the calendar. Lots of places slow down hiring as the year draws to a close. I was laid off in mid-October last year and told my wife if I didn't land something by Thanksgiving then it likely dry up until mid- to late January. Fortunately I landed something in November.It sucks losing your job, and if I recall from your previous post this is your first time going through this. I experienced being laid off at my first job after graduating, only being there about six months. Felt like an absolute failure, especially to my parents because I was still living at home. They were very understanding and mainly just felt bad for me, but we're happy to let me live with them as long as I was hunting for another job. Lots of folks will be more understanding than you realize, and for the ones who don't or seem to pull away I'd say you'll learn the ""value"" of those relationships.The best advice I can give you would be:1) Realize it's very likely not your fault and simply a business decision. This is not a reflection on you as a person or on your skills as much as you may think it is. You now know that most employers don't really value you or others as much as you may have thought.2) If there are local user groups for your field of study, attend those and network as much as possible. I've been able to keep my recent stints with layoffs fairly short due to the network I've built over the years. Talking with folks and getting their help in applying for open positions is gonna do more for you than online submissions where you're a name among hundreds or thousands of others. I landed my current position by going to a local user group and connecting with a staff engineer of the company hosting it, who was willing to submit my resume directly to HR for an open position.3) In the current market, you may need to be more open to both returning to an office to work and even taking short term contract gigs. Fully in office positions will likely have fewer applicants compared to hybrid, and both will have fewer applicants compared to fully remote. Taking contract work can also be an option, as most times those interview loops are one or two rounds and often not that involved. Part of this is because they can cut you loose at any moment and owe you nothing, because you likely won't have paid time off (you can take time off, just not paid). Benefits, if offered, can usually be stupid expensive depending on your needs, but contract work will almost always pay far better than unemployment, and keeps long gaps off your resume. It may lead to a permanent position, and if not then at least you avoid dipping into your savings for a while. You can absolutely keep interviewing for better gigs in the meantime.4) If needed, take part-time work somewhere or work in something adjacent to your field of study if possible. I floated by on support and sys admin type roles for about three years, from 2009 to 2012, because I was a new grad with minimal experience losing out on jobs to folks who had that experience. I managed to stay close to the industry and make decent money from it while waiting for my time to get back into SWE jobs in full.I get it man, losing a job sucks and is a big hit to your mental. Know that you're not the first to experience this, you won't be the last, and this may not be your last time experiencing it. There's gonna be aspects of paranoia about it happening again going forward and you just gotta learn how to deal with it. The best way to deal with it is to build both a solid amount of savings, along with a solid network of folks you can reach out to if it ever happens again.You'll get through this, and you'll be stronger for it.",ModernTenshi04,2025-09-28 15:50:00,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1nsp8yg,False,

Instead of being able to take interesting CS electives, you will be much more constrained and forced into taking engineering math and physics courses.",Jazzlike_Middle2757,2025-09-30 20:29:19,19,cscareerquestions,t3_1nuo73w,False,

nh2k11b,"Comp sci - I actually worked briefly for a Canadian company and the software engineering degree, iirc is a shorter degree? I left because they were paying me what they paid that degree.Comp sci will always be there. I’d argue that the field has advanced a bit beyond what you learn in undergrad (or at least the practical applications), and you’ll need to learn some things for yourself, especially how it’s practiced in engineering. But you won’t learn a single useless thing. Foundational knowledge for CS existed long before we could digitally do the computations, and those foundational aspects scale up pretty flawlessly.",bflo666,2025-09-30 20:30:55,4,cscareerquestions,t3_1nuo73w,False,

nh2kigk,"It'll only matter for the handful of companies that really care about your degree. Employers will more often than not prefer experience/skills over anything else, so if either of those programs have co-op I'd go with that. Otherwise, pick whatever interests you and try to get internships on your own while in school (sometimes companies hire with the requirement that you're enrolled in a relevant program).",astwisk,2025-09-30 20:33:13,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1nuo73w,False,

Your work experience is unrelated, so it doesn’t matter too much. I recommend posting an anonymized resume on resume subreddits for feedback. You can edit your post and include it here, maybe someone will take a look. You also don’t mention how many applications you’ve sent out. If you want any proper feedback, a resume and info on number of applications submitted definitely helps.
