If you're not a fortune 500, a not-terrible on prem warehouse is perfectly adequate, and a better investment in data might have actually been to document what you have and work towards a medallion architecture just within the dwh, which would have given you the opportunity to systematically unpick the sources and transformations, embedding business logic and documenting it as you go.

In your case it sounds like your org had a not-terrible thing going already, and fucked yourselves with a lazy lurch into the cloud that just lifted and shifted your existing problems.Maybe the question to ask is what it is that you like about DE.

noq1ox1,"Let me focus on data products. I have a data engineering background, and yes, these terms often get thrown into the buzzword bucket.But I actually like thinking in data products. A little story time: Our team once had a major pipeline outage (fun fact: it was when we upgraded our Hadoop infrastructure to a new major version, what a mess :man_facepalming:). Suddenly, everyone in the company understood our value, because they saw what broke when our tables and processes went down.Up until that point, I often struggled communicating our value to stakeholders. Then, during a sales call with a third-party company, they asked me, ""What are your data products?"", I heard it the first time and thought it was just management speak. But actually, it became quite a useful tool for me.While software engineers ship visible features, data engineers build invisible infrastructure. Our work powers decisions, reports, and systems behind the scenes. That makes it hard to demonstrate value.Technically speaking, I'd define a data product as a composition of assets that, taken together, deliver a result with business relevance(!). Assets can be anything involved in the process: input tables, queries, processes, models, intermediate results, etc. If we're talking Airflow specifically (because this is well known by most), that means tables, Dags, tasks, everything involved in delivering the outcome.From a data engineering perspective, data products are a communication framework to make our work visible. Simple concept, but powerful for explaining what we actually deliver.From a management perspective, a data product is a measurable business asset with clear ROI and accountability. It's something you can point to during budget discussions, assign ownership to, and track performance against defined SLAs.However, not every table, task, or Dag is a data product, but it might be part of one. It's a good exercise to identify them by looking at: Business impact (if this disappeared tomorrow, would executives notice? Would customers be impacted?), orchestration complexity (we had a super Dag triggering lots of other Dags, that was a clear sign for a data product), and high-value consumption (multiple teams depending on it, feeding executive dashboards, etc.).Look at all your data assets, try to group them together as data products, and also learn what value those data products generate (e.g. what are the tables, reports used for? Is there any measurable impact like revenue, cost savings, increase retention times along the chain?). This will help you to communicate the value of your work, be it internally or when applying for a new job and it helps understanding what needs monitoring and observability.**Basically: When they work, they're invisible.

It's better if you use a combination of standard approaches (column level masking with policy tags, row level access controls, authorised views) in my opinion.You _can_ use custom masking routines in your column level security. This involves creating a UDF that operates on the column and decides how to mask it. To make this work, you need to insert suitable info into the column, so you'd need to do something a bit hacky:1. create a column in an upstream layer indicating whether a row's ID is present in your list of those-to-be-masked2. prepend some identifier to the column of interest if it's in a row that needs masking```SELECT CONCAT( IF(to_be_masked, 'MASKME::', ''), valuable_col ) AS valuable_col,...```3.

Said in another way, you could (in fact, I do) have jobs that are processing records in batches (everything from the past 24 hrs), BUT the way those jobs are triggered is thru a pub/sub architecture. Meaning its not a a run-at-3-am cron scheduler, but instead events & rules on an aws event bus. So in this example the ""choosing batch"" does not automatically exclude the Event Driven part. Our glue jobs were built to process records in batch, but then we also went back and swapped out the scheduled runs with pub-sub events.... and all of this was done **without touching the glue code...** Batch to streaming is a bigger effort to transition to. Scheduled to event driven is much easier, I do not mind using aws event bridge + step functions. Eventually I'll get around to refreshing quicksight data sets with the same pattern.

Max time is typically 1-15 minutes, depending on the feed. * Once it lands all further processing is typically event-driven leveraging s3 event notifications and parallel processing kubernetes, ecs, lambda, or whatever. * If downstream apps need to run against newly-arriving files, they can subscribe to s3 event notifications for when they do. These can also be translated to load timestamps & ids if the apps want to query the database rather than just read the s3 file. * If downstream apps need to run against a certain newly-arrived period of data (ex: the most recent day/hour/etc) then a specific agent is responsible for periodically querying the data and is solely responsible for dictating when a given period is complete. And then it sends out a sns message and apps can subscribe to that.The net results is that it's extremely resistant to data quality problems from late-arriving data, it delivers data as quickly as it's economically feasible, most of the system is fault-tolerant and self-healing, and you don't have bloated daily processes failing in the middle of the night and lengthy outages, you deploy during the day, you know immediately if there are problems, and it doesn't take 8 hours in the middle of the night to know if the fix worked.",kenfar,2025-11-18 04:29:23,2,dataengineering,t3_1ozu1qq,False,

npgnzo1,"Near-real-time? Short answer: Flink.Long answer: I already worked in a setting in which the pattern was trained using scikit-learn (it was a simple classifier that considered 50 dimensions and decided if the event was fraud/not fraud). We packaged it and exposed it through a FastAPI endpoint. It was deployed on k8s with a load balancer for horizontal and elastic scaling. The main app called the endpoint with the payload and we answered with a float (the score). Using FastAPI background tasks, we sent asynchronously the payload, timestamp and score as a JSON to S3 (we could also have published it to Kafka). Then, a small ETL orchestrated by Prefect imported the JSONs into ClickHouse. The API was capable of answering the request in \~100ms. It was fast enough for the small product we had back then.Coming back to Flink: I believe that for usecases that requires statefulness, it is indeed the best solution. You could also use Spark, even though it will very likely be slower. Another good fit is TImeplus/Proton (waaaaaaay easier to setup than Flink, the tradeoff being the flexibility on the choice of the pattern).",palmtree0990,2025-11-18 08:39:47,7,dataengineering,t3_1p01h3l,False,

nofen96,"From my experience:1. Try to separate i/o (reading/writing) and transformation logic. One day you will want to add unit tests for the transformation, for corner cases, etc. and having logic in pure functions (functions that takes DataFrame and return DataFrame) will simplify things, because you won't need to mock i/o, but can just write tests.2. Move configuration logic away from transformation logic. You can create a singleton ""context"" class or an abstract class for the ""job"" and re-use it everywhere. When I say ""configuration"" I mean things like partition dates, input schemas or s3 paths. Again, it will simplify both maintenance (anyone who wants just to check a path or a config do not need to dive into transformation logic) and testing (you can test config and transformation separately).3. Do not write a very long chain of pyspark transformations, it is really hard to read. Instead separate logical parts into small functions. Simplify reading the code, transformation and testing.Overall: the main benefit of using PySpark DF API over SQL is that you can benefit from all the Python tooling for working with growing complexity of the codebase (functions, classes, imports, objects, tests, etc.). So, such a migraton, imo, makes sense only if you are going to use this benefits. In other words, you should start thinking about your ETL as about the software product and use the correspondence best practices. If you just convert SQL to DF API calls it will be much worser: you won't use benefits of DF API, but you will suffer from downsides of DF API.",ssinchenko,2025-11-12 08:57:52,19,dataengineering,t3_1ouxsb8,False,

Not to discourage you, but my two cents if you're main goal is maximising TC, I'd say getting into IT isn't worth it.

What I did first, and my recommendation is to start with cs50 which is Harvard's free into to computer science course. I think it's worth doing even if you end up studying a master's.

The Backend and Tasks seem to be the main expansion of your transactional data, so your processing bottleneck will hit there first.

np79ard,"For transparency, I am a co-founder of Bruin, an open-source platform for ingestion, transformation, and data cataloging. I will keep the advice general and vendor-neutral.You are on the right track. What you are feeling now is the natural boundary of relying on complex views in OLTP Postgres for BI and cross-system logic. The good news is that your data volume is still small, so you have a lot of cheap, simple options before needing a heavy architecture.A very important point: you do not need to move out of Postgres yet. One of the biggest cost-effective wins is to stop running 20-join views and instead materialize those transformations into tables on a schedule. Postgres can easily serve modeled fact and dimension tables for years at your size. And even in a warehouse or a data lake, you end up materializing tables anyway, so this work is never wasted.If you eventually add a warehouse, S3 + Athena or Snowflake are both very cost-conscious. You are already on AWS, your data volumes are small, and both fit the medallion pattern cleanly. Athena is extremely cheap (5$ / TB processed). Snowflake gives more predictable performance on small workloads. If you are comfortable running your own infra, ClickHouse on a single VM is one of the strongest low-cost OLAP choices and works well for real-time dashboards.Whatever platform you choose, keep your transformations in SQL. At your scale, you do not need Spark or distributed compute. Most transformations and even ML feature engineering can be done in SQL. Use Python only where absolutely necessary.A big structural improvement is to model your Backend and Camunda data properly once. Instead of repeating joins or routing everything through a massive consolidated view, create clean fact and dimension tables in Postgres or the warehouse. This will eliminate most of your current performance limitations.For ML and RAG, storing curated datasets as Parquet in S3 is ideal. Cheap, flexible, and compatible with all downstream tools.For ingestion, modeling, scheduling, and lineage, you can keep things simple by using a single unified tool. Bruin can pull from&to Postgres and APIs, run SQL transformations, and give you lineage and a catalog without stitching together multiple systems.If you prefer a more modular setup, dbt plus a scheduler (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster) is the standard alternative.At your stage, a simple setup is enough: keep everything in Postgres with materialized tables, or store raw data in S3 and model it in Athena or Snowflake before sending it to Metabase and saving ML datasets in Parquet.

nozmhwe,"Assuming a leadership position is more of a ""lateral"" move rather than a ""vertical"" transfer - it requires a different set of skill. Your job becomes tied to the collective outcome of your team, and managing people, which can be more challenging than writing ETL pipelines sometimes.You mentioned you're completing your SWE degree, and have concerns about your growth due to lack of a manager/repetitive job process.I'd start asking myself:1. Do I still want to grow my technical skills? If I become a manager, would this hinder my time capacity to juggle both technical projects and managing people at the same time.2. If I become a leader - what kind of leader should I be? Should I stay technical and handle 50% of the implementation, or focus more on the high level architectures and strategies of the team.I'd also encourage you to discuss your concerns with your CDO - since he has more context on your situation. Communicate openly about your goals, and create an actionable plan on how you can achieve them.>Should I explore an alternative career trajectory, such as transitioning toward a Data Scientist role?Only consider this if you're interested in Statistics/Quantitative projects. A big part of Data Science is story-telling and communicating results to business stakeholders.I personally stuck with DE because I love the software part of the job; building pipelines, optimizing Spark jobs, managing AWS/GCP costs etc.Most people don't realize Data Science has more to do with communication than technical - that's why many Econ/Social Sciences people do well in data science (not talking about MLOps or hard core data science PhD jobs of course)>What critical internal questions should I ask myself to ensure I make the most informed decision about my future path? \*Should I ask for a salary update? of how much? 15%?15% raise is reasonable for promotions or ""very good"" performances. In general, single digit raise for non-promotions is normal. Double digit for promotions, exceptional or new job.For salary negotiations, I'd start with having a X number, where X is the highest you'd want. Then ask for slightly higher than X. Also have a number Y which is the minimum salary you would accept,During salary conversations, try to center the conversation around your future responsibilities at the company, and re-defining your current scope of job to match that new salary.Hope this helps!",jayzern,2025-11-15 15:22:01,1,dataengineering,t3_1owfezf,False,

Use something CDC-aware to land data in a “raw” zone (ADLS / Blob) and let Databricks just do transformations on a shared cluster / job cluster.2. Or use Databricks directly, but centralize it: one or a few pipelines per DB, scheduled jobs, and a shared compute / serverless SQL warehouse, instead of one pipeline = one cluster.The confusing bit with Databricks “Ingestion Pipelines” is they’re optimized for their own Auto Loader + cloud files, not as a general CDC platform, so you end up with lots of tiny jobs and infra to babysit. For heavy SQL Server CDC, a lot of folks offload that part to a dedicated movement tool, then just point Databricks at the Delta / Parquet that shows up. Estuary does this pretty cleanly: MSSQL CDC -> Delta in near-real-time, and then your analysts just read Delta from Databricks without each pipeline spinning its own compute.Couple qs to narrow it down:* Are you okay with “near real-time” (seconds to minutes) vs strict real-time?* Do you *need* Databricks to own the ingestion, or are you open to using a separate CDC tool and keeping Databricks for transforms / AI only?I work at Estuary, so take that into account.",dani_estuary,2025-11-19 01:00:06,1,dataengineering,t3_1p0dejw,False,

The upside of this is that it's a common pattern that most of your customers will understand. The downside is that they have to write code (ie do work) to get the data out. The shape of the data is limited to what you serve over the API. It also puts a bunch of extraneous load on your servers and db (we've seen APIs be taken down because they were being scraped aggressively for BI purposes).* you can let your customers download CSVs. Like the first option, this will take work on your side to support and operationalize. The upside is that it's a pretty well understood pattern. The downside is that your customers might get annoyed quickly because this is a manual process: if they want data with any kind of regularity, they'll have to do this over and over again.* you can upload the data to an S3 bucket (or other object storage like R2 / GCS) and let your customers read it there. This is similar to giving them access to a database that you own, but gives you better cost and load protection: they'll be using their own compute to read it so it's less likely they'll blow up your bill by reading the data (though they can rack up big egress fees if your dataset is large).* you can share data directly to your customer's database or data warehouse. The upside is that the data shows up directly where they're ready to consume it, and they have to do zero work in order to get the data. It's also much more secure than letting them access your database directly (for example, they can't take your database down by accident by putting undue load on it). The downside is that it can be more or less cumbersome for your team to implement, depending on whether you build it in house or use existing tools.

npce0ne,"I did a career switch also when being 28. From logistics to CS. Logistics was fine but it did not fascinate me. Messing around with computers, experimenting with viruses (at one point my laptop was full of malware), camping our computer classroom during secondary/high school studies - all of that was interesting for me. So, I went for a degree and I never regret it. Started Bachelor studies when being 28. Graduated when being 32, and then followed it up with Master studies in Cyber security. And working as a junior software developer at the same time.Self-study will not take you far. You do not know what you do not know but what you should know. While in a university professors know what you should know and make you to study it. Even when you do not like it. Yes, you can google ""X roadmap"" or something but this only touches the main topics not tells what exactly you have to learn in it. You can also pick some online bootcamp course, but this only teaches you the very basics that usually is not enough to get hired.With self study your portfolio will be much more generic. You'll be copying the tutorials you are following, writing meaningless calculators. While university studies will introduce you into much more complex topics and also will give you more variety ideas that you can turn into projects. Either as part of your course studies, as part of hackathons, part of the computer club or robotics club or such that you might join, or as your Bachelor thesis project. Also, you'll learn all the theory that comes handy later on. Online tutorials and bootcamps show you how to write a functioning simple prototype but they do not tell you why to do it the way you are doing. And often they leave out all kinds of things that will be needed during your work as a software developer.And then there are connections. All your course mates, professors, computer club mates, they can later on help you with finding a job. Most of your course mates graduate and get hired. Some of the professors already are working in different companies while also part time being lecturers in a university. People can give you referrals. You'll get none of that as a self-learner. Now, to the downside of doing these studies: you won't be able to study full time and work full time at the same time. Either your studies will stretch over to 4-6 years, to lower your study load, or you'll have to lower your work load. I was working with 50% load and studying full time. And I run out of all the free time. Sometimes my flatmates (I shared an apartment with other students) found me sleeping in the middle of my notebooks. I feel into sleep while studying. Also, it can cost for you. Where I am from, university studies are free for our citizens. Well, free as long as you are passing your exams and not failing some course. Retaking a course will cost. But in other countries it can be that the studies fully cost money. I will put it so: how will you stand out as a self-learner from the crowd of university graduates, vocational school graduates, and junior developers changing their company? Why a company should hire a self-learner over a guy who has a degree? If you can figure it out for yourself, then sure, go with a self-study.

We have noticed how one team had started producing visibly worse PRs recently. With stuff that clearly comes from an AI: needless comments, helper methods that make no sense, deleted parts of unit tests / integration tests, unnecessary visibility modifications (making a method public when it has absolutely no reason to be public), using full-path dependencies in a code (instead of using ""import this.is.some.package.dependency"" they use it as ""var this.is.some.package.dependency = some value or initialization"", etc. Stuff that serves no purpose or is even dangerous (deleting functionality to ""fix"" tests).We have just rejected such PRs when the PR makes no sense. If it is a small code smell or such, we let them change it. If it is a nonsense, then we reject it and tell to rewrite the code. ""IDK"" is not acceptable answer to comments that we add.There have been also some complaints that we do not accept such PRs and the task stays unfinished because of taking too much time in the code review phase. But then we just escalated our concerns to our managers. It is their responsibility to talk with the managers of other teams for them to deal with their developers. Inside our team we do use AI tools but we also share both pros and cons with each other to teach the whole team to not fully rely on an AI and to not permit AI-generated code that does not first pass the review/criticism of the developer himself. We also are using SonarQube tool for checking some of the more common mistakes in coding style and such. The person who is pushing his PR has to fix these findings before even forwarding the PR to somebody for a review. We will not consider a PR that has unfixed findings from SonarQube and from one vulnerability check scanner.Also, the PR has to have a good test coverage (measured by another tool).

np9a3kq,"By ""small indie studio,"" are you referring to an actual company that hired people and pay them, or just a team of volunteers that someone with an idea recruited on Reddit and Discord? I've worked with plenty of indie teams of the latter, and the skill/experience level of the programmers that you find in those are very low. It's usually someone who just started learning game dev after watching a tutorial video on YouTube. Sometimes, you find someone who already knows how to code because they're a CS major in college or something. It's almost never an actual experienced programmer, because they're usually not out and about looking for unpaid or rev-share work. It's one of the main reasons why I stopped working with other programmers on projects. I can code the game by myself, and I team up with artists, composers, etc., to cover the skills I'm not good at. Finding a good programmer out in the wild is like finding a needle in a haystack, and the bad ones just slow down the team. Even when someone says they have several years of experience, you have to take it with a grain of salt. I worked for a studio with a dev whose LinkedIn showed 3 years of game dev experience, but he didn't understand the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms. He wrote a path finding algorithm that took 3-7 seconds instead of the 40 milliseconds it should have taken after I fixed the bug. The bug? The GetNeighbors function was iterating over every tile in the game board (several thousand of them) to find the neighboring tiles each time it was called, instead of simply retrieving a stored list of neighbors or using a constant time method like adding/subtracting 1 to the X, Y, Z coordinates. If your studio is actually paying people, your studio needs to re-evaluate what they're paying for. If it's a team of volunteers, just let go of the unskilled programmers.I also hope that your studio isn't trying to build a MMORPG that's supposed to have thousands of players all in the same server interacting with each other in real-time or something along that line. If the project is over scoped to a degree that's challenging even for AAA studios, it's very unlikely that your studio will succeed with a team of volunteers who have no obligation to stay on the project.

Just bond with your team not grow distanced of everybody.But coming back to your work then it is absolutely normal that you won't be on the same level as everybody else after being a junior just for 5 months. Forget comparing yourself with mid-level or senior-level developers. They are mid and senior because they have a whole lot of more experience, knowledge and skills. And they gained it with time. They also were juniors once. They also were slow, once. And even there is no point to compare yourself with other juniors. Every junior has a different past. Some juniors got a degree.

Some have been coding since a kid/teenager because their parents were in the IT field.Compare yourself only with the past you. Did you learn anything new during the sprint (or, if your team is not using sprints then during last week/month)? If you did, then well done. You are only competing with yourself. Not with others.Ask your boss if the time estimate in these tasks is taking you into consideration or the time estimate is how majority of the team members should be able to finish it in time. Let's say the time estimate is 3 days. Is this 3 days what your team mates should be able to do it in given time or is this 3 days also what a fresh junior should handle? Ask him what will happen when you deliver your task one or two days later. Depending on a project it can be that nothing happens. Some projects are quite agile. Client is fine with waiting some days more. Other are public sector projects where the government and ministries are setting fixed deadlines that can't be changed. Perhaps you delivering your stuff one or two days later, as a new junior, is totally fine. YOU must talk with your boss over this.You are not expected to work off the clock. This can give wrong idea to the boss. Perhaps they should put more days or story points to the estimate when going over the tasks in the backlog. But when you are working at the night or something then they will not see this (unless you push your stuff, then pipelines will leave a mark behind). Work 8 hours a day. For the better or for the worse. You doing overhours WILL start affecting the quality of your tasks. Right now you are freaking out over a bug. The next time you might blow up their test environment or something. Because of being too tired, from working more than 8 hours. Stop working more. Get rest.Bugs happen. This is why QA and/or developers testing the product exist. Even mids and sometimes senior developers have a bug in their code, a missed business case. Or a client asks something to be changed. You have to write tests to your functionality. Then test locally. Then test in your team's testing environment (if it exists). And after that pass it on to your team mates (QA or just other developers). They will do a code review and will do the testing. It is a normal process flow. Especially as it was a small bug. That is fine.Your boss is right. You must communicate more. If you are stuck then ask for help. Tell what you tried, what did not work out, where do you think the issue is (or where it is not).

Like when you play tic-tac-toe, you both see the actual board with Xs and Os, and you imagine how the board will look once you place your next mark.That is also how software works, there is some sort of output, if not explicitly graphical or visual, at least observable in some way, and there is an invisible internal representation, that you can't experience, but that the program ""knows"" and uses to decide its next move, or determine who won. And in both games and programs there's input that manipulates the internal model - often with very different results, depending on the previous state of that model.And of course, games have rules - often you follow an actual algorithm when playing a game, or at least you have some fixed pattern of steps to perform, and there is, if not an algorithm, then a fairly strict way of determining a winner or loser, or if the game should continue.And most important of all for learning - there is a lot of repetition in games, both as a player and a developer you are iterating a lot, gradually improving, and always trying various combinations.

I very much recommend that for a -very- deep dive! If you are more into data structures than user interfaces, taking a deep dive into the **Collections framework** in Java is another interesting example of using OOP! And of course, there's always the option of building your own game - like e.g. **a simple text adventure**, with objects representing items, rooms and characters, using inheritance and polymorphism to give different items either similar or different attributes, and letting objects communicate, like hitting an enemy with a weapon could happen as the player-object calling a hit-method on the enemy-object with a weapon-object, and the enemy-object then asks the weapon-object how much damage it would inflict, and subtract from its own health.

npim6zb,"I got into software engineering in my 40s, with no college or connections in the industry, and coming from a radically different sector (brick and mortar retail). ngl it's definitely hard mode getting your \*first\* job, but after that first one you're basically indistinguishable from any other candidate.My journey in a nutshell: I was a self-taught programmer who'd never met another software engineer in my life. I quit my old job to move to a major tech hub (this was before I had kids -- it would be much harder to do this now) because, you know, you should go where the money is. And by ""move"" I mean ""sleep on the floor of the one guy I know in this city"".I was very quickly disabused of the notion I'd get hired as a software engineer because 1) I had absolutely no worthwhile experience to speak of, and no one is hiring you off a portfolio.\[0\] 2) I was objectively unqualified, which I can now say with the benefit of hindsight. I wasn't competent enough to understand how actually incompetent I was.After sleeping on my friend's floor for a scary six months of unemployment and failing to get hired as a software engineer, I changed my approach from ""What can I do to get someone to hire me as a software engineer?"" (because that clearly wasn't working) to ""What can I do to get on a path that will allow me to take meaningful steps toward my goal?"" and this basically unlocked everything for me.I made lists of what I deemed the ""right"" companies to facilitate my growth. These were:1. Companies that were smallish but definitely growing. Successful startups or just post-startup-phase companies. Places like this, you're going to get asked to flex out of your zone all the time, and internal mobility is very high relative to the Googles or Metas of the world.2. Companies where software engineering was in the DNA of the company: whether it was a strong engineering brand, or the customers were engineers. I wanted to become a software engineer, so I wanted a place that had software engineering top of mind (ie not like, a photo-sharing app or dog-walking-as-a-service or whatever).And I guess (3): a place where my past background might be at least slightly relevant, to leverage in some way the value of my past life.And from there I made it my goal to get \*any\* role in one of those companies. I would have taken a role in the kitchen.I got hired as a non-technical customer support agent at what was the dream company on my list. And I spent the next few years proving to them that I am awesome and capable of bigger and better things, and after a few years transitioned internally to a software engineering role, which I would have ABSOLUTELY NOT ever been considered for as an external candidate, largely because I was not competent to do the job. It's much, much easier to become competent while you're inside the house. When you're on the outside, you're largely flying blind and it's very very easy to waste energy.

Their intent would be clearer if they'd called the function `toggleAutoPlay` too.You don't need the if statement at all if you use code like this:- let intervalId; function startAutoPlay() {   intervalId = setInterval(function () {       const playerMove = pickComputerMove();       playGame(playerMove);     }, 1000);   document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').innerHTML = 'Stop';   document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').onClick = stopAutoPlay; }; function stopAutoPlay() {   clearInterval(intervalId);   document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').innerHTML = 'Auto Play';   document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').onClick = startAutoPlay; };Instead of checking state variables and branching, you just make the click event point to the right code block in the first place, Personally I'm not a big fan of the choice to put the looping function inline either, there's a lot to be said for a few extra lines of code and the additional clarity.",motific,2025-11-18 18:36:55,2,learnprogramming,t3_1p0evm0,False,

We don't actually see *where* it's called in this code, but my bet is it's tied to a button click event. So when the app starts running, it's `false`, and then the first time `autoPlay()` is called it will call the first branch of the `if` statement and set `isAutoPlaying` to `true`. The next time it's called, `isAutoPlaying` will be `true` and run the `else` branch instead, resetting `isAutoPlaying` to `false` again.Quick edit: The statement `!isAutoPlaying` doesn't actually change the value of `isAutoPlaying`.

Most flashcards are free (about 70 percent across 30 categories), and the subscription unlocks quizzes, which also help track progress more effectively. Of course, all of this was before AI appeared.

But of course you'll have to write at minimum some code for processing the arguments (see Python's argparse, for example), and code for opening input files, opening output files, checking for errors, etc. However, such code is definitely reusable across projects, though, so once you've written it once, you can and should reuse it in many different such command-line tools, not only to prevent code rewriting, but also to enforce ""consistency"" in your CLI apps.BTW, even for programs that accept input parameters by naming files, it's a popular convention to also allow an option to read from standard input. This is particularly useful if the input the user wants to process comes from another file. Typically this option is called ""-"": ./some_other_program_that_produces_output | ./my_awesome_program -o out.txt -So in that way of calling the program, the output goes to out.txt, and the input comes from standard input (specified by the - argument for the filename), which we can see comes from some other program (but your program should not know nor care about that).

But you have to stick to that linear, sequential model.If two separate programs need to interact, then file I/O gets awkward. Output will typically be buffered, so a dialogue between two concurrently running programs will get stuck when B is waiting for output that A hasn't flushed. There are ways around this, but in cases where you'd be tempted to go there, it's much better if you can rethink it - use as many temporary files as you need, if it helps avoid that mess.PS ""stdin"" is buffered input around the UNIX file descriptor 0; stdout for fd 1, stderr for fd 2. These file descriptors are the underlying UNIX I/O, and the shell can open and redirect other file descriptors if there's any use for them.",DonnPT,2025-11-18 11:02:39,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p02uoy,False,

Use a framework/toolkit/library to help you with that. You *should* know which ones if you supposedly have HTML/CSS/JS experience. So, how would you design a calendar app? It's just a database with UI. So you need some sort of database backend. Pick one that fits your needs. (Complicated: Firebase. Simple as heck: SQLite)Then you need some sort of middleware linking database to the UI. That's what you program the ""webapp"" in. And you need to learn THAT. The combination of database and middleware and UI is sometimes called a ""web stack"". For example, the MERN stack is MongoDB as database, Express.js and Node.js as Middleware, and React for UI. No, not suggesting that. It's too complicated for your needs. Figure out the right stack for your project is YOUR responsibility. How would an app send you message? Well... WHAT TYPE of message?

npgl0tx,"Probably just googling around?Solid is mostly just set of Design (capital D design) principles of varying usefulness (things should do one thing, things should be extensible, class that inherits from other class should be usable everywhere where the parents class was, interfaces should be small, you should inject dependencies…), I would say don’t treat them as a gospel since there is a lot of situations where some interpretations of those endup being counter productive.Message passing comes from the old world of smalltalk, and is not really a thing in modern implementations of “OO” languages, outside of something like ObjC, weirdly learning some FP language can demystify this a lot better than OO (something like erlang for example).Objects are just units of mutable state, that’s the entire idea. and encapsulation is just way of hiding the internals of said state. But the more mutable state you have the more bug-prone you inherently are and the harder it is actually parallelize your program, not to mention that people are undisciplined and leak internal state everywhere anyway…And as the video you saw points out OOP=Inheritance+Encapsulation. And inheritance is in general kinda pointless… Composition is better mechanism of abstraction and parametric polymorphism/parametric types (think of C++ templates) are way better way of code reuse, there has been at-least million PLT texts written on this topic, they aren’t that hard to find either. So that’s why in lot of people say that OOP is essentially just a method of encapsulation.Also as someone in this thread pointed out, everybody defines OOP bit differently, for what’s it worth I recently saw this definition and kinda liked it: ”compile-time hierarchy of encapsulation that matches the domain model”",UdPropheticCatgirl,2025-11-18 08:08:49,3,learnprogramming,t3_1p05ueo,False,

Primitive data.2. Aggregation of primitive data (optional).3. Associating behaviour (functions) with (aggregated) data.You have a form of OOP from this point but you can go further:4. Runtime polymorphism and dynamic dispatch of functions (ability to treat sub-types as super-types, and looking up which functions to call based on which concrete type your data is to select behaviour at runtime).5. Optionally, encapsulation of the data. (access modifiers at language or design level).6. Design patterns (e.g. GoF Patterns for OOP).Those are basically the core OOP concepts. Plenty of implementation details within each (e.g. message-passing, vtables, etc.)It will be useful to look at the differences between OOP in message-passing langs (Smalltalk, Ruby, etc.) vs something like CLOS (Common LISP) vs any class-based language (Java, C#, C++, etc.) vs a prototype-based language (JS etc.) for differences in the interface presented by the language to the programmer as well as implementation.",HashDefTrueFalse,2025-11-18 11:22:27,2,learnprogramming,t3_1p05ueo,False,

npig3pr,"Object Oriented Programming is based on an ideology, whereas Functional Programming is based on mathematical principles. I'll tell you right now that FP is consistently smaller, faster, easier to maintain, and scales better than OOP. You REALLY should focus on FP.The principles of OOP do not cause OOP, they come out of OOP as a consequence. So you can use abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance as standalone idioms, or in other paradigms - Functional Programming has all these things, too - and you can still completely miss OOP.OOP is all about message passing. It's also known as the Actor Model of computation, which you might want to read up on. There's an old tome called Theory of Objects you might want to track down and read, you might want to Google Alan Kay and Carl Hewitt. You might also benefit from dabbling in Smalltalk for a bit - Squeak is a modern implementation.---In OOP - you send messages to objects, and the objects decide ENTIRELY how to handle that message.You do not call `car.accelerate();`, you instead create a message, ""I wanna go faster"", and you pass that to the driver, and the driver decides what to do with that. MAYBE they accelerate the car, maybe they maintain a more consistent speed by moving to a less busy lane, maybe they take a shorter route, maybe they're already doing everything they can and have to ignore you.Java doesn't have a message passing interface like Smalltalk an C++ do, but you can build something - make a `Producer` and `Consumer`, both derived from `Runnable`, that share a `Message` queue. In Smalltalk, message passing is a language level construct. In C++, it's standard streams.You are giving the object - the actor, autonomy and agency. You are not giving up control. You don't need to command the object what to do and when to do it; it's your object - you built it, you designed it, you've just relocated WHAT and WHEN to somewhere else in your design - when you construct the object. Want a more aggressive driver? Give it more aggressive characteristics as a part of it's construction parameters. Now when you pass it messages, you know it will drive as predictably as you have prescribed.Objects have no public interface beyond the message passing interface, maybe some necessary boilerplate per your language. You don't GET or SET anything - members are implementation details. You don't push or pull information, you can send it messages with new information, or you can submit a question or query and maybe get a response. Normally objects are constructed in terms of other objects. A car that is accelerated - you don't QUERY the car for the speed, the transmission sends a message to the speedometer, which could be a text output, it could be a widget, an analog device, a HUD...So in OOP, you assemble this graph structure of objects as your nodes and message channels as your edges. Your inputs are a source, a monitor, a motor controller, a log file... These are sinks. Things in the middle of the graph can be both sources and sinks - you can make objects that produce their own messages, consume messages, and produce other messages as a response. Perhaps a motor controller is producing heat, speed and power consumption on its own, but also responds to control inputs to speed up or slow down, and acknowledges it received the request.I dunno, use your imagination.OOP is GREAT for graph theory, which means it's great for distributed systems. Bjarne invented C++ because he wanted to build network simulators (could have just done it with a matrix - linear algebra is great for solving for networks), but its performance is quite damningly limited. It's ability to scale is also limited - you can scale your graph horizontally all you want, but eventually the size of the network becomes the most limiting factor and you can't get additional performance.You can abstract any problem into the OOP domain. That doesn't mean it's a good fit. You can make a text character an object and pass it a message asking it to capitalize itself. This is how Smalltalk works, since everything is an object. But consider the overhead... OOP, Smalltalk presumed a smart compiler, an investment in the paradigm could make the object oriented nature compile out, leaving optimal machine code behind. I don't suppose that's flawed, but it would be an investment in this unique programming paradigm. You're basically trying to get the paradigm out of the way so you can get back down to the lambda calculus formula of computation that the program should actually be.So in any of these languages, you can create User Defined Types, as classes certainly are, but that doesn't make them object oriented. Without that autonomous agency, without message passing, it's just more imperative programming, where you're taking direct, explicit control of what happens, when and where.And think about it, once you have an object that accepts messages - you have abstraction aka complexity hiding; you don't know how the object is implemented and you don't care so long as it behaves as it should in lieu of the message. You have encapsulation, which is that bundling of state and functions, aka you can build it internally in terms of stateful behavior. You have polymorphism, which is the ability to interchange any object for any other and they each decide what a message means to them. And you have inheritance, which is an implementation detail, but gives you type hierarchies for when that is sometimes useful.You weren't TRYING for any of that, but you get it for free.",mredding,2025-11-18 16:04:29,-1,learnprogramming,t3_1p05ueo,False,

The server can take a list of prime numbers, and select 'n' random prime numbers from that list (repeats allowed), quickly compute the product and send it to the client.

nos20vl,"Languages like Swift and Kotlin were certainly designed to support the needs of GUI development, but they don’t have any particular GUI “built in.” Most languages rely on libraries and frameworks for anything thats platform-specific, including user interfaces, graphical or otherwise.Building a GUI framework into a language would just encumber the compiler with a lot of extra complexity, making it less suitable for other purposes and possibly less useful on other platforms. So in general it’s good to keep them separate.That said, there are tools that integrate a language and GUI framework pretty seamlessly, and languages that are meant only for use within a particular platform. Logo defines its own drawing environment and has a lot of built-in drawing functions. HyperTalk (from the late-80’s) was meant mainly for defining UI within the HyperCard environment. Visual Basic was very Windows-specific and integrated with a GUI editor.If Kotlin was recommended for your project, use it.

noxejs4,"From my experience, yes, GUIs are generally done with libraries. They aren't built into a language because many programming languages are intended to be available to write programs for more than one OS/platform, and including a GUI library would make the language's library quite large. GUIs for the various operating systems can also behave significantly differently, with different philosophies, so making a standard GUI library that works with everything would be fairly complex and not very practical.Some developers write command-line applications (without a GUI), so for those reasons, language designers typically choose not to include GUI capabilities directly in a programming language.",RolandMT32,2025-11-15 04:14:20,2,learnprogramming,t3_1owq8fz,False,

nosxizd,"General-purpose languages like Python, C, C++, C#, Java, etc, are meant to run code - All they really do is move data around and execute instructions. GUIs are something else. Like in the beginning, there was just the console terminal, and people had to write programs that moved the cursor, colored parts of the screen, wrote text on the screen buffer. Then framebuffered graphics cards became a thing, and then all of a sudden there were window managers and bitmaps, but the languages pretty much stayed the same. Libraries of course helped create an interface between the language and how data was represented visually.There will always be a separate layer between the general purpose language and the UI. Also, people have different ideas of how a UI should be represented. For example, the Win32 API lets you call the OS layer to draw windows, buttons and style them according to the OS, but that means you can't use your program code as-is on another platform like Linux.Libraries like GTK and QT attempt to solve this problem by creating their own API, which calls the underlying OS to create some of the OS-layer objects like windows, but does the rest of the display stuff itself, in order to have a consistent cross-platform experience.So most language rely on separate libraries or frameworks, like C#/.NET having WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) that is Windows-only, or AvaloniaUI which is cross-platform, and MAUI, which is... well...Then different libraries have different ways of abstracting the layout, so WPF uses XML or rather XAML, Kotlin has it written as code.",rupertavery64,2025-11-14 13:12:42,1,learnprogramming,t3_1owq8fz,False,

There are frameworks for building GUIs with imperative code, but they're not great to work with. Declarative languages, however, are great for building GUIs. For example, HTML.

Then once you get the fundamentals down, you can go with more complex lessons like OOP, Java-specific things, etc. You'll know you understand it enough when you start paying more attention to what AI outputs, and you go ""wait, why is it done this way instead of this?"".Also I haven't mentioned it yet, but people would agree that another method to learn faster is to find a mentor or ask in Reddit or Discord communities.

Debugging code is where you actually start to build your diagnostic muscles.Any programmer will have tales of woe of the time they spent hours, if not days, hunting down something as trivial as a badly declared variable. However, that suffering will have made them better programmers and probably taught them innumerable things they didn't realize at the time.> I ask AI what I can do too make the program better.While an LLM can barf out code that does stuff, it achieves this feat by stealing all available code from programmers it can find.

It does make sense to also parameterize the ""1 hour"" part assuming folks using the API would be interested in other time frames, too.I think I prefer /centers as the end-point, since presumably a list of that resource is the return value, and the rest as query parameters treated as filters. They could even be nested as filters to make it explicit. Or they could have filter added to the query parameter name.I would not do it as 2 queries without knowing more requirements that would justify an API like that. You'd want an API like that for various reasons. But without any reasons, you may as well just make the API as friendly to the user calling it as possible. 1 call is certainly more friendly than 2. It's also almost always more performant, though I wouldn't worry about performance without a specific reason to.Since it's your API, you can of course require the user to pass the item ID in.

I think it's pretty normal for it to be overwhelming in the beginning, too.- don't stop learning new technologies just because there are new ones coming out every other week. The opportunity cost of switching technologies is pretty high for a company (depending on how deeply integrated it is) so chances are in your career you will sometimes work on stuff that is not bleeding-edge, and having learned a varied set of tools is likely to be if use eventually. Not to mention you will start seeing patterns at some point, which will make you grow as a dev- AI: sure this is transforming the profession in many ways, but try not to over-rely on it as a junior. Some things have to be learnt the hard way. Never keep going if you don't understand what you're doing. It's fine if it's AI or not your idea, but take the time to understand it first. Challenge it if you can. Also yes, many investors and execs would love to completely replace developers with AI, and this is making the market more difficult for junior developers.

Writing software is easy, once you figure out what you want to make, you can bang it out pretty fast. LLMs make this part even faster, which can be nice, especially when I have writer's block.But.I have to go back and read through everything it wrote, make sure it works properly, make sure it caught all the weird edge cases specific to our codebase, make sure it matches our coding style, make sure it's going to be reliable, make sure it didn't hallucinate. I usually end up having to rewrite a decent amount of the LLM generated code.This sucks because reading software and auditing it is much harder and more intellectually draining than writing it.Figuring out what you need to write is the bulk of your job, understanding the specs, understanding the context of your changes within your codebase. Making sure all the weird edge cases you know are handled. Writing docs.

A few of them were obvious showstoppers which meant they hadn’t touched the code at all for five of those “day for day slip!” weeks. It was schedule drama to cover their own issues. They did this nine times in a row before they found one bug I hadn’t already fixed and created a tagged release for. Every one before that was known bug, upgrade to 2.0.4 or later to get the fix.

At medium to larger size orgs there tends to be a split after senior where you decide to either continue advancing as an IC (with titles like staff, principal, architect) or go into management (with titles like manager, director, senior director, VP, CTO). As a result staff or principal engineer wouldn't be considered management. As these titles are in the IC track. This can be important because if you say you want to be an architect or staff title but are talking about management you may be sending mixed messages to gatekeepers. I was surprised about your post title and then the contents of your post weren't about jobs that are commonly thought of as being management. They may think you don't know what you want. Or worse they may think you aren't experienced enough to know the difference and set your application to the side.\> my manager keeps saying i'm ""operating at the next level"" but when i apply for staff or principal engineer roles, either internally or externally, i hit a wall.You will have to be honest with yourself here as we can't evaluate you. But if you are struggling in the behavioral and system design rounds it doesn't sound like you are there. You shouldn't be struggling at all in a behavioral at any of the titles you've expressed. Those titles have a lot of coordination with other stakeholders and you should be able to breeze through them for those titles. Likewise system design is also a fundamental task for those titles. If you are struggling then that may mean you haven't worked on complex enough tasks for them to feel comfortable hiring you with that title. Yes interviewing is a different skill, but it's just as important for getting the job. Yes sometimes the interview is harder than the actual job.If you have skip level meetings I'd highly encourage you to talk to your manager's manager about getting specific with what ""strategic thinking"", ""broader impact"" and ""working on communication"" means to them. Strategic thinking to me would be forward thinking about the feature not just how it's used right now but how will it be used in the future, should it be architected a little differently so we can get future wins for free. You may already be doing this, and what you really need to work on is how people perceive you. If you aren't explaining your thought process to your boss then he may not realize that you are doing ""strategic thinking"". You should be doing this in 1 on 1s. Sometimes using the phrases they care about can work too. I know it sounds dumb but when they are filling out a review and you've been consistently talking about strategy for a project to make sure it has impact can go a long way. Broader impact tends to mean impacting multiple departments. If you are already doing that it might be code for you getting more visibility within those departments when you work in projects that impact them. That could be scheduling meetings to ensure the technical requirements will fulfill their needs. Yes product is usually involved here, but product isn't technical and may not make optimal choices.It should also be noted in some companies they have to have a business need for the title you want to be promoted into. You simply operating at that level isn't enough justification.Lastly, the market is utter garbage right now. You are competing against a lot of other people.

It was NOT to leave. However, the offer I did end up getting was too good to pass up, and I would have been an idiot to pass on it. I was open about this to my manager - I didn’t want to leave, but I’d be an idiot to say no - and they wanted to keep me enough that they worked with me to get a counter.

npkiea1,"Most AI performance measurements are not credible, and growth in that sector is not sustainable because of the costs of the underlying infrastructure. Neural networks don't scale very well, and the explosion in their usage from 2010 onwards was basically only enabled by improvements to GPU hardware.Those improvements have plateau'd, both due to shortages of silicon, and due to how little headroom there is to make hardware breakthroughs at the moment. We've basically hit the point of diminishing returns for the everyday consumer and for business use of LLMs and GPT systems.With that in mind, I can't predict the future, but for the time being, LLMs and GPT systems are *a convenient excuse* for the layoffs required in the post-COVID recession conditions. Businesses don't like to scare their shareholders and stakeholders by saying ""the market sucks and we shrunk"", so they spin it as ""we adopted AI, so the 40% reduction in forces is actually 40% efficiency!!!"" LLMs and GPT systems also took off right when crypto startups needed an exit plan and a way to unload *thousands* of GPUs.So you'll need to prepare to job-hunt in a very large recession, and the AI / ML sector is currently experiencing a hype bubble. Obviously, some of that hype is totally valid -- they are fantastic at classification problems that don't have formalized training sets. But, a lot of the hype is business people and end users not quite understanding the shell game going on. And there's plenty of grifting because people think they'll be able to sell their ""bottle imp"" before it's too late. LLMs and GPT systems will remain, and they're *really* cool.

Staff and above focus more on why.As a staff, it's my job to become deeply intimate and opinionated with the product or platform I am paid to improve, as well my company's technical roadmap. From there, I need to form solid business cases as to what technical work is most important for my team, defend those with SLT or C-suite leadership, and then set up my seniors for success in the execution of that roadmap.As a senior, it's your job to become deeply intimate and opinionated on the problem that's put in front of you, likely a project from your staff dev or manager.

novq48i,"Yeah, I usually see them as MLOps Engineer or Data Science Engineer, though they can also be listed under more generic AI/ML Engineer, or even occasionally as Data Scientist, depending on the organization. But there's absolutely a career to be made in the space.Candidly, I find that ML Engineering as we're discussing it isn't really an entry level role, but more something that a software/data engineer or data scientist will lateral into if they have an affinity for it. While as an ops/deployment person you won't need to have the same familiarity with the statistics/math as the data scientists and researchers putting together the initial proofs-of-concept and models, you're going to need enough familiarity to be able to sense check things, collaborate effectively with the research side, and, from time to time, optimize the approach without negatively impacting the model capabilities.Key skills include traditional software dev, including the usual system design, engineering, testing, etc., with a few other things. For embedded, there's additional nuances around programming on custom boards, signal processing/cleaning, and to some extent hardware tinkering, and for cloud/forecasting stuff, parallelization and distributed computing comes up with some frequency. Some of the more relevant challenges I see day-to-day are around model instrumentation/tracking metrics, managing cloud costs, runtime, and wrangling tech debt that inevitably spawns as the model pipelines keep changing.I'd personally want to take a software engineer with a few years of experience working in the cloud, or someone who's done some lightweight embedded stuff, and get them up to speed on the ML-relevant side. I could probably take a data scientist and do it, but I've found that most professionals that grow up on that side have pretty terrible programming skills. It's easier to beat data quality and validation into an engineer's head than to get someone up to speed on formal engineering, I find. Though if our nascent ML Engineer is bad at math and logic, their career in ML will probably be pretty short lived.Edit: For LLMs, I think that there isn't much reason (apart from political organizational reasons) to have ML/DS teams responsible for applied LLM implementations and deployments. You'd think that people who should notionally be familiar with the math would be more clear-eyed on what these models can and can't do, but that doesn't seem to be the case--so in my mind, there isnt't a reason to bother having a data scientist involved in the implementation from a technical standpoint.

If it's more than a 5 minute ask, put up a calendar invite. Look up the Pomodoro technique. Keep in mind these quick changes affect our neurotypical colleges as well. It's worse for us but they aren't immune. Context switching hurts. As to the workflow change issue: yeah some migrations will have you jumping backwards and forwards when things aren't working properly. You have to roll with the punches, in the 4 years I've been in my team I've had: 4 pipeline migrations, three changes to our observability stack, one cloud migration, and a DB migration.
