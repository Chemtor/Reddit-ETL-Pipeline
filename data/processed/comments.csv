nlgugf7,"A few of the other comments hit reasons why you would do partitioning, but there's a common underlying mechanism for it.Partitioning allows you to do isolated operations on a lake table, so that you can limit an operation that works on 'all' the data to only work on a single partition, or allow multiple otherwise conflicting operations to run concurrently on different partitions, or both.Z-Ordering inherently adjusts the ordering of data across files so that file skipping mechanics work better. It Has to be able to rewrite all of the data in scope so that the ordering can work properly, so it would necessarily rewrite all the data. That would conflict with concurrent merge/update/delete operations, as at the time of finishing the ZOrder you would revert the rewritten data. However, if you run ZOrder on a single partition, then you can still merge/update/delete data in other partitions.The same goes for performing merge operations -- if you can isolate them to a single partition then the system can know for certain that you could not have possibly rewritten data outside that partition, so you can have concurrent merges working on different partitions.But that's all you really need it for now. You might add it for `is_active` on an SCD2 table because you will generally fundamentally only be updating current data and frequently only querying it, but you wouldn't be trying to optimise tables with partitioning.

Instead of physically co-locate files to nested folders (partitions) it just mark in a metadata that ""this parquet file is related to cluster (partition) X"" in a corresponding metadata JSON-file.

If your clustering keys change, then the files do need to be rewritten. (Edit: to benefit from the new clustering. But Databricks actually allows keeping old files with a previous clustering, see reply.)Please let me know if you have a source stating otherwise or if I misunderstood your comment.The difference between liquid clustering and simple clustering, is that liquid clustering is dynamic based on the access pattern statistics. If your access pattern is shifting, the optimizer will decide at some point that it is worth it to rewrite some files to reduce cost. This dynamic aspect is great, but it may also create new unexpected costs.

nm3o4vd,"I have a lot of thoughts on the statement ""Data Contracts are only as good as the data tests that back them up.""While at face value I agree with this as best practice, it doesn't align with the value prop of data contracts. In particular, data contracts require preventive enforcement, and if you are profiling data, it means incorrect data has already been written to database systems and is propagating across the business. If anything, I argue that data profiling is more closely tied to data observability, which complements data contracts but serves a different purpose.I argue that data contracts need enforcement where data is either first generated, captured, or ingested. In the Glassdoor case study above, they use static code analysis to extract metadata from the code to determine what function calls in the application relate to a data asset. Then apply LLMs to this highlighted code to determine the codified business logic irrespective of the data. Enforcement of expectations on the code ensures prevention via CI/CD before the code is deployed and thus before data is written.My recent article [*Your Data Contracts Are in the Wrong Spot*](https://dataproducts.substack.com/p/your-data-contracts-are-in-the-wrong) goes into more detail on this.",on_the_mark_data,2025-10-29 23:39:14,1,dataengineering,t1_nm2rzjf,True,

nm2e4ym,"Hey [r/dataengineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/)! Hope you’re having a productive week.We’re super excited to share what we’ve been working on at LakeSail. Our latest Sail 0.4 release introduces native Apache Iceberg support and provides major architectural improvements to Delta Lake execution. The release also lays the foundation for distributed DML operations across open data formats and marks a key step toward Sail’s goal of a fully unified lakehouse engine.# What is Sail?Sail is an open-source, Rust-native, multimodal computation framework which includes drop-in replacement compatibility for Apache Spark (SQL and DataFrame API) in both single-host and distributed settings. Built from the ground up in Rust, Sail runs \~4x faster than Spark while reducing hardware costs by up to 94%. Our mission is to unify batch processing, stream processing, and compute-intensive AI workloads all in one compute engine.# What’s New in Sail 0.4* **Native Apache Iceberg integration:** Iceberg tables now run directly inside Sail’s Rust-based query engine for a unified experience across open data formats.* **Added support for the Iceberg Catalog REST API**, including **Polaris** and **R2 Catalog**, enabling connectivity to standard Iceberg catalog backends.* **Reengineered Delta Lake integration:** Delta operations have been refactored into modular nodes for scanning, writing, and committing, enabling more advanced DML operations.* **Shared abstractions across Iceberg and Delta Lake:** A common foundation that paves the way for a unified, format-agnostic lakehouse architecture.# Join the Slack CommunityWe invite anyone whose interested to [join our community on Slack](https://www.launchpass.com/lakesail-community/free) and get involved on [GitHub](https://github.com/lakehq/sail)!

Considering your team isn’t very technical and it seems unlikely that you will have a specialized data engineering team any time soon, I’d recommend going with Snowflake. The primary factor is that everything just works right out of the box. No major configurations or steep learning curve to be up and running in no time. No specialists/specialist knowledge needed. For moving data in to the platform, you can use no code tools like Fivetran. Definitely consider using these tools as free trials to see how you feel about the ease of use and administration required.

nm1hxhj,"I'll comment from a Snowflake perspective on the numbered points you raised ...1. Snowflake have recently released OpenFlow but it has a limited number of connectors, so may not meet your needs. People generally use tools such as Fivetran to pull data from source systems and push it into Snowflake, or they have some process that writes source data to cloud storage where Snowflake can load it (using COPY INTO... commands)2. Straightforward to transform data using SQL (normally wrapped in a Stored Proc if you're building pipelines). A lot of people use dbt for transformations and Snowflake have recently released the ability to run dbt within Snowflake. If you really want to go down the low/no code route, have a look at [coalesce.io](http://coalesce.io)3. If your analysts can write SQL then they should be fine. You can also write/run SQL in VS Code if you want to (and probably in other tools too)4. Not sure how this differs from your point 1?5. Snowflake can probably do all this; depends on your precise requirements6. Depends on your definition of ""seamless"" but making Snowflake a datasource for PowerBI is pretty trivial7. Snowflake allows you to keep data within Snowflake or externally (Iceberg and external tables). It also separates storage and compute so you can scale the compute power you want to use for running a query independently of the data being queried, and this happens almost instantaneously. I can't imagine a scenario where Snowflake wouldn't be able to scale to your needsSnowflake documentation is pretty good, and readable, so is always a useful place to start if you want to get a better understanding of the platform in general or specific capabilities : [https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide-getting-started](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide-getting-started)",NW1969,2025-10-29 17:17:50,6,dataengineering,t3_1oj8uaq,False,

If you go with Airflow I'd recommend looking into [DAG Factory](https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/) (or creating your own), it is an open source package that abstracts the Python for the Airflow pipelines behind YAML, it is especially useful for simple and repetitive pipelines. I've also seen setups were almost all of the Airflow code was abstracted away by one or two engineers and the analysts only wrote SQL (an OSS example here is [gusty](https://github.com/pipeline-tools/gusty)). Might be a way to help the drag and drop team members to slowly start to see the beauty of code-based abstractions and pipelines, once they see that can just fill in a few values in a template instead of clicking around when adding a new source etc.Also if you ever end up hating one of the GCP tools you can still switch them out against another tool and move towards a hybrid setup later.I haven't used data transfer service/dataform before so can't speak to those vs Fivetran/dbt. Just FYI you can use dbt Core with Airflow, a great way there is Cosmos. Disclaimer: I work at Astronomer, we made Cosmos (which is OSS, so you can run it no matter how you run Airflow), adopted and maintain the DAG Factory and do managed Airflow, so I am biased towards Airflow. Though in this case I guess I just gave an assist to cloud composer which is our competitor. If you want to look into Airflow we have a lot of beginner resources like the [learn guides](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/intro-to-airflow) or [Marc Lamberti's academy course ](https://academy.astronomer.io/path/airflow-101)that are relevant no matter where you run Airflow. :)",TJaniF,2025-10-27 22:51:50,10,dataengineering,t3_1ohrt4e,False,

You get the bonus of having quality control by having your SQL (dbt models) version controlled and peer reviewed via pull requests. Also control over deployments. Your dbt code should be in a repository with a CI process that tests it and then publishes an image to Google Artifacts Registry. Cloud Run will pick up the image when Composer runs it, just use the Cloud Run Operator.Sure newer orchestration tools like Dagster and Prefect a bit sexier.

nlisgpa,"1. ClickHouse is great to run analytics on very large immutable data (super fast because of the vectorized engine, sparse index etc), I'd only use it for that and only if your data is actually very large (or you anticipate it to be in a reasonable time frame) and move the SCD and model layers into a proper OLAP db. So: raw, very large and will never change in ClickHouse, anything aggregated or that needs to be updated ever in Postgres/BQ/Snowflake etc. But honestly for a first PoC if your data isnt that big, which I assume based on the current CSV/SharePoint/PowerBI combination, you can also skip ClickHouse for now.2. Sorry no first hand experience with PowerBI+ClickHouse. From what I've heard it works fine for basic dashboards but complex joins are not fun with that combo.3. I'm biased here since I work for Astronomer so I have a lot of Airflow and only very little Prefect experience. I'd recommend spinning up a small dev environment of both and creating some mock pipelines to see which fits your needs better. For small projects it's often the case that several orchestrators can do the job and the decision is made more based on personal preference. Some tips for Airflow: * Use the Astro CLI to spin up a local dev env in containers to try it out (its free and does not need a sign up). * If you are combining Airflow with dbt you have to use [Cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos) (ok, technically you don't *have* to but it is really the best way!). It is an OSS package that lets you render dbt projects and dbt docs in the Airflow UI. * You said your ingest is pulling from REST APIs using Python: you can use the `task`decorator in Airflow to turn any Python function into an Airflow task, thats probably the fastest way. I think Prefect has a similar decorator too. So with either tool hopefully you can reuse a lot of your existing code there. * If you end up passing data between tasks that is more than just small jsons in Airflow, for example larger pandas dataframes, you'll want to store that data in a blob storage. This used to take a bit of setup but about 1.5 years ago a class was added in the Common IO provider package that is very quick to set up via env vars ([a tutorial](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/custom-xcom-backends-tutorial)). * PSA: top level code in Airflow is executed every time the file is parsed, so don't connect to your db in top level code (i.e. outside of tasks).4. If there is a good way to do SCD with ClickHouse I have not found it yet. There is [ReplacingMergeTree](https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/replacing-merge-tree), which I haven't tried myself but generally, yes, that is definitely a good reason to have the modeling layers somewhere else.",TJaniF,2025-10-26 18:51:14,2,dataengineering,t3_1ogop8w,False,

Whether or not you use that, you’ll need to match names in a way that discounts common words and prioritizes uncommon words. Most distance metrics don’t work well for this because you’ll get really high values for names that aren’t actually that close. For example, using Levenshtein distance “apple corporation” and “Snapple corporation” (different companies) are very close, but “Bernstein Partnership, LTD” and “Bernstein” (same company) are not. You can look at various text vectorization models on huggingface that should be able to account for the fact that “corporation” is basically meaningless while “Snapple” is significant. If you have enough data you may even be able to just use tf-idf.If you want you can then lay on hierarchical clustering or just use a score cutoff.Last, you’ll probably want this wrapped up with some kind of feedback mechanism so you can make a lookup table to unify known alternatives over time.

nlykida,"I've done something similar at a previous job at scale in the health tech space. I had a dataset in the hundreds of millions of rows with fields of of text for medical notes where I had to identify specific key terms related to specific medical codes (eg ""Used X medical device to do Y procedure.""). The problem is that this wasn't just for one hospital, this dataset captured 80% of hospitals in the US, and all have their unique implementation of medical records.Where to start:1. You have to understand the business logic and what a ""meaningful"" match entails. This was especially true in medicine where I had to coordinate with doctors employed by the startup.2. Create regex for each form of business logic and validate that it accurately matches data for samples. You will quickly start seeing edge cases (note them, but don't optimize for them yet).3. Create a script to apply the business logic and regex matching, then run it on a sample of data if the data is large (in my case it was the difference between running in 30s vs 3hrs). 4. Apply the script to your dataset (or sample) where you only count how many times a separate piece of regex matched with a row. You can then quickly see your coverage (ie match count greater than 0) and where your logic could be wrong (ie match count greater than 1).5. Determine what level of coverage and accuracy is needed for your stakeholders (they will always say ""as much as possible"" to which you respond with time/effort tradeoffs). Since I was in medical, it had to be high, but a lower threshold could suffice.6. Take a new sample of the data (about 1k records) and manually label them with what they should match with. Then apply your script to the sample and determine your accuracy. I often represent this as a confusion matrix (my background was data sci before eng). Id often pull in some of my colleagues to help with the labeling if we all benefit from the data asset.You now have levers for coverage and accuracy, iterate on your regex logic script until you meet the requirements of your stakeholders. Bonus, if it's a huge success, you now also have direct metrics for employee reviews/resume.Please note that this was back in 2020.

For historicals, don’t chase “active only” upstream land everything and model “active” as an attribute. In dbt, use snapshots (Type 2) with unique\_key = that surrogate and check\_cols='all'; you’ll get valid\_from/valid\_to/is\_current without depending on Oracle MVs. For incrementals from Oracle when you can’t do CDC, keep a high-watermark table in Postgres (last seen version or updated\_at), and also compute a row hash; diff by hash to catch silent changes.

You need to ensure to compare supply against demand from the same points of time to get a meaningful comparison. The point of my question is a little more high level though. In complicated situations are there established best practices for adding quality specific meta data to add explainability to complex metrics?",rotr0102,2025-10-24 17:53:08,1,dataengineering,t1_nl62tm3,True,

nlbnniw,"Thank you! Looking briefly at this post, it does seem to touch on what I’m asking. The post calls it a “monster query”, which is accurate. A composite metric fact table is just that - rather than a period snapshot, or transactional fact (or other) it’s literally taking data (facts) from many adjacent places and smashing them together - in my case to create “supply vs. demand” - adjacent facts include production actuals, production schedules, inventory (on hand, consignment, with vendor, in transient, etc), stock received from 3rd parties, projected sales, actual sales, goods issued, etc. There is like >17 datasets that comprise the formula for “supply vs. demand”, and each data set is multiple ETL jobs / facts broken out by different companies / regions of the world (in a large multinational). Hence, you can see my concern about potential challenges about different points of time due to unexpected failed or delayed ETL jobs, and ensuring to write an artifact to the fact for data quality purposes. I don’t need to expose this to my end uses (who are restricted to views on top of my table) but I would put in in the physical table for quality/explainability. Also, I’m only concerned with the explainability part now (best practice design). Obviously, the more important part is the proactive portion of who you programmatically ensure all combined data is from the same point of time. For example, you can break the metric up into regions of the world (NA, EMEA, APAC) to ensure it’s computed relevant to their time zones, you can adjust your “subqueries” to enforce timeboxes, or time travel / time restrictions to ensure they are all consistent, or you might do some sort of staging tables that can be “frozen” (for example frequent loading upstream but frozen into daily buckets, etc.). I’m sure there are a few good options.Again, I’m starting with “hey they this is very complicated since ETL doesn’t always work as intended and error free” so how do I assure quality given the many challenges. Thanks again - it’s is a great link, very helpful and exactly what i was asking for.Edit: the blog post called out something I forgot to mention that’s pretty critical. The subsets of data are all aggregated, so what’s included/missing from the aggregation is very important. For example, if we are calculating MetricValue = Inventory on hand [region | material | day] - goods issue [region | material | day ] + projected sales [ region | material | calendar day] —> and each of these are very volatile. The different businesses in different regions of the world will change their sales forecasts through out the day (especially as we near quarter/year end, or other business target dates), inventory changes drastically, and goods issue (reduction of inventory) is very dynamic. So, if I’m after a daily level, as in what’s my EMEA inventory for material 111 on 10/23/25, this value could be very different if my subquery executes at 1am vs. 4am vs. 7am. Where as in a transactional fact table, i would simply be adding rows (ie: additional sales invoices to a sales fact table) and the differences are easily understood - I’m summarizing inventory per day, so the differences in values due to timing are a mystery. I like that the blog post is pointing this out as a challenge in the “monster query” which aggregates results into a “common grain” (which is exactly what I’m doing here).",rotr0102,2025-10-25 15:27:12,2,dataengineering,t1_nl9swgv,True,
nmamuo2,"Assuming the data is a time series and query range is unpredictable a single shard with more replicas would be best. The query workload will be distributed over the replicas and all nodes have all the data to handle any query, so you can achieve maximum distribution/parallelism. But note that a single node performs better with double the resources compared to adding another node to the cluster with these resources.If you partition data over multiple shards distributed over nodes you'll have less parallelism but might perform better on specific queries or when running many queries at the same time. But a query that requires data from a single shard cannot be executed on a node that doesn't have that shard or a replica of it.Bottom line: adding nodes and replicas will improve query performance linearly due to query distribution. For sharding you'll need a more complicated strategy. But if you're ingesting terabytes of data and already know your workload it's almost certainly a good idea to develop a sharding strategy, even if you'd have all shards on the same node or when every node has replicas of any data not in its own shard.And finally for a few terabytes of data on a cluster of 2 nodes with 32 cores and 64GB seems sufficient. If it's all one data stream I'd rather upgrade my server RAM and cores if possible than adding nodes.

All you know is that you're getting an object that implements the `MyServiceClient` interface. It could have been made by half a dozen different implementations of that interface, or it could even be a mock object created in a unit test. You treat all of them the same way and don't care where they were constructed.If you think there's something wrong with the way the object is being constructed, looking in the code that is having it injected is the wrong way to inspect it.

If it was that good, every other language would be copying the patterns. Instead, what we see is Java trying to copy other languages while maintaining backwards compatibility, which naturally makes the language harder than needed. See the ""wonders"" of how string interpolation is stuck with a kind of nasty format, because all the more reasonable ones were used in other libraries first, and they didn't want to break backwards compatibility. See the streaming api, less comfortable than the equivalent in every language with monadic collection operations. The Option class that has no nullability guarantees, so it's not reliable, And since 95% of all Java for services is written in Spring, the annotation salad is what we've got.So yeah, your best bet is to cope via heavy IDEs that do all the work and will track usages, including knowing the autowiring logic.",hibikir_40k,2025-10-24 14:31:27,25,learnprogramming,t3_1oey2jw,False,

The hardest part is learning that when you write `int weeks = days / 7;` on line 14, and then change the number of `days` on line 20, the value of `weeks` doesn't change along with it. But you get used to it, and learn to read code.Then comes **procedural** code, with loops and functions/methods (we ignore the objects at first), and it gets a bit harder to understand that the loop does the same thing over and over, but with the values changing - so now changing a value on line 20 **DOES** impact the calculation on line 14, if they are inside the same loop. Or a function behaves differently from time to time, because it depends on a global variable, whose value might have changed since the last call ...Then you move into **object oriented** code, where objects ask each other to do stuff - but it still mostly reads like procedural code, where a single thread of execution goes through methods living in different objects - you get used to having to jump around in different files, but most of the time you can still follow along. The hardest part is knowing when the objects are instantiated, and who ""owns"" the reference to them - but other than that you begin to abstract away the actual program flow, unless you really need it.But you begin using frameworks, and suddenly you don't see all the code - you have objects that extend existing objects, who then call methods in your object. You don't know exactly when or why your own methods are called, you just get CVS-receipt-length style stack-dumps when something fails, and you sit ""outside"" the code, looking in, trying to understand what might be happening around your own code - mostly you are guessing or using information from other people also guessing.It becomes very hard to follow, even for experienced programmersAnd then you move to Spring, which is **aspect oriented** programming, where you don't even write, nor see all the code, but only add annotations and interfaces, and then some magic entity behind the curtain reads your code, and changes it! Sometimes before compiling, sometimes after! And you have no idea how your code is being used, who uses it, what for, or when. You just hand code to the monster, and it does something - now it is literally impossible to follow what is going on, and you need to know what the platform does, what the framework does, how it uses your classes and methods, and why it uses them in the way it does ... And you either have to read through 35 years of accumulated specifications, or watch days of indian youtubers explain it, still somewhat on the surface-level ...So to answer your question, **yes**!

You're probably ahead of me in skill and prospects. **Work on skills related to finding a job:**Set a block of time, every day after work, for applying and upskilling. No exceptions, even if it's as little as 30min for one and 30min for the other. Every time you feel like you're not skilled enough (which may be true), remember that people less skilled than us ARE getting jobs.Figure out why. Are they applying in novel ways? Do they have really good interviewing skills? Are they personable? Did they do x, y, and z? Improve yourself based on your findings. There are A LOT of unique ways to get hired while being less skilled. At the very least, you can improve your interviewing skills by failing at them and learning what to learn. Don't be afraid to look for more technical, but still retail-adjacent/low-level roles as a start. Don't allow yourself to settle for this either - keep searching and improving your process. I'd also try doing Neetcode 150 as well. Spend 15-30minutes failing on one question, watch the solution to the video, and then learn why the solution works (you can use AI as a mentor, not a solution solver). Rinse-repeat. Don't worry about ""not knowing the answers."" Even experienced developers struggle on optimizing Easy's.So, 30 minutes of self-study, 30min of applying (even ""knowing"" you'll fail), and a bit of LC-style learning when you're bored. .**Work on your technical skills:**There are just as many paths forward in this as there is on the above. My advice as a beginner? Figure out what domains you liked during your studies, research what it takes to get into them, and then follow an online roadmap learning those resources. Don't have a preferred domain?Then either read some books related to learning how to program, ones that are heavy on coding along and building things, follow a bootcamp, or go straight into ""github project-based learning"" repo and start building with your preferred languages. Focus on your preferred languages and up your skills.I recommend that path the most.At the end of the day, school primed us to be very good at intaking new information and thinking like a computer, so now you have to learn how to be a craftsmen, building new projects and applying your theory. Too overwhelming? The Odin Project is a free online boot camp that will essentially take you from 0 to the very minimum skills of a junior full-stack developer. You'll learn how to research, use version control, and build projects. This will solidify your programming foundation, especially if you go a layer or two deep when using the additional resources/reading books.Don't forget to keep applying. When you're done with Foundations, you're not going to be ""cracked out junior"" level, but you'll be ""meh, *maybe* I can teach him the rest"" level. If you haven't been applying due to being an imposter, you want a job or what? At least start at this point. The more you improve at learning to program, the workflow for it, the rigor it takes, etc, the better you can pivot to other domains of programming.

The forwarding can happen through HTTP calls, but in modern data centers you may also encounter request forwarding through other protocols that are more suited like gRPC. Reverse proxy servers can also handle load balancing, i.e. if the same application is deployed multiple times behind the reverse proxy the reverse proxy can choose the application with the lowest load as the forward target so that no server becomes overly burdened.Reverse proxy servers can perform so called ""TLS termination"", where the reverse proxy handles the TLS handshake (and is aware of the TLS private keys that are used to prove service authenticity). This effectively strips the TLS functionality from the requests so that an application can focus purely on providing functionality, while the secure connection responsibility remains with the reverse proxy. However it is also possible (and encouraged) to encrypt a HTTP / gRPC connection that gets established within a data-center from the reverse proxy to the application server with TLS.

nm34buk,"> So I decided to build something, and http server in c++This is an excellent exercise and perfect for your academic level.> I know nothing about network programming, sockets or even portsYou don't need to know shit about any of this.HTTP is a text protocol. That makes it REAL simple... And - as it happens, standard streams are text streams. It's a marriage like it was meant to be.This means you implement the HTTP protocol: namespace methods { class GET; class POST; class PUT; class PATCH; class DELETE; class HEAD; class OPTIONS; class CONNECT; class TRACE; using method = std::variant; }I'll let you fill those out in detail, but I'm going to still jump around to get to my point.Next you need a request and a response type: namespace messages { class request: method { /* an incoming request is implemented in terms of one of the HTTP methods */}; class response; }Now here's where we're REALLY going to build on some of the magic: class request { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, request &); }; class response { friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &, const response &); };Barring the rest of the class details, you need these functions. Now when it comes to the request, you'll start parsing the incoming text stream until you get the HTTP method, and then you know which method type above to instantiate. Then your method types implement their own stream extractors, and THEY extract their own bits. So understand that transport protocols tend to have enumerations - whether they're numbers or text tags, doesn't matter. We don't need a data field to store the method, we can translate that into a C++ User Defined Type. The enumeration of all the methods? That's implied by our type instance stored in the variant. That's you enumeration! We've enumerated the method types with actual types!I'm droning on about that because you wouldn't believe how much code I end up seeing where people read data out of a source and plug it right into a runtime data field. Wholly unnecessary and missing the point.But this means that all your IO is over text, and it's over streams, and your types work with ANY stream, including... `std::cin` and `std::cout`.See, you don't have to know shit about networking because you don't have to write any of it. C++ is a systems software language, you're expected to make systems of software, not these gigantic monoliths. The desktop and the GUI is not the operating system, an operating system is a system of software FOR YOU - THE ENGINEER. You make this one part that can extract and then insert HTTP, and then you can combine it with other software to do the networking and the encryption. > nc -l 8080 -c your_serverSo now when a request comes in on port 8080, an instance of your program will launch, and all TCP IO will be redirected through `std::cin` and `std::cout`. Your program doesn't know, doesn't care.You want that shit encrypted? > nc -l 8080 -c 'stunnel | your_server'It's a bit more than that, but it's the basic premise. It's why unencrypted HTTP is default port 80 and encrypted HTTPS is default port 443.As for servicing the request, you've got a variant, which means your handler is a visitor, and of course you can make a visitor that can dispatch to different handlers for each type. You can initially make a catchall visitor that always returns a 501 - not implemented. If you can hit your server with your browser and get a 501, that's not nothing, that's something - proof that your server actually worked and talked HTTP with your browser. Remember, a response is going to be in text!So now all you have to do is read the HTTP standard and figure out the nature of the protocol. Are fields fixed or floating? That is to say, are they order and formatting specific, or can fields be anywhere in the message payload? Which ones are optional and which are mandatory? You know - I'll give you another hint, that URL and RESTful resources LOOK like a file path for a very good reason... You can also deliver binary payloads, but I'll let you figure that one out, and it's also common to base64 encode content because it turns binary into text to get past some of the text fuckery that is assumed by the protocol and implementation, like how line feeds and carriage returns get mangled.Continued...",mredding,2025-10-29 21:53:21,8,learnprogramming,t3_1oj1nr8,False,

nlyrgzo,"Let's take the square root example.If your function is just calling sqrt(x) and returning, then no that'd be silly to unit test - but then again why would you have such a function in the first place?Let's say the function is actually computing the square root using Newton's Method. Then wouldn't you want to test that it works? You could easily have a bug in your code. What if it works most of the time but fails for small numbers? What if it crashes if you give it a negative number?Unit tests can be useful for this sort of thing - trying a wide range of inputs to a function to ensure it works correctly.As far as where to put them, the standard practice is to make them part of the same repository and to make an easy way to run all of your tests. The idea is that every time you change your code, you run all of your tests and make sure you didn't break anything.So that brings up the second value of unit tests - they catch future problems. Suppose you want to speed up your code by using SIMD instructions to speed up math. You could rewrite your square root function and then re-run the unit tests to make sure it still gives the correct answer.There's no rule for how many tests you need, but one goal that a lot of people strive for is to cover every line of code with at least one test. So if your function has an ""if"" statement in it at the top level, you'd need at a minimum two tests to cover it - one test that covers the true branch, and one test that covers the false branch.There are tools that will run your tests and tell you exactly which lines were and weren't covered by tests.Finally, as to what to test, unit tests are generally for testing individual functions. A good rule of thumb is to test all of the public interface of any class. So if there are some helper functions inside of a file that can't be called from anywhere else, you don't have to test those, but you should test whatever public functions or methods other parts of your code might be able to call.Testing systems is also a good idea, but then they're not called unit tests, they're called something else, like integration tests. They tend to have different tradeoffs, like they're usually slower so you can't have as many of them, and you might care more about the tests being robust than them being comprehensive.",dmazzoni,2025-10-29 06:24:32,72,learnprogramming,t3_1oiwnd1,False,

If you replace your logging provider 3 years from now, you may forget about the log message until it breaks. Unit tests help catch that, if you have a test ensuring a log message is written properly. All of the following questions could be behavior you want to test so a) you know it’s working as designed, and b) you know it continues to work every time you run the tests.- depending on how strict the type system is for your language, what happens when the user enters “fish” or the string “42”, rather than the number 42?- What if the user provides a negative number - how do you want to handle that? Do you check the input before the calculation and exit gracefully? Or attempt it anyway?- Do you support the imaginary portion, or do you throw an exception? - What exception do you throw, and what is the message?- you may want to know if the input was abnormal or caused an error, do you have logging? You can unit test that a log message was emitted. - what happens when you provide 0? Or the largest input number?

nlz8mnu,"Lot's of good answers on the technical implementation but I think some things were left unanswered.1. How many people are working on the code2. What is the domainIf you are working on your own you can think more greedily about your own productivity. For example, only create tests when you start developing something and you know it's going to be annoying to test manually (like someone mentioned, a reimplementation of calculating a square root). Another good point to write some tests is before a big refactor.Once there are more people working on the project it makes sense to add tests to provide some stability to the project. Most contributors are not able to test a project comprehensively, often code lacks the proper data to test the program, and tests can provide that. In general, a small team of experienced developers can work with less tests, only adding tests were it truly makes development easier. Once you go into bigger organizations or open source you will need more tests, because there is going to be people whose main task is to review and merge code and their life is made so much easier with tests.Second, what is the project? I've seen application UI code has usually less tests because a lot of the output is visual. Sure there are some methods like monitoring visuals changes, or component libraries where you can click though individual components. Something as simple as just checking all components render can be a good enough test. But in general the passing test for UI is that it looks good and is usable, and that needs more often than not some manual testing anyway.Data processing oriented code, infrastructure code, and code that has difficult inputs or outputs on the other hand rely more on tests. Like how are you ""manually"" going to test that some data objects coming through your kafka stream are processed correctly so they can be sent to the database? The whole premise just asks for some kind of programmatical test.While 100% code coverage can be good, it is not the ultimate milestone. You can have 100% code coverage but still you are not handling some cases correctly and have bugs in your code.",Independent-Fig6042,2025-10-29 09:21:40,6,learnprogramming,t3_1oiwnd1,False,

nlyri37,">For example if you have a function that calculates the square root of a number, it's quite easy to unit test. But is that really necessary?Well you know its supposed to calculate the square root of a number, someone else might see the function and think it just devides by 3 because they put in 9 and 3 came out but now they put in 16 and it doesnt work so they ""fix"" the function so it devides by 3. Ofcourse this a rediculous example but in the real world even a lot of short and easy to write functions dont have a super obvious expected output and sometimes multiple outputs are equally possible but you this case needs one and another case needs another output. So you write a unittest to make sure if someone changes the function to fit their usecase they see that something else now is broken.>What about functions and classes that are simple to understand/debug/modify? Should unit tests only be done for more complex code/frequently modified code?Well again simple to understand/debug/modify code doesnt equal just one possible expected output.>And if something needs unit tests how many should I do? Should I try to cover all the edge cases? Or just the common ones that are easy to break.Thats something each dev or each team needs to decide on their own and depends on the projekt. Think about what happens if that piece of code fails and how likely it is to fail. If the code fails and people die you wanna absolutly test as much as you can. If you are using that code to turn on an LED on a personal project well no cares if it fails. For me personaly on the current project the goal is to have atleast a unittest so that every piece of code is atleast called once. So if you have an if somewhere in there (that depends on the input) you need two write two unittests so that both sides are called. >Finally, what scope should unit tests be? It's probably not a good idea to make unit tests for each function, but what about per class? Should it be done per system instead?Per function is absolutly a viable option. if you know each function gives the expected output and your code is deterministic (which it should be) your code should pretty much never fail.

When you merge, either you'll get a clean merge, or you'll get merge conflicts that need to be resolved.The key thing is that any new changes from the base branch may or may not matter for your feature development in that 4 day period. It depends. A major factor there is how orthogonal the team members are to one another. If people are working on completely different things that don't affect the other, then you could potentially defer merging the base branch into your feature branch until your feature branch is done, especially if it's pretty short-lived.Sometimes, you'll encounter merge conflicts when you attempt to merge the base branch into yours. Depending on what they are, I usually prefer to reconcile those sooner than later, just to not have that looming over my head, but even so, you could potentially hold off if they're not critical and don't affect how you develop the feature.In some cases though, even non-conflicting changes can be problematic, either in the sense that the code is no longer working (a semantic conflict, rather than a textual conflict), or they could just muck up your build in some way and force you to have to rebuild. In either case, if it doesn't affect how I'd build the feature, then I tend to defer merging until my feature is done, unless there's some good reason I should merge sooner.All that said, it's a judgment call, and ultimately you'll want to ensure that in the end you're merging quality work to the main branch that is well tested against the main branch's latest changes.",SoSpongyAndBruised,2025-10-25 23:56:57,1,learnprogramming,t3_1og2npt,False,
nled6zh,"We never push to master at work, and you shouldn't either.Sure, you can uncommit and cherry pick to fix it. But you should be committing and pushing often, and you don't want to push something incomplete into master.A minor change having a dozen pushes is perfectly fine. But if you always plush to master, and you've done work since you realized that feature you added broke something, removing it without removing the in between work is a pain. It's also harder to go back and figure it out.We branch from master when we start on a new major update. These usually are usually a very big deal - features being added. We don't merge a major into master until we end support - master holds the oldest version we support.When we patch, we branch off the major branch into a patch branch. So most of the time there will be master, major, and patch. There can be two major branches, though it's not common. When we release a patch we merge it into the major, so that doesn't get cluttered.When a developer starts working in something, they branch from, usually, the patch branch. When they're happy they submit a pull request so someone else can review it, then merge once approved.This makes it very easy to keep things organized. If you need to pause work on one incomplete task, you can just swich branches, do what you need to, switch back and, if needed, rebase to bring in the thing you stopped to work on.And commit often.

DOM has a box model that doesn't allow you to simply drag/drop a button anywhere. The only way to do that is to position it with absolute. You wouldn't do that because it breaks responsiveness with different view-ports. Instead you would work with padding, margins, grid layouts etc to get the desired effect - but the wysiwyg cannot show that. It can only hint at that.This in turn usually leads to people who're used only to the wysiwyg editor to forget about the underlying structure. There's plenty of precedent for that. LaTeX for example is about code representing structured text and styles to render headlines differently than normal text, Microsoft Word simply allows you to make text large and bold to emulate a heading. But the loss of structure also means you can't do the other stuff LaTeX can do like creating content listings and reducing page breaks immediately after headings. Designers who create mockups in Figma _can_ do really great work, or they can simply slap some shapes there and call it a day. But since the code will be the truth eventually, someone has to translate those shapes into the structure anyway.Lastly, the people who work with code all day have a different problem than the people who rely mainly on wysiwyg editors. Graphical user interfaces are about discoverability of features and a quick preview of the final product. Material pipelines in Blender for example work very well as boxes connected with wires. Code has about information density, and is easier to work with. No graphical tool can fit as much information on a screen as well written text. Copy and pasting text works between tons of editors, but copy and pasting graphical elements only works in the same tool. You can check text into version control and get diffs or even move detection, that doesn't work for graphical elements unless it compiles to text first.",aanzeijar,2025-10-28 10:33:19,2,learnprogramming,t3_1oi54ny,False,

You're not learning how to USE the language, and they're not teaching you problem solving skills. Your programming classes give you some context for your other classes - computation theory, DSA, applied mathematics... It also gives you some exposure - this is the job, staring at a screen, walls of text, arbitrary decisions, bastard bugs. Is this something you want to do all day, every day, for the next 45 years?When you graduate, your education didn't finish, it only just begun. You don't pop out an expert. The end of college is only the beginning of the rest of your life. WE KNOW you don't know shit. THAT is why we hire junior developers - not because you're cheap, not because we couldn't afford a senior, but because juniors tend to multiply the force of a senior, because we can mold you into what you need to be successful here.I'll bet when you're done with this semester you couldn't actually tell me what OOP even is or adequately demonstrate it. It's not a judgement on you - all programming and college courses are saturated with dogmas and traditions. They call it an OOP course but don't actually teach it, typically because your professors don't actually know, either.So when you graduate, your programming experience isn't terribly relevant. C++, Python... What I need to know is how you think, if you can learn and adapt. Can I mold you into the person I need here to solve our problems? Ostensibly, the answer is ""yes"", so the major difference between you and another candidate is not what you ""know"", but the aptitude you both demonstrate. Obviously I'm going to hire the one with the greater potential, insofar as my hiring process can deduce. We don't have great tools for this - your GPA is SOMETHING but only tells a particular kind of story. It can mean you can learn a lot and make connections, or it can mean you can memorize the material long enough to ace a test. So GPA alone isn't enough. Your personality also counts for something - can I see myself working with you for the next 5 years? Are you going to mesh well with the personality of the team? You don't have to be smarter than the other guy to be the better fit.Once you get hired here, we'll teach you what you need to know to be successful. So don't sweat it. If you're hired, it means you're good enough, you've got the right stuff, and that we want to build you up and see you succeed. We know that's going to take time.Watch out for puppy mills - places that want junior graduates to also paradoxically have 3-5 years experience. That's not junior, that's not entry level. Also, if a company doesn't hire you - they're doing you a favor. Often it's because it's not a good fit - and that there is a TWO-WAY street. You DO NOT want to work for a place you don't fit in, that kind of misery WILL take years off your life.So focus on your fundamentals, your problem solving skills, and your joy of the craft. A good GPA won't hurt, either. Very quickly, the programming language fades away, and becomes a tool, a means to an end - you won't even see the code anymore.

Maybe version 10 either completely removes theOldWay. You could go through your code and replace all calls to theOldWay with theNewWay, while still in version 9, before introducing any other changesOr, maybe you have some other dependencies that you know won't be compatible with React 18, so first you update those dependencies to the latest version one at a time, before updating React itself",help-me-vibe-code,2025-10-30 12:48:54,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ojukgn,False,

nm8w5ca,"You start by having a very good test suite at all levels (unit, functional, integration, e2e).Then you decide where you want to land with the refactor, and you plot out step by step how you're going to get there. The bigger the steps, the more likely it is to fail, so ideally you have a CI/CD approach where you can just make small commits and daily pushes and slowly things switch over.Then you execute.Sometimes this approach doesn't work because you're building a whole new stack with different tech. In that case, you build the new stack bit by bit and slowly transition calls over. For example, you might start by implementing one use case on the new stack, then divert calls for some test users to it. If everything looks good, then you can start bringing over more traffic and slowly increase the load on the new stack until that use case is fully moved. Then you add another use case, rinse, repeat until done.You also want to have a good experiment / feature framework for this. This is where you can create flags in the code that can be updated live on the running system (which are usually just booleans like `ENABLE_X_THING` but can be anything). Then in your code you introduce the feature flag to divert calls to the new stack: if (ENABLE_X_THING) { return // result from new stack } return // result from existing codeTypically in these feature frameworks, the state of the flags is attached to the individual requests, it's not a system-wide thing. This lets you turn it on and off for individual end users, or only for a sampling of requests across users, or whatever you want to do. It also allows you to selectively enable the feature in test envs so you can keep the old tests running on the old code path and add new tests for the new code path.So now you deploy it, add the new code with tests, and if everything looks good now you can start playing with it in prod to do manual testing, enable e2e tests with test user accounts, etc. Then you start rolling it out to actual users and if anything starts going wrong, you can always just flip the flag and shut it off.After you've moved everyone over and it's fully deployed for a few weeks and everything looks good, you can go in and remove the old code path. Once that's fully deployed, the feature flag now no longer controls anything so you can remove it from the feature flag framework as well and you've moved this use case over.",severoon,2025-10-30 19:32:09,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ojukgn,False,

The key to learning DSA, in my opinion, is not just how to write an algorithm it in a programing language, but understanding the underlying concept. So, if you know how a hash table works, if you know how to explain binary search in detail, if you can visualize the call stack when doing recursive binary search or merge sort, then I think you're good to go and you shouldn't worry if you forget syntax. If you forget the underlying concept, then I think you should just try to practice more by yourself and force yourself to think. So, if you get an exercise that says ""sort this array using bubble sort"", then instead of just using the memorized bubble sort implementation that you have in your head and then going to your code editor, instead open up a notion document or a google docs and write pseudocode or go to excalidraw and draw some diagrams to visualize bubble sort with 0 code so that you can make sure that before you implement it in your programming language of choice that you actually understand the concept and you're not just using the memorized implementation of bubble sort that you saw in a course.

nlskwrd,"I'll just echo what others have said. If you already know the basics of writing code, find a problem you think is small enough that you can complete it, and then do it. I would strongly advice to NOT find random tutorials, walkthroughs etc. to help you with this. The main skills you want to accomplish solving these problems goes (IMO) something like this:1. Creative thinking: How should I even tackle this problem? When I think of ""create a program that does X, Y, Z"" - which subproblems does X, Y and Z actually consist of. This is a skill that you cannot really read your way towards, you have to DO it. If you find yourself stuck it is of course alright to look for solutions to subproblems, but again I would avoid copy/pasting code, look for general ideas you can apply to the problem solving at hand. 2. Just experience writing and debugging code. This is another area where reading the answers just don't help. You need to learn the error messages of whatever tool you're using and how they relate to problems in your code. This is probably the most frustrating part of all of this, as sometimes it can take hours only to realise it was some small silly thing that was wrong. But just to give an example of what I think about here (I don't know if this is still the case or not), but back in the day whenever reading error messages, regarding syntax, from PHP, usually the error was on the line above the one mentioned in the error message. Figuring out stuff like this, finding shortcuts for yourself in how to debug your code and general issues will enable you to write code for yourself. 3. You need some experience designing systems, as you become more and more skilled your systems will become bigger and probably more complex - and likely also more messy. I cannot remember how many years I wrote code before I was able to look back at code from just a year prior without thinking it was total crap. Nobody expects a junior to create beautiful architectured code, but you need to have experienced this epiphany of ""I wrote this, and it's trash, I should have done so and so"".Of course reading about code, be it design patterns, or something else entirely is also good. But you need to ensure that actually writing, debugging, testing code is the main part of what you spend your time on. I would suggest only reading for an explicit aim in solving something you are currently working on for the foreseeable future. It is very easy to fall into the trap of reading instead of doing and then thinking that you're becoming better book by book.

I say in your area because it does drastically change depending on when you live!

Why? I mean, microservices CAN be great, but they always increase complexity, both to develop and to deploy. If you can't give enough good reasons as to why you need microservices, a monolith might be better. 3. I don't know what you mean by ""completely""? It is probably not necessary to learn postgresql ""completely"" (that would take a loooong time), because in all seriousness: your app will most likely not need 100% of all possible performance out of your database. Even if everything you write is 10x slower than possible, it will still be more than fast enough in reality. 4. Monolith is simpler, Microservices scale differently and can do a clean separation of concerns. Monolith should be your default!5. afaik you can just deploy docker images to kubernetes, no? My understanding is, that kubernetes is just a more fancy way of managing deployed images, and stuff, but I am not very experienced in deployment. 6. Again, why do you need this? Ci/Cd sounds good on paper, but especially the CD part adds a lot of complexity to your deployment phase. If you can't articulate, why, default to a normal, manual deployment whenever you think a release is ready. 7. Cloud is just an invisible server. You can get a VPS for very cheap, which doesn't run the risk of increasing your cloud bill into the stratosphere, if you use too many CPU cycles. Start there. As with CI/CD and Kubernetes, this is really not a developer issue. It's a deployment and DevOps issue. At small scales, you can do it yourself, but you really don't need a lot of complexity, and when you are working at a company, there will be a separate position for this. 8. This is legitimately the most important point on your list for a developer, and there is no single correct answer. As with all design decisions, there are a lot of possible tradeoffs. While I don't have a good book for that handy, I would suggest reading up on your favourite API Design (REST for example), because much ink has probably been spilled about that topic. Also: experience. Just build some APIs and see what works, and what gives you more issues in the long run, when you try to refactor a new feature for example. 9. So, this is complicated: Most backend system have a proper event system / observer pattern thing going, like flask or axum both have pretty good signals internally. As long as you build a monolith, this is really good and should definitaly be used. Kafka is just a way to send signals over multiple microservices, which CAN be useful, or it can just add more unnecessary complexity! As with everything else that adds complexity, start with the assumption, that you should not use kafka, unless you can articulate why you need it!",Beregolas,2025-10-28 12:41:22,7,learnprogramming,t3_1oi7s46,False,
nlthk4u,"To your last point: No one expects you to have a good overview over what you are working on from the start, because that is really what separates junior devs from normal devs and from senios devs: The overview. Knowing everyting else is just a bonus, but I can look up how certain commands work, or how I send a message over kafka: I don't need to know this by heart to be a senior!The way to learn this is probably just practice. You can practice by coding, and by doing stuff, that helps you switch abstraction levels (which you can also learn best by coding imo). The important thing is: no one can have an accurate mental model of 10k lines of code, and that is pretty tame as far as big codebases go. In the last corporate project I worked on, we had 3 main (and several smaller) microservices with about 30k-60k loc each. So instead of memorizing files, I learned the structure of the project. When I was asked, where to find a feature, I could then think through it logically. This only works, if your project is internally consistent, so if you have every piece of code placed correctly. For example, we had all models in a folder, all endpoints in a folder, with subfolders for very large collections of endpoints, all validation code was together, all signals where in a single folder, and so on. At that point, it's just like following a map: ""Okay, you want to know about the bookmarking function for an article. Let's open all models regarding bookmarks and articles, the endpoints files, the signals and start looking if we can find what we are looking for anywhere in there.""",Beregolas,2025-10-28 12:41:26,2,learnprogramming,t1_nlthjqi,False,

nlp01w4,"So, backend and frontend are pretty different skills: You have started dipping your toes into frontend, which is mostly declarative: You tell the computer HOW things should BE, and you will need to learn a little JavaScript for better interactivity, which is imperative: It tells the computer WHAT to DO, if something happens (a button is pressed for exmaple). This is connected to the fact, that the frontend is very visual. The backend works on data: You get a request, you react to that request ba returning data of some kind, often after running multiple layers of checks (authentication, authorization) and fetching data from a database. You might like both, but I would still suggest that you stay with frontend for a while, at least until you are pretty well rounded there. Afterwards you can try backend and decide, if you want to pursue both (fullstack) or even switch over to backend.

This code ""unwinds the stack"", one stack frame at a time, until it finds a corresponding handler. It only terminates the thread/program if it **doesn't** find a handler.

To simplify: language exceptions are things thrown within the language by language statements, machine exceptions are things like ""divide by zero"" which are generated by the processor.There's then two additional pieces of machinery:- when a machine exception happens, the OS can pass it to the process to handle. On Unix this is done with signals. If there is no handler, the process will crash. - But if there is a handler, it can convert a machine exception into a language exception, which can then be caught. This happens in most managed languages - Python, Java, C# etc.C and C++ generally do not provide such handlers.

But if it is an exception, it breaks out of the try-block, and jumps straight to the catch-block. Kind of like you can `break` out of a while-loop.I like to think of the try-catch like an if-else, where the try-block is like: ""if everything goes well"", and the catch-block is like ""else do this"" - with the crazy change that you can break out of the ""if"" and jump into the ""else"", unlike normal program flow.I know that these comparisons aren't correct - but they do help me understand how to write the code, and what to expect to happen.

nm82gev,"The API is how programs make requests to each other. You usually don’t want to expose your program’s internal logic to outside sources, that’s just asking for trouble, so instead you define an API that lets outside sources make requests to your program with predefined parameters about what they can ask for, what data you need from them, and what they should expect to get back in response, and then you build a function in your program to parse and handle the request.Likely the most common implementation of this pattern is Rest API that allows your front-end web service to communicate with your back-end code. An analogy I like to use is ordering food at a restaurant: imagine if you went to a restaurant where there was no waiter, no menus, just a chef in the back kitchen. To order your food, you just yell whatever recipe you want to eat at the chef. If he knows how to make it, he will, although it might not be exactly what you asked for because you couldn’t see a menu to know that their version of grilled salmon comes with Broccoli while you were expecting asparagus, because nothing was there to tell you so, and you aren’t allowed to go poking around in the kitchen. And, if you ask for something not on the menu, the chef sends you back an empty plate. If you ask for something REALLY not on the menu, the entire kitchen might catch on fire. That is your code with no API, where the front end is allowed to just make requests to public methods in the back end.With an API, you have a more standard restaurant. The waiter (API client) comes out and hands the customer (user / front end) a menu (API schema). The customer now knows what is available to order, and what they should expect to get back once they place that order. If the customer asks for something not on the menu, the waiter can tell them “no” before that request ever makes it to the chef. And the chef, instead of waiting around trying to listen to 500 customers all screaming nonsense from the dining room and trying to pick up orders, can instead just rely on the waiter to carry valid requests back to him as a single point of contact. The chef also just needs to hand the prepared food back to the waiter and let the waiter take care of interacting with customers, instead of having to sprint out of the kitchen to drop food off and then rush back to handle the next request. And finally, say something changes in the kitchen — they run out of paprika and need to substitute chili powder, for example. Now, instead of the customer having to *know* that the chef is actually using chili powder and, if they order a dish with paprika, the whole order gets thrown out… they can just order off the menu like normal, and the chef is responsible for knowing “menu item #17 uses chili powder now instead of paprika”, make the dish, and send it back out. The customer doesn’t have to *care* exactly what spices are being used, just that they wanted a dish, had a standardized and codified way to ask for that dish, and then whatever happens between the waiter and the kitchen is a black box, but results in the dish being served to them.",INTstictual,2025-10-30 17:11:01,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oi1y99,False,

People don't really want to talk about it, but there have always been a tremendous amount of people in the industry who did very little. At least that's how it has been since I started in 2007.The reason why it used to be like that is because you used to be able to predict revenue growth by adding warm bodies and new projects, but now that tech (particularly the web) in a lot of ways matured its a lot harder to increase profits in this way. There are far fewer obvious ideas not being done out there that you can make bank on by doing. Thus the incentive has become cutting through the layers of fat and excess in engineering orgs.Going forward I see tech as being far leaner than it has been and more focused being placed on building high-performance teams that are spearheaded by high-impact individual contributors. Whenever those teams yield significant results you'll probably see them hiring reliable warm bodies again to maintain and extend what they've built. Even with lower interest rates I don't really see this dynamic changing much. Because back in the day you could just mill out CRUD apps and rake in cash but that game is tapped out.With that being said the experienced engineers who aren't finding jobs are the ones that never really applied themselves to achieve significant things for the organizations they worked for.

At the end I was leading teams of 20 SWEs on multi-year cross functional projects making 110K.People will ask, why didn't you leave? The answer was I was never good enough to find another job when I decided to start looking.

Lots of things I know tech companies do this company had no interest in doing.I even worked in my free time to develop a prototype of how something like Jenkins could help by running automated tests nightly. When management found out they literally told me ""if you want to work extra on the weekends work on project priorities or don't work on anything at all."" The issue was management didn't care about things I was trying to solve.They were content with the speed of development, which was slow. They were content with how automated testing were run at the whim of people who owned the tests and sometimes issues would be found late in to the process. They were content with all the tech debt, because it wasn't preventing them from meeting their goals of getting FDA approval.At the end of the day they know creating an FDA approved medical device takes a long time and they were confident they could talk away any issues that did not affect patient safety. There were 100's of bugs that did not affect patient safety in the bug tracker, but fixing them was only priority when doctors or patients complained.

nlo3nrb,"I have some weird semi-related experiences to this actually.At one of my jobs, we hired a new grad who had launched a very successful app in their home country. It probably didn't help him get the initial interview, since I think that was more about the fact that we were recruiting at his school, but it definitely helped him stand out during the interview process. When we were in discussions about the new grad class, that project was mentioned often and certainly kept him above the fold. It should be noted that he had to pass the interview solely on technical merits.One side point with this is that he was extremely difficult to work with because of this. He kept mentioning how he had built an app with thousands of users so he knew what he was talking about. We were building a company at petabyte scale with millions of users, so his experience was not particularly applicable. Not saying that you're like this, but it's something to be aware of. It shows that you're a go-getter and good at figuring things out, which are important qualities of a great SWE, but a SWE role at a big company is an entirely different skill set than a successful app builder.On the other side of the coin, I was able to land my first internship through a successful project. The thing that made my experience different from yours is that our app had very few users but a ton of publicity (it was kind of a wacky idea). This helped recruiters find us. All of the members of our team landed internships by responding to social media posts about our project. I also think that the companies liked the marketing aspect of ""look at these fun young founders working for OUR company.""In short, I think having a successful project is great during an interview, but having a highly publicized project is better for getting your foot in the door.",NeitherOfEither,2025-10-27 16:04:18,12,cscareerquestions,t3_1ohffgc,False,

nlfhcby,"Unionizing is a great idea but unfortunately there are problems with this idea that in my opinion this will exacerbate the problem. First and foremost, if software devs unionize then it will give the companies a golden opportunity to push for more AI and outsourcing. Simply because the people here are complaining about work hours, pay but hey over there in this other country we can abuse the living shit out of people and our operating costs are lower.Secondly, software developer position is highly dependent on the thing/service the company is trying to make. For example, a person sitting in pakistan or india can make the same website/app that any person any american software developer can make. Moreover, these people will bend over backwards to adjust to the american demand. Thirdly, unions will demoralize and depress the high salaries one can find in tech companies. Again, for example pilots in air canada are paid bonkers and the union has to constantly fight against the corporation to hold a bargain. Fourthly, the supply of software engineers is slightly higher than the demand at the current moment. This will overall negatively impact the strength of the movement. A new grad software developer doesn't have the leverage to bargain for higher salary because of inexperience.This is however, not the end. If you want, push the law makers and politicians, collective force to lobby the government into taxing the companies which outsource or use more AI. The way I see the current problem in software industry is that, the big players want to cash in on the AI demand, the mid level companies are trying to make a product which will earn them the attention from big companies. The government is only interested in sucking rich peoples' cocks. There is nothing to stand in the way.Other commenter u/dontping mentioned some other pathways, which are viable but they demand more time and effort than the current market is willing to deploy.

If your org can just be eliminated or you can easily be replaced, and everything else will stay standing without you, then you have no job security. If you are directly driving the company's financials, no one else can run your machine, and everyone else that is important to the business likes you and will be pissed and follow you if you are fired, then you have near-infinite job security. The title means nothing. It's just about what power you have. Generally, the title of an executive is supposed to be descriptive, not prescriptive. You are VP of eng because you are the person controlling eng. You aren't controlling eng because you are VP of eng.

The pay is also good state dependent, I made about 70k year 1, year 2 I was close to 6 figures, and the next several years I was ~120-200k depending on overtime and how much I wanted to work.The negatives: you often get shit work days (weekends, nights), poor pto, work holidays, work in hazardous environments, it’s hard on your body, and you work with people who HR would have a meltdown if they heard for 5 minutes (gay jokes, teasing you, political talk, stuff some aren’t comfortable with I didn’t mind but I’ve seen several people quit a week or 2 in over it).

Don't panic they're easier than most people think. The easy level questions shoudln't be too hard, go through 20-30 of them to see what sorts of questions you'll be asked. But before moving to medium or hard, first learn DS/A. Data Structures and Algorithms is what Leetcode is there to test (not entirely, but basically). Most jobs will almost never need it, but really complex problems solved at scale (think Google Map's directions handling hundreds of millions of requests a minute) do, so Google started using these questions to test their recruits and the rest of the industry couldn't be bothered to make their own interviews, so now we all have to answer them. This youtube channel has some great lessons on how DSA/Leetcode all works:https://www.youtube.com/@mycodeschoolThey don't cover every element of DSA but do cover the most common. Either watch a video, then go to neetcode.io and practice the questions related to that video, or get a question on neetcode.io, look at the answers, then go find the videos that cover the answers and watch the video and then learn how and why the answers work. Sorry if that's unclear, my point is don't sit and try to ""learn"" how to answer leetcode questiosn on your own, lots of them are not ""intuitive"" and you will only get annoyed. It's much simpler to understand the question, then find the answer soemone else already fine tuned and learn that. If you want to fix a car, you don't just go smashing on things and see what happens, you get the manual. For leetcode, DSA and neetcode.io togehter, are your manual. And no, you don't need to pay for neetcode.io for it to be incredibly useful, you get better organization if you pay, but it's all still very usable for free. Though I will say, its' a pretty useful site, so I did end up paying, but I actually got the lifetime membership after I got my job and had some money coming it.

nm1h71u,"Honestly, every specialist I have worked with performed like a junior-level engineer doing tasks that didn't fall into the scope of their specialization, so with that being said, specializing needs to be viewed as a calculated risk because if you need to pivot later in your career you may very well have to start over. The only sustainable move for specialists to make is to get into leadership. Preferably as quickly as possible because the bottom can and will fall out. See the current status of Salesforce development for example.Contrast that to a generalist who gets paid less to start, but eventually they know so much there isn't really anything they can't do. Once you're 15 to 20 years deep studying become unnecessary because you have a total grasp on how everything works within the current architectural limits of computing. You can literally do just about anything at a high-level and weigh every pro and con from a technical perspective without needing to research anything.

nm2cbuf,"IMHO, you really need to be a generalist to be useful in many roles. Specialization can be added on top to fit into desirable roles after.The problem I see with a lot of specialist engineers, even mid-to-late career, is that they can end up being sidelined when things go wrong.Like a superstar front-end engineer who can crush React components, handle bundling and build systems and even has solid chops putting together a build system and deployment pipeline. But they might end up flummoxed when the site is broken due to bad DNS config, load balancer problems, certificate issues, etc.Specialists can be super productive when they are in their lane and things are working on the happy path. But they can end up struggling when troubleshooting failures and problems that occur in systems they ""own"" but fall outside their speciality.I'm happy that I've spent time working on provisioning systems for bare metal servers, fumbled my way through setting up networks and getting BGP working across VPN links between sites, built my own AD domains and a thousand other ""IT"" tasks which most Software Developers are never exposed to. Its been amazingly useful when it comes to troubleshooting failures and being able to identify all the places where problems can be injected into the environment where services run.So ultimately, I think it is most valuable to be a specialist in one or more domains, but with a broad exposure and experience outside of those specialist silos. I think that means you pretty much need to be a generalist early in the career, then evolving specialist knowledge in one or more domains as your experience grows.",ryancoplen,2025-10-29 19:40:49,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1oi526q,False,

There's a chance that you can apply to go remote if you get your manager on board. It isn't guaranteed of course but for L3+ with a good performance record, you have a shot. In the short term it may be worth the trouble to get a short term rental with a less insane commute while you decide if the role is a good fit.You should absolutely include RSUs in your consideration for this role. Stripe has had 1-2 tender offers annually for the last couple years so there are plenty of chances to get liquidity. Yes, RSU grants are taxed at your marginal income tax rate (about 50% for me), and you will pay capital gains if your shares increase on value after vesting (this is a good problem to have). If you are a high performer, you can stack additional RSU grants that vest over 1-2 years and sweeten the deal considerably.WLB varies by team of course but I don't think it's as bad as some people say. You can try to get opinions for your team/org by asking on Blind. It's definitely not a place where you can coast but I rarely work over 40 hours a week.

Feeling trapped between financial obligations, career dissatisfaction, and the loyalty you feel towards your team, especially with such significant projects on the horizon, must be incredibly isolating. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when facing such critical decisions, particularly when they involve your health, your peace of mind, and your ability to start a family. When you're dealing with such frequent panic attacks and the daily drain of a job you dislike, it's natural for your brain to feel like it's in overdrive, making it hard to see a clear path forward. Prioritizing your mental health is never a sacrifice; it's an investment in every other aspect of your life, especially when you're considering bringing a child into the world. It might be helpful to explore different ways to manage the acute symptoms of anxiety, especially since your current medication situation is changing. Sometimes just having a toolkit of techniques can make a big difference in those overwhelming moments. There's a free [podcast](https://youtu.be/72ZhaR-aWNI) that covers common anxiety symptoms, coping strategies, breathing exercises, and techniques for controlling panic attacks, which you might find useful to listen to in your own time as you navigate these challenges.

nl3aos6,"It's a matter of picking your battles. In my experience ""clean code"" is very much in the eye of the beholder and is more a matter of whether the author and the reader are on the same page rather than any objective superiority of any particular method of coding. Just like any other sort of writing. There are of course some general principles that tend to make things better, and it is certainly possible to make *horribly unclear* code, but past a certain point a lot of it really is a matter of taste.So essentially a person who has strong opinions about specific details of how code should be written is similar to a person who thinks their preferred genre of music is superior to others, or otherwise thinks their taste is superior -- they are wrong, but it's going to be very difficult to convince them of that, and the more persuasive you are the more they will probably dig in and get pissed at you.So you'll need to decide which things *you* care about and which things you don't. If you don't actually care about something, just go along with what they want and smile and nod anytime they try to justify it, content that they're trying to justify it to themselves as much as to you.If you do care, really think again about whether you actually do care. Lots of people don't actually care about things they fight for but rather let ego get tied up in it and are instead fighting over ego. Try to avoid that if possible. So really think about whether you genuinely do care.And if you genuinely do, try to act in good faith. Explain what you think, then invite them to explain what they think and walk you through their thought process and be genuinely open to it. They might actually have good reasons, and so *you* should be open to changing *your* mind. But inviting them to explain will both make them feel like they are valued (which is important to them if they have strong opinions about how the code should be written) and also let them talk themselves out of ideas that are bad (like, if you explain a good idea and ask them to explain theirs, they will have a hard time denying yours is better if they actually have to explain it, and because it is them talking it through and deciding they will be more likely to compromise than if you order them to).Inviting them to explain also gets both of you on the same side -- rather than arguing you are instead both looking at the same problem and talking about it as a thing separate from yourselves. And that change in perspective is helpful -- it makes them feel less like *they* are being devalued if their ideas aren't used.In my experience, most workers do ultimately want to get along and do good stuff, and if you can diffuse their defense mechanisms and avoid getting defensive yourself you can usually find a common ground.But if a person truly is an asshole and can't be reasoned with and truly is my way or the high way, and you really do care about the thing they're digging in on, your best bet is probably to try to go around them. Build support for others / get others to validate your view. After all, if the person is an asshole to you then they have probably been an asshole to others as well, and so you probably will find support.

If you are unsure about how to do something, ask for advice or ""how to do it well"" or ""the best practices"" for such task. When you want to discuss your task with your senior, study your task very well, understand the code you wrote, and **TAKE NOTES**. Don't try to remember everything in your head if you can't.

The only reason I am asking is because I relate to what you describe A LOT and I understand that most of the other commenters do not relate to this experience..I also work with a team that is mostly HK/Singapore but I am in the west. It's tough. And some people can be very condescending and difficult to work with. I found a new job in the country I currently live in for this very reason and I will give my resignation very soon. Just remember, we are always being held to higher standards when it comes to technical skills. Because their assumption is that we are just not as technical as them. They don't do it consciously and if you mention it to them as a feedback to your manager they will 100% get defensive and you will come across as ""oversensitive and blaming them for sexism instead of responding positively to their feedback"". But it's been my experience, my friends' experience and I ve seen it countless times.There have been times that I saw men in my team doing things in a certain way and their PRs got merged. I tried to use their approach and my PR got scrutinized. I try to just stay on the facts, avoid making any accusations, just sharing code snippets and say "" we used this approach here, how is it different now?"". Most of the time, they don't have an answer.Just try to look at your output objectively. Are they really right to what they are saying? If not, try to remind yourself that your output is just being scrutinized much more than theirs. If yes, try to improve on the things they are right and also document what you worked on/what you did to improve.

nlizfst,"You’re not a fraud. You got a CS degree and that is a testament to your knowledge and ability to learn and grow in this field.I don’t know what companies are looking for with respect to new grads these days. It used to be the case that companies hired knowing you had zero experience but the capacity to learn and grow into the role. These days, since there’s so many new grad applicants, the bar for hiring has been raised and so you’ll need to improve your resume to get interviews and improve your interview skills to increase the odds of performing well.Think of it as levels in a game, you'll want to focus your energy on one level at a time (more or less). Since you're not landing interviews, this the first level to pass. Get constant feedback on your resume. You should be iterating on it — share it with friends or redditors to get feedback, make improvements, and send it out to companies (job boards, networking, etc). If you get callbacks, this means your resume is good enough. If not, keep doing that iterative feedback loop until you do. Once you feel you're landing interviews a bit more consistently, then you'll need to focus on the interview rounds. I don't really know what that entails for new grads, but you seem to be on the right track. Practicing leetcode as a way to prove your understanding of DSA is good. Working on personal projects is also good. Keep track of what problems you encounter and what you did to solve them, and be able to communicate that. They don't expect you to be an expert, just want to know how you think and tackle problems. It's great that you're focusing on infra and LLM projects btw. There's no right or wrong path here, the field is too broad so it's best to do what you're interested in because enjoyment is a crucial recipe for making progress and preventing burnout. It's better to have some depth here rather than shallow breadth. It really sucks that this is the market you’re graduating into, but you’re definitely not a fraud, and you're definitely not alone in this experience. Do what you need to sustain a living and be sure to socialize, exercise, and eat well to keep your mental health in good shape too!

nljhcxd,"For the feeling like a fraud part: I used to think this way as well. but after a few years on the job, I realize that you can't prepare for everything. A lot of our stuff is internal, so its gonna be new anyway. I think just have a good foundation, and learn on the job is the best. For the job part: If you don't have the job or interview, focus on getting the interview. if you got the interview, focus on passing the interview.Worry about the not knowing things part after you get the job. Not all companies have a good onboarding/ramp-up time for you, but that's not something you can control anyway. Once you get there, find out what you need to know for your team's projects and tech stack. Go from there.I didn't have AI to help me when I started, but I think AI makes it way easier to learn quickly nowadays. Use it to understand the code base. Like if you need to modify a part of something in the codebase, use AI to find where the code is and understand what patterns this codebase use and get suggestions.Need to build something from scratch? Use AI to quickly understand parts of the tech stack you don't understand. Feed it documentation and ask questions. Clarify your understanding, but be skeptical about what it tells you. ask it to confirm, ask it for direct reference sin the documentation if you're unsure.I don't really know what's best for a junior in this era of AI-assisted tools. But my personal opinion is that you use it to augment your learning potential and gain experience. Once you have more experience, perhaps you can use it to vibe code or output tons of code. Because at least, you tell tell if the output is good or bad.",esme023,2025-10-26 20:53:12,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1ogreua,False,
nlj368s,"The problem with academic programming in school is that business has an entirely different set of needs, tools and development processes. As a junior-level person, you're not expected to know all that stuff. There are a couple of exceptions to this rule -- startups frequently expect new grads to know as much and be able to perform at the level a senior with full implementation level knowledge of their tech stack in the first week. FAANGs might also have higher expectations and be more unforgiving as well, depending on the FAANG.Larger corporations that aren't FAANG will generally have well established IT groups who can offer a decent level of mentorship. Maybe focus on trying to find a spot at one of those.The more you know in general the better. Being able to set up docker instances and CI/CD pipelines is a pretty good skill to have, even if you don't find devops particularly interesting. You might even want to go look at hashicorp's terraform and tools like that, that allow you to stand up a huge amount of infrastructure with the wave of a hand. I don't particularly care for terraform's configuration, would much rather do it in python, but it's still a pretty neat tool and a good one to have in your toolbox. You are very much building out a toolbox now, and it's good to know the things you have at your disposal.I wouldn't suggest coding directly with AI. There are a couple reasons for that and your instincts are good that if you just blindly copy and paste AI code, you're not really going to learn anything. Poke at the problem a bit and use the AI for inspiration. If it writes code for you, try to read and understand it and possibly even rearrange it a bit. Rather than ""Write some code to do X"", focus on ""How do I do X"" and try to understand the underlying concepts.Also, relax! Back in the 80's when I was getting started, there was already way more to know about this field than any single person could know. Math has been like that since Isaac Newton's day -- before him, one single person could know everything there was to know about math. He gave us the map to an infinite landscape. Programming is similar, an infinite landscape of the mind. Don't try to understand it all at once and accept that there will be things you couldn't have even imagined were out there. Maybe you'll even invent one of them one day!Got a couple of funny stories for you if you care to keep reading.Funny story about relaxing: I decided to learn how to skydive when I was in my early 40's. My instructors kept telling me to relax. And I was all like ""I'M ABOUT TO JUMP OUT OF AN AIRPLANE! I AM NOT GOING TO RELAX!"" A few months later I went to the indoor skydiving wind tunnel and told my instructor I just wanted to mess around today and not focus on learning anything. As soon as I hit the wind I felt my whole body relax and I realized that *I'd never done that before!* And I flew so well that day. And knowing how to relax, my driving (which I'd been doing for ~30 years at that point) immediately improved as well. It took a somewhat extreme experience to get me to that point, and it's something I wish I'd learned much earlier in my life.Funny story about people skills: Empathy is a human superpower. We have the ability to think about what another person might be thinking and feeling and act on how we think they're feeling. Hone that power to a fine edge and it's as close to telepathy as we're gonna get. At some point along the way, I found that while reading code, I could get a sense of how well the programmer who wrote it understood the requirements and even their mood and how they were feeling when they wrote the code. It's weird when it happens.So back in the poker craze of the early 2000s there were a bunch of guys around who'd go to bars and set up tables to run free poker tournaments. They'd arrange to get a small kickback from the bar for each customer they brought in. I got laid off from a company I was working for at the time so I started frequenting these tournaments, as they were free to enter and usually offered a free $30 bar tab to the winner of the tournament. I could pick up one or two of those a week and get one or two halfway decent meals out of them. Playing poker taught me to look at people. I can't read people as well as I can read code, but the first time I knew what a guy's hand was just from watching him while he was thinking about betting, I felt like a sorcerer.So learn what you can about computers, but also learn what you can about yourself and the species you belong to.
