mucbctv,"1. Start estimating higher! If you get pushback, point out that your team is always delivering late, so clearly everyone is \*under\*-estimating and you are trying to be realistic. 2. If you are not influential on your team, discuss with someone who is and work a plan. Come with some ideas for solutions rather than just complaints and figure out how to present them. e.g. switch to a Kanban-style workflow; keep the backlog groomed and in prioritized order; for tickets with firm deadlines find a way to indicate the deadline so it gets prioritized correctly. Each person works on only one active story at a time until it is in a review stage where they are waiting on approval to merge. Only then do they pick up the next story on the backlog assigned to them.This gives a clarity to bottlenecks, and focus to what is in progress as it is limited at any given time. It forces clear prioritization of the work each person needs to do next: if a new urgent task comes in, it's set appropriately at or near the top of the backlog. Other items naturally shift down.It does require constant grooming & prioritization, and attention to velocity to ensure the lack of sprint deadline does not cause people to slack off. In addition to that, you can start the week off with everyone stating their goal(s) for the week based on what they know right then. ( in a shared document) \- As the week progresses, each person jots a quick note here or there on anything that prevent completion, whether changing priorities, lack of information needed from others, blocking issues, etc. Or you check off the stuff you have completed in some way. \- At end of week, status is left as it is; the next week a new section is created for that week, and you don't go back and clean up the previous week's notes or ticket status.Over time you can read back and see the patterns of *why* work is typically underestimated.",Fun_Independent_7529,2025-05-26 13:49:59,39,dataengineering,t3_1kvtz7d,False,

The interviews went well, and I shortlisted several candidates for further rounds.Last week, I was pulled into a call with HR, the Team Director, and PM, where I learned that they had shortlisted two candidates, both with around 5 years of experience.

I would like an extra 800$ every month, Who wouldn't?This revelation devastated me.

This is fairly common though, so the thought of cloning a prod table to dev environment could get you in trouble. Generally speaking though, any transformative logic that needs to be worked out can be done via specially curated files containing essential data points and scenarios within the data. Or you can simply write up a script against prod data so you can ensure your features make sense and then plug that in. Though in my experience the latter is less common.And yes during deployment phase you would ensure that these parameters that point to specific environments would be replaced with the relevant environment that the code has been merged to. Dev -> Test, Test -> Stage, etc… keep in mind though that there are times where dev, test, stg, prod are not simply different schemas in a larger database but are entirely different databases/workspaces themselves and have maintained the same naming convention so sometimes nothing needs to change.

Which honestly yeah, makes a lot of sense to me anyway.The elephant in the room is, of course, third-party adoption – at this point Iceberg has some degree of support in a lot of places (Athena, Trini, Clickhouse, Snowflake, DuckDB, etc). Of course several of those only have RO support IIRC because of the clusterfuck that is catalogs – so maybe there's hope for them picking this up just because RW support will be more straightforward to implement.Either way, interested to see where this is going – perhaps the data lake format wars aren't done just yet.",G3n3r0,2025-05-27 14:39:20,32,dataengineering,t3_1kwnx2o,False,

muj0rr3,"I'm brand new to DE. I wanted to type up a pretty detailed summary of what I've learned about all of these tools and formats recently, when looking at what stack to use for my app's pipeline but, unfortunately, my hands are fucked... arthritis is definitely coming for me.My super short summary, then, is that traditional databases use a proprietary file format to store data ""inside"" of the database (meaning it's not a file you can find in your file explorer and open); modern tools like DuckDB provide a query engine and enable SQL queries to be run on open-source file formats like parquet. Importantly, for my understanding, you can run DuckDB queries over many parquet files as if they were a single table.For me, this has shifted the way I view what a ""database"" really is. I used to think of it as the thing that stored data and let me query it. Now, I view the query engine and the stored data as two separate things, with ""database"" still referring to the engine. Then, tools like Iceberg exist to define how multiple parquet files are organised together into a table, as well as dealing with things like snapshots, partitions, schema evolution, and metadata files... at the moment I view Iceberg like a notepad I would keep on my desk that says ""to query sales, read files A, B, and C into DuckDB"" or ""Added Row X, Deleted Row Y"" so it can track how the table evolves over time without taking entire copies of the table (it actually creates a new file called a ""delete file"", to my knowledge, that works kind of like a subtraction X - Y). That means there are now three parts: data storage, the query engine, and metadata management.My understanding of the blogpost is that DuckLake replicates the kind of functionality that Iceberg provides but does so in a format that is compatible with any SQL database. This gives the management of datalakes database-like transactional guarantees, allows easier cross-table transactions, better concurrency, better snapshotting by referencing parts of files, and allows for things like views (which I guess Iceberg and other tools didn't?)Moreover, metadata is currently managed through file writing, and when performing many small updates or changes, this can be slow, and prone to conflict errors. Tools like BigQuery can be even worse, as they re-write entire blocks that have been affected by operations. DuckLake claims to solve for this by storing the metadata in a database, because they're typically good at handling high concurrency and sorting out conflicts. Correct me if I'm wrong there - that's definitely the limit of my technical knowledge.... if I ever get to work with these tools, I'm sure it'll be good knowledge to have!",ColdStorage256,2025-05-27 15:13:22,18,dataengineering,t3_1kwnx2o,False,
mujzakw,"At one level it makes a lot of sense. Iceberg and Delta are fundamentally metadata formats, you write a bunch of files that basically say ""table X is comprised of parquet files 1,2,...N, minus the rows at positions 1,2,...N"". But then they put a catalog on top, which is a regular relational database that says ""the latest version of table X is defined by metadata file X.N"". If we're going to have a database in the picture, why don't we just put all the metadata there?The problem I see is, I don't see how this gets adopted. Adoption of Iceberg was a multi-year process. Adoption of Delta was basically vendor-driven by Databricks and Microsoft. Right now I can't see a path by which DuckLake gets adopted by Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, MS Fabric, and AWS Glue.

mubqq79,"I dunno about DE or Apache but what I’ve observed in big companies is…Some management dickhead gets given the cloud keys. Then they implement “governance” which means that nobody gets access. Everything has to go through multiple levels of manual approvals and every change can take days or weeks or months of haggling to get actioned. Nobody is monitoring uptime or performance because that’s the vendor’s job - and they aren’t doing it either. Meanwhile it’s expensive for terrible performance and management are constantly staring at it as a cost and trying to get everyone to plan and justify their usage and keep justifying it; which kills both development and later experimentation and just sucks your will to live. Compare to on-premises. Fast. Probably over provisioned and under utilised. But it’s already paid for so you can develop straight away without having to estimate what it’s all going to cost, experiment and have it go wrong without getting a sudden million dollar bill, it’s so much easier to get access or even a couple VMs spun up with admin access, and you can get what you need done.

I’m not saying this is all companies, but it was my experience early on and have since enjoyed working in cloud settings.What you are describing sounds more like poorly architected cloud platforms versus an issue with cloud computing. The same could be said for an on-prem company where there isn’t a reliable IT team for managing the servers. I never experienced it but you hear about the meme posts of “unpatched servers” so I doubt those are “reliable and performant”Both on-prem and cloud are susceptible to poor architecture, lack of resources with unrealistic demand for budget, lack of in house knowledge, etc. At the end of the day, the tools themselves matter far less and instead require in-depth understanding of trade offs to know what is the right architecture for different use cases.Lastly, on-prem and cloud both have a place in building Data Platforms.

There is also the cloud service market saturation too.Don’t know much about Apache NiFi infrastructure needs but I don’t think that going public cloud or on-prem has anything to do with a certain technology/framework, there is so much more at stake here, business-wise.

Not only do they not have the budget allocated to hire full time permanent IT staff, they usually don't have managers skilled in building or maintaining technology infrastructure teams. They also usually don't have the culture required to do site reliability properly. Imagine at Bank XYZ you ask for a new server. You have to call the IT team, they have to call their manager, get approval, the guy who buys server racks is on parental leave, sorry you'll have to wait for 3 more months. Not to mention, the manager of that team decides to de-prioritize your request because guess what, when Bob Servers came back from leave he got a better offer from Google and left.

mu4o1wg,"The amount of data modeling you do upfront will be a lot, but if you did a good job of understanding business requirements and build out a data warehouse that does a good job of meeting business needs, it shouldn’t be as often post implementation.Now, it kind of depends on what your definition of “data modeling” means here. Are you talking about like adding columns or adding new fact and dimension tables? Any data warehouse will require maintenance, add new features, etc. but if you are doing a regular major rework, that is either a business issue or you may need to consider evaluating a skill gap on your team around data modeling.Lastly, this would be a poor KPI. Like some other folks of said, it would be similar to counting lines of code. If you are looking for some good KPIs, general ones that I’m a fan of are:1. Data Quality time to resolution. How long does it take from when a data quality bug is reported to it being fixed.2. How many Data Quality issues get through to end users. If you do not have a good data quality test suite in place, you will end up with a lot of bad data getting presented to end users which loses trust and can potentially be costly to the business.3. Data Platform uptime. The percentage of time the data platform is available and appropriately supplying data. An example would be is if you have a pipeline fail and new reports can’t be generated, that would be counted as downtime.Hope this helps. Evaluating the success of a Data Engineering team can be tricky because there is a lot out of our control so whether it is fair or not, we have to play what I call “a lot of defensive” to ensure we are in a good state.

mty4gug,"Practical advice: You mention wanting to organise your files but didn't state a clear end goal. You have to first ask yourself: why is it important and/or useful for me to organise this? What benefits do I hope to achieve? Answering those first will give you some guidelines on what needs to be done. Then from there you can pick specific techniques. Though it's important to note that having a 'random stuff' drawer where everything gets put in with no sorting can actually be useful since it cuts the cognitive load of having to sort things. If you haven't found a compelling reason to organise it after 15 years then it's a strong indication that you either don't have a strong reason to do it, or the system you currently use - albeit informal - is workable enough.Ok now I get to put my autistic hat on: As an autistic person I have at times enjoyed organising things 'for their own sake'. Whilst it's been fun and I learned a lot, the end results were never anything \*that\* useful. If you're anything like me then just be aware of it. It's fine to spend time and enjoy the process but be cautious about any perceived future benefit.The system I like best for lots of random stuff is the PARA method. You can start by dumping everything into one big 'archive' folder and then either move things out one-by-one into an organised place, or you can move things ad-hoc when you 'touch' them. e.g. if you find yourself needing to use an old python script or look at certain docs, then make sure to move those into the organised structure when you do so.",nNaz,2025-05-24 02:46:06,2,dataengineering,t3_1kro76m,False,

muhznyi,"ClickHouse will optimise the query as long as you set a useful ordering key in the table. If you tell me your schema I can give you an example of how to set up the table.In ClickHouse when you make a table it must have an ORDER BY clause (this is a different concept than the order by your queries).In general what you want to do is set the ORDER BY on the table to all the fields you will end up using in your queries, but list them in order of lowest cardinality first. This will let ClickHouse run your queries in literally milliseconds.e.g. suppose you have logs that have the columns: id (unique), timestamp, app, machine, country, message. Where each app runs on many machines and each machine is in a country.Here you want to set the ORDER BY such that the lowest cardinality items come first. Since you have few distinct countries, more distinct machines, many distinct apps and very many distinct timestamps it should be:ORDER BY (country, machine, app, timestamp)This will store the data sorted on disk in a way that will make GROUP BYs very efficient. You can expect queries of under 1 second on an 8 core machine.However also note that ClickHouse is very fast. Even if you don’t set the group by optimally it will likely still execute your queries in under 1min.Whilst it’s hard to give exact numbers I’ve given ballparks for what you can expect for illustration to help you decide whether you want to do it or not.Edit: another thing to note is that ClickHouse will compress your data to speed it up and use less disk.

It can't figure that out when you're using rdds and lambdas.Also, it has to serialise every row to python, so python can deserialise it, just so that python can execute a basic equality check.

mu68y4x,"> how about check pointing?RDD checkpointing should give you a similar effect, but only within a session and only if you specifically pull that RDD by id. If you rerun the pyspark code you'll generate a new RDD definition. Even though *you* know you'll get the same result, spark can't tell, so it is a new RDD.> I start from RDD but you start with UDFThat's not really the distinction. Both versions are running a python function on the executors with input args being sent over from the spark data. The only distinction with a UDF is that the `udf()` call is a wrapper so that you can call the function as if it were a spark function and send it column definitions, whereas in an `rdd.map()` you pass the function reference (rather than call it), and it takes the whole row as its arg.The main difference is to process everything once and just save the json output as text as you go with no further processing. That will complete the data retrieval step, without mixing in possible issues or errors from anything else that could unnecessarily cause you to have to hit the API again. It is a lot like making a 'bronze layer' for your overall process. There's likely little overhead in writing then reading back the data, since it can likely write the data while it is still processing requests, and also because spark is going to have to go over the data multiple times to infer the json schema anyway.> What is the benefit of using UDF over RDD in first place?Again, it isn't a UDF over an RDD. A UDF is just a way to wrap a python call so you can use it as if it is a spark function that takes columns as input, rather than passing a function reference and that function having to take a whole row.For one thing, it is a bit faster because spark only has to serialise (and python deserialise) the specific columns that go into the function, which can help performance when the row is very wide. It also means that spark can potentially skip execute the UDF entirely, if its output isn't required for anything.A benefit with using DataFrames is that spark can optimise things by cutting out steps that aren't necessary. Here as an example you can run locally -- just do a `pip install pyspark` and make sure you have openjdk17 with JAVA_HOME set. import json from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col, lit from pyspark.sql.types import StringType spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() data = [ (""A"", 0), (""A"", 100), (""B"", 0), (""B"", 100), ] input_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=""category STRING, offset INT"") input_df.show() def python_func(category: str, offset: int) -> str: with open(""side_effect.txt"", ""a"") as filewriter: filewriter.write(f""{category}:{str(offset)}\n"") return ""--"" python_func_udf = udf(python_func, StringType()) ( input_df.filter(col(""category"") == lit(""A"")).withColumn( ""python_func_call"", python_func_udf(col(""category""), col(""offset"")) ) ).write.format(""noop"").mode(""overwrite"").save()If you run this once and open `side_effect.txt` you'll see that it *only* has rows where the input data `category` column is equal to `""A""`. Spark *completely skipped* processing the other rows, and the python function was never called for them.In your original example spark *cannot* know what the result of the filter is going to be, because it is being done in Python code. Therefore it must execute the entire source RDD and push every row in its entirety through the filter function in order to get the correct results. This is what causes the execution of the 'invoices' json rdd to also hit the api for the purchase_orders endpoint, even though that data won't go into that RDD.If you use DataFrames from the beginning, and use a DataFrame filter to pick the table you are processing, spark will *only* hit the API for the rows that match your filter, even though you specified the filter in a later step. You could avoid this double-processing without even trying.---The actual suggestion is to stick with DataFrames and just save the data immediately. Then after pulling down the data from the API -- which is *highly* likely to be the slow part -- and saving it, you can just read it back to do everything you need. You *have* the data, you just need to process it. You can take the response json strings and write them out to 'text' files, then read them back in 'json' format and spark will do all the schema inference for you. You can even automatically split up the writes by table in a single pass by setting a partition on the tablename, then read back just the files for a specific table. from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col, explode_outer from pyspark.sql.types import ArrayType, StringType spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() # set up API calls data = [ (""Invoices"", ""https://api.example.com/invoices"", 0), (""Invoices"", ""https://api.example.com/invoices"", 100), (""Invoices"", ""https://api.example.com/invoices"", 200), (""PurchaseOrders"", ""https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders"", 0), (""PurchaseOrders"", ""https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders"", 150), (""PurchaseOrders"", ""https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders"", 300), ] input_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=""tablename STRING, endpoint STRING, offset INT"") def fetch_responses(endpoint: str, offset: int) -> list[str]: response_body = YOUR_REQUEST_RESPONSE return response_body fetch_responses_udf = udf(fetch_responses, ArrayType(StringType())) # define the process to fetch the data and save it as-is to avoid reprocessing due to errors responses_col = fetch_responses_udf(col(""endpoint""), col(""offset"")).alias(""response_array"") get_everything_df = input_df.select(""*"", responses_col) get_everything_df.write.format(""parquet"").save(SOME_SCRATCH_SPACE_PATH) # use the saved data to generate the per element data and save to separate folders per table fetch_each_col = explode_outer(responses_col).alias(""response"") per_element_df = get_everything_df.select(""tablename"", fetch_each_col) per_element_df.write.format(""text"").partitionBy(""tablename"").save(SOME_PATH_FOR_YOUR_JSONL_TABLEDATA) # now read back for your desired tablename - this uses the hive style partitioning to pick just one table invoices_df = spark.read.format(""json"").load(SOME_PATH_FOR_YOUR_JSONL + ""/tablename=invoices"")",azirale,2025-05-25 14:05:24,1,dataengineering,t1_mu012a9,False,

So that you can do the solution in a naive way and still get a passing, because is what I actually care about as a dev. You are able to understand and solve the issue, not that you can do in the most efficient way, that you only need to do it as a refractoring after it has been assessed that we need performance for that specific task.Classic example is to be able to do what they ask for string 10\^12 carachter long in less than 200ms.And that's bad for two reasons:1. A requirement like that in a professional setting would have probably been stopped at the source: why do you have a string this long, and do we really need a string this long ?2. A lot of times, the DP solution is worse than the native solution for smaller sets. Something simply because it's harder to understand and as a general rule of thumb you want to make your code easy to understand, and also because sometimes is just less efficient for small sets because it requires some overhead work that the naive solutiomn won't need and while the naive solution is 0(n\^2) instead of O(log(n)) for strings less than 200 carachter the naive solution can be faster.",LordAmras,2025-05-27 06:00:30,2,learnprogramming,t3_1kwbj94,False,

Form POSTs specifically predate CORS and developers have always been allowed to submit a form to another domain by simply creating `<form action=""bank.com/...` HTML and either tricking the user into clicking the submit button or submitting automatically with JS. This wouldn't allow an attacker to see the response to a cross-domain form post, but it would allow you to make the cross-domain form post. Browsers retained this capability because they didn't want to break all the legitimate websites that rely on this behavior to this day.This is why you need anti-csrf tokens to hand form POSTs.

The number of projects I or friends of mine have started and never finished massively outweighs the ones completed, that's the nature of things. Even the ones that got done were a struggle, you have to decide when something is truly worth pushing through for and make yourself do it (sometimes because you really believe in it, sometimes just because you're being paid). Otherwise chalk it up to learning and move on. I think the main thing is for you to release some of the pressure you're putting on yourself. Your family wants you to do well, and you want to do well for their sake, but pushing yourself into a corner won't help with that. Focus on what you're doing, not anyone else. Finish your masters. Put effort into looking for a job, but understand there's no guarantee so don't punish yourself if you're having trouble. If getting a job was easy, or guaranteed, everyone would be following the same path. That path doesn't exist. Just do your best, play your cards as well as you can, and hope like the rest of us. You are not special, or in other words, you're as special as any of us. Everyone fails sometimes, even the best in the world, everyone can compare to another and think ""damn I wish I had that"".

Nobel prize winners will wake up one morning and dread plugging away at the next thing, wondering if they've lost their touch... point I'm making is you carry on going regardless, sprinting or crawling, that's the only way it all happens.

Don't stress the low points, and try to keep your mind clear so you can recognise when you've got the chance for brilliance and take it when it happens. Personally, and this is where the sub might disagree, my excitement and curiosity is all around the crazy progress being made in AI tech. Big changes are on the horizon, if you ask me, so try to stay flexible and see if you can take advantage of that in some way. The job market is bad for non-seniors right now, but we have no idea how it's going to shake out over the coming year or so. Stay alert, learn whatever you can, and hold on for the ride.

Working for money is an experience just like learning a new tech. - If you can't, try to survive. Everything is about to be turned upside down anyway (IMO). - Nothing is forever. Falling behind and pulling back ahead again are natural in the rat race of life. - Relax. As much as is possible.

mtn3yxx,"I've been programming for 8 years, and honestly, this feels like one of the toughest times to be a developer — even my boss, who’s been in the industry for 20 years, agrees. The engineering world is in a bit of a strange place right now. With the rise of AI and a shaky global economy, tech jobs have become harder to find. But I do believe this will shift in time.One big challenge is that many people involved in hiring aren’t developers themselves. They're often finance-driven decision-makers who don’t fully understand the nuances of engineering work. That can make things frustrating — especially when the hiring process includes unrealistic coding challenges that don't reflect real-world development.These days, there’s a dangerous expectation that every dev needs to be ""elite."" The truth is, tech moves fast, and everyone has different strengths. Some are more technical, others better at architecture or communication. The role of a developer is evolving — communication, collaboration, and adaptability are becoming just as important as coding skills. The era of working in isolation, coding for hours without interruption, is mostly gone.Still, there *will* be jobs. The industry is in transition, and once it stabilizes, opportunities will open up again. Try not to stress about being “mediocre” — imposter syndrome is incredibly common, even among experienced developers. I’ve been doing this for years and still feel it at times, but I’ve learned that most people do.At the end of the day, software development is about solving problems and moving data — it doesn’t have to be overcomplicated. Many tools and frameworks have added unnecessary layers, but the core principles remain the same.So hang in there. Keep learning, stay curious, and don’t compare yourself to others.

Start with FCC and do the html/css/JS content until you finish it, get painfully bored, or feel like you're spinning your wheels. When you're ready to apply the js skills from FCC, start odin project for web development -- it'll show you how to use all of the syntax you've learned to build real things. Odin is particularly good because it's project-based and doesn't hold your hand, but for these reasons, it's good to have some syntax knowledge before getting too deep into it, IMO. It also teaches you common non-code skills that are necessary for building software in web context: version control (git/github), IDE/code editor setup, linux env setup (esp important if you're not on mac), basic terminal usage etc.That's the path I took, and I don't think I'd be where I am today if I hadn't had FCC and Odin. I stayed 100% focused on js, and if you're going for web, I'd suggest you do the same -- it will speed things up if you focus on one language. And with node, you can write backend in js as well. The earlier you get used to typescript, as well, the better.By the time I got semi-competent w/ React through Odin, I actually did a bootcamp.

mtugqo2,"Good answers here, so I won't reiterate what has already been said, only mention that it was common to distinguish between ""programs"" and ""scripts"", where you could write a script inside another program, like Excel, and make it manipulate the objects that already existed in that environment.But if you wanted to run your code outside of that other program (it will always run inside *some* ""program"", like for instance the operating system) then you'd have to write a proper program. The idea was that you could write that in any text-editor you like, and then ""compile"" the source code to a binary program that could be run on its own.I use the past tense, because nowadays the differences are a lot more blurred - you can write programs in languages like Python and JavaScript inside spreadsheets (Google Sheets and Excel supports both, as far as I'm aware), or inside the browser, or custom applications, or you can write code on its own, but then execute it with a runtime. And often this runtime contains a virtual machine, and it is all very complicated, but you usually don't need to know - you just write your program in an IDE and then run it directly in the IDE while working on it, until you are done, and can run it from anywhere on the computer.I recommend getting started with Python - follow a tutorial to help you set everything up, and get something working.

mub99m4,"I have a little over 3.5 years of experience, and I’m at a mid-level position. I work in web dev.If I was starting out again, I’d do the bare minimum to understand how to debug on my own and learning how to Google and find things on Stack overflow.After becoming barely proficient enough to generally get through difficult tasks that approach, when needed, then I’d stop utilizing that approach for learning. I’d then open up several AI models with free chat samples of their higher-end models (usually in the form of free credits that reset daily), and then I’d start building tons of projects.The AI assistance I’d use to help me understand things and identify unknown unknowns. You can’t just use it to build everything for you. Then you’re not a programmer, just a prompter. The goal is to use it faster than you’d have used Stack Overflow or Google to learn the same things.After building tons of projects, I’d get the experience taking a few live, such as web hosting, figuring out DNS, live database, live authentication, etc.After doing this, I’d research best security practices and go back through projects implementing them, and also trying to break them, to get a real-world understanding of how many insecure things you just built with AI’s help. AI isn’t thinking of security. You need to be. I’d download Burp suite, and learn the basics of using it. This is great for learning how to compromise your system and find vulnerabilities. You will find vulnerabilities. If you don’t, it’s not because you don’t have any. It’s because you can’t find them.I myself am still getting better at the security aspect of things, so I can’t give you much more advice there, but that’s a starting point!The thing is, I’m providing the value that many coworkers pre-AI were providing with much more years of experience than me. You need to use it to your advantage and speed up your learning to catch up and overtake many of them.You also need to acknowledge that you are in a competitive field, and you are competing with many smart people. You need to acknowledge that if you want to grow faster than others, you need to do what 99% won’t. For me, that was working longer hours for experience. It was jumping into hard tasks for experience. It was pushing for more work and opportunity and legacy code work and bigger features and more bugs. I was willing to do the dirty work when it came up, and I was also always willing to listen to my coworkers whenever they had constructive feedback.Some of my coworkers have described me as “starving” and “hungry” to learn. I think there are a few who it scares, because of how fast I caught up to them.The thing is, they’re working 9-5. I was willing to work 9-5, or 9-9, or 9-5 then midnight to 4, or over the weekend. It isn’t about the money. It’s about the experience. I don’t get paid more as a salaried individual. You need to acknowledge that it’s about the short-term suffering for the long-term investment.Finally, place yourself in positions where you’re not the smartest in the room, or the highest on the totem pole. If you’re the top of the food chain in an area, leave. It’s a waste of your time unless you’re building up experience by sharing to those with less experience. You need a bit of both. Sharing to others, and learning from others. Look for engineering meet-ups in your area. I was lucky to go to one with all staff and principal engineers, as the sole junior. Just being around them causes you to learn immensely. If you go to a meet up, and it’s primarily people in your own skill level, then leave.In code, don’t get caught up in the little picture. Remember the big picture. Sometimes, things should really be left a little less perfect, or maybe not as clean, if they’re very leaf-node-like. Focus deeper on the root areas of the code base, that affect many things.In the end, it also depends on your goals. My goal was (and is) to move up as quickly as possible, to make as much money as I can, as quickly as possible. My goal is to get higher quicker so that I can r/FIRE when I want to, where I want to, if I want to. I’m already in a position to coast FIRE.

You have Django, which is a powerhouse of a framework, making development of any backends very secure and reliable.Golang is very nice to use. Static typing makes it a lot easier to work with. Also, the performance is almost comparable to language like Rust and C++, especially considering how much easier it is to write good code in it. I personally quite like the community behind it. They seem to not like using too many dependencies, which alines with my personal preferences. Building a solid, thoroughly tested API in Go can be done exclusively using the standard library. It’s also very efficient. Small scale APIs and apps can run containerised on a few dozen megabytes of memory, which I imagine could be very good for freelancing, as it will lower cloud bills for clients. Unfortunately there is no Django-styled batteries included framework in Go, which can make development of smaller projects harder.I’m also going to add one more suggestion - Java.

Also, it has been running literally on billions of devices for decades, making it pass the test of time with flying colours.

What kind of job or project do you want to do?2. What skills or technologies are commonly used in that field?I'm not too confident when it comes to frameworks, so I won't go into that. But based on my personal experience, here are a few examples of different paths you could take. Still, I highly encourage you to do your own research and explore further:1. If you want to make video games, it's useful to learn C++ and C#, along with engines like Unreal Engine (C++) or Unity (C#). C++ is a lower-level language, which gives you more control over performance, but it's harder to learn. C# is widely used in Unity and also good for building desktop GUIs.2. If you'd like to make websites, you'll need HTML and CSS to structure and style web pages, and JavaScript to make them interactive.3. Lastly, if you want to work as a data scientist or in the AI field, Python is the go-to language. Learn libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and so on. SQL is also important for managing and querying databases.Python is considered a high-level language, meaning it's easier to write and read, but it's further from the hardware compared to languages like C or C++. This means you have less control over performance, and in some cases, Python can be slower when executing certain types of code. If you want to learn JavaScript know that there's a lot of memes because it works in a.. strange way :face_with_tears_of_joy:Apart from this, you're surely making an excellent choice wanting to understand programming, I'm too ""at the beginning"", so this is everything I can give to you, hope I helped you brother!",CostRepulsive693,2025-05-23 20:30:52,11,learnprogramming,t3_1ktsh09,False,

To be entirely honest the best advice I can really give you is, ""just allow yourself to get into it"". If you are just discovering it, the journey will take you somewhere.

That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t also be reading up on design patterns, data structures, language details, and algorithms. It just means that you do need to put that stuff into practice. You need to make mistakes and learn from them. Write something bad, and then go back and refactor it now that you know better. It’s a slow, iterative process. You should absolutely pick up source control, ideally, as you noted, git. You don’t need to be a wizard. Just get good enough that you’re not bricking your repo and losing progress all the time. Just absolute everyone uses it, and if they’re not, they’re still using source control, so the ideas are still good to know about. C++ can be tough for people. Between pointers, dependencies, templates, (Pre)Build Systems, and more, it’s not the easiest language. If it’s what you want to use though, you’ve really gotta just put your head down and learn enough to get cracking on some small to medium sized projects and get comfortable with some basic dependency management. Just in general, you’ll need to start thinking about writing code if your classes aren’t doing it. I was never a competitive programmer, nor did I do a ton of the puzzle or algorithm sites. My school was team project focused, and was self driven. So I was working on projects for 8 semesters. Often in between as well since they’d carry over. And I’d have side projects to learn a thing that I might bring back into the main project. I’d learn stuff alongside friends who were struggling with a topic over the summer (it’s how I started with the basics of Vulkan after it released in 2016, though, I’ve not evolved much beyond a beginner in graphics haha). I found projects worked for me. If you want something driven, give the puzzle and algorithm sites a try. But I think you should try to build out a few small projects that interest you. Even just writing scripts that automate a tedious task helps, it’s not uncommon for me to script up stuff like that at work, so those are good skills to have.",playmer,2025-05-23 06:48:26,3,learnprogramming,t3_1ktcoaf,False,

Most of the CS classes used FORTRAN-IV on a PDP-11/40 running RSTS/E timesharing.But I will try anyway...The key to Computer Science, Software Engineering, and programming in general (all different, though related, disciplines) is problem solving - recognizing a problem, decomposing it into smaller problems, and solving each of those smaller pieces in a way that solves the larger problem when brought back together.By ""problem"", I don't mean ""error"" or ""malfunction""; I mean the thing you are trying to accomplish when you set out.The language and things like git are tools that you apply to this, and different tools lead to different paths to solving a problem. You need to know how to use the tools you have, but problem solving is the skill you need to develop independent of the tools; you simply apply the tools at hand when solving the problem. The tools are changing continuously, don't get hung up on the tools themselves.Whether you are in the right field of study is something you must determine. Are you interested in it? Do you enjoy the challenges it provides? Do you see an opportunity to expand your skills and make meaningful contributions to projects or the field as a whole after getting your bachelor degree? Have you identified what subset of the discipline you are most interested in pursuing?You need to be motivated, interested, and willing to make mistakes and learn from them. Developing critical problem solving skills is essential to success. Without it, you might as well be an accountant. I expect there's also aptitude - some people are faster at picking this up than others.Ask yourself why you chose this path in the first place, and whether those reasons are still compelling to you. Is there something else you would rather be doing? There's no shame in changing directions - I went from civil engineering to computer science in my 4 years.

All of that can be very useful in writing good software.If you don't learn any of that, coding can be a bit like learning magic incantations - you know what to type to make something happen, but you don't really understand why it works. That can lead to code that's inefficient, or it can lead to not being able to understand why your code isn't working.Note that CS programs tend to teach very little about tools, frameworks, and libraries that are currently used in industry. That frustrates some students because they don't feel job-ready, but the reality is that those things change frequently. Schools focus on the fundamentals that are universal and timeless.But yeah, there's nothing different about the programming. It doesn't matter whether you're a CS major or not. Some of the best programmers I've ever known were some other major - often physics or engineering.I'd say another difference is what your goal is in programming. If your goal is purely to solve a problem - like you need to write a program that figures out the answer to one question, then you'll never use it again - then a lot of what you learn in CS probably doesn't matter.If you're trying to build robust, efficient, powerful software that lots of people can use and rely on, the stuff you learn in CS is a lot more relevant.",dmazzoni,2025-05-21 04:29:17,15,learnprogramming,t3_1krouk0,False,

mtfkp21,"There are a lot of different engineering disciplines, all of them have their own ""take"" on programming.Of course the basics that you mention are shared: data structures, algorithms, stats, linear algebra, discrete math, etc are pretty much university year 1 and 2 kind of stuff for almost all technical disciplines. You need all that as a basis for advanced learning.However, where it differs is in how programming is used. I come from the angle of a computer engineering and robotics/mechatronics dropout.In CS you have a lot of focus on how to think about computation and the nature of the algorithm. Stuff like Big O / algorithmic efficiency, memory efficiency, information theory, a lot of Claude Shannon's foundational works, also cryptography. And of course, in the 4th year, operating systems, compilers, databases, consensus algorithms, network programming (which is a totally different kind of beast).In contrast, in Engineering, you will not need any of those things I mentioned in the CS paragraph.Computation in engineering, from a mechanical engineering perspective, is more about modeling, simulating physical properties/materials, extremely large scale numerical simulations (I think only the theoretical and experimental physicists deal with larger numbers) (aside: IEEE floating point is a mind bender!). Almost all of mechanical engineering programming challenges are safety related, as in if the program crashes or miscalculates, people die and processes explode or buildings come down or bridges collapse. So there is a lot of focus on ""tried-and-true"" methods of programming - no ""seat of the pants"" stuff there.The best C programming teacher I ever had was a mechanical engineer, and almost all of his programming experience comes from programming the feedback loop that controls a large scale blast furnace at smelters - the program uses measurements from various sensors, and then controls the smelting process. He drilled safety issues (error check, bounds check, input sanitisation, improper casting, huge possibility of improper pointer usage, saturation vs wraparound on overflow, pair programming, code review, using static analysis tools, etc) into every single lecture, because if the program crashes or miscalculates, thousands of litres of molten metal would spill and destroy the plant.Some of our homework assignments in C contain a magnitude more error checking and recovery code than actual executable code - of course this is not realistic for programming in the workforce, but his point of view is that no one else will teach defensive programming after we get out of his class, so might as well make us do it over and over again as homework until it's drilled into our brains. The evaluation criteria for this kind of assignment is him and the TA trying to hack/crash/exploit the program (for example, one easy trick is for them to give some unexpected inputs and seeing how your program deals with that, which is a basic form of fuzzing). They write up their report for you, and if you fix the issues they give the mark back.Mechatronics folks usually deal with real-time circuitry and need to complete evaluation loops within a pre-determined amount of time. Think bipedal robots that need to respond when it is about to fall - how does a robot recover from that situation? Things like aerospace engineering also fall into this category: how does a programmer create a ""fly-by-wire"" airplane program so it can correct and adjust pitch/yaw/roll, etc. within time and physical limits.In these use cases, recursion and dynamic memory allocation, both mainstays of CS oriented programming, is forbidden.Some Electrical Engineers programming to do DSP (digital signal processing) - where you take in a massive amount of data and you filter stuff out - DSP programming is kind of like creating filters and sieves out of computer programs - it sounds glamorous but it's actually quite a bit of grunt work. I think one of the exercises is like - take this huge sample of RF random noise and filter it until you can hear the satellite transmission downlink. It's like using programming to find needle in a haystack.I don't know what the chemical engineers need from their programmers, but I'd assume it's also about simulation, chaotic/stochastic processes.As you can tell, Computer science is primarily concerned with the nature of computing, and engineers use programming to work with the real world.The real world is incredibly messy and our math doesn't always work. That, added to the incredibly strict safety tolerances makes engineering programming a really niche job - I personally don't think you can be a great aeronautics real-time programmer and a good database programmer at the same time.As for your last question: are you into physical processes (blowing things up, making lights turn on and off, melting aluminum and using a mold to cast wheels, etc) or are you into computing, calculating, storing and searching information?It's perfectly ok to be into both - just keep in mind that there are these 2 ""ways of thinking"" when it comes to programming.The last bit of info is that in the real workforce, we work in teams: everyone brings a bit of their own ""special sauce"" to the team and that's how everything in the world is built/done.Even though the ""lone programmer"" is a trope in TV/media, that almost never happens in real life.If you become a programmer, you *will be working within a team* - so one of the most vital skills over everything else, is learning how to work with people who are different from you: they have different skillsets, different communication methods, may speak different languages, etc. That's probably the most critical skill out of everything: learning to work with other people.Hope this little overview helps and good luck!",barkingcat,2025-05-21 06:38:06,3,learnprogramming,t3_1krouk0,False,

I think learning ""the hard way"" like this is quite good but autocomplete/suggestions make getting the syntax right a lot easier.A few tips/useful sites:* [MDM ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)\- this should be the first place you look things up, its THE reference and is well written, easy to understand and has good examples * [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/guides/) \- I've linked to the guides section, whilst there's some advanced stuff here their guides/cheat sheets for flexbox and, lengths and media queries are always useful* [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/elements) \- Firefox has similar, use the one you like. I've linked to the ""element"" section which helps answer the question ""why doesn't this thing do the thing I thought it should"". On free code camp when doing the test projects you can click the button at the top right to open the preview in a new window, this will mean the dev tools for that window don't show the code editors which can be confusing.* [BEM](https://getbem.com/naming/) \- At some point you'll start building more complex things and have a convention for how to give things names consistently helps keep your CSS readable and reusable. There are other conventions but I like this one.* [CSS Variables/Why frameworks are good](https://coreframework.com/) \- Free code camp introduces variables super late which can build bad habits. As a general rule you never want hard coded values in any code, anywhere. It makes code hard to read and hard to modify in the future. Defining things like font sizes, colour palettes, spacing and border radiuses upfront makes everything a lot easier down the line.

mu5ufnh,"Well, no, but also yes.CSS isn't confusing at all, it is, especially with changes made the last three-five years, a very well structured language to express how you'd like the design and layout of your HTML-document to look.However, most programmers suck at visual design, at understanding what looks good, what the rules are, what things are called, and how to plan or even talk about the design of a document. They often prefer some pre-baked incantations that they can just throw at the page, so it will look like every other page out there. Which is probably why Bootstrap became so popular in the first place, and why Tailwind is so popular now.CSS is very, very, very different from HTML and JavaScript - HTML is a structure, it is easy to see if one element is before, after, inside or outside another. And JavaScript mostly is a list of lines, all being executed one after another, so that's also pretty easy to understand. But in CSS there isn't really any structure, just a bunch of rules that more or less all apply at the same time.Some parts of CSS has to do the the individual elements, how they look, how much space they take up, or where they are in relation to other elements. Other parts of CSS has to do with the layout, how an element layouts other elements inside of it. Yet other parts of CSS has to do with how an element is layouted by the parent. And you don't really write the rules, you just set some values on some properties that is used by some algorithms. So it is a bit like programming where you can only change the values of variables - difficult.I think that this recent video from Kevin Powell: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-95kJ0eyzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-95kJ0eyzQ) gives a good introduction to understanding how to understand CSS :)",peterlinddk,2025-05-25 12:36:11,2,learnprogramming,t3_1kuyfqt,False,

mtkoz0x,"Some people have suggested a compressed file system. That’s an option, but I think your approach is still better due to portability and forwards compatibility given your use case and the business intent I’m assuming from your post. A compressed file system is typically linked to its OS family and soft linked to its specific filesystem version. Every OS maintainer starts out with the intent to honor the contract of every feature of every filesystem they ever made, but they typically get sketchier and sketchier as the specific filesystem gets older and older. Meanwhile, zip and a few of its brethren have been portable across all operating systems for years and you can simply move a file from one machine on one os to another generally without any functionality issue. Zip also contains built in CRC protection in the file which although not the most modern has been sufficient since its creation. The standard open source ‘zip/unzip’ available on Linux and macOS have long contained the same ‘test’ command that pkzip first introduced. Ie - unzip -t file.zip verifies all the CRCs of the files and the redundant copies of the metadata. In actuality it’s probably just checking the metadata, decompressing all the files in memory and comparing them with the CRCs. That verifies the files without taking any additional file storage. See if you can figure out how to directly trigger the ‘-t’ functionality via your library. Or alternatively just decompress them into the null device which accomplishes about the same. There are still some theoretical gaps in the integrity of this system though. If the original zip run received bad data or the data was corrupted while in memory than the files in the zip will be corrupt even though they verify. You should definitely be doing this if you care enough on a machine with ECC ram. Disk errors at just the wrong time could also cause problems in the chain that go unnoticed. In the ideal case you would have your own verifiable CRC produced at the very start of the chain where the source files were. Then you have something to check against anywhere in the chain without needing to go back and compare against the original files. For example if you produced a sha256 hash of each file at the source machine you could then check against that hash anywhere in the chain.",xilvar,2025-05-22 00:46:27,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ks61v4,False,
mtkqihe,"For your first question, just create a checksum before compressing the folder. Then decompress it and check the decompressed file against the checksum. If it's good, you can be sure the file compressed correctly.You should also create a checksum for the compressed file as well. That way you can verify the integrity of the compressed file whenever it's transferred somewhere.Ideally your system works like this.1. System identifies project file to be archived on the working server2. System generates checksum for project file/folder4. System verifies the checksum against the project file (redundant check, just to be sure)5. System compresses project file into archive file6. System decompresses archive file into decompressed file7. System checks the decompressed file against the checksum to verify compression worked properly. (This checksum can be discarded now, since most compression algorithms have internal checksums. You could keep it if you want, just don't confuse it with the checksum for the archive file.)8. System generates checksum for the archive file9. System verifies the checksum against the archive file (again, redundant check)10. System transfers the archive file to the archive server along with the checksum11. System verifies the transferred archive file against the checksum12. System deletes project file and archive file on the working serverIf a verification check fails at any point, you just repeat the steps after the previous successful verification.As for other compression tools, gzip and bzip have better compression ratios that zip. They're standard tools that are widely supported, so you shouldn't have any issues working with them.There are other compression tools that offer minor improvements to compression ratio or speed, but are less popular, so unless you really *need* that extra file space they're probably not worth using.Finally, I see that you mention the archive is on a raid disk which is good, but I just want to encourage following the 3-2-1 rule for backups if you aren't already. If these files are critical enough to warrant all this work, the least you can do is pay a bit extra for offsite storage to ensure you can recover if the archive server blows up.

Front-end work involves UX decisions that require logic, while back-end development can benefit from a creative mindset, too.Since the left side of your brain handles logic and the right side is all about visual imagination, I separate my tasks based on this.Here’s the trick:While tackling logical tasks, I keep a notepad nearby for any creative ideas or concepts I’m excited to test later. The key is having the discipline not to indulge in those creative tasks immediately or start new projects out of boredom.Instead, I treat those moments of boredom as opportunities.

Reddit was originally modeled with comments being rows which have straightforward relations to other comments that are their children or they are children of.- At scale you bust naive RDB index caches all the time if you don’t model your product around how it’s cached by the engine. - Reddits product revolves around sufficiently timely elevation and surfacing of the right comments. This was originally hyper-naive in a request time sort done independently for every comment thread fetch.

I don't think it is going to burst. It already has too many practical applications and I think the folks denying it are engaging with public chatbots exclusively. The future is a business running its own relatively efficient models, sometimes locally, trained on their own data. The future are computers with NPUs capable of running local models plugged into IDEs and editors, no need to waste resources in a server farm. I can already run models on my Mac that can assist with coding (and coding is a small part of the overall job for probably most SWEs anyway--just like physical exams are a small part of a physician's job; vital but not the bulk of it). What I do think will burst are all the shovel sellers.

Instant resume killersYour resume doesn't tell me what you've been doing the last few years! I know it sounds silly but I've seen some resumes that talk really in detail about tools and languages, and don't talk about... what projects you worked on and how they mattered in the big picture, who used your work, who you collaborated with to make things happen, what defects you saw and what you improved and how you did that.If all you talk about is having taken tickets and turn them to code with lots of languages and tools, I can only assume you're best suited for a role that needs someone to specialise in taking tickets and turning them into code.What I'm looking for is, someone who's interested in joining a team, who wants to learn and help others learn, who wants to improve things, and to build stuff that works which they're proud of. So.... Write your resumes to show me these: make each bullet show some mix of how you've worked with lots of types of people, learned from and mentored them, made small improvements, worked on projects, all while you did the bigger items you want to highlight.Illustrating these will impress me more than a contextless ""Shipped project megazorb in java 21, made a billion""3.

The aim of the interview is: get to know what we'll both be like to work with. If you feel like a question or task is about to sink you, this is now a chance to show me how you deal with what seems like a really big problem. We'll have plenty in the role, I'm certain you've seen plenty before, so show me what you can do.\- Never criticise past employers/colleagues. Just don't go there. Even if you've heard that rule and still think ""well this is close to criticism but I'm phrasing it objectively so its ok"", still don't. I don't know why, but people do it a lot. I don't know you or those people and I have know way of knowing if what you're saying is fair or not. Just flip everything to ""I'm looking for $goodthing"" and don't say ""past employer had $badthing"". We can lament bad jobs when you're hired\- Don't lie. I'm not always going to catch it, but when I do, it's just a straight decline. If you don't have a great example of ""tell me a time X happened"", don't make one up, just say: ""I've never had to deal with that exactly, as stated, but I have had to do Y or Z"". These questions are almost always about, how did you learn from bad thing, how did you get around obstacle.

muj8j9p,">I'll do junior stuff and take low end salariesAnd companies won't believe you.One of the most important parts of recruiting is retention. If a company doesn't think they can retain you, they're not going to hire you.Lots of things can make a company think they can't retain you. For example, if you blurt out your salary expectation are $200k, but the company is only able to offer $80k, they're not going to even bother extending the offer. Even if you say ""Oh, actually, I'm totally willing to accept $80k!"", they're not going to bother. You already showed your hand. They know you want $200k, and they know even though you'll accept their offer of $80k, because $200k was your expectation you're going to continue job searching and leave them the moment you get an offer that's more aligned with your expectations.Another example, if you've gotten a PhD and are highly specialized in a niche area of the industry, and the company you're talking to is just hiring for a basic CRUD role... they know you'll be impossible to retain. You got a PhD, you're highly specialized. Even if you say to the company ""I'll be totally happy in your role"", they know it's BS. They know you'll be out the door the second you get an offer that's relevant to your PhD.That same idea applies to you. You have 10 YOE. You can claim you'll be happy with junior roles, and low end salaries, but companies know that's total BS and you'll quit the moment you get a Senior role with a Senior salary lined up. Even if it's the truth, from the company's perspective, they're not going to believe it for a second, and you'll fall into the ""impossible to retain"" category. No company will hire someone they don't think they can retain.All of that said, you can absolutely be a 10+ YOE dev and be part of the team, and code regularly. Most of us do. A Senior SWE is still an IC. A Staff SWE, and a Principal SWE, are still IC's. They still code every day, they're still an active contributing member of the engineering team, their responsibilities just get zoomed out a bit. Instead of looking at things at the single-Jira-ticket level, they might be thinking at the epic-level, or the quarterly-deliverables-level, or the company-wide-architecture-level. You're still extremely technical, you're not a manager. Plenty of people stay an IC their entire career, and you can too.But your problem is you're trying to stay on the IC-route, but aren't actually evolving beyond a junior/mid-level in terms of skills/contribution. So that makes you a very, very, very expensive developer that doesn't deliver on their price tag. And because of the aforementioned issue, companies aren't just going to continue paying you junior level salaries when you're carrying with you 10+ YOE.You need to dive into the deep end, and apply for Senior+ level roles. If you can convince a company you're ready for that role, even if you don't feel like you are, that's how you'll set yourself up for the next 20 years of your career. If you don't do that, you'll find yourself struggling a lot, and you'll claim ""age-ism"", but it's very much about your career path, not about your age.",SouredRamen,2025-05-27 15:49:26,36,cscareerquestions,t3_1kwq4ml,False,

muf3c4u,"tl:dr: I'm a full stack dev who is about to get laid off. I've worked at one company for 7 years, and that's the extent of my industry experience. Assuming work is going to be scarce, what other options are out there that i could look into with minimal or no need for additional training? Does that even exist? Trying to be realistic and proactive. Summary: I work on a team of developers for an enterprise company with a suite of proprietary web apps. All .NET/angular & nosql cloud architecture. I was promoted out of QA into development, but have not been given opportunity to progress, or mentorship, so I've had to learn everything on my own through hard won experience and the help of online coding communities. I only recently started using AI tools since I felt early on that it would limit my learning rather than improve it (honestly they only became strong enough to really help significantly in the last two years, anyway. I don't tend to work on stuff that an AI agent from 2022 could reproduce without errors or structural issues). I believe I may be about to be laid off, so I'm looking for advice on how to continue pursuing a career as a developer (aide from just trying to apply everywhere i can, obviously) - or, what adjacent options i could pivot into given I only have an Associates degree.The whole bloody story: I've been a junior web developer for 3 years. Before that I did two years as a QA Analyst and one year of help desk before that. All at this same company. The first year I spent as a developer, I spent a lot of time online doing courses like Pluralsite, MS Learn, OSSU, etc, so I was learning, but in my day-to-day I wasn't being allowed to work on modern infrastructure the rest of the team was working on. Instead, I was made responsible for maintaining a 20 year old piece of software primarily operating on old mvc and web forms. This was mainly to free up the other developers (who are all seniors) to work on the ""important"" projects. So I was spending 8 hours a day on bad examples and barely-functional software, while on my own time trying to learn javascript, .net, c#, angular, react, my sql, rxjs, etc. I have pretty severe ADHD that I'm on medication for... that didn't go well. They knew. I made a lot of mistakes, because it was difficult to apply what I was learning to what I was working on at work. When asked to create a proof of concept in modern architecture or refactor some complex logic, I would constantly be getting confused by outdated coding patterns and structural flaws vs newer stuff like onion and so on. I brought up multiple times that this was a problem and that it was impossible for me to learn anything this way with my disability, and was ignored. It was truly a ""sink or swim"" mentality. Eventually, I was taken off of development because they weren't seeing the improvement they wanted, and given qa tasks. For an entire year, I was not allowed to work on code and was entirely support. My title did not change. They moved me back into dev in 2024 as a ""last chance."" At first this went really well. People were shocked to see how much progress I'd made, because I WAS NOT IDLE during the intervening time. I'd still been studying and coding in my spare time while I was working on QA. I work for a company that has a suite of proprietary web apps used to track their assets, and most development is done in-house. I just helped them release a modern replacement for that 20 y/o flagship product, and being that it was just released, it has a lot of user stories coming in. As you might expect. Several other devs recently left, and all of their defects and user stories were reassigned to me. Because I'm taking the heat for all of these story points, and my performance is being called into question, I've been told-without-words that if I don't improve I'm going to be terminated. The company is young and scrappy, and they ""aren't interested in being a school"". I'm completely overloaded, sometimes literally working 80hrs a week just to keep up with the pace of seniors who have 20+ years of experience, and to be honest it's really starting to affect my health. Based on the way my coworkers are talking about and around me, I feel like it's going to happen soon (possibly this week).This company is hugely toxic (its one of those ""corporate family"" environments), and during this entire process I have never received a significant raise, so my compensation is still on par with a tester. I need to leave. I've needed to leave. But the job market is in the toilet due to the seemingly endless layoffs in our sector over the last years. With recent news from Microsoft, that doesn't seem likely to change. For what is worth: i do really enjoy the work. And my coworkers. But I'm absolutely killing myself over it. I routinely have anxiety attacks. The area i live in is expensive, and I'm not making it to payday as it is. In this economy, I'm looking for any advice on either how to continue pursuing a career in development... or how to pivot into something adjacent. I'm happy to move literally anywhere as we don't particularly like the northeast anyway. To be clear: I'm quite proud of where I'm at now, as far as my capability compared to where I started. I routinely work on tasks that would be out of question for a green junior and these days my code is much more structured and predictable. I have done a huge amount of skill acquisition in the last 3 years and I'm very confident in my abilities (with or without AI). My biggest detractor is my education status which stopped at Associates degree due to health and family issues. Thanks for reading. Any advice is appreciated.

mu21g2q,"Speaking from a meta perspective, as someone who’s been working as an MLE for 3-4 years now. Companies want the perceived benefits of ML without investing into it. Their expectation vs reality is different. Obviously all executives think that throwing an LLM backend into a clean UI is sufficient for an AI-powered product, but it’s not. Even a “GPT wrapper” requires significant amount of information retrieval, validation, logging and operational signal collection, etc to not have generic AI slop polluting their product, data, and their image. Even if you don’t train an LLM from scratch (which is what most uninformed executives think ML is), there is significant overhead in solely serving the LLM for your specific use cases. That’s why AI startups, despite being ridiculous and “just a GPT wrapper” still have a legitimate case for a product. Those “other processes” are extremely nontrivial. Most companies are not even willing to invest into a “GPT wrapper”.Now consider something one step further upstream. Let’s say you want to train custom models (not necessarily LLM’s, but SSD’s, classifiers, methods of statistical inference, etc). Maybe you want to power a recommendation system or intelligent search, or you want to automate classification of support issues, etc. This requires ETL pipelines to take raw data and transform them. But this requires your web infrastructure to have instrumentation for real-time analytics and collection of usage behaviors. My point is, delivering machine learning into product is an organizational effort. Starts from the top-down. That’s why the golden data trio of titles: machine learning engineer, data scientist, data engineer, will never be as prevalent as a SWE or analysts in numbers. You could have VERY knowledgeable and talented MLE, DS, DE, but if your org isn’t willing to be data driven from the top-down, these functions will not drive any value, to no fault of these people. A company not collecting data and expecting these functions to succeed is like telling a SWE to build software for a company, but not giving them any servers to deploy on or having no critical infrastructure: CI/CD, networking, security, etc. TLDR; The number of openings for MLE, DS, DE are low because most companies are unwilling to invest into data, and even less willing to invest into ML infra and the upkeep required for industry-specific R&D.",ToastandSpaceJam,2025-05-24 19:24:39,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1kscroh,False,

Also, scale is not always just about human users - it’s not hard to imagine an application that has to make hundreds or thousands of calls just to service a single request, that is also a form of scale. Especially in the age of AI agents, this is becoming fairly routine. Alternatively, imagine some cloud storage solution like DropBox which one day might be asked to upload/download a 100 KB file and the next day asked to upload/download a 1 TB file.

But to optimize an application for high throughput, low latency, and fault tolerance at large scale? That typically requires years of experience to understand the tradeoffs and foresee bottlenecks before they throttle you.Depending on your subfield, handling traffic at scale may also require not simply writing performant code but also using specialized tooling that you’d have no reason to learn at lower scale.So yes, developing at scale requires significant skills beyond what your run-of-the-mill dev will bring to the table.",synthphreak,2025-05-22 02:28:40,64,cscareerquestions,t3_1ksf1yd,False,

muebgrm,"Same advice for anyone else who hasn't been able to find a job post-graduation. Apply to jobs, be open to the kinds of companies you are applying to. Don't think you should only work for pure tech companies. All sorts of companies hire developers. You have a gap since your graduation. It may make sense to take your graduation date off your resume. It's your call. Besides applying, studying a mix of LeetCode and practical skills. What do I mean by practical skills? Things you'd be doing on the job.* Do you understand how databases work? How familiar are you with SQL?* NoSQL?* Any cloud experience?* How good are your front-end vs back-end skills? Do you only know a language like PHP, or do you know languages that are more widely in use in corporate settings like Java, Python, JavaScript, React? * Can you build a basic CRUD app that uses REST API endpoints?* Are you familiar with Git? CI/CD pipelines?Those are a few things to get you started. I worked as a contractor at a large financial institution for a while. They were trying to fill some roles with people who graduated from a boot camp. 5/6 candidates could not answer extremely basic questions. I know everyone needs to live, but one guy said he had been driving Uber for a few months, and he seemed to have forgotten everything. The one person who was stronger ended up getting another offer elsewhere. While LeetCode has gotten more popular, there are still companies that don't use it. A challenge is finding a balance of what to study, etc. Some recruiters will tell you what their interview process is like, and others will not. A lot of people on this sub think that applying with what is effectively the same resume over and over will yield different results. Some people get lucky, but you should be trying to improve while you're looking. Otherwise, you're just someone who graduated and couldn't find a job. There are people with plenty of work experience who still don't know anything about cloud or NoSQL for example. There are tools and resources out there to become a stronger developer. It's been years since I graduated, but there's a lot of stuff that school doesn't teach you. One other thing, take any comments from the internet with a grain of salt. Looking through these comments, there's almost nothing of value in there. Remember the joke about most of this sub being unemployed students.

I work in big tech and make good money, but I do somewhat regret not taking the opportunity when I was younger.If you truly have a passion for games, I would say take the chance. You can always pivot later. Game dev is hard, and I’ve known many game devs who switched to a “normal” swe job later with great success. Going the other way is not as common.

mthtfbs,"OK, take my perspective for what it is; I'm a non-FAANG SWE.I think it is *okay.*Will it help you land a job? Probably not (unless you're trying to break into game dev).Will it hurt you? Probably not.It *could* tangentially help you by way of building skills you might otherwise not use and strengthening fundamentals like DS&A. Self learning is always a skill to keep as strong as possible, too.But everything has an opportunity cost. What field do you want to work in? What stacks (if any)? I know you previously mentioned Java/Kotlin and Android dev. Something to consider is whether you want to work in that field, or if you are applying only because you feel strongest in it.Game dev is an entirely different beast. Personally, I'm into game dev myself because I learn almost exclusively from doing. I don't work in game dev. I don't publish games. I build them (and plenty of other things) to scratch that curiosity itch to learn while keeping it interesting (for example, I couldn't care less about yet another fucking library that's going viral that everyone is raving about in X language for Y framework--I'm not on the bleeding edge and it is not my niche).TL;DR: do it, if you're interested. The only downside is opportunity cost. Honestly ask yourself: what else would you be doing if not learning some game dev? Everything has an opportunity cost. Grinding leetcode has it. Learning tons of frameworks have it. But it doesn't hurt to spend a month on something to figure out if you're genuinely interested in it. Edit: and you'll probably get lots of conflicting answers here. Were I interviewing you, I'd be **very** interested in your hypothetical game dev journey because of my own interest.

mug35yf,"English is my first language, but I learned Spanish well enough to present at tech conferences in Spanish, so I do have language learning experience.Regarding A1-A2 active vocabulary: you’ve gotta move a lot of stuff from passive to active vocabulary. Writing may be a good stepping stone to practice output without the time pressure of speaking. r/WriteStreakEN will give you daily corrections. You could even note in your posts that you want corrections that elevate your vocabulary.Also, if you have flash cards, work them in the “I need to produce English” direction. If you don’t have flash cards, maybe get started with some. I had 5000 words in my Spanish study list back when I was studying.Also: read. A LOT. Reading is huge for increasing a person’s vocabulary. Since English pronunciation and orthography are only loosely related, and we’re talking about learning new words, reading along to an audiobook may be wise to ensure you pick up the correct pronunciations.For specifically-tech stuff, watching conference talks might not be a bad idea; you can learn a lot of domain-specific vocabulary that way, and there are a ton on YouTube.Regarding filler words: spend at least one hour a week with a tutor doing conversation practice. If you can do an hour twice a week, even better. This is to get you practicing with the time pressure. As your vocabulary and production under time pressure improve, you’ll spend less time searching for words and trying to hide it with filler words. But also: are you using English filler words/sounds/phrases or ones from your first language? If first language, switch to English fillers. “That’s a really interesting question because well, you know, the thing is, when you consider all aspects of that topic…” is a nice long string of words that give you time to actually think of your answer without it just being “uhhhhh” or worse, a non-English filler like “eeehmmmmmm.”Regarding pronunciation: record yourself repeating after something you’ve just heard. Maybe you watch a technical video and pause and repeat back a sentence. Then play back the original and yourself and compare. You can do a fair bit of accent training this way. You can also hire tutors who specifically do accent coaching. If your native language has far fewer vowels than English (for example, Spanish has 5, and Italian has 7), then you will want to learn some new ones. The two Italian has that Spanish doesn’t (open o and open e) are common in English, but English also has an open i, where the tongue is placed midway between Spanish’s i and e, and the sound in “put” which is midway between o and u.",macoafi,2025-05-27 02:04:30,9,cscareerquestions,t3_1kwbg1q,False,

mtubap3,"I can empathise with you on some level. I'm also a SWE that works at big4 and constantly feel like i'm lost or not knowledgable enough. Early on, I also felt that I didn't get much mentorship and was just thrown into the deep end, asked to implement feature X, enhancement Y, or bugfix Z, in a huge codebase, with little guidance. Though, now I feel quite fortunate because I ended up learning a lot from those early experiences, a lot more than I think most devs early in their careers would.I also have felt the same way with AI, especially when it's crunch time and I need to really accelerate my output. Something that has helped me is treating it more like a search engine to find information I need, but I write the almost all the code myself. I really try to understand what it's telling me and will cross reference with other resources as well. This makes it so I really understand and know that I can backup the code I have written if i'm questioned during a PR. I also maintain a large personal document of just general CS concepts and fundementals; whenever I learn something new from AI (and confirmed it's correct), i'll add it to this document. So I kind of force myself to constantly learn and understand what i'm doing, while still reaping the benefit of AI.If you have been doing alright so far and it sounds like you spend a lot of time trying to improve outside of work, I feel like your feeling of being totally lost may largely be imposter syndrome. Sure AI can generate a lot of code, but you would still be reading and understanding it to ensure it is applicable for your situation and actually works. So I think you probably know more than you think. I also believe that completely cutting AI out would not be beneficial in the long term, because using it is a skill in itself, and is likely to just continue to get more important. Otherwise, it sounds like you're doing all the right things. Keep working on personal projects, use and learn technologies that interest you and that are in demand, and continue to challenge yourself with Leetcodes. You're still a grad (i'm assuming), you're not going to know everything straightaway and there will always be plenty more for you to learn.

mtw4tp4,"OP, listen to this advice. Don’t ask chat gpt how to write something for you. Try reading the documentation or looking at other code in the repo that does something similar and figure out why and how it works. After you write it, then ask chat gpt what it thinks or how it works but keep in mind it’s a probabilistic model so it could be wrong. Always double check with the documentation or look up articles by vetted sources that have written about the same piece of technology. It’ll give you way more insight.Technology is a huge field and there are so many layers as well as tools. I remember being a fresh new grad and even though I learned about the different components in computer systems and how memory is evicted out of ram and how different networking protocols handled communication. Getting my first internship all of that was so abstracted from me by the tools we were using that I felt like I had no idea why things were written the way they were or why we used certain tools.Take time to ask questions and learn the answers to those questions. Take notes and study them. Slowly it all starts coming together and years later you know exactly how the service or app you’re working on is leveraging the framework and language you’re using and working together with the os on the server or computer it runs on to do the things that it is doing. I will say this. I was overwhelmed at the beginning. I think most people are. I really enjoyed being able to build something by just writing some code. But it was extremely frustrating at times and sometimes I wondered if I was in the wrong profession. It took me finding out it was really rewarding knowing so much of how things worked to find passion in my career and stick with it.",ladidadi82,2025-05-23 19:48:32,2,cscareerquestions,t1_mtubap3,False,

After all the big comapnies got rid of wfh, I've never had a friend struggle for a tech job in Seattle, atlanta, or the bay in the past year even with the recession or they were new grads. ##what does that mean for you?QA, Dev ops, web dev ( just be a freelancer at first to build your portfolio ) all of these can be found at entry level. The issue people don't wanna accept is that entry level **requires past experience** the same way an junior level doctor or lawyer requries past experience. ##ExamplesLike for web dev, just do freelance contracts or programs like Dev for good. Not that hard to make a portfolio if you really liked it. For ML, just work in a univeresity research lab; many of them are paid for every student they take on and your work gets published and used in industry. A lot will even take non-students (helping Columbia with their research actually landed me at Microsoft without an application)Wanna do QA? Go to utest.com, get a few tests done and get paid for it and after 2 years you'd be overqualified for Jr roles.

mtr4e69,"I'm of the opinion that if you hyper-focus on how to get around things like AI filters, ATS, non-technical recruiters, etc, you're just going to end up writing a shitty resume. Even if you make it past these alleged AI filters, the minute a human sees an AI-oriented resume, they're going to throw it away anyways.I've never once thought about those things. I write a resume that effectively communicates my experience in a very concise way meant to pull the reader in. I've never thought about keywords, I've never thought about metrics/impact/numbers, I've never thought about AI or ATS.A good resume is a good resume.If you're not getting bites, you should be focusing on what's wrong with your resume, not how to get past ""filters"".SWE resume writing is actually a pretty well defined task. Our resumes are *technical documents*. And how to write a technical document is a full on field of study called Tech Comm. Many CS degrees have several tech comm courses in them. If you study what makes a good resume, by studying Tech Comm and what makes a good technical document, the interviews will follow. That's something that a lot of people overlook. And the rules of tech comm would *never* suggest you keyword spam to get around some AI.So that's my advice. Learn what makes a resume good (without asking others for anecdotal advice). Don't operate on the assumption that your resume is already good and focus on trying to find some sort of other problem outside your control like AI or other resume filters.",SouredRamen,2025-05-23 00:33:50,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1kt12kw,False,

If anything you should want to transfer to computer engineering.You should note that certificates are not certifications. Certificates are what you get when you finish random online tutorials. Certifications are from (paid) accredited institutions that (thanks to marketing) signal to employers you have a baseline knowledge of what you're applying for. As a college student, your best chance is through an internship. Cybersecurity jobs, at least the fun ones, are harder and much more scarce than SWE roles. Most companies do not need in-house cybersecurity roles, let alone of the offensive kind. It's definitely not something you'd do instead of SWE if you just want money. The ROI is much less.Also, for a lot of certifications, they are priced with the intention that people's employers will pay for them.

Which data structures should you use and what algorithm will you use to process your data? Think of the space and time complexity and consider if you can improve that. It helps to write little notes. Only start coding *after* you have your entire solution mapped out.

mthlera,"I make sure I leave a confident, yet very self-aware impression on the interviewers.When I am thinking, I prefer to think in silence. However, as I have been an interviewer myself, I know how unproductive this is and the impression this gives. I will therefore tell the interviewer directly: ""I prefer thinking in silence, but I will still do my best to give you an insight into my thought process"". This helps me because I can now take a silence break whenever I feel like it without feeling bad about it. It helps the interviewer know what's going on because I have explicitly communicated it. Other than that, I believe a mindset shift is due here. Let me offer it: interviewer usually wants you to succeed. We want to get a new colleague and stop the interviews and just get back to our day to day job. Very rarely people will use the interview process to bully you and nitpick. And if they do, this is not a place I want to work at. I mean this. I have experienced this, laughed back at the interviewer and hung up the conversation after saying ""thanks, this was enough information for me"". So, the more you communicate with the interviewer (who wants you to succeed), the more they will be able to help you out, throw you a bone here and there if you're struggling or outright tell you ""this is not what I am looking for"". When you start believing this person wants to help you, you'll naturally want to use this leverage. Definitely use it. A final piece of advice would be to ask a lot of questions yourself. Intelligent, directional, intentional questions. This gives you a lot more information to work with, which makes you more confident in what you're doing, which makes you calm down and be able to communicate. It additionally allows you to showcase your maturity while being on the ""offense"", so even if you have some hiccups during the coding, you give yourself better chances.

I don't really think any particular location in the US has any better or worse tech job market than another, really.

mubk7h2,"Well, not sure there's a name for this sort of stuff. The things you mention sound more like good practices, design principles, and all the jazz you collect along your career path. Some of it you'll grasp along the way, but you can always speed up the process with active engagement. Here are some good (free) resources: * [https://newsletter.systemdesignclassroom.com/](https://newsletter.systemdesignclassroom.com/) (learn system design and design principles)* [https://shipvalue.substack.com/](https://shipvalue.substack.com/) (learn how to think like an engineer and grow faster)* [https://www.youtube.com/@hnasr/playlists](https://www.youtube.com/@hnasr/playlists) (this guy is awesome, there's playlists for nearly everything you've mentioned here)* [https://news.ycombinator.com/](https://news.ycombinator.com/) (you can find great sources through this)* [https://programmingdigest.net/](https://programmingdigest.net/) (newsletter that collects various articles, I personally subscribe and feel like I get good value from it)You can find plenty of great books on these topics as well, although I'd say you can get by with articles and A LOT OF PRACTICE. You'll need to invest a lot of effort into thinking differently and deeply about the concepts you're trying to understand. These things are never clear-cut and can lead you astray if you're not sure what you're doing. Best of luck my friend!",capn-hunch,2025-05-26 10:38:45,4,cscareerquestions,t3_1kvkwe8,False,
mucush3,"""Domain knowledge"" is knowledge specific to the domain you're working in. For example, if you work for a finance company, finance stuff would be your domain knowledge. It generally doesn't transfer between domains (knowing about finance doesn't help much if you join an embedded systems company), whereas general programming knowledge (what you're describing) does.",Barrucadu,2025-05-26 15:31:32,4,cscareerquestions,t3_1kvkwe8,False,
muhtgm4,"You're dealing with fundamental computer science and software engineering concepts, not really domain knowledge in the traditional sense. These are core programming principles that every developer should know regardless of what industry they work in. Polymorphism and SOLID principles fall under object-oriented programming fundamentals, language features are just the specific syntax and capabilities of your chosen programming languages, and the ""unknown unknowns"" you mention are likely design patterns, software architecture concepts, and best practices that come up frequently in technical interviews.The good news is that these concepts are well-documented and there are tons of resources out there. Search for ""OOP fundamentals,"" ""SOLID principles explained,"" ""JavaScript/Python/Java interview questions,"" and ""software design patterns"" on YouTube and you'll find plenty of content. Focus on understanding the why behind these concepts rather than just memorizing definitions, because interviewers love to ask follow-up questions that test your actual comprehension. I'm on the team that built [interview helper](http://interviews.chat), and we've found that practicing these concepts in a conversational format really helps people internalize them better than just watching videos alone.",akornato,2025-05-27 10:54:01,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1kvkwe8,False,
