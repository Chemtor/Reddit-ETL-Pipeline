n0f2wzi,"Ask them if an LLM has ever given them the wrong answer and if they are fine making decisions based on that output. We have spent decades trying to build deterministic systems that give the right answer every time but effectively we are throwing a probabilistic system on top that will add to the error rate. Their expectation is that you one shot determine the correct answer every time and that's never going to happen no matter how much you tune it, add agents or whatever. The best you can do is reduce the error rate, but that takes some serious work with experienced people, not just something you get out of the box from some crap tool or whatever.Also the context of how the LLM got to that answer that it gives is often SQL and that's gibberish to most business users, so they can't even evaluate whether something that ""looks weird"" is actually correct or it's an obvious mistake in the SQL construction. Personally I think AI is great for tasks in which the user can evaluate the output from their knowledge like doc retrieval with links, coding assist, etc. But we are not at a point where we can blindly trust answers from AI.Kinda related, we had a call with a company that was offering some kind of vibe coding tool for data engineering. You feed it a bunch of context and it would build your pipelines with an agentic model (orchestrator/workers from what I could tell). I asked the question of how it could get to understand your source systems when the documentation is often lacking.

I haven’t done this myself yet, but something I hope to experiment with soon: build an MCP server that scans your metadata and samples the data so that it “understands your database”. You can then, in theory, hook that up to Copilot or some other LLM as the MCP host. There are probably good and bad ways of doing this, but it should in theory be doable. Someone on this sub recently posted that that they had successfully implemented this (I give this sub slightly more credence than LinkedIn lunatics).To those concerned about OP feeding private data to public LLMs: enterprise LLM products exist (ChatGPT Enterprise, GitHub Copilot, etc) and they typically have privacy/security guarantees, or so I’m told. This type of setup should only be used with those, obviously. All that being said, the most successful use case of such a setup would probably be the data team having more intelligent/aware AI coding assistants, eg using an agent to build you a pipeline that isn’t just guessing at your schemas.

n02k10h,"You need to see every state change.Take a CRM with a customer issue workflow. The issue may bounce between a variety of states through the day, and the CRM doesn't log all of the information related to the state change at the time it was made into a fully comprehensive audit log. This is even a reason why the system might have CDC enabled -- so that this in depth functionality is offloaded from the system.Alternatively, getting account balance and related details in a banking system on each transaction. Transactions may not log the actual remaining balance at the time, that's just on the account table. You might want analyses on lowest/highest value on account even during the day, or the amount of time spent below a balance level or in arrears.All sorts of tables live system back ends may provide better information if all their state changes are logged to a full history table.You might not necessarily *need* this now, but I've seen business want to convert to faster update frequencies and/or finer granularity pretty frequently. It is generally not that much more difficult to set up, and once you have the pattern set once it is just repeated for every other table.Doing it by default makes later development much easier. If it saves the work of just a single person for just one week in an entire year, that could be worth $10k/yr. Is the marginal cost of the full history more than that? Does it save so little development time? What if an ask for finer grained data came in for more tables? What's the lost value of all the data you *didn't* collect?---Speed / latency and flexibilityIf you bring this into a bronze style append-only log table, you have access to all the data essentially immediately. Any use case that could ever use just the latest state information without having to burn down the core database with excessive queries to get it will want to hit this instead. You can be constantly ingesting this data.You don't have to integrate it into SCD2 tables constantly though. You could do that daily, or hourly, or every 15 minutes, or skip it on weekends, or do it monthly, or on demand. Because the incoming data is a full change log it doesn't matter how often you run the process, it works the exact same way. It isn't like snapshots where you have to run each snapshot individually and sequentially in order to get the correct behaviour for building a history, and you run into issues when you have to skip a day due to the source system having a planned outage because your DQ checks throw up errors that you're missing a snapshot.---Efficiency with actual slow changesIf only a small proportion of the data is changing over a given snapshot period, then you don't need to be sending the 10x, 100x, 1000x, or 10_000x data volume of the full snapshot just to make the state change (including deletes) calculable. You can get away with sending significantly less data.If your integration process to SCD2 or other tables is set up properly, you can also get away with significantly less processing. Only the primary keys in the latest CDC slice will be updated, and only for SCD2 records that are currently active (or end after the CDC slice starts). You can filter the target table for the appropriate date range then semi-join on the primary keys to limit what you're working with. I've had this cut down the amount of data being processed when compared to snapshots by ~95%---Automation and concurrent usesCDC is useful for all sorts of ways to use a database, and it is a fairly generic feature. Rather than maintaining lots of manual queries to snapshot data and then having to write more scripts to export it and transfer it, some SaaS come with built-in CDC processes where you can direct the data to be emitted to lake storage, or to an event system like Kafka. It may be significantly easier for the ops team for the original database to just enable CDC and point it to somewhere you can access, rather than managing and tweaking an in-house snapshot setup.If the CDC is being evented out low latency as it occurs, it could also have multiple consumers. There may be other processes around the business that want to follow along on data level changes to trigger alerts or workflows, so that the business doesn't have to dig into the guts of a SaaS or overload the development team. If they're setting this up anyway, there's no need to then set up another redundant process for another team, they can just pull the CDC like anyone else.--- CaveatIf the data is changing extremely rapidly and outpaces the size of a daily snapshot, then you're probably not really looking at something that's typically usable as an SCD2 table, or at least one where it probably isn't helpful. You can often just have an append-only table for the CDC if all the data are essentially inserts, as would be the case for banking transactions for example. Or you might want to initially ingest into an append-only table, then on a daily run grab the last change per primarty key before midnight to generate a daily snapshot delta.In any case, for almost everything you receive, always put it into an append-only table first, then work with it from there. It almost always make later processing easier and more efficient, it really helps with being able to test or scope out changes on real data, and if anything ever goes wrong with the integrated (eg SCD2) data then you've got an essentially immutable copy that you can rerun and restore from.",azirale,2025-06-27 14:27:57,5,dataengineering,t3_1llt6y9,False,

Iceberg makes it mutable by storing copies of the metadata. This is a lakehouse.If you just have tabular data you don’t even need a lake much less a lakehouse. People like the lake houses approach because they want all their data in one place instead of tabular in datamart and PDFs in lake because then it’s easier to combine them.The exception to all this is when you have HUGE tabular data. A datamart will be too slow because it’s not partitioned. Indexing helps but eventually it’s not enough. A lake is partitioned because it’s files so if you have 5 years of data but only need to query one day you can just scan that one partition and get your data.,Trick-Interaction396,2025-06-25 23:19:51,112,dataengineering,t3_1lkkjdf,False,

mzt4ec2,"I think the question is confusing a little unstructured data (image, video, etc.) and unprocessed structured data (raw JSON, raw CSV, etc.). My experience is on structured data, so I will be answering about this.In my understanding, the value proposition of the ""lake house"" as opposed to ""data lake + data warehouse"", is to reduce the amount of tools and data pipelines required to get your data from a raw state to a state that your end user can analyze.1. data lake + data warehouse (from Hadoop ~ 2007 then cloud ~ 2015): 1. ETL 1: Raw data is extracted/transformed/loaded (ETLed, or just dumped) into the data lake. 2. Storage 1: A data lake is optimized for massive low-cost storage (S3, GCS, Azure blob, MinIO). 3. ETL 2: Data lake data is cleaned, joined, aggregated etc. into a query-able state loaded in the data warehouse. 4. Storage 2: A data warehouse is optimized for analytical-oriented queries OLAP. It is generally an expensive independent black-box service with its own internal file storage so it requires additional data transfer (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift etc.).2. lake house (from Delta Lake ~ 2019): 1. ETL 1: Same as above. 2. Storage 1: Same as above. 3. ETL 2: Same as above, but you're not loading into a separate OLAP service, you stay in your object storage and just store in a different format, a lake house format. 4. Storage 2: A lake house (Delta Lake, Iceberg, Duck Lake) is optimized for OLAP queries, but it can be created in the same massive low-cost storage as Storage 1. It relies on additional table metadata that allows replicating some of the features and optimizations that make the previous OLAP services more performant than querying a basic partitioned Parquet table. For example, compared to Parquet only, it allows: 1. transactional changes (either successful or not at all), 1. schema evolution (adding new columns without rewriting the whole table), 1. time travel to previous versions, 1. upsert/delete/merge at the file level instead of the partition level, 1. and related read/write optimizations.> 1 - One of the most common examples is the data lake populated with tons of parquet files. How different from each other in data types, number of columns etc are these files? If not very much, why not just throw it all in a pipeline to clean/normalize the data and store the output in a common warehouse?So the key with Lake House tech is you can keep using your massive low-cost object storage for your OLAP layer as opposed to loading into an expensive OLAP black box. I have not detailed the generation before ""data lake + data warehouse"" (before Hadoop), which is mostly ""OLTP + data warehouse"", as you didn't ask about it.You can find more details in this article from Databricks who makes Delta Lake: https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf> 3 - Will these technologies become the de facto standard in the near future, turning traditional lakes and warehouses obsolete?Given their killer features above, I think so. But it can be a progressive evolution of your existing data lake, you don't have to trash it. Now, ""lake house"" warehouses are still distributed ""big data"" warehouses, which means they shine in processing huge amounts of data in a reasonable time and cost, and they do that better than partitioned Parquet tables. But this is still not as performant as PostgreSQL on average data, highly specialized OLAP databases like Click House or expensive black box OLAP like Snowflake. Although, Duck Lake may be bridging the gap for average data, with its metadata stored in OLTP instead of file, and its highly performant single process C++ engine.",sib_n,2025-06-26 01:47:57,16,dataengineering,t3_1lkkjdf,False,
mzsu7it,"1. Because many, many systems don't know how to create a parquet file or the cost of adding that capability is outrageous. Many of the systems that are older, but still very functional, are also very brittle. You don't change the file format just because you want to use a different format. You have to come up with a business case that makes changing the format worth it. BTW, cost savings are a terrible way to start a discussion to get money. Figure out how to make more money by changing the file format and you may have something.2. We have heard all about the coming of semi-structured or unstructured data for years. Like cold fusion, it is just 20 years away. PDFs are a horrible way to move data. They are designed for how the information looks, not how it is held. You wouldn't believe the number of escape sequences are used to make PDFs look good. Those are very hard to get the data out of. Ask your local data scientist how much they love pulling data out of PDFs. They'll tell you it sucks. The first step to using them is to get the info out of the PDF into text and then try to make it work.3. Not even close. 90% of what you hear about these ""coming technologies"" is marketing BS.

But it doesn’t mean that your bad or you underperform. It’s just that the company’s culture don’t fit your values. Working outside shift hours is bad. There has to be some level of respect there. Not unless the role requires an on-call responsibility. Don’t be too hard on yourself, brother. On the other hand, there are also some factors that might contribute to your situation. It might be possible that your communication style ia different from the the comm style of your boss or your peers. For example, there are some people who don’t respond via email. They respond via chat. You mentioned that you tagged your boss on a doc and he seemed to miss that. So, that might be an issue. Adjust to your boss’ comm style. If he wants a chat, then do so. His email might be swamp with a lot of emails so your email might be burried in his inbox. Another thing is, in start ups autonomy is the usual culture. In corporate, it’s not always the case. There will be a lot of times that you have to have buyins from certain stakeholders. Even your boss. You need to push for approvals and sell the idea to them. Culture is really different. On the issue of passive-aggressiveness. I might be wrong on this one but have you spoken to your boss lately? Have you communicated your concerns? One possible reason that it looks like passive-agressiveness is that you don’t speak enough with your boss.In startups, speed is usually name of the game. In corporate, you can only do so much until your boss approves it. Lastly, communicate always your work. It’s important that you become visible to your boss and he’s aware about what you do.

n0gg0w0,"Upfront disclosure - I work at MongoDB. But I’ll fully upvote every comment that says you’ll have to redevelop most backend code to use MongoDB. Fact! On the other hand - an Order Management use case is perfectly suited to the MongoDB document model. Your data is not highly relational; it is highly structured. A customer places orders, and orders contain items. That can be entirely achieved in a single collection with nested fields in MongoDB. The performance will be superior. There is rarely a need for transactions in MongoDB - use a flexible document to capture the reads atomically, and if you need to update other collections that contain values use change streams. Jumping across 87TB in relational tables is inherently less efficient. Going further, if you use MongoDB Atlas, I’d expect you can use the built in archive for a majority of the customer data (orders >6 months go to archive?), adding minimal latency degradation (+1-2s? Vs sub 100ms for hot data) and massive savings, with no added code. That could half the size of your cluster and costs. But at worst, for the near hundred TB of data, you are looking at a 25 shard cluster which would be active-active and could accept east/west geo-specific writesGoing even further, how does your order management support search? Atlas will provide you order search capability within the same cluster or with dedicated search nodes. And vector search. And all of this is Highly Available starting with 4 9s of uptime with options to increase to 5 9s. So if your C-Suite is weighing in with technical requirement (active-active) - my suggestion is ask them what the business requirement is - uptime, latency - and steer them back towards doing their jobs and letting you do yours ;). And ask them what value lucene search would provide to users? And then returning to the reason for you not to use MongoDB Atlas - you will have to refactor more code. But we do offer purpose built genAI refactoring solutions to help customers achieve this. DM me or check our website.

This is definitely a very sensitive area and I think you are correct for erring on side of caution, since exfiltration or ""data leak"" risks could carry extreme repetitional risks for your company. Here are my general thoughts:- There are many procedures which do require PII. I won't get into them here, but say for instance Fuzzy Matching is involved. Sometimes the fraud team will keep these secret since if folks were aware of the nature of the detection analytics they could circumvent them. I'm referring to sophisticated stuff you can't really do this in PowerBI, not basic calculations or lookups. - If this access is absolutely necessary, the fraud team should make every effort to limit who on their team can view the data, they should have procedures for granting access, and document who has access and who approved it, ie I wouldn't advise a ""free-for-all"" but I would be pretty upset if PII was restricted. - I had access because I was one of the 'trusted few' at the company. I was maybe one of 10~ employees out of 100k employees who had the level of access needed to conduct this work, the others being legal, the CEO, CFO, etc. There were maybe 50+ other folks in my org, but the PII was masked for the rest of the employees. They could download aggregated statistics from dashboards, but not the PII or row-level data. - You may want to involve in-house Legal. Anytime I granted access to the raw PII data, we involved legal. - There are excel-level controls, like encryption and security, you can tell the team must be enabled anytime they send an email - we did this as a policy. There's no real way to enforce it, but we'd always encrypt the emails and the excel file if we ever shared it. - On that note, aren't there controls in your company which monitor the sending & sharing of Excel documents? ie if it is ever exported to a flash drive or printed? - Speculating here - I think Microsoft has a data governance tool, Purview, which might detect things like PII containing columns and restrict the sharing of the excel report? Might want to look into that. I briefly used it but can't speak to its applicability or effectiveness in this situation.

The strategies which focus on ""we need to move to databricks"" or ""data governance process will look like this"" is not a strategy. Once the context, vision, goals and objectives are in place you simply lay out a roadmap for the next X years and this is then used to kick off the initiatives in the business to deliver on the strategy. Again, this is why it's a strategy and why it leads you simply in a direction to fix where you are.The people hired, the architecture patterns, the solutions chosen and tech changes all use the strategy vision, principles and goals to keep aligned.

What's going to happen next?4. What do we do about it?Luckily, those things build on each other and can help you prioritize your work. For example, first standing up simple reporting and over time growing that into predictions and recommendations. That last part is where a data team really shows its value.You can extend, or alternatively, start this thinking by considering who your data team's end users or customers are now and, just as important, who they'll be in the future. These are usually:1. Business users: The folks looking at dashboards.2. Analysts: The folks diving into the data to answer novel questions.3. Reverse ELT: Platforms you send enriched data back to, often marketing.4. Data Science: Perhaps to answer questions 2 and 3 above, or to power your application.5. Application: Your application itself. Are you responsible for master data concepts like a single representation of a user that needs to be fed back to your platform?Once you have a sense for these things you can then think about the technical requirements that answering those four questions and serving those five customers might entail. Often, these can be grouped into two big questions (the ones we're always asking first in this sub):1. What is the volume of the data?2. What are the latency requirements for my uses?For example, making a dashboard for business users to see what happened usually doesn't require data more timely than a day. That's why so many organizations start with simple batch ELT jobs. From here, you can begin to build into the other use cases and customer needs. But, on the other hand, maybe you know that you're immediately going to be tasked with some application or data science need. Being aware of that could help you get in front of that problem and start with a more robust, lower-latency solution like streaming or microbatches from the beginning.If, like many data teams, your first responsibility is to get the business users and analysts the data they need to understand what is happening to the business, I find [Metric Trees](https://www.datacouncil.ai/talks/designing-and-building-metric-trees) to be the most useful way to think about this.

The brutal truth is that after 5+ years of experience, companies expect you to not just solve problems but to think strategically about data architecture, communicate trade-offs clearly, and demonstrate leadership potential. You might be nailing the coding challenges but struggling with system design discussions or not articulating your thought process in a way that shows senior-level thinking. The gap since March isn't helping, but it's not insurmountable if you can identify what's happening in those final interviews.The good news is that reaching final rounds repeatedly means you're close, not failing. Companies are investing significant time in you, which signals genuine interest. Try getting feedback from those rejections, even if it's just a brief call with the recruiter. Practice explaining your architectural decisions out loud, prepare stories that showcase your impact beyond just technical execution, and consider doing mock interviews with other senior engineers who can spot what you might be missing.

Such that for varchar columns, we have setup a column length if a column is varchar or if it’s a number, etc… This made development and data validation easier.

Or… create a macro with 3 levels of lengths like short, medium, long. Each have equivalent lengths.

Treat your warehouse as a feature store for documents: break sources into small, well-tagged passages, snapshot them, and pump the embeddings plus raw text into something like PGVector or Pinecone so RAG stays deterministic. Build lineage on the chunk level, then wire row-level roles into the retrieval layer; that’s way easier than hoping users classify PII correctly before pasting it into ChatGPT. Automate redaction inside the pipeline-simple regex masks won’t cut it, lean on entity detection like Presidio. Observability matters more now because any silent refresh lag will surface as hallucination, so monitor vector drift the same way you watch table freshness.

I recently told an analyst to stick my documentation and schemas into claude as well. It claims to have no need for a RAG database when fed good context. As for other tasks, llms can create boilerplate. I usually have to find the random bug and perform validation checks. For some reason, setting an integer to 0 is an optimization, lol.

The whole point is that you can run your entire application inside of a container without the overhead of an entire VM, but with the flexibility of everyone 'using the same os'.For pyspark is also just skips the JAVA and SPARK environment variables because those are just already setup for you.If you ever need to host your applications using something like docker is highly advised anyways.

But more importantly, you made up a formula that increases the payout if the player spends more, and you did it in a way that would be a **big problem** if this were a real casino. With a wager of 3 credits, the house has a significant advantage (a player will lose 1.333 credits per play on average). But with the way you're calculating payouts, a player who wagers 6 credits or more has a positive expected return per play, so they can easily just bankrupt the casino by playing repeatedly.Also, this is a much smaller issue, but your test code in `SuccessfulGameTest` seems kind of sketchy to me. For one thing, I really don't like the structure of making all your test cases being dependent on running in a specific order, because it means you can't test them separately.

Try git blaming some stuff you're interested in and just understanding one well-documented commit or PR \- Documenting things -- there's probably missing comments that are making things tricky, may as well make it easier for the next guy. Having docs for a function's dependencies makes it easier to read that function since you can now understand what it does without needing to ctrl+click into another context \- Debuggers are good, learn to use them \- Tests are good, learn to write them -- this is the core thesis of ""working effectively with legacy code"" \- Learn editor navigation shortcuts: be able to quickly navigate to that one class that you know the name of, to jump into and back out of specific functions, etcOverall, I'm fond to say ""productivity is an engineering problem.""

The goal isn’t to answer the question immediately, the goal is to track with honesty what I actually know vs. what I need to work on. For example, if I keep asking the same question 5 times across different problems, that’s an area I don’t truly understand.Bonus: LLMs are really good at pattern recognition. Once it has enough data on you, you can ask it something like ‘Based on out previous conversations on xyz, what do I know well, what are the areas where I need to improve and what learning style has proven to work best for me?’We learn in chunks.

There's a reason people say to start with tic-tac-toe or a TODO app. Building something small and self-contained is great 2. Piggyback off of existing projects. Clone some open-source repos down, poke around, see how much you can understand. Pick something small and cool to rebuild as much as you can, using the repo as a reference. That way you can see how code is built and used in the real world.2. Tutorials can be really useful, but don't just build what's in the tutorial. Change or add \*something\* so that you can apply what you've learned.3. Maybe controversial, but I strongly recommend preferring text tutorials over video. I've found that text has a number of advantages. It's more similar to reading documentation. You can easily jump around back and forth without needing to rely on timestamps or trying to skip back and forth on a video.

Make mistakes, recreate things that are already created. Don't expect that it will lead to greatness but it will help you understand why (in the case of libraries) some decisions were made. Likely you will (in some cases) run into the same constraints.For chess: why not make a chess board that lets you move a piece (and the board verifies your move is valid). that's an achievable goal. You can do it in text or using simple graphics. (graphics takes some learning but it is manageable if you set your goals low, like just load sprites for board and pieces. then displaying them in a grid. then if you cna make moves and if you make illegal moves it will stop you (just with 1 side of the pieces) you can start on taking turns with the opponent. At any of these stages you can ask for help, talk through your planned strategy. Don't literally build what people here / elsewhere tell you is 'the optimal' way to do it. You don't need to get a perfect solution , you are exercising your brain at the coding gym. It's good to get pointed in the right direction but it's important you do the work.We all feel like this. Especially at the start of a project because there are too many options. Once you start a project, the options become smaller and it will become easier to do steps forward. At some point you have removed enough unknowns for a specific problem that you have mental space to work on the problem at hand (isolated from the rest of the issues it becomes easier to think about). then you'll find you actually can work your way through it.There is a reason that in school you get given clearly defined problems with clear boundaries. It makes it very easy to focus on what you have to do. Build a datastructure that ... , build code that finds ... , etc. If you want to get a break from the high level things you can always go do some exercises but don't stick to them permanently.And when you see a tutorial, don't copy paste their solution but read it and then implement it yourself.",josephblade,2025-06-28 09:03:42,1,learnprogramming,t3_1lmc4vv,False,

Often that is, because one does not understand what exactly is happening on the lower levels of a thing.

Like Project Euler, Advent of Code, or similar. Those allow you also to write beautiful code to solve problems elegantly.

Your comments about your portfolio website suggest that you got stuck in a “I have to pick the right thing” loop, and that stalled progress… and I’m going to assume (rightly or wrongly) that a similar thing impacts other projects.If you’re anything like me… you start something, build up some good momentum, then reach a “decision point” where you’ve got multiple equally valid paths you could explore. At this point, you lose momentum, it stops being fun… and in your case, you move on to something that feels more fun again.For personal projects (and, many a time, even professional work), better to deliver *something* that isn’t quite right than to deliver nothing at all.If you accept that you might have to make big changes in the future (your “large front end revisions” you were avoiding), you can just pick something and see how it goes. If you like it, great… if not, you have another mini project ready for the future to redesign this to use some other design system (or whatever).Also, yeah, you’re going to have times when working 8 hours a day on coding leaves you not wanting to touch a keyboard when you get home.

This is convenient, but there's a cost to it; the message itself must be copied and typically you'll have to make a system call to the operating system to do it. Still, it's great when you don't have much data to send or you need to compose different programs together and make them talk to each other (as in most command shells).In the latter case, there's the risk that two different threads will edit the same piece of data at the same time. To prevent this, you can use atomic operations and/or mutexes. An atomic operation is guaranteed by the language to make other threads wait to mess with the variable until you've finished reading or writing to it.

The ENIAC computer was programmed by connecting wires between components that did addition, subtraction, multiplication, comparison, storage and so on!But of course that was very low level, and programming languages then came about, that did the job for you. You wrote ""A = B + C"" instead of plugging C and B into the addition-component, and the result into the A component.And as programming projects grew, you didn't write code for mathematical functions yourself, there were libraries for that, you write Math.sin(X) to calculate the sine value of X, you never write the lower level calculations yourself.When programmers repeat code, then instead write functions to reuse, and when those functions are needed a lot in every project, they become part of a shared library, or often the programming language itself. No one writes code to sort a list alphabetically, there's always a built in .sort function, that you don't even need to know how work.And when you write applications that look a lot like each other - say a web-interface to administer a database with users and their logins - you don't write the same code over and over, but do it once, and create a framework, or even easier, use a framework written by someone else! **But!** And this is the important part! - There's always something missing! The application you are working on will always need some feature that isn't in the framework, or library, or language, and then you have to write it yourself. You always have to ""dive down in between the cracks"" and write filler-code for that one thing or another. And also, to connect the components you still use very basic programming at the lowest level available in the language, variables, for-loops, if-statements and functions are still as important building blocks as they have ever been. So you won't get away from needing to understand basic coding - but mostly you don't have to write very much from scratch, you almost always build on something existing!",peterlinddk,2025-06-28 08:13:53,27,learnprogramming,t3_1lmgojn,False,

So I'll write a class that handles using an HTTP client to pull down data from an API and do something useful with it. Cool. Now I have something that can be plugged into a larger system to do other things based on that data. Rinse, repeat until you have a program that's solving a unique problem (or solving an old problem in a new and hopefully better way). A core rule of our craft is ""don't reinvent the wheel"".

Hackers seek to understand the problem and the machine and be able to derive a solution from the combination. No catalogues necessary. Of course, people are always a mixture of both to a greater or lesser extent. But at least in terms of hackery, programming is NOT bolting together things we already knew.

It might make the code look better, something like: switch(command) { case 1 -> generateRandom(); case 2 -> generateWithLength(); case 3 -> generateWithLetter();and so on. But it is a matter of taste.You could benefit from making a single method for reading a valid number from the input - something like: `getValidInput(int[] numbers)` that would only return one of the numbers in the array, or zero if something else was entered by the user. That would isolate your use of scanner to that method alone, and make the rest of the code easier to write without having to handle exceptions or different invalid inputs.It is always a good idea to have a lot of small methods that only do one thing - my own personal rule is that if I have more than two levels of if-statements or loops, I need to make a method to combine them.

However, later on, when you *use* `dCons`, your code looks like this: dCons[random.nextInt(40)]Here, you have explicitly hardcoded the length of `dCons`. In the future, if you ever manually edit your code to change what is in `dCons`, you will need to update *two* places in your code — 2a and 2b. That's not good, because it's important that those two places in your code stay in sync.Instead, it's better to remove the hard-coded length in 2b, and have it *read* the length, via something like `dCons[random.nextInt(dCons.length)]`. This way, if you ever manually edit your code to change what is in `dCons`, you will simply need to update *one* place in your code, and everything else will automatically adjust.",abrahamguo,2025-07-01 12:30:55,1,learnprogramming,t1_n0pmbf6,False,

In fact, even if you combined the methods, we would still have two separate blocks in the code that we would have to keep in sync with each other, even if they are near each other — the block of `System.out.println`s, and the `switch`/`case` that lists all the functionality of each of the actions.Instead, what I'm recommending, is to restructure your code so that *each individual* action name is immediately adjacent (in the code) to the *logic for that specific action*.You can do this by putting the logic for each method into a [lambda expression](https://dev.java/learn/lambdas/), and creating a data structure that stores all of the action names alongside their lambda expressions.",abrahamguo,2025-07-01 12:43:43,1,learnprogramming,t1_n0pmbf6,False,

You won't always have the benefit of knowing exactly what was going through the authors head when interacting with a class.

Plus, that leaves room for error. You or another developer later on might forget to check. But you could define it with a getter that checks initialization and executes lazy initialization if its not done. Now that initialization logic exists in one place, and you never need to worry about checking for initialization when using the object. And you don't have to worry about some other developer down the line writing dangerous code into your class that forgets to check initialization.Similar with constructors.

However, if you wanted to do something like clean the input - check bounds, convert type, etc., - or fire an event or something when the value is retrieved or written to, this is where a getter or setter is really valuable.C# does a better job of this, IMO, but getters and setters are the norm because globally accessible variables are a HUGE no-no in virtually every application.Most often setters are the complicated ones and public getters that just spit out the value of the variable are pretty common. However, one case I am currently using right now of a more complex getter is that I have to retrieve the firmware information of a co-processor that talks to my primary MCU application over a serial connection. I request that information and cache it when the program starts, but if I call my version getter and that value is invalid for whatever reason (firmware update, mainboard resets, etc) I can spin up the serial port and request the info again, then return the new information or an error code. From the application perspective, I am just getting the firmware version and it doesn't really concern itself with how. I don't have to almost ever change that code, and it can be reused in other places so that if I ever change how the firmware version is retrieved, it's in one spot and makes my job much easier.

How do you figure out why it's being set to 100007? With a setter you can put a break point (or a conditional break point) in the setter, then trace up the stack to see where and why it's being set to 100007.As for getter, unfortunately with java if the variable is public then if it can be got it can be set.

More on that at the end.Presumably, in a real (not a learning exercise) program, many of your variables have constraints that require validation, eg can a person's age be negative or higher than 200? Can their name contain unprintable characters or whitespace like tab? These constraints are put into the setters, and signal an error if the attempt to set them to an invalid value is made. Getters protect data that the user can see, but should not change. For example, with the person, you can maybe look at their address when making a map of your customers but this is not an appropriate place and time to be changing the values -- a getter can provide a look without letting you accidentally modify it. To modify it you must deliberately call the setter rather than just an oops side effect on a free wheeling variable. But when the getters and setters do nothing, and they often will, their only purpose is to keep it consistent. These 10 values have getters and setters and those 5 do not in class A, those 18 do not and 11 do in class B, .. C, D, E, ... after a few classes, remembering which variables in which classes have getters and setters is overwhelming. If you just assume they all have these functions and use them for everything, its that much less burden on the programmer.

n0lv4z2,"User space (virtual) threads here are opposed to kernel space threads.Kernel space threads are expensive resources; they are few, and each is capable of running roughly the same amount of computations.User space threads were created as we recognized that most of the time, our expensive and limited kernel space threads are just waiting, rather than executing any operation, so by applying virtualization, you can generate as many threads as necessary to do the waiting, which requires little to no CPU time.An example here would be waiting for 10000 I/O operations. This could easily be handled by a single kernel thread when it comes to CPU load, so it makes perfect sense to create virtualized threads, which expose the same API as a kernel thread, but all run on a single kernel thread.When faced with CPU-bound work, however, user space threads are simply not that useful. No matter how you slice your algorithm, you only have a fixed number of threads capable of independent computation, so even if you run 10 thousand virtual threads per kernel thread, all of them together can execute only as much real computation (not waiting) as the kernel thread itself. Of course, since managing user space threads has some overhead, this is also a net negative in performance for CPU-bound work.Modern server applications are rarely CPU bound, though, so feel free to go as far as you want with your millions of user space threads, like Go has shown to be completely possible and manageable.",HQMorganstern,2025-06-30 17:00:58,9,learnprogramming,t3_1lobtvf,False,

n0lyoho,"This is actually dependent on whether the OS scheduler can reliably have threads run on different physical cores. With some server products, it absolutely can. If your program executes on a single core, there's no benefit. Multithreading (and lightweight async execution) lets a program benefit from context switching where a blocked thread can surrender the cpu until its data arrives. The OS scheduler will do this with processes as well. As long as the thread can still do work on the cpu, there's no point in switching off. Also, do note that cpu cores are pretty good at parallelizing independent work and simulating in order execution. We've had cpus with multiple ALUs per core for example since the 90s and the hardware will dispatch parallel instructions as long as there's no dependency within the execution window. You as a programmer don't have to specifically ask for this. The same is true for things like hard disk caching.On the multiple cpu issue, it is worth testing or reading more about if you need this. There have been notorious cases like Playstation where hardware designers shipped multi-core hardware only to find that the OS hardly ever used more than one and never more than two. On the flip side, there are cases like Sql Server on Windows, where the server absolutely can scale across cores to process large volumes of data. I know that's an IO bound load, but often the whole load is aggressively cached when the request comes in so there's low latency.",Far_Swordfish5729,2025-06-30 17:17:13,1,learnprogramming,t3_1lobtvf,False,
n0mwuja,"It can be, if the executor of the user-space threads is itself multi-threaded and runs on multiple system threads.User-space threads are designed to solve a very specific issue - to reduce the time a system thread needs to wait on operations that block (think: locking a mutex, waiting for IO, waiting for timer,...). It is implemented thusly:Instead of calling blocking APIs, we call their non-blocking alternatives . The non-blocking version of the API works the same, but instead of blocking, it returns ""would block"" error.A user-space thread is a state machine. The states are the values of thread-local variables at the points where blocking operation is called. Advancing a state means executing all the code up to the operation that would block.This advancing of states is done by an executor, which runs directly on a system thread. The executor has a set of user-space threads. It advances a user-space thread up until the point it calls a ""blocking"" that would block. It then tries to find another user-space thread in the set, which no longer blocks and can be advanced. If all the user-space threads in the set are blocked, the executor (ie. the system thread its running on) blocks, until one of the user-space threads unblocks (operating-systems do have API that lets you wait on multiple blocking operations simultaneously, until one of them unblocks).As you can see from this, user-space threads are completely useless for CPU-bound tasks (ie. tasks that don't wait on blocking operations). You might as well just directly run such tasks as a sequence, because that's exactly what a user-space thread executor will end up doing (likely with some additional overhead).HOWEVER! A user-space thread executor can be parallelized using system threads. You spawn multiple system threads (as many as your computer has cores) aka. a thread pool. Each system threads runs an executor, but they all share the same set of pending tasks. Now the tasks (in our case, user-space threads) can actually truly run in parallel.That being said, user-space threads, as tasks for thread pools, is not the best abstraction for CPU-bound tasks. If you don't divide the work evenly between the user-space threads, then some of the system threads in the thread pool will be busy with big long tasks, while the rest are parked, waiting for something to do.A better abstraction are tasks that can be automatically broken down into sub-tasks that can be done in parallel. That way, the thread pool can automatically spread the load among the system threads. For example ""apply this operation to each item in a list"" can be easily split into processing sub-ranges of the list, or even individual items.This is why pure functional paradigm has gained some notable traction in the last decade. It is trivially parallelizable, because the program is ultimately a tree of function calls where branches (ie. evaluation of arguments) can be evaluated independently of one another.Imperative code, much less so, because it essentially describes a sequence of operations that are expected to be executed in order. Transforming that sequence into multiple independent parallel sequences (ie. threads) is not trivial.",kohugaly,2025-06-30 19:59:53,1,learnprogramming,t3_1lobtvf,False,

Usually one process:one app but when you can and want to utilise multiple CPU cores you need more processes. That usually gets called multi threading but that's not what your operating system, or my concurrent computing textbook calls it.In my experience outside uni, both these things tend to get called threads without much care for the very important distinctions. Like I'm seeing people talk about user vs kernel threads and it kinda sounds like when they say kernel thread they mean what I've called a process above. However windows and Linux both provide a kernel feature that matches my definition of a thread above. Not having a go at anyone we're all just using words the way we were taught to.

Never implement an algorithm, if some exists in the language/library/framework you are using! Don't choose a sorting algorithm, use the built-in sort, that is always the most efficient one!

So it is also necessary to track down real JavaScript ""source code"" (i.e. unminified code) to learn how people are writing this.Nowadays a lot of people also write TypeScript as the source code, which ""compiles"" (sometimes called ""Transpiled"" in this context) down to plain JavaScript.

n0q4i1u,"This is one of the best questions I've seen in a while. It's really nice to see someone trying to clarify something about the interaction of the language with the environment it's running in.`scanf()` is not moving the cursor. The OS is. Well, the terminal application is, with the help of the OS (and possibly BIOS). It turns out that the cursor advances all the time. Like when you type in the command to compile:```$ _$ g_$ gc_$ gcc_```After each character typed, the cursor advances (most of the time). But terminals are very complex things. Suffice to say that the terminal--with the help of the OS--manages receiving keystrokes and ""sending them"" to the application.IOW, the terminal receives the keystrokes. It does what it usually does; advances it when you type a character, retreats it when you type backspace, etc. Then, after it does what it needs to (though there are exceptions, like what happens when you press `Ctrl-C` on a Unix-like machine), it tells your C program: ""Hey, someone pressed a character, here it is."" Then, you do whatever you're going to do with it.It's somewhere from ""a little"" to ""way more"" complicated than that in realities, but that's the general idea. Just to finish this up, the complexity can come around buffering, which is how many character the terminal and OS will hold before sending them. If it sent every character, one at a time, that could be inefficient, so sometimes terminals and OSes buffer. Generally, in terminal applications, hitting `` will force/suggest the underlying bits (terminal, OS) to send the data to the application. Also, it's the terminal that decides to move the cursor down (newline), and then return to the left-side on English/Western locales (carriage return).If you're curious about how terminals work on Unix-like machines, check out **Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment** by Stevens, often abbreviated ""APUE"".",qruxxurq,2025-07-01 08:28:40,8,learnprogramming,t3_1lovxji,False,

n0q7vlr,"In a traditional environment with a serial terminal connected to a remote computer, keyboard input to the terminal is sent to the remote computer to be handled as program input, and output from a program is sent from the remote computer to the terminal for display.Most of the time, the cursor is placed after the last output character sent from the remote computer. Sometimes other characters change the cursor position, like a carriage return moving the cursor to the beginning of the current output line, a line feed moving the cursor down one line, a backspace moving the cursor backward one character, and other special escape sequences can move the cursor in other ways (such as to a specified row and column).Also in most cases the operating system terminal driver echoes characters input on the terminal back out to the terminal. This may happen automatically in the terminal driver without the remote program having to do anything, but the terminal driver can also be put in a mode where automatic echo is disabled and the program must deliberately echo input characters if it wants to. A text editor, for example, may set non-echoing mode so that editor commands are not echoed when they are typed, and instead output from the editor program displays the results of performing the command.The terminal driver in the operating system usually also handles input in line mode, meaning that an entire line of characters followed by a ENTER is buffered up and made available to the program after ENTER is pressed. But the terminal driver can also be put into a mode where every keypress from the terminal is immediately available to the program, rather than being held and sent when ENTER is pressed.In modern computers the terminal is often a program that emulates the behavior of a serial terminal, because the serial terminal model is so pervasive for managing program input and output.In a simple program, output to the terminal is what moves the cursor, so calling scanf() does not cause the cursor to move, and if the terminal driver is in its normal mode of echoing input, it's the echoed output of input characters, or output from the program, that moves the cursor on the terminal",stevevdvkpe,2025-07-01 09:02:59,2,learnprogramming,t3_1lovxji,False,

The Odin Project is probably a good start though. I will however give you a great starting reference guide though - [https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)This is a site that not only has documentation for just about anything you can do with HTML/CSS/Javascript(these three were as deep as we got) but also includes built in environments to start messing around and see what happens when you change different values. One thing I do recommend though - learn HTML at least reasonably well before you move onto CSS. CSS is an *amazing* tool that basically acts as templates. It makes a lot of things much easier to do but it's important to know *how* they work under the hood if you want to really get your skills up. Trust me, HTML is not hard and you can get up to speed relatively quickly. Our course was like once a week for 12 weeks and by the end we could make functional websites with decent designs.One amusing thing about HTML compared to other languages - it does not care how bad your coding is. It will try to run it anyway. You can have a garbled mess of garbage that god himself will not forgive under the hood and as long as the important parts are functional it'll still go, as opposed to other programming languages that tell you to die in a fire if you miss one bracket. Just something to keep in mind - your code may work despite being terrible(professor asked me ""what the hell is all this doing?"" one time when I had a solid 30 lines of broken code) so use some attention to detail to keep it clean.Hope that helps a bit, best wishes!",NewMarzipan3134,2025-07-01 12:03:23,1,learnprogramming,t1_n0ozyw1,False,

n0api7b,"Most mature frameworks have roughly the same capabilities overall. For the back-end, in my view Python frameworks and Node/JavaScript frameworks are equally capable. I personally prefer more structured languages, like C#, Java, and C++. I actually prefer C++ (I use the POCO library) overall because it lets me write the fastest code possible, and to access other C/C++ libraries directly (most of the core libraries you'll use in any backend framework are based on C++). But I learned to program long ago and I'm in the minority on that.For front-end, you are ultimately always working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. There are a ton of pre-processors that can compile, obfuscate, and otherwise turn code from some other source format into JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. For my part I just use those basics straight, usually with jQuery. But I've also used JavaScript compilers like esbuild (which I like because it's very fast).So I think it's largely a matter of taste and people tend to mostly use what they already know.I think the main constraints are (1) if you're writing server code that needs to be very fast, you either need to master something like numpy or the equivalent JavaScript libraries, or use C++ or rust. In my opinion, it's easier to use a fast language like C++ instead of trying to cleverly use numpy or other C++-based libraries to make a slow language like Python faster. And (2), because front-end code is always in JavaScript, if I'm using a scripted back-end language I'll prefer Node over Python, just to keep everything in the same language.",parseroftokens,2025-06-28 20:17:18,1,learnprogramming,t3_1lm6sad,False,

You will also learn to appreciate higher level languages, and understand some of the ""whys"" in their design.Then, in parallel, python is just a great scripting language for quickly getting something done, can teach you how higher level languages work, and many big projects use it.After knowing enough of those two, i would suggest trying to understand what you like and want to learn/work at, and either pick another language popular in that domain or stick with C/Python.",CyberWank2077,2025-06-28 16:54:16,2,learnprogramming,t3_1llyauj,False,

As your manager or mentor, I would want to work with you on that preoccupation because it can be career-limiting. Your focus should be on adding value rather than making sure you are getting “credit” for every thing you do. HR would tell you that is what your compensation is for and you can document on your self-assessment for your performance review. I would never utter the word “credit” again as this all transpires.Having said that, this is a wonderful opportunity and quite flattering for anyone, never mind someone early in his career. I would suggest writing a lengthy email about your concerns. You can start it with, “As the architect of this process ….. it has come to my attention… and in order to ensure maximum success…. I want to make everyone is aware xxxxxxx” List the important stuff, like why you think this won’t scale and why each instance needs to be customized. But offer fixes to the problems as well. How can this be customized so that it does work for other departments? What work effort would be required? Be specific and as lengthy as you need to be, as you will be saving them time and possible embarrassment. Also, if it doesn’t scale, you could end up being blamed, (“who created this in the first place”)Send your email to all interested parties and cc: your boss. Again, make sure the email is emotionless, fact-based and solely focused on you trying to help the company and the team to succeed. Of course, this also serves as your documentation that you are the originator.Try not to assume the worst in people.

n0id4vb,"I am a mobile eng at a FANG. Generally speaking, if you are just building user-facing features, Android has a lower ceiling as most of the hard problems should be taken care of by the backend. You aren't going to build something out of a system design interview in your day to day.But here are some examples where you CAN differentiate yourself:1) Building frameworks / features in a way that's easy to iterate on. What if your app wants to show every new UI screen with a certain template that serves a nice entrance and exit animation? Okay, now you have to build that animation out. But it would be inefficient for every engineer who wants to add a new screen to deal with that themselves, so you build it in a way with enough abstractions / modularity that it's easy to use for other use cases.2) Finding and solving problems that nobody knows exist, because they're not directly attributable to the product. Maybe your app startup time is too long, or you lose a lot of users while a certain page loads. You have the ability to improve this stuff and see incremental but significant gains in engagement.3) Influencing the backend / APIs - the backend doesn't always know exactly what's needed and what's possible from a mobile perspective, or edge cases that might arise. Being good at your job means you participate in these discussions, not just showing up to plug in their fully baked implementation to the mobile appI'd also add this: judging the value of an engineer solely in the context of ""What technically difficult problems can they build"" as if you need to be building something worthy of a case study in an algorithms textbook is a very junior way of thinking.",PlasticPresentation1,2025-06-30 02:09:49,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1lnk40f,False,

He reached out to another exec at her new company, pointed out her posts, and said it would be risky to keep her on. Another is that some companies love to sue. This is especially true when people sign a non-disparagement clause in a severance agreement.

This guy was a higher level engineer who basically developed everything and went out of his way to make the code 100x better and refactored. But he also was the AH engineer who cut people off, wanted to get in arguments over any little disagreements and would go on rants for over an hour if someone dared to disagree. People def walked on eggshells for him. The thing was, I think he basically knew there was very little they could do to fire him. This was in FAANG for a product that had many big time customers. Even with his AH behavior, he produced results even in his sleep. In my opinion he was like what teammates say about michael jordan, he wanted it so bad he didnt care if he was an asshole about it. It sounds great in sports but in an office job, it doesnt sound as great. He would tell my manager how to do his job. I could tell my manager hated the guy too but just was complacent with him.One time I worked with him on something major. I could tell he hated my work ethic. Im not saying I was perfect but I felt like I was getting a hand on the work at that point. When I was done, my manager decides to have a 1:1 to discuss my work with him and I basically get a list of what I could've done better. I accepted it and tried to improve on it. But guess what was in my next review session when I got underperforming, all the shit that the higher level engineer had said about me. I accepted some that I felt I could've done better but tried fighting the ones I felt were unfair. One that I remember the most was that there was a merge I did that had too many commits. I admit that it did have more commits but it was because the change we worked on had like 20 different iterations because everytime I wrote one change in, it broke something unexpected so it was a lot of trial and error. That one merge was an outlier from all my other work but it was used against me for the following year. I got Pipd shortly after.I saw the writing on the wall but I gave the company 110% and then I got fired early this year, a year after I worked with that guy.

It sucks that you are getting singled out, but you might be working on particularly sensitive or critical stuff and that might justify a much stricter review process.2. If you think it’s unjustified then you could try and have a 1:1 chat with the person in private and try to figure out what the problem is. You should not assume malice, they might be very busy. If you made an RFC previously, you should be ready to say you solicited feedback early and these concerns never came up, and that you’re finding it difficult to make progress at the moment because this late feedback is asking for major overhauls. You’re hopefully looking for them to back down, or for compromise, and to figure out how to avoid this problem in future.

Lots of solid devs are struggling to land something.For JavaScript full-stack, Id say React, Node.js, Express and PostgreSQL combo is still the most in demand combo. Its not the shiniest anymore but companies actually use it in production. Next.js is also huge right now if you wanna go that route.The thing is, at this point its less about picking the ""perfect"" stack and more about getting really good at one thing. Companies would rather hire someone who's solid at React than someone who kinda knows React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte.We see this at Metana all the time. Students who try to learn everything end up not being great at anything. The ones who pick a stack and build 2 to 3 real projects with it are the ones getting hired.Build stuff that actually does something useful. Not another todo app lol.

To a person, a lot of bad, bad things happened to them, and the sacrifice including their lives, their mental and physical well being, and years of time. You may be too young to remember war, but we've done it, and we'll likely do it again, so I sort of agree with your Dad: not worth the risk.You might be a little bit better than my friends (mostly ground pounders or support during the Iraq surge), but even ""smart"" veterans who end up at fancy language schools and in the drone program have incredibly high rates of PTSD and all sorts of other problems.If it's the absolute last option, and you get a good MOS, there are clear benefits: like a great social welfare program for veterans that includes healthcare and other entitlements, and maybe some skills in a specialized area that can apply to cyber security. That said, the military is no jobs program, when in you exist to serve, and that service is a sacrifice. If you want to fight, if you want to serve, do it, otherwise, you could easily end up worse off where you are today, in ways that will be difficult for you to imagine right now.Therefore, you need to try harder to make what you have now work.

Not just because you want to join, everyone was multiple reasons, but at the end of the day men will be relying on you in your role, and your ability to bite the bullet and work harder for your boys is what matters. If you do it solely for your own career and everyone/thing comes second, life will suck for others, and as I've seen personally, men will die. If you do that, fuck you.2. There's lots of roles related to this field, particularly in the AF. Look into those.3. If you do it, and serve honorably, you will not regret it. Of all the good, the bad, and the ugly, and there was a lot of ugly, it's the greatest point of pride in my life and I'm thankful every day that I did it. I gained so much, both materially and non-material. 4. Talk to actual vets/actives about it. Do NOT listen to anyone here who did not serve. My DMs are open.

I just sorted my system out and noodled around company docs. Fortunately it's a remote position, so I just got to hang out and play videogames in the dead space. Not as much fun to do nothing all day when it's onsite. Sorry homie.It sounds like you're doing the best you can. I'd ping your manager again just to check in and see where things are at, but not in a *needy* way. Just ask if there's anything you should be doing while you wait on the onboarding stuff, but I'd try to write the message in such a way that you are not concerned/bothered by it. Not a great move to annoy your manager on your first week, but it is still their job to...do something.

Was it *actually* 3 minutes? Not even 10? That's an alarmingly short intro call. If that's the case, I'd be prepared for him to be a very dont-give-a-fuck sort of manager.

n0qzoaj,"I was laid off back in Feb and am in the third week at my new job now. I have 7.5 yoe and was able to get a lot of initial interviews. I made it to the late stages with five different companies, all past the technical round. But was rejected from three. I was able to end the prices with one when I got the offer at my current job What follows is my anecdotal experience. Companies are extremely picky right now. I would feel really strong about my interview performance. I would connect with the hiring managers and the CEO or CTO. I would feel great about my technical round performance. Then I wouldn't get the role. The reasons given, because I would always ask for feedback, were typically that I performed well, but someone was a better fit. Which makes sense. There were probably five hundred or more applicants. But a few of those I would see the same job posted a week or two later, those were frustrating. My advice is to keep a pipeline going. You want a few of those initial recruiter interviews a week so that you have a couple of technical and later stage interviews going at all times. The process seems slower than it used to, like a month or longer from application to offer. And give yourself grace. This is really difficult and you are going to get down on yourself.

n060xrk,"I’ve done three major moves in my career. First team was, after several rounds of layoffs, down to me and a guy that was there for less than six months. That time I’m there was very little emotion. The next team I worked on, I spent 6 years going from a mid-level to and lead. Over 4 years I got to build out an awesome team. Not just developers, but a few BAs, a PM, and a QA team. This was for two huge projects. Nothing makes people close like time in the trenches. We all became great friends. After the second project launched, I needed a change of scenery and a great remote opportunity opened up that would allow me to move home. Resigning from that team was the hardest decision I ever made. Some of those developers couldn’t hardly write OOP code when they started with me and by the time I left, we were a well oiled machine. Not a day goes buy 2 years later that I don’t think about them.The last two years I had the chance to build a software dev practice from near scratch. It has been a great experience, and some of the folks I’m really going to miss when I leave in about two weeks. This time I knew it was the right decision to leave (bad culture fit, lost a big contract for reasons the dev team had no control over, inconsistent / lack of full time adjacent support, and never ending dangling of carrots that always vanished when they were to materialize). Am I going to miss my team? For sure. Some have become friends like my last team. But the reality is that for them to grow as well, I need to move on. They rely way too much on me and I failed to get them to fly on their own because of pressure from the top to deliver now now now. My new role is a director of software engineering, so it’s going to be a new experience for me… but I will always appreciate the folks I work with daily. I don’t think leaving good people is ever easy. It’s great when you can challenge each other just the right way, attack problems with some out of the box solutions, and just being nerds together in general. At the end of the day though, you have to worry about your and your career progression.

Full stack experience at a small company where you're leading features? That's valuable real-world experience that beats a lot of what new grads get at big companies where they might spend 6 months just learning internal tools.For getting into big tech eventually, it really does come down to two main things: 1) having solid fundamentals, and 2) being able to communicate your experience well in interviews. Your portfolio projects + the feature leadership experience you mentioned gives you good stories to tell.Don't bother with a masters unless you want to go into research or very specialized areas. The time you'd spend in school could be better used gaining more experience and prepping for interviews.Practical next steps: Start doing leetcode regularly (like 15-30 min daily), practice explaining your projects clearly, and start applying to mid-size companies as stepping stones. Companies like Shopify, Slack, Stripe etc often have good engineering cultures and pay well but aren't as competitive as the absolute top tier.For the behavioral side of interviews - this is where a lot of engineers struggle. You need to get good at telling stories about your work using frameworks like STAR.

n06wic8,"First accept that you can build a great career outside of big tech. It may not be the most exciting work, but it pays well and leaves you enough energy to live the rest of your life. The old guys I know in this business, do not give a shit were you used to work. They barely care where they worked. And no one outside this business cares who you work for. Now, how do you advance your career. Try to stick it out for two years in your job (but it's okay to bail if a better opportunity comes along...becoming the CTO of your buddy's start up is not a better opportunity), then move on to the job, work another couple of years, three if you like it. Then move on. Every time you change jobs, you will get more money. More importantly, you will increase your breadth of experience. You'll be exposed to more approaches to development. Which will make you better able to advocate for one approach over another. It will also help you understand what really matters vs. what's just noise.Eventually, you'll want to start increasing your time in jobs just to show you're not a job hopper. However, you wil reach a point where it really doesn't matter. My default advice is keep your linkedIn profile up to date, turn on the quiet open to work flag, and respond to every recruiter that isn't a clear scam, even if it's to say, ""thanks, but this isn't the right opportunity for me"". My average is about three years.You do this for a while, and big tech companies will start to notice you. They may not be FAANG, but the pay is good.The most important thing to remember is that your career is a business.

The thing is, there's no one ""right"" path and those social media posts are just highlight reels.And The masters thing? Honestly depends on what you want. If you're eyeing specific roles that require it, sure. But experience and strong interviewing skills usually trumps another degree.On the comparison side, remember that for every person posting about their Meta offer, there are thousands of successful devs who took different paths.

When I would have my 1:1s with more senior folks I always asked “what career advice do you have” and a lot of them would joke “work at big tech out of college” which I was fortunate enough to do, but also highlighted that most people with those jobs weren’t in that position. Post uni if you aren’t given a golden ticket from graduating (Ivy+, FAANG internships, etc.) you’ll actually have to prove yourself. This means working in jobs where you have impact and actually do stuff. While it will probably be harder than resting and vesting, it will push you to have the work ethic required to be truly successful in this field. FAANG folks get paid a lot more, but aren’t really noticeably smarter from what I’ve seen. Plus after spending 3 years supporting the migration of a survey modal at big tech you might realize you weren’t really doing as much as you would have expected.

Since you’re already using JS, and it sounds like you’re going the web dev route so far, I recommend doing [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths).

The problem is that your team isn't putting in the necessary work to ensure that emergencies don't happen and there are no mitigation strategies for when they inevitably do occur.Your team has a lot of bad practices/habits and unless your team is willing to recognize the problem, it's only going to get worse.

I'd suggest focusing on system design first since that's what'll get you to senior architect roles fastest.But something most people miss is that you can actually grow within your current crappy role. Those support tickets? Start asking why they're happening. Is it bad error handling? Poor user experience? Scaling issues? Then propose solutions during team meetings. Even if they don't implement them, you're thinking like a senior engineer.Document everything you fix and the impact. ""Fixed authentication bug that was affecting 15% of users"" sounds way better than ""did support tickets"" on your resume.Also, start a side project that mirrors what you wish you were doing at work.

If you're applying to a .NET position, flesh out your .NET portion so people can see you have the depth of experience they need. If applying to a Python position, emphasize your Python experience. Asking about *why* you have to do that is spitting in the wind. You only have so much space for your resume, so why waste some of it on fleshing out skills that aren't relevant to the job you are applying for? If you do that, peopel are going to want to know *why* there isn't more verbiage that is *directly applicable* to the position.

n04y9ca,"My dude. You have been doing this for a year. Everyone knows you are not good enough and no one is expecting you to be. There is a reason you are a junior dev and not a senior dev.That being said a few words of advice from someone who's been doing this for 11 years. 1. The fact that you can acknowledge this at all and care about it puts you ahead of the game. This was all of us at one point, myself included. I basically lied to get my first job because I was so desperate and then I had to deliver. What did I do? I wasn't the smartest person in the room but I was willing to work more than anyone around me. I worked nights and weekends, not every one but when I had the time, I was working all the time. You don't have to do this forever, but I would recommend this to any dev new on the job. Absolve yourself of the idea of ""work life balance"", cause if you wanna be good and you aren't naturally gifted, its not gunna happen. Don't get me wrong, I still played hard on the weekends when I had time, but most likely, you are young and have very little responsibilities and you need to take advantage of that. Yourself in 10 years will be on your knees thanking you.2. I had a great professor in college that told me something I never forgot. ""A great developer has read for 15 minutes for every line of code he writes"". You need to read. Read everything, read all the docs of all the tools you're using, know them front and back. Read books, clean code, clean architecture (these are terrible books btw but you need to know them), gang of four, anything you can get your hands on about programming, read it and know it.3. You need to be kinder to yourself. Believing that you can do it is 90% of the game. Instill some fight into your spirit and dig in. No one is going to advocate for you like you can advocate for yourself. Positive affirmations, whatever it takes, you have to believe you are capable.

That's not junior dev stuff, that's some architecture level thinking. Your team lead probably just wants you to build confidence before throwing you into the deep end, not because you suck.The competition anxiety is real tho. When I was building startups, I'd see people constantly worried about being replaced by someone cheaper/smarter/faster. But something Ive learned is that average devs who can communicate well and understand business problems are actually gold.About the PM pivot tho, honestly, it could work. You already have dev background which most PMs lack. You understand technical constraints, can talk to engineers without sounding clueless, and you've got that project leadership experience.But before you jump ship completely, maybe try focusing on becoming a technically aware PM rather than abandoning code entirely. At Metana, we see tons of people who started as ""average"" developers but found their niche by combining technical skills with other strengthsAlso don't let imposter syndrome make you quit something you might actually be decent at. Maybe you're not the next senior engineer, but you could be a damn good technical PM who actually gets how software works.Give yourself more time to figure out what clicks for you before making the full pivot :)",darkstanly,2025-06-25 07:01:27,9,cscareerquestions,t3_1ljwf31,False,

n0rwqc6,"You're not dumb. From my experience, 99% of new devs (interns, salaried, contract, whatever) get that same feeling when jumping into an established company with an established codebase. No reasonable person will expect you to ""just get it"" right off the bat. Keep asking questions until it clicks. It's the only way you will learn.That said, what I wish I had done much sooner was to just spend time with the software. Poke around. Get a feel for what the user's experience will be. Try to understand what problem it is that your software is trying to solve.For me, I jumped into smart agriculture development with zero farm experience. It wasn't until I sat in a combine and just drove around for a day that I understood why x button is there, why menu z is nested in menu y, etc.From there, you can start to understand the hows and whys of the software design. Most frameworks just tackle one area (except maybe for the ""we've got it all"" frameworks like Qt), so understand what frameworks/middleware you're using and, more importantly, why you're using it.Another thing you can do it almost any industry is look at other people's PRs. Presuming the title is ""fixed a bug where x would happen when you do y"", make a chain in your head between x and y and the chunk of code that was modified. It's a decent way to start connecting those dots. Plus, informally, it looks very good if you can say ""oh yeah, I saw something about that in Tim's PR"" since it shows you're engaged and taking an active interest.On a less technical note, nobody gets mad at the new guy for asking questions because they understand it's all a lot to take in. They have all been exactly where you are right now. What people DO get upset with is a developer who has been onboard for 6 months, a year, 3 years, or whatever and still doesn't know some of the basic things.

What I see happening, is that in 5-10 years, programmers will be super-efficient, and our job will look more like a tech or team lead that serves as the owner for the code and interfaces with management and stakeholder.Anyway, software isn't going anywhere, it's going to continue changing, but no matter what, we're going to have more software in 20 years than we do today, and someone is going to have to build it, or at least be the person responsible for it.Job security in software doesn't come down to the coding skills, it comes down to all the non-coding skills you have. Are you experienced enough to learn new concepts? Can you lead a team? How well do you do working on ambiguous problems? Do you have a track record of producing results in difficult environments? How well do you work with others? These are the driving questions that determine employ-ability. You'll learn how to pass software coding assessments in school, but after that, employ ability boils down to the ability to contribute to companies bottom line. That's never going to change!",justUseAnSvm,2025-07-01 15:48:45,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1lp4e0i,False,

Depending on the director, they might not let me pick if they think I may be biased. They could just come up with the names and be done with it. This same logic could roll up to their bosses.

So I'll tell them I've done s/w eng, I've done DevOps, etc. but not at an enterprise level; I'm familiar w/ the concepts and the tools but I haven't done it on the cloud. At best, I've used a cloud env that someone else set up.Sometimes it goes no further but other times they are willing to talk because I demonstrate that I can learn new things and have an unusual way of solving problems.
