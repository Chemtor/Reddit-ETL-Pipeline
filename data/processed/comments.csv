mvqu8my,"There is also the rampant confusion between doing data quality checks, and testing your code.Data quality checks are just going to verify that the actual data is as expected. Testing your code on the other hand should focus on the code logic only, and if data needs to be involved, then it should not be actual data, but mock data (Maybe inspired by issues encountered in production).Then you control the input and have an expected output. Therefore the only thing that is controlled is your code.While I see teams go for data quality checks (like DBT tests), I rarely see code testing (doable with dbt-unit-tests, but tedious).",ManonMacru,2025-06-03 10:22:37,169,dataengineering,t3_1l26xgo,False,
mvr9bzt,"I need to headline acknowledge that this is complex and generalisations are always going to struggle on a topic like this. And I'm likely to get downvoted for a practical non-theory answer, I know.BUT...Data engineering and software engineering are two different disciplines, so you can only draw parallels so far. And within data engineering, there's a huge difference between (1) a pipeline that supports a piece of software used by millions, or on which lives (any number, small or large) might depend, and (2) a pipeline that just ensures Sally from accounts payable can see the latest invoices in her report, which she only looks at once a month anyway, and occasionally forgets to look without anything bad happening.The same difference exists within software engineering, between that million-user piece of software and a script running on a server in a medium sized business to do something useful but not business critical, and that hasn't had a code change in 4 years. Those two things won't (or at least shouldn't) have the same amount of testing effort even if the same software engineer did both. Ditto for the two data pipelines. Ultimately, testing of any sort takes time that could be spent on other things, so for a business, it needs to provide more value than it costs, or you shouldn't do it. I see people forgetting this sometimes. Nobody should do testing purely dogmatically, except perhaps for FOSS projects, and any kind of libraries, which are a very different story. Another angle is that user-facing software typically has lots of code branches, conditionally-executed code, and complex object interactions. Data software _might_ have that too (in which case it has the same potential for testing), but it might be very simple and linear. If running a pipeline executes every line of code in the project - isn't running it an adequate test for a reasonable swathe of test conditions?",sjcuthbertson,2025-06-03 12:14:38,30,dataengineering,t3_1l26xgo,False,

mw7j9n2,They’re going to have a huge uphill battle. Delta and Iceberg formats started working together and now they converged as of the latest iceberg release. So you can have both iceberg (e.g for snowflake support) and delta (e.g for databricks / open source delta spark support) metadata on the same parquet. Hudi already took the back seat.

mw8hr3u,"Yes sorry, currently it’s duckdb doing the querying because I don’t think Postgres has a native parquet reader and isn’t really built around columnar storage. Although for smaller writes the data is stored within the database itself, so it is doing the planning for that. Obviously under the hood duckdb is querying for the metadata and then executing the query. I thought you were saying that when using duckdb you had to attach to the Postgres, then write the metadata query, then use that info to write your main data query. So what I was saying was that you just attach duckdb to the Postgres db and then you can start writing queries in duckdb as if the Postgres db actually contained the data.But yes even that might be too much for less tech savvy users. Plus other db formats that are able to read parquet files could implement the ducklake format more natively so that they are both the repository and the query planner.

mvvginy,"Part of our job would be to show why these practices are important. However, they may or may not listen. This isn't limited to just Data Engineering, this is true for all software engineering practices.There is no one right way to do this, so you'll have to figure out what works for you and your company. Here's a couple of things that have worked for me in the past (does not always work, but you can always try)1. Making them feel the pain - when pipelines break, make it known. Send an incident report email to everyone hen it happens. As you're fixing it, give updates, even if the update is still investigating. If they ask why its taking so long, let them know about the ""right"" work we have chosen not to do, and why it is making things slower to fix. This is especially important on data that is used in highly used reports. Connect these ""best practices"" to things that they care about.2. Insisting on specific practices - sometimes you just need to stand your ground and say THIS IS THE WAY WE ARE DOING THINGS. This is tough to do, especially if you don't have a high position in the company, but from the sound of things, you are the only data engineer, and you are the subject matter expert on the engineering pipelines. You will most likely not be able to say to them that you'll spend a month to ""fix"" the pipelines and make sure they are following best practices, but at the very least, for newer pipelines, you can insist on a few practices. Maybe automated data quality checks and alerts.3. Do things that bring value. While us engineers want to take the time and effort to design things well, and to make sure things are running well, what business cares about is always value - can I get my report in time? Can I trust the data that I see? Any best practice you want to do, or introduce into your work, should always be connected to something that matters to them. There is no use in doing medallion architecture if it means we will need to stall everything for months, without new reports, or fixing current issues. People will be more willing to go with you if they can see that what you want to do will fix issues that they care about. In this case, your lead seems to be focused on the powerBI reports - ask him, what things about the reports are bugging him? what does he think we need to fix in those reports? Can he think of things that will make it easier to build reports? Any dataset that would be commonly used? What issues in the data do they constantly see? If you can connect your practices to these items, it will increase the likelihood of them agreeing with you.Finally though, there is a limit to what you can do. I think a lot of people of this thread has basically said - time to give up, and look for a different job. And there is truth to this - sometimes people just don't know what the best thing to do is, and isn't willing to listen, even to subject matter experts. OR sometimes, they don't care about the long term, and only care about the short term. If your values don't align with theirs - leave. Find a company that cares about what you care about.

mvyefq8,"**You’re not alone!!** What you’re experiencing is unfortunately *way* too common, especially in consulting and anywhere Power BI folks are put in charge of data engineering.I’ve been there, teams with little to no coding background trying to use low-code/Power BI tooling for *everything*. One Dataflow Gen2 per table?! That’s rough and you are building up tech debt fast, unmaintainable pipelines, and debugging nightmares might become a way of life. The only winners here are cloud providers raking in cash for unnecessary resources.**A few thoughts:**1. **This isn’t “just” consulting.** You’ll see it in product companies too, but consulting *magnifies* the chaos. **Speed > Quality** every time. The “default tool” is often whatever the least-technical person understands, not what scales. You’re not crazy or missing anything; what you’re seeing is just bad design, period.2. **You** ***can*** **find real data engineering work.** Look for companies that actually value automation, code quality, and actual engineering best practices. Hint: If they use Databricks, Airflow, or even just ADF (with dynamic patterns and metadata logging), you’re more likely to find serious teams. **In interviews,** ask how they handle orchestration, monitoring, and tech debt. If they can’t answer, that’s a red flag... share how you’d do it instead and see how they respond.3. **With your current team:** Quantify the pain. Estimate hours lost to debugging, tech debt, slow refreshes, and cloud spend. Reference stats (e.g., Gartner: bad data/processes cost orgs \~$13M/year). **Write it up**! Put it in an email, a slide deck, or a doc, so the business impact is clear and visible. Propose practical alternatives: dynamic pipelines, metadata logging, or just consolidating flows so you’re not maintaining 100+ separately. Sometimes, seeing wasted hours or dollars is what finally gets through to non-technical leads.4. **If they won’t listen?** You’ve done your best, don’t let their lack of vision drag you down.

Now, depending on the business, the volume of data, the stack etc data engineering might be from code less till fully open source.

If the volume increases they usually switch to open source solutions(spark on emr, airflow, hive metastore, etc) for cost cutting reasons. As you understand there are cases where data engineering might involve more than data related tasks such us managing infra, setting up permissions/vpc/etc, modeling, database administration, unit testing, scripting etc. Do these tasks fall under the DE's responsibilities?

SQLGlot can parse 20+ dialects. https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/parser.pyIt has type inference and logical planning.https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/optimizer/annotate_types.pyhttps://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/planner.pyIt even has a Python based physical execution engine.https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/executor/python.pyAt the end of the day, there's been a big media brigade by dbt trying to hype up catching up to us. But it's the equivalent of boasting about making your GPS (compile time of SQL) when your engine is still slow (run time and execution of SQL). dbt core + fusion still doesn't have state. There's no scheduling / cron. So although they can now validate SQL queries, it still can't do something as simple as remembering what days of data your transformations has run for or when it should run. Compile time of SQL queries really should only take a couple of seconds, so they're solving a problem that shouldn't have been there in the first place. You're spending minutes/hours, thousands of dollars running queries on your warehouse, and SQLMesh is significantly more advanced there.Happy to chat any time, give me a ping.",captaintobs,2025-06-03 05:57:16,62,dataengineering,t3_1l1y798,False,

Having a good mentor can help steer your own career. Working in FAANG it shouldn't be difficult to find one and they don't always need to be within your own reporting lines.- Teach, don't do. You'll find yourself a lot just fixing juniors problems but not solving the underlying issue. The teach a man to fish anecdote is so applicable and you'll feel less uncomfortable with them struggling. Failure is a part of learning so treat it like that for them.- Be informally formal. Imposter syndrome at your age is always rife and I too had the same issue. I ended up on a training course for working at an enterprise level and raised the same challenge with the trainer. The main learning was reading the situation and being yourself where applicable. The imposter syndrome is hard to shake but it'll get easier with time.- Most importantly, make time for yourself and your own development.

Foundry had this concept of table format way before Iceberg or delta got popular. One take away I have is if your organization needs a data platform that needs traditional data warehousing alot Foundry sucks in that area. This is a great solution for Extraction and Transformation but if your organization depends on datasets mostly for creating charts and dashboards with strict SLAs. Foundry can only be used as compute layer and then load this data back into snowflake or other data warehouses.,Ok-Refrigerator521,2025-06-05 06:42:47,5,dataengineering,t3_1l3kx85,False,

mvy96hh,I am going offer a different perspective one that is centered around permissions. Lets say you put your ETL logic inside your orchestrator for 2 use cases1. Extracting data from an RDS instance2. Extracting data from an external API endpoint You have to give permissions to the orchestrator (most likely ECS task) to access the RDS instance and also secrets such as API key and RDS password. But let us say the ETL logic lives outside (separate ECS tasks) then the orchestrator essentially only needs permissions to kickoff those tasks. The individual tasks get separate permissions to access their specific instances. This is in line with the least privilege principle often recommended for defining permissions.Giving the orchestrator too much permissions is exposing you to a lot of risk. There are some newer approaches like the ETL logic is defined in the orchestrator but the flow/task itself runs in a specific pre-defined compute which seems like a better balance. So if you do want to put it all in the orchestrator make sure you leverage such an approach.,anatomy_of_an_eraser,2025-06-04 13:49:02,9,dataengineering,t3_1l327w2,False,

We have some client teams which develop images/clis/binaries that are pretty complicated, and having them compartmentalize means they can easily manage their own release versioning and test process.However, some of the intermediate steps that stitch them together either don't require such rigor or the rigor comes from the orchestrator (think: file type conversion, moving stuff bucket to bucket, managing data versions).A simplified description of our case would be sensing data from a vendor and placing in managed block storage (as opposed to a vendor-accessible bucket), converting the files, and then letting a client team run their validator tool on the files.",ZeroSobel,2025-06-04 11:21:31,3,dataengineering,t3_1l327w2,False,

mwhkdlw,"Great question, thanks for asking and giving me a chance to explain a bit more :)Just to clarify up front: Heimdall isn’t trying to replace Airflow (or Dagster). It’s meant to complement those tools, especially in big data environments. We actually use both -- Airflow and Heimdall -- and each plays a different role in our system.In our setup:* Airflow handles scheduling -- the ""when"" something should run (""run this job daily, but only after X completes"").* Heimdall handles orchestration -- the ""what"", ""where"", and ""how"" something runs (""run this Spark job with version X on cluster Y, with these configs"").So why build Heimdall for orchestration instead of just using Airflow for everything?A few reasons:**1. Consistency:** We want a single, unified interface between all tools and data systems (Spark, Trino, Clickhouse, etc.). Heimdall abstracts away infra details -- our users just submit workloads the same way every time (from user's p-o-v, the way they submit SparkSQL and Trino query and get results is exactly the same). We can manage things like version upgrades, logging, error tracking, etc., in one place. Similar to what Netflix’s Genie does -- it creates a clean boundary between clients (humans and systems) and infrastructure.**2. Security:** Engineers can run and test jobs locally -- even against prod data -- without needing shared credentials (we integrate with many systems, zero creds for those on laptops). They just use their own identity, and Heimdall enforces everything (RBAC, logging, etc.) in one place. Airflow submits jobs *through* Heimdall, so we get a centralized entry point to everything.**3. Simplification:** By offloading orchestration to Heimdall, our Airflow operators got *really* simple -- each is maybe 10-20 lines of code, no matter how complex the job is. This helps us avoid the usual “infra logic leaking into pipeline code” problem. Heimdall gives us reusable building blocks that keep our DAGs clean.There are other reasons too, but those are the big ones. Happy to go deeper into any of them if it’s useful.And just to be clear -- we still really like Airflow. :) It’s become much more lightweight for us now that it only handles scheduling. We’re even looking at turning Heimdall-based operators into lightweight sensors, so we can run thousands of DAGs on a small Airflow box.",Pale-Fan2905,2025-06-07 13:36:19,2,dataengineering,t1_mwglt0m,True,

Your data may have quality issues or just isn't structured in a way that's easy to work with, and you can learn about patterns like dimensional modeling and Data Vault. You can also pick up a transform tool like dbt or SQLMesh5. Optional: you can do some (simple) ML with keras / Tensorflow or PyTorch. Think simple classification or prediction6. Visualization.

mvwa4wv,"In Databricks specifically you can create [workflows](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-engineering/workflows) that specify what to run and what the dependencies are, and what to do on failures. That's obviously a bit different since you specify it separately, so I suppose the lineage is 'manual' in that case.The workflow tooling has some advantages. You can specify which clusters to use for which steps, so you can keep a cluster live throughout the process for faster job startups, or switch clusters if some steps need specialised settings or need to be larger.Obviously you don't have that with just Spark, but essentially any orchestrating job runner could work.You can mix DBT in with python functions for python models. Those can specify their model dependencies within the function, and other sql models can reference the python module. I believe there are some more hoops to jump through in specifying the model in yaml and needing to set up your spark session to be passed in, so it might take some work to figure that out.Then things like Airflow, Dagster, or more classic things like Ctrl-M can be set up to orchestrate things, or in Azure ADF can do it if it isn't too large. I believe they all have a similar limitation that you can't just ask for ""things leading to this"" or ""things following this"" or both, you just have a set pipeline to run.You can also do a very basic one yourself. If you have a function that runs some data process you can create decorators to specify dependencies, then as long as you `import` the module with those decorated functions you'll have a full dependency tree and can automatically execute what you need. You could find all dependencies leading into some data process function, so they are all refreshed, or run a data process function and update everything that follows from it. The functions to map all that out, but it is a pretty general dependencies problem so an LLM will likely have something to get you started.",azirale,2025-06-04 04:21:00,2,dataengineering,t3_1l2sbm1,False,

mwgy8qy,"I’ve been doing the first option for a few years and it works. I do it in three steps, using CTEs. 1. Union the valid_from and valid_to from all of the source scd tables to create a “spine” of every state change timestamp and person ID. The reason you have to stack the valid_froms and valid_tos vertically is to handle gaps in the source scds’ time ranges for cases where dims were deleted. 2. Join each scd table to that spine on person id and where the state change timestamp is within the scd time range, e.g. scd.valid_from <= spine.timestamp < coalesce(scd.valid_to, ‘9999-01-01’). 3. The spine timestamp becomes the new valid_from, and use a lead() window function to add a valid_to.

First, it sounds like you have good/smart people even if they aren’t familiar with modern platforms and technologies (public cloud, etc.). Someone mentioned “data mesh” and that came to mind to me as well. Specifically, the principles around ”data as a product” and “self-service” as these are largely about organizational empowerment and alignment more so than technology choices.It sounds like the teams need some guidance on how to organize and get work done. I recommend looking into the following.. the teams and company may be doing some of this already but it’s hard to tell from a short narrative. Each of the topics below embody principles of modern data teams.1. Agile2. DataOps (the modern data value chain and how to build data capabilities and the operations around them)3. Data as a product - creating things that matter and generate value for the business. The tech is not the point.If you want to go deeper on organizational design ideas for technology teams, I recommend the book “Team Topologies.” What you read in the book is helpful and insightful but it’s not a blueprint - in my opinion - to simply go and follow. Instead, take what the book teaches, overlay it with your company, teams, and culture, and determine what your own organizational next steps should be.Hope this helps give you some ideas on where to start.",trajik210,2025-06-07 21:41:21,1,dataengineering,t3_1l4zcne,False,

The DBA team ground to a halt so that the lead DBA could spend all their time and attention nannying the change. The analytics team ground to a halt because they wanted to manually check and manage 50+ reports and talk to all the stakeholders of those reports to find out how they wanted the reports to work with the new data. In other organizations I've managed this by creating a data lake, creating pipelines and DAGs and incremental models with tests.

mvjlc80,"My vote would be to keep it all in MSSQL but that’s because I’m an MSSQL DBA. Postgres is great and all but there’s no reason to do extract/load that you don’t need to, and if you’re licensed for MSSQL then use it!Having an intermediate layer means another tool chain. What would you use? I tried dlt for that and it can’t properly handle MSSQL sources or designations; its reader library fails on large column types and the writer library writes everything as varchar rather than nvarchar! I ended up rolling my own (for MSSQL to MSSQL). But also for performance tuning and investigation tooling wise, MSSQL has it all. I’d keep it all in there. I haven’t used dbt but I’ve been trialing sqlmesh which is a kind of successor to it. It’s good at managing nested views on top of data and materialising it, and I’m contributing a patch to make it run better on MSSQL also for my own purposes.To expand on that, sqlmesh works perfectly for all of the MSSQL data types I’ve thrown at it so far. Because you aren’t moving data through it and just managing views, that’s all it needs to do, and so in that case it’s great.It reads in your source tables and data types. You create your views and it understands what output types should be there, even in views that reference views too, and creates the output heaps to dump into with all of the right data types (they say you should explicitly declare them but I don’t want to and it seems to work without it, so why would I? that’s the whole point…).So there’s no repetition of basic data type information or table management. Just write your views and go.My patch is around improving the way it does its merge for incremental updates to the views. But also the output tables it creates are just heaps, there are ways to add indexes after the fact though and even in an automatic kind of way, it’s just not as intuitive as it could be. Still, it works!So yeah I’d keep it all in MSSQL but also if you’re mostly interested in materialising views I’d probably at least try sqlmesh before fully committing to dbt.

mvusjg9,The author would advise you to only enrich with these fields in the silver layer if those attributes provide a reusable and commonly understood entity for the whole enterprise. Do not enrich with fields specific to one domain or subprocess because now you add the overhead of having to know which fields have to be filtered out for downstream consumption. If for example your sign up date is an attribute that is relevant to the whole enterprise it would be a good candidate for a customer field. If it describes a specific sign up for a newsletter that is relevant to marketing it might be better suited to keep those sign ups separate. Maybe create a signup table that references the customer id so it can be reused across different business processes and is easily understood.In the end it is more about the approach itself. A few fields here or there wont break your architecture but once you have super wide tables because people keep adding columns to defined tables the madness starts.

Think of the french speaking region of Belgium being in the same marketing region of France while being in a different financial region).Besides that you also have ownership issues. Who controls this dimension and is responsible for its data? What if they decide to change the region of a customer, will that break dependencies from other areas of business?So I agree with her. Keep only things that are relevant and have unified meaning across the business on the silver layer.

I would not be surprised to see more companies approach data infrastructure this way in the future, as we see cloud computing cost skyrocketing, and a mass emigration from the cloud.Other than allowing for half the data infrastructure on prem and the other half in the cloud, I can’t see why anyone would implement this approach on a strictly cloud based environment. Generally, OLAP based systems are faster and more efficient at data transformations than OLTP, so you might not be getting any cost advantages. You are also managing yet another pipeline, and likely need another DBT project implemented with incremental models. This approach also reduces visibility and traceability of your pipelines, and complicates CI/CD. There are plenty of reasons NOT to do this.

mvkmrf9,"> It would be useful if you could list what you're trying to solve for in making changes.Mainly, we hired a new Data Analyst and one of the big noticed pain points is that are data structure is kinda of all over the place.We generally have the two primary data sources that are in real-time sync atm, but the thing keeping them in sync (Power Automate) constantly breaks and constantly causes headaches. So one job is moving that into a more robust ETL/ELT/sync solution.The second problem is ingesting data for analysis is difficult. Right now, the reports that are ran directly on the web database have to be refreshed manually after opening an SSH tunnel (the DA opens it through PuTTY right now). Instead, I want to have this data pulled into a more accessible place. The data from D365 and our other tools would also benefit from being in here, as we'd be able to leverage something like ELT to transform these datasets into something easily useable for PBI reports or synchronising with each other.So, the problems I'm looking to solve are to find a good place to centrally store our data for reporting / analysis, and to then find a good way (not Power Automate!!!) to move that data there.> How many data sources are you trying to sync? I'm still a bit lost on how you're using both Power Automate and Service Bus.Main 2 datasets are MySQL are D365. This is through power automate. When one makes a change, it gets put into a service bus to be processed.Additional sources are:External API from a similar org that uses Power Automate to pull into D365. This runs on a schedule. Every change made then syncs real-time with MySQL.Series of spreadsheets from another service we use for raising tenders (it's complicated). These are processed by Power Automate on a manual basis, pushed into D365 which then synchronises realtime with MySQL.MailChimp also synchronises here, pulling data from I believe oth MySQL and D365. We're apparently contacting our D365 vendor about a quote for having this data more closely married with D365.> If you need low-latency, I don't think a data warehouse with reverse ETL is going to be a good solution. My guess is that if you have decent data volume and velocity, it's going to get costly pretty fast. If your message bus isn't getting you quite what you want, you could always look at Event Hub or Confluent for managed Kafka. Either way, you're looking at some amount of custom code to read / write data to / from your queues / topics.Got it. I've heard about Kafka, the other two will probably be similar enough. Custom code is something to consider.Generally, I think the real-time requirement is one that causes more problems than solutions. Changing an accounts name on CRM might be nice to have immediately show up on the website, but I've found achieving that so far is difficult and time consuming.> I have literally never read anything positive about Fabric.Lmao, me neither. The only benefit I see is it makes setting something up a little bit easier.> I think your team is too small to take this approach, but it depends on your company's cost sensitivity. Some have the mindset that it's ""cheaper"" to avoid vendors and have engineers build everything in-house; in my experience, that math only works if you discount labor costs at 100%. You will certainly have some custom tooling and processes, but make sure that you're getting good value: the commodity solution is very expensive, or you can build and maintain a solution with minimal resources.This is something I've realised / been realising. Hiring an external vendor to build something is gonna be costly/ difficult to get to pass, but would be at least a decent idea. The vendor we use did suggest adding Data Factory to the unused Synapse instance we have, but with Synapse now being effectively discontinued I'd rather find a new solution than depend on it even more.> It still sounds like you want a data warehouse for reporting. Snowflake is a fine choice in Azure, though you could also look at BigQuery Omni. You may want to look into ClickHouse, since it's got a realtime / time series angle. My hunch is that this still won't satisfy your systems integration requirement, but I'm not familiar enough with ClickHouse to say definitively.I'll take a look at those names. Main reason for a data warehouse / lake is that the main existing alternatives would be Microsoft Dataverse which isn't a great idea imo, or wrangling the Azure SQL DB that's sitting empty. A little more feasible, but wouldn't offer as good a feature set as something made for warehousing.> If your data is relatively small, I'd at least look at a recent feature from DuckDBI've heard a fair bit about DuckDB, it might be time to give it more of a look.",A_SeriousGamer,2025-06-02 11:47:54,1,dataengineering,t1_mvkjpfi,True,
mvkiogx,"Yeah, that's a generally correct understanding. The data is by-and-large all kept within a Dataverse / D365 instance, although some bits of data are kept external and instead pulled directly into a PBI report.It's a solution that's been built over the course of a fair few years.The end goal would be either finding a new central data store or improving how we use Dataverse as one, and making sure everything is accessible within it.Dataverse / D365 we use generally as a standard CRM. The website contains much of the same information, on top of some additional website specific data: the actual quote requests raised and reported spend being the main pieces.We had originally used a vendor to move from a Dynamics 2014 system to 365 back in around 2020 and the requirement was to make the synchronisation between the new CRM and the website realtime as they shared a lot of data. From what I know, that requirement is intended to stay for the time being.Hopefully, depending on however the solution we end up with shakes up that requirement might change. But generally if say an Account (eg one of our members) has some of their details changed on say the CRM then that change needs to be propagated to the website on-demand rather than on-schedule.I am aware that's a rather big ask.

ADF designer requires network connectivity and it becomes clunky once you start to create more complex solutions. \* In SSIS you have a choice of many third-party extensions to use when developing solutions. In ADF you are completely dependent on Microsoft for connectors and new features. Some people call SSIS legacy. However, the reality is SSIS is still the best ETL platform on the market and people not only continue to use it, but the use is increasing. I suspect many people are now discovering that having the ability to run SSIS both on-premises and in the cloud is a very attractive feature compared to having a solution that is cloud-only with no ability to transition back on-premises for cost reasons, for example.",Nekobul,2025-06-02 12:08:07,3,dataengineering,t1_mvknogb,False,

The language was designed with the express purpose of being as difficult to use as possible, going as far as requiring the source code itself to be encoded in a cypher, making it essentially impossible to read. Beyond that, it uses base 3 arithmetic, and essentially requires to use of self modifying code to accomplish most tasks.There are very few programs written in it, with the first hello world program appearing 2 years after the language was published. And that code was not written by hand, but instead generated using a [beam search](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search) algorithm.If we relax the ""uselessness"" requirements a bit, and focus more on languages that are simply incredibly different from the ones you've learned, there are a lot of potential candidates.[Prolog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) is a logic programming language where you basically describe the problem and the compiler finds a program that solves it (assuming it has a solution). This is a very radically different way of writing code compared to the languages you have experience with.Similarly [Rocq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocq) (previously Coq) is an interactive theorem prover, where you wrote code that describes mathematical logic modeling something and can find formal mathematical proofs about it. It is possible to write programs and verify their correctness in Rocq as demonstrated by the [CompCert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompCert) C compiler.[Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html) is a functional programming language with algebraic effect types, which clearly define what kind of side effects (if any) a function is capable of causing.[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is an extremely powerful functional programming language with an absolute crapton of functionality that can be enabled for all sorts of advanced type level programming. As a bonus, since everyone loves to create custom operators, it's not uncommon for Haskell code to look like symbol soup with a handful of recognizable names mixed in here and there.[APL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) and other array languages treat everything as arrays and provide a bunch of super basic functions to manipulate them, leading to solving problems in a very different way than you might in other languages. As a bonus, APL specifically uses a bunch of custom symbols, leading to code that looks like this: life ← {⊃1 ⍵ ∨.∧ 3 4 = +/ +⌿ ¯1 0 1 ∘.⊖ ¯1 0 1 ⌽¨ ⊂⍵}This example implements [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in APL.You could also try Racket, as another commenter mentioned, or any other Lisp really, as they are different enough from what you're familiar with to require learning to think differently about solving problems.There are tons more languages in various different paradigms you could try, and they would all be valuable right now. All the languages you;be learned sit within a very tiny corner of the world of programming languages, and offer only the tiniest glimpse into the variety of languages, paradigms, and ways to think about solving various problems.While I respect that you aren't interested in learning something just because it's ""useful"", I think putting emphasis on the ""uselessness"" of a language is not the best way to think about this. Instead you should consider ""how different is this language from what I'm familiar with"", because the more different and alien a language feels, the harder it will be to learn, but it will also reshape how you think about solving problems.Edit: fixed APL link (at least on mobile)",Bobbias,2025-06-02 20:25:21,37,learnprogramming,t3_1l1qdkg,False,

mw9621n,"I'll provide a contrasting point of view since most people are trying to convince you there's nothing special about C++. I believe C++ is very problematic for newer programmers because a huge list of reasons. The general dismissive advice is to just program in the ""safe"" areas of C++, but there is no way for a beginner to know where that is.There are basic problems right off the bat for a beginner.1. No real package management system. If you want to use libraries in C++, you'll often need to download someone's .hpp and .cpp file and figure out how to compile that into your program and use it. That directly leads into2. Compilation. No other modern language has a system as complicated as C++, you are going to struggle with your program finding your headers, things are going to compile and not link the right libraries, these words don't even make sense to beginner programmers in other languages. But of course C++ programmers have tried to solve this and that causes problem number3. Build systems, C++ has 3 popular build systems, and they don't necessarily work well with each other. You got make, cmake, autoconf and just regular writing the compiler arguments yourself. These systems are extremely complex, introduce a whole new language to learn, and are often impossible to debug. People will tell you that a newbie doesn't need to know about any of this, well they do if they want to be doing anything substantial using existing code instead of implementing every single thing themselves.So all of that is before you get a program running, so once we've figure out how to compile code, what happens when we write code and try to learn stuff from online?4. C++ is extremely fragmented. C++ has gone through multiple incarnations, from C with Classes to C++11 to more recent versions. The way you write C++ code differs dramatically between pre and post C++11. By default the majority of the code you write based on basic examples will be considered incorrect. For example, you'd think you can generate random numbers using `rand()`. You'd be dead wrong, C++ developers do NOT suggest using `rand()` to generate random numbers, it's not guaranteed to generate a uniform distribution or numbers that are sufficiently random. People will even tell you off if you use iostream, the basic recommended way to handle input/output in every tutorial, because C++ code is supposed to be fast, and iostreams are considered slow. Basically C++ does something wrong in some initial implementation, and has to maintain that for backwards compatibility forever, so they implement a whole new different correct way to do it, but a newbie has no way to tell if they are looking at outdated and bad code or new code.5. Standards vs Compilers. Suppose you are super keen and keep up to date with new language features. You see that C++23 has some cool new feature you want to try in your own code. Well too bad, it probably hasn't been implemented yet. The standards committee are independent from the people that write the compilers. So the committee declares that the new version of the language has this new feature, and it's someone else's job to actually implement that feature into the compiler so it can actually be used in code. This is done bit by bit, so your compiler will support some C++23 features and not others. Hell, some features are in the spec and NEVER get supported. So if you're a keen beginner and see people present cool new features and code patterns you want to try, bad luck, try again in 5 years and pray that compilers have caught up.6. C++ data structures are heavily memory focused. This isn't the memory management that people usually talk about. These are the standard vector and collection types that manage the memory for you like in other languages. Except in almost every case, you interact with these objects via iterators, which dips down a level of abstraction and makes you think about memory anyway. So where in another language you might run `sort(s)`, in C++ you run `std::sort(s.begin(), s.end());`. That seems ok, until you start using references and pointers, and `sort` shifts the values in memory and you end up not pointing to what you thought you were pointing to. That's just a rookie mistake, but most algorithms do things in-place in memory and it's an easy mistake to make. On top of that you get pointer invalidation, where sometimes the automatic memory management just takes your data somewhere else and all your previously declared pointers are now pointing at nothing. The simplest way to accidentally do this is when you are using `push_back()`, when the allocated vector fills up it'll relocate somewhere else.I could go on. But the overall point is that1. Compilation and library management in C++ introduces significant complications to beginners that simply do not exist in other highly used languages.2. C++ has many conflicting ways of doing something, and there does not exist a single agreed upon set of teaching material for beginners to learn best practices.3. C++ has MANY hidden pitfalls that will cause beginners to write broken programs. Almost by default any code you write intuitively will be considered wrong in some way. The simple `for (int i = 0; i++; i < s.size()) { s[i]; }` should be written as `for (const auto& v : s) { v; }`, note the additional syntax and operators that might be unclear to beginners. Also you were meant to use `size_t` instead of `int` for the first loop, but that's almost never presented in basic teaching material.C++ has more complicated language constructs than other languages, worse developer support, has no single high-quality resource for learning, and online resources are litered with bad practice that beginners have no ability to distinguish.",TonySu,2025-06-06 03:14:19,4,learnprogramming,t3_1l4d5gi,False,
mw9seo1,">I understand that you need a ton of understanding and experience to write performant C++ code. And that even decent Python code will outperform bad/mediocre C++ code.Wait, what? This isn't even true. The only situation where this might be a thing is where you're copying around data needlessly, but using references in C++(just like Python does by default) is an idiomatic language feature. Barring those cases, C++ code can be like 100 times faster than Python, unless you use Numpy arrays or something(which is written in C, so hardly counts as Python code).>I also understand that there's a huge responsibility in managing memory safely. Yeah, except if you use smart pointers, C++ even has automatic memory management. People who say memory management in it is this super hard and difficult thing probably never heard about C++11. The language's complexity is greatly overblown, of course, but there is some merit to it. For example, template metaprogramming is functional programming, while your normal code tends to be object-oriented / imperative, so you need to learn two programming paradigms to properly program, which indeed is a lot. But most of people's problems with the language aren't really a problem if they use the right solution.

C++ is also unmanaged, not running in basically a VM like C# and Java, so it's a little more efficient in that regard. Also, you're relatively unrestricted in what you can do with C++, so if you know what you're doing, C++ is a very powerful language.Since the C++11 standard, C++ has gained a lot of more modern features too.

mw5se8d,"For clarity : My answer is based on my own experience in this field, but I have formatted the response with AI for clear reading, AI will never generate knowledge like this.Hey, wishing you a bright future—read to the end! No way is programming dead, trust me. The idea that AI will wipe out coders is a myth. Tools like GitHub Copilot are like having a brainy assistant—they make you faster, not replace you. Coders who skip AI might lag since it cuts problem-solving from weeks to hours. You’ll learn quicker, debug faster, and tackle big stuff, but AI needs your creativity to work. Coding’s been around forever (before you were born!) and isn’t going anywhere—it just evolves. Use AI to level up, and you’re golden. It’s totally worth jumping into in 2025. The industry needs solid coders who solve real problems. Stay curious, keep learning, and you’ll stand out, no matter how many others code.Learning paths depend on you. Self-taught is awesome but tough—you need discipline to avoid scams or getting lost. A mentor, even paid, can save you tons of time by guiding you right. Tons of top devs are self-taught, so it’s doable with grit. Bootcamps are great for fast, practical skills—3-6 months and you’re job-ready if you pick one with mentorship and job help. Check Course Report for legit ones to dodge duds. A CS degree gives deep theory for stuff like AI or systems coding and looks great to employers, but it’s pricey and takes years. You don’t always need it for jobs like web dev But remember that if you don't learn the deep theoretical stuff like systems design, algorithms, data structures, computer architectures and operating systems, and only the final technology like web development, you will reach a stage where you will not develop, and you will not move up the career ladder until you have comprehensive knowledge and experience in all aspects, not just simple technological skills like html, css, etc. Whatever path, you’ll need to self-learn, so try Coursera’s “Learn How to Learn” to master studying. Tech’s got endless free resources—use them! I’d start self-taught to test the waters, then maybe a bootcamp or degree if you’re hooked. Just know bootcamps focus on jobs and might skimp on theory like algorithms, which you’ll need.Please do not be tempted by crash courses, all of them aim to teach you how to use the programming language only or just a basic understanding, and do not teach you deep programming concepts, the least professional course may take more than 50 hours of learning, and time is not a condition on the professionalism of the course, but for example, you will not find an in-depth algorithms course of 10 hours ...First, see if coding’s your thing with Harvard’s CS50 on edX—it’s free and a fun intro to programming with bits of C, Python, and JavaScript. It’s not a full course but a taste of what coding’s about. You’ll know if it clicks and get a sense of next steps. After CS50, don’t jump straight to a track like web dev—focus on building core programming skills, like algorithms, data structures and solve a lot of problems on websites like hackerrank,leetcode,codeforces, and so on... . These are the foundation of coding and crucial for any field. You can learn them while exploring a track (like web or AI) or before picking one—it’s up to you. Python’s a great first language—easy, versatile for web, AI, or data, and super in-demand. But it’s not about the language; it’s about getting loops, functions, and logic, which apply everywhere. Think of coding like swinging a hammer: easy to learn, hard to master. Start with computational thinking to grasp how computers work before diving into languages. To gain a solid foundation in your level, I suggest reading books that will develop your way of thinking. It can be read while you are studying CS50. There is a great book called Computational Thinking: A Beginner's Guide to Problem Solving and Programming by Karl Beecher. I really like it and still read it from time to time, even though I am experienced but it's really a great book.Expect bumps—coding’s all about solving problems. Don’t quit when you’re stuck; take a break, hit Google or Stack Overflow, or use AI to explain (but don’t let it solve coding challenges—that’s cheating and you learn nothing). Everyone learns differently—some pay for courses to stay motivated, others grind free stuff. Stay consistent, even 2 hours a day. You’ve got this! Finish CS50, then focus on algorithms, data structures, databases , operating systems, programming with C++ and OOP, and any programming fundamentals that didn't covered in CS50(because 8 weeks not enough to know what you should learn ) (try free resources like FreeCodeCamp or books like “grokking algorithms”). Hit us up for next steps.What you did was the right move, you took the initiative to ask, keep doing that when you have questions, always ask the experts and don't rely on the answers of laymen or non-specialists, not even AI, AI can help you along the way if you know what you're doing, but it may not be appropriate at all times.And not all paid courses are good and not all free courses are bad, I can give you advices for hours, but unfortunately that is not the way you will develop, you have a path that you must discover for yourself, what I discovered is what you will discover, but you will discover it in your own way and with your own understanding, so I said it directly to you ... You may not always be convinced, so I'm not going to give you all the advice as much as I'm going to give you what works for you at your current stage.And remember that not everything is clear at the beginning, meaning that I cannot give you everything from the beginning until you are an expert in the field, but this depends on you and your research, reading books and learning, I only guide you to the beginning of the road. Good luck!update : CS50 (also called CS50x which is the most popular course of the CS50 series) may be difficult for some students, but in some countries computer principles are taught in schools, if you don't have knowledge about it, you can watch the content of the CS50T course first and learn more about computer principles and how to use Windows and what is hardware and software.",MohabCodeX,2025-06-05 16:32:00,52,learnprogramming,t3_1l42sn3,False,

I'm not saying that these aren't good places to start, they really are, but they need to be used as the baseline for a least a year of extra learning or hardcore personal portfolio creation.Not to be harsh here, but you got advertised to by Udemy and they gave you expectations that were way too high. I think next steps to get a job are A: go to some form of higher education. B: work your ass off doing personal projects.That being said, this market is extremely saturated at the moment and if you got sold comp-sci solely as an easy industry to get into, maybe think hard about if you really enjoy doing it.

That's exactly what I did and I don't have any certificates, college education, etc. I basically found a small web developer shop that did websites for local businesses and offered to work part-time on a contract basis and cut my teeth on developing POS and/or internet ordering systems for them, and then leveraged the experience I got working with payment processing to get a job as a junior engineer at an actual payment processor. From there, I have had no trouble finding work as a software engineer.Maybe it is harder these days - maybe there are even people lining up to do the free or low-cost work to build up a portfolio.

I'm able to get somewhere because I've taken courses that include kinematics / maths of projectile motion, but the wall exists for me as I'm not familiar enough with the equation of bezier curves, and the relationship between control points and the equation, to be able to create the path, let alone figure out how to dynamically create a bezier ease that hangs at a given point in time, and otherwise exhibits acceleration in gravity.

The more familiar you are with this math the easier it gets and you'll recognise more and more problems for which you already have the solution. If you're not very familiar you will not even recognize that it's a problem which can be solved this way and you'll not see that it can be simplified using de Morgan's etcInstead you'll solve it by for example the most naive solution which could be to evaluate all cases and see that it branches like you want. Or you'll solve it by writing different implementation like using a sequence of if with early returns which might be simpler and better for some reasons and more complex and worse for others.To sum it up in most programming math is just one other tool, very powerful but still just one of your options and that's why I think a ""wall"" is going to be very domain specific like if I had no idea what fourier/z-transform/laplace was I would be in trouble in Embedded but on the other I don't need to really understand them.

You want people to be responsible for things - delegating the responsibility of ensuring things get done and that they are correct. Ai in 5 years most likely will not be able to replace a person at determining the correctness of some code. The best path forward is to keep an eye on the tools.

At 15, you're not even close to starting your career, let alone getting the ball rolling enough to rely on your experience / tenure to help you settle down.First thing to mention (even outside of AI) is that this entire field goes through ups and down. Software development is not immune to economic downswings unless you luck out (there are some jobs out there that are more ""essential"", but not most), and we're in one right now. The current job market, plus all the AI advancements in the news, has everyone worrying about AI, but it's a scapegoat to larger issues over-hiring from Covid, interest rates, and tax laws (Section 174 being a big one).And in regards to AI, if software development gets to a point where a non-technical person can use AI like a ""cheap high-quality on-demand agency"", nearly every job is getting replaced. Put ""will doctors"" into Google search, the first result is likely ""will doctors be replaced by AI"".Being concerned about AI ***right now*** is pretty ridiculous. I've not seen any major instances of ""AI replacing developers"". There have been some decent showcases of AI reducing workloads (AirBnB did some interesting work in regards to testing migration), but even those are pretty limited. In general, it helped cut out some of the mundanity with repetitive boilerplate code, and helped people who have never written code to get things started, but that's about it.Being concerned about AI in 20 years is perfectly reasonable though. We've seen major advancements over just the last two years, but we still are not completely sure if there's a ""ceiling"" that might cap what AI can do, or if those advancements will continue to accelerate.Overall, if you're passionate about something, especially at such a young age, it's worth investing some time into that passion. No one knows what the world is going to look like in 5 years, let alone 20.

That role is absolutely critical, since AI can't take over management, and someone needs to be responsible for ensuring the technology get built and solves the problem you think it does.So how has AI changed out life?

This kicked my ass thoroughly, but I managed to join a closed source project for an old MMO game emulator. There was another one that was the competitor around 2003 that was open source. We had decided to merge but they made an interesting choice during the merger. This strange language called C#. This was a very early version of it. But I couldn't believe how cool and approachable it made things. I personally loved it. Others hated it and said nothing serious could ever be built with it. But me being new to this, I loved the idea of removing so much complexity behind things like memory management, it was like magic. You could get so much done by doing less. This decision fractured the team. The C++ diehards refused to work with it and eventually left to continue the C++ version, I stayed on the C# version. Fast forward some years, the C# version was pumping out more and more features while the C++ version couldn't keep up. Eventually the C++ version of this project died out, but the C# project is still alive today (sort of, it's gone stagnant since about 2018 or so). But it's incredible to see how far C# has come over the years. It's what I use in my current job (the little bit of coding an architect does anyway). I think it's important to know how languages like C/C++ work as they provide a better understanding of what's going on under the hood. But I also think it's better for someone new to start with something more approachable like Java & C#. That's good you decided to delve into it after learning Java.

We also have known ""design patterns"" and ""software architecture patterns"" that can help us when we design different systems (they also give us a common vocabulary that we can use when reasoning about different solutions). It is not that you ""must"" learn DSA to know how to write programs, but it will probably enrich your knowledge base, enhance your problem-solving skills, and give you an understanding of the performance implications of different data structures and algorithms.Having a ""side project"" is orthogonal to learning about different programming concepts. Having your own project allows you to challenge your assumptions of how things work, put into practice what you have learned (and learn even more from your own mistakes).You may check the FAQ (in the sidebar); it has, for example, a section on different exercises and project ideas that can be helpful.",joranstark018,2025-06-06 05:43:47,2,learnprogramming,t3_1l4k5x6,False,

That’s a real sign you’ve found something you’re genuinely passionate about. A lot of great devs started the same way - just getting lost in code.Since you're learning C#, that’s a strong start.

So don’t think it’s a “just-for-school"" language - it’s got legs in the industry.If you're eyeing cybersecurity and want to branch out smartly, here's a quick breakdown of useful languages based on where you might go:For Cybersecurity:Python – absolute must. It's everywhere in cybersec (automation, scripting, tooling, etc.), super beginner-friendly, and has a massive library ecosystem.Bash/Shell Scripting – essential if you're going to be dealing with Linux servers or writing security automation scripts.C/C++ – if you ever want to understand exploits, memory management, or reverse engineering.For General Dev / Building Stuff:JavaScript + HTML/CSS – if you ever want to touch frontend or build tools with a GUI.Go – gaining traction in cloud & network tooling, really nice for fast and secure backend systems.Since you're enjoying it already, I'd say:Stick with C# and get comfy building small projects.Start Python next - you’ll love how fast you can get stuff working.Maybe check out TryHackMe or Hack The Box once you’re comfortable with the basics - great intro to hands-on cybersec.Also, shameless plug, but I’ve been using this app called BootSelf lately.

I have a file alongside each project outlining exactly what’s going on as I work on the project. 1) explain the concept, goals, success factors and a note on what I might need and what I want to learn2) I usually have a design drawn out separately but I’ll write a brief summary of how I intend it to work, classes that will be used and key methods or functions. 3) start a diary for each day or section. This is handy for showing what I was working on and how I approached it but also good practice for getting back into it quicker and having a clear view of where you are in the projectYou don’t have to be working on something new each day. Your having trouble with something explain it (you might find the answer while you talk through it), show each approach you went through and if you have to go back and change something earlier in the project hilight it and make a note on that entry incase you go back to check it. Again not every day needs to have an entry, just add onto the end on the one you’re working on if it’s a continuation. 4) At the end write a summary of how the project went.

I was hired into a team and at a time where all the others in my cohort had masters degrees and seemed so much more experienced than I was. And it's possible that they were, I didn't realize that it didn't actually matter that much. I was showing up, passionate about doing a good job, and learning every day.I have a distinct memory of talking to a mentor about it. A meeting had just ended and I asked him to hang back in the conference room with me. I mentioned those feelings, that I wasn't as good as the other junior developers. I'd hoped my mentor would have some sage advice for me, recommendations on learning materials to catch up, or even just a pep talk. Instead, he told me to never let anyone hear me say that again. Because people will believe it if they hear it. And it sort of crushed me, because **I believed it.**Later on, that same mentor was let go from the company. In my final chat with him he shared that he'd had a lot of personal things going on in his life. The reality is that he was struggling too, all that time. And his way of handling it had been to put up that front. That's why I thought he was the person who would be able to help me. Because he presented like he had it figured out. When really, he was falling behind just like the rest of us. He felt lost. His mental state was impacting his work, etc. And worst of all, he didn't have a healthy mindset of how to address it.Years later, I was one of the most senior people working on a product. I had a manager who was new in role and together we built out a team of mostly college hires to stand up and then operate a new set of services. Every one of those developers we hired were brilliant. I always felt like they were so far ahead of where I was when I started and found each of them to be so impressive. But sure enough, in the months and then years that followed our building that team out... those new junior developers would each take me aside on their own to express how they were struggling with feelings in inadequacy. Literally, every single one.Ironically, it was those junior developers who helped me to overcome my imposters syndrome. Not the experienced mentor like I'd imagined. It was when I realized how **we all feel behind,** that I managed to wrangle my own feelings. What you're feeling now is completely normal. Its okay to be vulnerable. To share if you feel lost, or don't understand something that everyone else seems to. You are on the long road to becoming an expert.

Their feelings of inadequacy are completely justified because they **are** literally beginners, and now they're understanding that completing a 3 year degree doesn't mean they know everything.Or they're too young to understand that the top 1% of any field are outliers, and everyone else is just a regular human who makes mistakes and doesn't know everything. Basically they haven't yet mentally grown out of the phase where they think parental figures are magical perfect beings, they've just replaced their actual parents with like, a senior colleague, or some YouTuber.

Understand what problems they help you solve or avoid. If you don't understand, then don't use them.

mwazsv0,"I’m a senior developer with around 15 years of professional experience. I too learned OOP and the MVC pattern (which was touted as the prime example of SOLID) at my university. Well, those patterns never really resonated with me and using Java helped solidify to me that OOP cannot be the simplest way to organize things in a maintainable way.In my career I’ve seen a lot of patterns, and the one that really clicked for me was pure functional programming. Working with a language that doesn’t have mutable objects, null values, or even a semblance of classes was such a revelation: nearly all the problems the golden rules try to mitigate come from mutability and complex hierarchical state. Pure functions always return the same result, given the same arguments, which makes testing them incredibly easy and fun. And if the language has nothing but pure functions, then all applications built with it are incredibly easy and fun to test.My point is, it’s okay if some aspects of programming don’t click. Maybe they will later on, when you’ve seen how following it avoided issues or cutting corners lead to issues. Maybe you’ll come across another way of looking at things (like FP for me) that finally makes sense and helps put everything else in a new perspective.Just build things you want to build, that’s the only way programming is going to start making sense. Try following the rules and try breaking them. Come up with your own solutions and once done, analyze if what you did actually followed a common pattern, just in a roundabout way. If not, was it better than the common pattern? Why did it work, would it scale to a larger codebase or a project with 10 developers?",ohanhi,2025-06-06 12:26:44,5,learnprogramming,t3_1l4pt4c,False,

Dependency injection means some external body knows all about the internals of an object and injects other objects into that object as needed.Now the OOD model still works if you think IoC as some kind of God object that has control of the construction of every object in the system.

Plus, while I have basic familiarity with Java, I don't know C# at all.I looked at a bunch of other mods for the game and decompiled the source code to get some starting points, but it wasn't long before I ran into roadblocks that no amount of Googling would have ever resolved.

mw4jrwl,"Avoid AI for most of your project. I’m in a similar boat to you going back to college and ya AI is a great tool to help get through it but your not actually learning that much by tweaking the code after it spits it out. There’s a lot more to learn in how to take an idea and how to start making it. One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned so far is in planning and design. Sitting down and actually breaking down each element, what do I want, what do I need, who will be doing x and who does y? What “date” should I be using and why?Learning how to define the success factors and set realistic goals is vital in coding. As I’m going through it I’ll jot down possible approaches and methods I might need going forward. I don’t need to fully code them now but I need to make sure I have everything tight for when things get complicated later. You won’t be designing every system you work on from the ground up but you will need to be able to read and identify what the other coders were doing, what were they thinking when they made this method or class and where does it go? You won’t be able to feed full applications into an AI to read them out to you when you’re on a team. I also put a lot of work in before I started college and got advanced entry into Y2. At Christmas I was miles ahead of most in the class and took the foot of the gas looking at other languages instead. Come April I realised I’d slipped too much and had work my balls off to catch up. Yes I had a basic understanding of what we did but I couldn’t use it effectively. The best example was SQL. I could read SQL, I knew where the query was going how things joined but I struggled trying to fix it together myself. I used AI while making my database connections and had to constantly look back to do them from scratch myself. Eventually I just stopped using the AI designed methods as this is something I need to be able to do. We had interviews presenting our final projects at the end of the year and they asked “You have well designed methods for database queries in the first 4-5 frames but you don’t use them later in the project. Why?” I explained that while I would be using those methods from the helper files in real world conditions, I wasn’t happy with my understanding of them. I couldn’t do them from memory and kept making errors, so I decided to drill them in by typing them out each time. They loved that answer. It showed I was able to use helper files and methods to keep code clear and concise making the project easy to read, but I also knew how to make and adjust the process to perform custom tasks. They asked me to isolate certain conditions and how I would pick out individual combinations and I was able to do it on the spot because I knew the system and understood how it worked. Some of the others struggled with that as AI had done all the thinking for them. When it came to exams I flew through the test because I A) understood how I would do it. B) was able to identify what they were looking for and how to trace back to it. And C) I made the mistakes and worked my way through them so when they happened there I knew what I was looking at. TLDR:Don’t use AI to design everything. Yes it’ll spit out loads of lovely code that works for this window of the project but it won’t improve your skills or work when you only have this small section on larger projects.

Marketing, sales, legal, IT, etc.* It's genuinely interesting to you and me! But to a lot of people out there what you just described is more boring than watching paint dry. Different strokes for different folks.* Variety also exists in many other careers... You know those prestigious companies you're talking about? And the exciting startups you're talking about? Guess what they both also hire? Non-SWE's.* Now you're just saying ""White Collar careers are the best careers by far"". This has nothing to do with SWE.* If you work for a large, well-known company it's just as likely (I'd argue significantly *more* likely) that you'll be working on some boring internal tool that has 20 internal users. Scale is also not inherent of this career. ""I work for Google"", ""Cool, what do you do there?"", ""Oh.. uhh... I manage a dashboard that lets a small team of internal users track internal budgets between departments"".It's a great career, don't get me wrong. But all of what you're describing isn't inherent of a SWE career, nor is it unique to a SWE career. There are billions of people. When you use words like ""best"", you're forgetting that the overwhelming majority of humans out there don't care at all about the things you care about.*Your* ""best"" career is someone else's living nightmare. Someone else's ""best"" career that makes them love waking up in the morning (someone who *enjoys* a manual labor job and like working outside, in extreme conditions for example), might be ***your*** living nightmare.If you enjoy SWE, pursue it.

(ammortization is the same in the long term- but getting the full break that year is the difference between 20% cost reduction and 4%.

The longer they can perpetuate it, the more desperate those people will get, and it creates a hermit crab conga line of companies firing their less senior staff hired when times were good to bring in more senior staff who've finally gotten desperate enough to accept lower pay.There is an argument to be made that because other companies are laying off tech staff and the abundance of tech graduates is creating an environment where wages are so severely depressed that it becomes in the interest of companies to also layoff their staff to rehire cheaper replacements *without direct collusion*, but **when that sort of behavior occurs in the banking sector or stock market, there are regulations in place to prevent the situation from becoming a feedback loop that tanks the institutions.** **This cycle of mass layoffs will repeat every time companies think they can get lower wages, more experience or both from a new hire over their current staff until the US gets serious about passing labor protection laws.**",Kalekuda,2025-06-07 14:24:51,44,cscareerquestions,t3_1l5kbzs,False,

If you're focusing on profitability, cost cutting by reducing labor is a huge lever.2. Tax issues like Section 174 also have an effect. For big tech companies, it doesn't matter as much since these companies are very profitable and have strong cashflow. They're already paying a lot of corporate income taxes in most cases anyways.

I think the reason why so many people latch on to it here is because it's a simple explanation where there's literally a number assigned to it. It's an easy way for people to hope: ""If only the interest rate goes down, market goes up!!"" But I think it's much more complex than just the interest rate number.First, I think companies are just trying to do more with less. I think this is a big cultural shift in tech that they need to be more efficient in terms of human capital and talent. I think this is here to stay. After all, it's in the culture of tech to want to optimize, streamline and efficientize everything. So we are seeing this play out in the workforce.Second, economic uncertainty (and interest rates!) is making companies invest less new projects that might not have immediate payoff, except for AI, which is supposed to automate a lot of stuff and save them costs in the long run.Third, AI. A lot of basic work can be done pretty easily with AI now and it saves so much time that would have typically required a junior-level worker. Aggregate all these little tasks that are able to get done fast and quick, and there's just less need for junior-level workers. I think AI is overplayed by AI companies and the general public, but I think on this subreddit, it's quite downplayed. I think too many people here are in denial tbh because to admit it means something very uncomfortable for them. AI is not fully replacing people anytime soon. But I think it can make many people quite efficient and productive across an entire company that there's less need for more workers to do the same amount of work.

He probably doesn't think about how much people like him or dislikes him, not because he doesn't care but because he hasn't thought about it, he is there to work. Make no mistake he has feelings and is sensitive to being hurt, that said, I did socialize in a small circle but I didn't waste time either.I was protected at times, especially in one job but they didn't change the expectations of everyone else, no. Instead I was looked at as a leader following a company mandate ( saving money ahead of downsizing - in 2015). Other guys asked me what they thought they should be doing instead. I had no idea and I wasn't ready to be a manager of others.Looking back, your manager needs to put aside through put to a degree whilst also acknowledging that maybe you don't want that person to work, maybe like I did all the time, they may regret not taking it a little slower and not enjoying the role more. And if they at all care about the person, they unilaterally should and it should be a concern discreetly shared to his peers, like you.As for letting him fail, I'm not surprised it being stated but still feel awful hearing other people say that and probably did about me. There's better ways and conversations then to just let someone drop and if I'm honest, you've probably got no idea if you're really testing him in the role. What I mean is, this may not be a strain for him or even considered work. This might be a passion and something they take a great deal of pride in and not even work but is paid to be. You have every right to raise a concern though and your manager needs to look at the person aspect. You all do but do it with them in mind as well as yourselves, maybe with their skills, they can learn to articulate them and go towards the team. It might be sensible to expect that the standard of work will improve and that doesn't have to be a bad thing (doesn't necessitate 'harder').

mvx6tt8,They do and they are. Wages haven’t kept up with inflation in many industries in the US since the 1970s. Every year people are being paid less. It’s a slow process because if they don’t pay good employees enough they jump ship to a competing company which is why today in a lot of white collar roles in the US it’s common to work 24 months at a company then switch. Larger companies like FAANG have attempted to address this through vesting. You don’t get fully paid unless you’re there for 4 years. On year 4 you’re getting paid for your first year of work. Leaving is like losing 4 years of half of your pay. In Europe wages are lower in part because people are far less likely to jump ship due to pay so they can just low ball everyone from the get go. Within the next 20 years it wouldn’t surprise me if in the US pay is closer to what Europeans are making but without the benefits.,proverbialbunny,2025-06-04 09:18:54,19,cscareerquestions,t3_1l30ir3,False,

A mediocre performance on a very supportive team will likely be better than a stellar performance on a highly dysfunctional team.

There's a lot of subjective opinions, but I think these are generally agreeable things that are worth prioritizing. It's relatively common to have weak support (either by a manager carousel or lack of E6+ sponsors) that can block your promo - ask me how I know lol. More subjectively, I think it's worth finding a team that you trust in their feedback (there are some people who are 10x more critical than average), and if you care about timelines, a staggering of levels (if there's like 8 E3s, it might take longer for your promotion to come through).

At meta the requirements are pretty clearly laid out but its really up to your team. They might not want to/cant give you opportunities to check off those requirements.Impact is also important. Theres an idea in big tech where you need to make impact, which means “what can i do to make something easier for another engineer”. Its not always “i have to work on the newest feature”(although ig is alway making then removing features lol), it could be related to fixing something for On-Call, etc. You just need to optimize some part of the job to “make life easier”.The only thing you need is to adapt and meet these requirement, but the hard part is if your team is going to even let you/give you the opportunity.

mvox3a7,"Approximately 1/50 application to interviews is pretty good in the current market. My advice would be to try to figure out what went wrong in the three interviews you did get, and work on fixing that in addition to applying. Because if you can fix that, you just need 1-2 more shots and you're good! Assuming you posted your resume to solicit feedback, here's a huge text wall of resume advice you can take or leave: As another user suggested, you might want a different template. I linked one at the bottom. I'm not sure if your template is the issue, but it doesn't hurt to try something different and test results, you can always circle back to what you have now. I'd also include a projects section, put your 2-3 most impressive school projects with some jazzed up bullet points (you can get an llm to help you with jazzing them up) and work on a project yourself using industry tools in the space you want to work in. Using and mentioning industry tools in projects is a great way to get through ATS assuming it's checking for keywords (for example ""Docker"", ""React"" and ""Java""). Here's an example of what I mean by a personal project, say you want to work with python full stack? Make and deploy a django app or something. Link the frontend on your resume, maybe the github too. What kind of app? I don't know. It doesn't have to be crazy, but try to use docker, a common database, maybe make the frontend with react that's popular af. If you can't get actual work experience in a company, try to get a bit of experience doing a project. You don't have to use industry tools to make a toy project, but doing so gives you a little practice and exposure to them which is what's valuable, and can help you get through ATS. Maybe even better than a personal project would be if you could contribute to an open source project and put that on your resume under the projects section. TLDR get a projects section and have your 3-4 most impressive projects on there until you get enough work experience to de-prioritize them. I'd shorten the skills section up to make room for the projects, mine is only two lines, languages and frameworks. I had an interview where the person was like, ok i'm going to list stuff from your skills section, you tell me on a scale of 1 to 10 how good you are with it, then proceeded to ask me corresponding difficulty questions about that skill/language/framework. After that, I trimmed my skills section up to stuff i'm at least a 4/10 confident in and it hasn't had a negative impact on my response rate.I'd consider putting one or two of those summer jobs back, you could put them under ""additional experience"" section at the bottom or something, just one liners very brief, if you give a description I think that describing teamwork and communication would help the most. For a template that has additional work experience I think the ""additional expereince"" template in this google doc from Codepath would be a good start (make a copy don't request edit access). [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDGkSD5l--GjKu56jw6frHmjr075QHbr\_wfma\_gmv8s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gjdgxs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDGkSD5l--GjKu56jw6frHmjr075QHbr_wfma_gmv8s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gjdgxs)You might want to consider making tailored resumes for different roles like swe, data analyst, etc where you put the popular keywords in. For example in your data analyst resume put a data project you did in there that uses powerBI or something at the top of the projects list, maybe change the skills up to include numpy pandas excel and tableau. Anyways, good luck. I'm curious from a scientific perspective if your response rate will improve after tweaking your resume.

mvist13,"One very important thing to keep in mind is that the markets from 2010-2022 were not all the same. We can't just give a single description/anecdote to describe that entire period.2010 for example was the recovery period from the Great Recession. Hiring was picking up compared to 2008-2009, but it was still slow and cautious. Companies were not hiring with confidence.2021 for example was the golden era of SWE. Companies were massively over hiring, the demand for SWE drastically outpaced the supply of CS grads, and that single-handedly created an entirely new sub-market of bootcampers and self-teachers. People already in the industry were job hopping and getting insane 100% raises,.That said, in my experience, good market or bad market, thing's aren't all that different. I still do the same interview prep, there's still the same kinds of startups/companies hiring, the expectation of this industry is still that you have a CS degree, etc. The difference I notice between a normal market (2011-2018-ish) and a bad market (2023+) is that the response rate is much lower. You need more applications to get responses. When I was applying for jobs in 2016 I did 10 applications total. When I was applying for jobs in 2021, I did 11 applications total. When I was applying for jobs in 2024, I did 82 applications total. I didn't feel like there was any difference in the process itself between those markets, once I got a company to actually interview me, the process was the sameFor your second note, I think the insane over-hiring of 2021 is what ruined todays market. Not AI. We're still recovering from that overhiring. A lot of people that wouldn't have had a chance of being hired in a normal market broke into the industry in 2021, and the industry is trying to self-correct. It's a slow, and painful process.AI is a valuable tool for SWE's. Some companies are buying into the hype, and might try to reduce headcount as a result, but it's still just hype. There's always some sexy new hyped up thing in the industry that companies try to chase, and might make them increase/reduce headcount. AI is no different.

In practice, it means that the law says an employer has to post a job ad for a role that had already been filled and ramped up a year+ earlier.The undertone of these kinds of exposes seem to be that some cohorts are more ""deserving of the opportunity conferred by the law"", but arguably the immigration lawyers involved are actually going by the spirit of the law (even if it may technically be malicious compliance) when they ask the H-1B worker to provide job descriptions with excruciatingly high level of detail to construct these job posts. It is already hard enough to get candidates to match nice-to-haves in a regular job post, so who else can check every checkmark in a huge and highly specific list other than the person that is already doing the function, and with zero ramp up time, to boot?

mwclx25,"Few things to unpack:First is understanding why there's a sense of urgency, and whether it is warranted. If something isn't literally on fire, you probably don't need to drop everything else to do it today. Normally you agree on milestones and delivery deadlines upfront, or at least in advance.Second is deconstructing delivery timelines based on whether it's due to technical complexity or due to scheduling. The former presumably means you've done some due diligence before estimating, and you should be able to articulate what the time consuming parts are with some degree of granularity, and their respective estimates. The latter is about what prior commitments you already have, and you have to decide how negotiable it is to make changes. Maybe you can deliver things faster by dropping/negotiating other things that have lower priorities or charging premium to work overtime or hiring a subcontractor, maybe not. If you can't, then be transparent about having other commitments. In other words, urgency is a feature, and you can charge money for it.If it's a question of perception, you could try to explain via analogies, e.g. in law movies everything happens very quickly, often within the same day, whereas in reality, they drag on for months/years because in the real world things just take time.

mwclop9,"I've been there. It is very frustrating.I think there's two parts to this. First, people who ask ""Can't you just do this today??"" or ""Why is this taking you so long? What's so difficult about it?"" are asking those questions because what they *really* want to know is When will it be complete? So your response to these questions should be a date you'll have that feature complete. Once you give a deadline, you'll get many fewer of these questions and if you do, just refer them to the aforementioned date.The other part of this is just that non-technical people just don't know how hard things are. They've been taught, through drag-and-drop website builders and, sadly, AI-marketing, that things are easy. A new form should take an hour to add, right?? It can also be helpful to explain, as part of the communication providing them with the estimated timeline, what goes into the feature you're building. If they ask for a button to send a report to their email, for example, you can explain that part of your work means preventing security issues, handling permissions, formatting the report, testing it, making sure the email doesn't go to spam, etc etc.As for the full-time job part, if they knew you had a full time job when they contracted with you, you can remind them of that, but I honestly think that's unnecessary to include.

mvo1byi,"I'm in a very similar boat. First job out of college, working as an integration developer at a startup for a year and a half. When I first started, I was told ""Go build an integration between our product and X CRM"" and that was about as much interaction as I got.Same thing where everything is always urgent, everything is always broken, everyone always needs something from you CONSTANTLY. I think that's unfortunately pretty common in SWE, but even more so at a startup.My advice would be first, to stop caring so much, and second, keep looking for new opportunities with a healthier company. I'm not saying give up, or slack off, but I am saying that you should understand and accept that you will always have work to do and tickets to complete, and if you put forth your best effort and don't get all of those tickets done, it's not a reflection of you or your productivity, it's a result of poor management and unrealistic expectations.When I first started, I felt like I had to grind late nights and weekends so that I could meet the needs of every customer, and I would often work 60+ hours a week just to push a project past the finish line. Time and time again, I would put in all of this extra work and a few weeks down the road, the customer would churn for a reason unrelated to my work and then suddenly all of those extra hours were for nothing.Nobody else cares about your mental health as much as you do, so you need to learn to set boundaries to protect your mental.I adopted the mantra ""Not my circus, not my monkeys"" lol. At the end of the day, if this company lives or dies, your life will ultimately be the same. Don't let it consume your life or your mental health, because one day you will find that it was all for nothing. My only other coworker in my department was just like me -- he stressed out about customers after hours and worked extra, and guess what? One day they decided he was too expensive and they canned him. All of those late nights and extra hours for nothing.Put forth your best effort during the work day and try to leave the stress in the office. If work is unfinished, it's unfinished, but it's not your problem because you already did as much as you reasonably should.I could go on and on, but my point is, *while you're looking for another job,* try to at least make this one more tolerable in the meantime by learning reasonable ways to protect your mental health. If you get punished for that in any way, let it roll off your shoulder knowing you're gonna leave the toxic environment as soon as you can anyway.",sheepbitinganimalman,2025-06-02 22:07:28,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1l1nq2d,False,

Prospective employer says thanks, hangs up the phoneAnd if your title/tenure doesn’t at least kinda match what is in your previous employer’s ERP, you have introduced a new line of questioning for your prospective employer.In so far as job seeking is concerned, nothing title-wise really matters outside of very large tech companies with well understood levels.

Just like you don't need to know how to build React from scratch, or Javascript from scratch.But are you talking academically or professionally? A very common kind of project in college is to reimplement very common data structures / concepts. From an academics perspective, yes, you need to learn to rebuild it if that's what's being asked of you. That's the point of those courses. It's a big part of your degree.Professionally, no, we don't know asbtractions so deeply that we could easily reimplement them off the top of our head. We go deep enough that we can use them to do our job.It goes further. *Everything we know* is built on layers, and layers, and layers, and layers of abstractions.

I’m one of a few here at my company that have a CS background and I became a lead within about 6 months after being hired as a “Senior Developer”.

Most people find 45-50 hours a week with short bursts above that sustainable, and I think that's a good place to target. You will be be pressured to work more; be ready to gracefully wiggle out of it.2. Whenever you ask someone for a piece of information (""what is X?"", ""how do I do Y?""), also find out how they know/obtained that information. Getting questions answered is good (and you should ask a lot of questions), but you should also be learning how to find answers yourself.3. Underpromise and overdeliver. You should describe every single task task you complete as both absolutely amazing and the product of tons of hard work.4. Optimize your commute. If you spend an hour sitting in the car each way, that's equivalent to working an extra 10 hours a week. Live close to work, work from home, or go in early and leave early to beat traffic. I usually listen to a podcast on the way in and call out of state family on the way home, much better than feeling your brain bleed out your ears as you sit in traffic.5. Be *very* careful when it comes to agreeing to take responsibility for something. Once you take responsibility for a project or feature you become the person on the hook for it, and if/when things go poorly you're going to be working 80 hour weeks while out of your mind. You need to be strategic, you need to advocate for yourself, and you need to resist peer pressure.6. If you're on a team of workaholics, just lie.

mvic3s6,"On going to college in general: If money is not an issue (which it sounds like it isn't because the state program is helping you), then going to college is generally a good idea, regardless of major (see [https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2011/collegepayoff.pdf](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2011/collegepayoff.pdf) for how much it's worth in $$$). The piece of paper you get at the end is one thing, but what's more important are the general skills that you can learn from pursuing a college degree: time management on a progressively longer scale, learning independently, collaborating with other people. Of course, these may be skills you have picked up from elsewhere, but if they are not (or if not to the level you would like), then this is an excellent opportunity to pick them up. Note that these are not necessarily things that happen automatically, though; graduation requirements get you the piece of paper, but how you spend your time engaging with your coursework determines what skills you'll actually get out of your degree. This is especially true if you're able to go full time and not worry about work during that time, because otherwise you will rarely have the time and energy to spend as you like on thinking and learning as you will during those 4 years.On majoring in CS: choosing CS because you ""like math and computers"" is a much better rationale than choosing it because of the job market, and part of why there are a lot of people complaining about the job market now is because a lot of people entered this field only because of the second reason back when the market was good. This of course does not guarantee you a job, but it does mean you're more likely to engage more deeply with the material in the degree, which means you will get more out of the degree one way or another. That said, do you know whether the program will allow you to switch majors? While you shouldn't switch out just because some class is harder than expected, if you discover that CS is really not for you, having the option to switch into something that better matches with your interests will make starting the program feel less constraining.On getting a job after: Let's be honest, no one actually knows what the job market will look like 4 years from now. Will it be challenging, especially with your nontraditional background? Probably. But would it be so bad that you would regret even \*trying\* in the first place?

If I were in your shoes, I'd try out some free resources before signing up for any classes.

The Odin Project is a great starter resource if you're into / want to try web development. If you choose the school route, go to a community college first to save some money, then transfer to a state school. See if you qualify for any grants. If not, check out scholarships. Regardless of your decision, I don't think you should base it solely off of the opinions of people from the internet. Not saying you are, but I just wanted to make note. Do your own research, make a plan (budget, time, courseload) and look into possible programs. Do you have any connections in the industry? Even a connection in something software-adjacent, like IT, would be valuable. Any sort of connection would help.

I've noticed that you really have to make an effort to get to know your co-workers because water cooler talk is non-existent. You want to get to know your co-workers because you want to be able to work with senior/principal engineers. The jrs who have a good upper level engineer on their side are usually the ones who succeed. It's hard to create the connection online because everybody is so busy and if they arent they arent trying to have DM chats with their co-workers. Also you never have that transition so it is very easy to work 10+ hours without realizing it. Becuase yo uarent sure if others have left or not and sometimes doing an extra 30 minutes because you can and are waiting for something to finish building is easy to do with your laptop in the other room.

These are all things you should be asking about in the reverse interview.Next time you job hop, make it a point to reverse interview.

You need to be the one rejecting companies you don't want to work for.That being said, I don't think your situation is that bad. Firstly, *you got a job*. In 2023, as a new grad. That's a win, regardless of the stack you're using.Also, especially this early in your career, companies won't necessarily require an exact 1-1 match of their tech stack expectations. You know Java. That's big. You can learn Spring on the side, or even on the job, it's not that hard. Just because you haven't worked professionally with Spring doesn't mean you're unqualified for Java/Spring positions.Anecdotally, I've switched stacks completely many times. Companies aren't DQ'ing me because I have no experience in their stack. They know I can learn on the job, and my resume paints that picture. One company I was talking to used Java/Micronaut, which was a completely new concept for me. That interested me, I had some great conversations about it with my interviewers, its pros/cons compared to Spring, etc. I got an offer. My confidence, and my interest in learning the new tech, made up for lack of experience in a core technology that company used. You can do the same, swapping out Spring/Micronaut with GWT/Spring.All that said, right now you're disqualifying youself without even trying.

Basically slowing down hiring for 90 days until the foreigners on visa have to self deport?Hiring freezes and layoffs are company-driven decisions. Those companies have no incentive to drive foreign workers out of the country - that would just make the cost of labor for them go up. Most companies want foreign workers to be available.So this makes no sense.

Be comfortable with saying ""okay, I don't know how that works properly... for now"". For now, just take a deep breath, every senior you respect has been where you are today. Here are some tips to make your life easier:1. Keep your world small. The route you already did with your mentor is the GOLD right now. You have 2 possible small ways you can expand your world. A) implement the rest of the routes for the project that you are working on right now, B) implement the same route across other projects. - It is probably easier to implement the other routes. 2. When working on this type of thing, you will be slow initially, it might take you 2 weeks to get through 2 routes initially, but by the last week of the summer you might complete a route per day. In order to move quickly, you are going to have to move slowly and intentionally. Things like Gradle / DI / those other internal tools and random config files on first blush don't sound super relevant to the task at hand, only learn how to use it if it is going to progress your goal. If you are going to *not* learn it on purpose, write it down and square it away for later. 3. Ask for feedback often, your mentor may be able to tell you what route would be the next simplest to tackle. 4. Don't be afraid to look at pull requests where any specific route was implemented. Often times, complete feature pull requests give you a really good idea of just how ""Small"" your world can be when you want it to, if you find some good ones. 5. If you are stuck on a particular thing for more than an hour, ask - just ask, ask your mentor or something else, ""Hey , do you have 5 minutes to explain something to me? I am trying to understand why when I remove the mock here this other test unexpectedly breaks - I Think you mentioned this during our call , but I think I just need a quick refresher - would super appreciate it!"" Just take it a day at a time, recognise that feeling like you don't know stuff is normal, panicking will not help you and it will detract from your ability to learn. You are also wrong about one thing, the ability to ""remember"" context is not key for success at larger companies, the actual key is realising what context does and does not matter. No one on your team knows everything, they're just capable of figuring out what bits are important enough to learn *today* to progress them towards whatever goal they're working on. Late July is a also a fairly reasonable goal for the task you were given, without knowing the specifics of the codebase. You'll be fine, just keep your head down, stick to it, and remember, keep your world small!",Abject_Parsley_4525,2025-06-07 15:39:01,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1l5mzmu,False,

Make a new database with the UI and do CRUD operations. Can get up to speed in 1 day. Oracle isn't nearly as common as it used to be and MySQL is the cheapskate version of Oracle. MSSQL is good though.* **Learn one of AWS, Azure, GCP**. I used to think no one used GCP but I saw one company switch to it because it's cheaper. Recruiters were always cool with me only knowing 1 of the 3 since the others are easy to learn at that point. Using on the job goes a long way, else get an entry level cert that you see listed in a few job applications. The only cert that not a scam for this reason but it is crazy expensive. Thus your employer pays. Probably need a book or course and the exam has extra cheating detection.* **Learn one of Docker or Kubernetes**. You can learn both but there's some overlap. Pick what you see more in job descriptions. I guess Kubernetes and that's what I've seen more as well.* Microservices, yeah this is on the job experience. You can't teach yourself, or you can, but it won't matter to a recruiter.* Less important: Compliment Java with another language. Could be Python, Kotlin, Go aka Golang or TypeScript/JavaScript with your choice of React or Angular. Actually is important but if not used on the job, it ranks here.* Less important: Use Jetty with Spring Boot, preferably now on the job for local testing.

But in 2025, that probably won’t lead to a pathway into a more technical role, since most data science and ML roles are looking for either loads of experience or advanced education.

mw3i43j,"Short answer: While I want to say ""YES, it will open doors for you!"" the reality is more akin to avoiding a penalty than actually helping you. Most people in the field have a degree, and it puts you on a level playing field.Not having the degree is going to close doors -- there's no way around it. That doesn't mean that there are no open doors for you, but it's going to limit you. Particularly if you ever think you might want to work in another country, your visa may hinge entirely on having a CS degree.When changing careers to software engineering, I went and did exactly what you are considering and got a Masters in CS. I have never even once had regrets, and many of the opportunities I've had wouldn't have been possible without it. If you have the time, and can afford the expense (I received a partial scholarship), I cannot recommend it enough.Additionally, considering the current job market, it is so competitive for new grads right now that I don't think companies are taking risks on giving someone their first CS job with no work history and no degree. At this particular moment in time, I think it would be incredibly difficult to get your first job in the industry unless you already have personal connections to do so (getting the first job without a degree and proving yourself is the biggest hurdle) or are prepared to work for absolutely abysmal pay or conditions (which may have lifelong career repercussions -- people will probably know exactly how your previous employer paid you and treated you, and it can be a struggle for your wages to catch up even as you move to better and better companies). Getting the degree also gives time for the current job market to possibly improve, though I don't know I'd put money on it getting better so that's neither here nor there.",wouldprefernot,2025-06-05 07:32:28,11,cscareerquestions,t3_1l3rnlk,False,

Call it coders and SWE. Coder will be a pretty run of the mill middle class, white collar job. SWE is highly compensated working on harder, more interesting, problems. Access to the latter category of jobs will increasingly be gated on pedigree: where you went to school, who you interned with, where you previously worked. Jumping tracks will be difficult to near impossible without some sort of inflection (like getting a graduate degree from a top institution). This is already how it works in other fields like law and finance. In finance there is retail finance and high finance. In law there’s big law raking in big bonuses and local firms that aren’t.

mvywar2,"I agree. My GF is somewhat like this.I recently lost my job and spent 3 months unemployed. When I got my new job they were offering me a good bump from my last job (about a 30% raise). When I told my GF (we live together) she looks at me and says ""OMG we will be able to buy so much for our house"".I dont want her to sound like she is money craved, it's more like she is a spend-mentality where i am save mentality. My mindset is I will live the same regardless of how much money I make (to a certain degree) and just save the rest and hoepfully retire younger. When I heard about the 30% raise my first thought was ""ok I can set about 10% of that to pay off some stuff from when I was unemployed, then when that's down invest that 10%, maybe with another 10% i will put in my savings/invest funds and then the last 10% will be for anything for us"". When she said that I was taken a bcak. My GF is someone who will pay and buy for her own things so I have never felt like she has cared about it. She'll buy me clothes even when I dont ask for it. She makes good money too. She has good money saved but when it comes for future money she hasnt really prepared well for it. She is definetely more of a spender than a buyer. To your point about people not wanting to go down. I gave her some tips to help her save more and told her to put maybe a couple hundred bucks per paycheck. She did it and for over a month she was crying about how little her paycheck was now looking. Again this is a girl who makes 6 figures. I think she is around 105k and in a no-income state her take home is probably around 70k.",Broad-Cranberry-9050,2025-06-04 15:40:47,1,cscareerquestions,t1_mvwrm8l,False,

mw1mg8u,"Things coming up that interrupt a sprint, and unknowns that make tickets take longer than originally estimated, are of course the norm. It's why we call it an *estimate.*What's important is how you *handle* those things.When I'm asked to do something ad hoc, I respond with something like ""Sure thing! I'll have to shift focus away from X in order to do that though, so X won't get done"".I have 40 hours in a week. My manager/PM is in charge of deciding how I use those 40 hours, they get to choose my priorities, so if they want me to address something immediately, I will. But *I'm* in charge of setting expectations, and enforcing my professional boundaries of a 40 hour work week. So the question goes back to them, they can trade one priority for another. They don't get to tell me ""Everything's gotta get done"", that's just a sign of poor management if they try. Luckily for management though, a lot of SWE's are scared to establish professional boundaries, so they just decide to quietly do everything and inflate their hours beyond 40, which is not sustainable.When unknowns pop up in tickets that I've estimated, I very clearly communicate those things as early as possible. ""X, Y,and Z came up while doing this ticket. We can either make a 2nd ticket to tackle next sprint and close this one out partially complete, or we can include that increased scope as a part of this ticket and it'll carry over"".It's all about how you respond.

This varied by team, but sometimes someone would act as a point person for the sprint from other teams. I don't recall if this was the same person every sprint, or if two different people played the roles.Perhaps your manager would be open to tracking the additional work that way. It might also be helpful to track how much time is being spent either not fixing things the right way or poor planning. Some of what you're describing sounds like requirements might be inaccurate, which adds to these issues popping up. There could also be an increased culture of testing. There used to be a practice back in the day that whoever broke the build was the new buildmaster until the next person. Or, you can rotate the role. It may give people more appreciation of what they are committing (realistically, there are some people who will never care). But if you go with a per-sprint role, maybe that can be a pointed ticket/story to cover that work. Sounds like your manager might not like those ideas because they just want to push features, but it's worth at least having the discussion. It's real work, and it may help the team find ways to be more efficient in the long-term. Another huge advantage of these rotations is spreading knowledge across the team.

So that discrepancy - like, $400-$500K - *that* is really tough to offset.But if you're just sacrificing $25K a year, $75K total?
