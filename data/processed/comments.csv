The Apache stack is a good place to start as it is free. Be warned, it is not easy with the configuration especially if you are a noob. You can also use the Databricks free edition to practice; and perhaps sign up for the databricks academy whilst you are at it.Also, it is best that you also learn how to set up a linux virtual machine (to run your cluster), bash, get familiar with the linux terminal commands, and master SQL. The common sql flavours are Hive, Spark, Trino and PostGres. Heck even kafka uses its own brand of SQL. Learning PySpark is also useful, especially for Spark transformations and when using the Databricks platform. Learning Java is useful if you need to go deeper into those tools, as those big data tools by Apache run on Java, and the latest and greatest features are released on Java first. Learning git and docker (containerisation) is also useful for an infrastructure as code approach.If you are intending to just be a user of Big Data platforms, just skip ahead to mastering SQL and PySpark.You can also consider learning cloud infrastructure too (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform) as they have their own flavours of big data infrastructure which is another rabbit hole to venture into. They have their own courses and certification programmes.For a more holistic education, reading books on data warehousing, data lakes and delta lakes would cap it off nicely.

Just off the top of my head:- To make calculations consistent across teams. If teams across large orgs aren't sharing code with one another (as what typically happens), one team might calculate the same KPI slightly differently from another. This is just an extension of the single source of truth logic that guides a silver layer.- Not all analysts on all teams are going to be technically proficient enough to produce the aggregated data they need. That's a great aspirational goal, maybe FAANG gets there with their amazing pickings. But for 99% of orgs, that just isn't happening.- Some analysts re-query the same data sets *a lot* during development.

Your use case (drilling down by UPC, store, category, department) is pretty much textbook OLAP stuff that CH excels at.A few things to consider though:1. You'll still need to think about your data modeling. ClickHouse works best when you denormalize things into wide tables, which might mean rethinking how you structure your retail data2. The PowerBI integration exists but it's not as smooth as native connectors. You might want to test the performance of PowerBI queries hitting ClickHouse before committing3. Consider whether you actually need PowerBI at all for this. Are you embedding a PowerBI dashboard into a user-facing app? If so, any reason not to ditch it and just build some data APIs and a custom dashboard UI?Druid is also solid for this but ClickHouse has better SQL support and is generally easier to work with imo.I'd definitely recommend spinning up a ClickHouse instance and loading a subset of your data to test query performance before making any big decisions.

One important aspect is your query patterns. A warehouse starts running with a single query and remains running for at least a minute after the last query (if configured to auto suspend). If you have something that queries the data periodically, like every five minutes, this will add up very fast. The smallest warehouse is like 3k per month full time running at the higher plans, so keep that in mind.What I think I would recommend is a combination of Snowflake and something opensource you can run yourself, using Iceberg tables.

nbbge6r,"This is the wrong way to think about this.Snowflake is a consumption based pricing model. It's not really about the size of your data at all. It costs $X for Y compute, and $2X for 2Y compute, and so on.They give you a free trial to figure out your estimated costs for your usage. It's easy to determine $X/Y ratio.It scales up and down so you can match supply (Monday morning rush, end of month workloads, that new ML experiment you want to try, basically turn off on nights and weekends) with compute demand. The important thing about the cloud is you can rent compute elastically.BUTthat $X/Y ratio for compute in Snowflake (compared to other options including DIY) is a bit of premium, because it's a SaaS and everything is managed for you \*and\* they are offering a lot of functionality - particularly GenAI, enterprise-grade DR, data sharing, etc - that you may not need.It's up to you to decide if you'll avail yourself of that functionality to justify the premium pricing Snowflake charges.So the math is simple:DIY/open source/IaaS is lower capex (""Free!\*\*\*"") + a lot of opex (""pay people to manage it"") for ... a highly variable set of functionality. (Good luck doing AI on open source Postgres)PaaS/SaaS is higher capex (""Snowflake is expensive!"") + very little opex (""this thing runs itself"") for ... a fairly robust set of functionality.So in my opinion it's not really about the size of your data and more what you (and in your case, your tenants) intend to do with it.When my old boss was buying new chairs for the office, he said something that stuck with me: ""When you buy something cheap, and you use it every day, you start to hate yourself for being so cheap. When you buy something expensive, and you don't use it at all, you start to hate yourself for being so careless. Be sure before you buy something you know how often you're going to use it.""PS: I work at Databricks where basically the same logic applies, so you can trust what I wrote here, I don't say nice things about Snowflake as a rule, but they are a high quality product at a high quality price.

The best you can do is spend too much time querying to get all dimension values found in your dataset, which may be missing critical dimension values. * Redacting PII or other data is vastly simpler in a dimension table of 100,000 rows than in a OBT of 400 columns and 10,000,000,000 rows. * Sometimes people want to see dimensions associated with an event from some other time then when the event occurred. For example, what's the contact for this customer *now*, or name of this company *now*, or what was the industry category for the customer at the end of last year? All of this is trivial for a dimensional model and impossible for OBT. * Usability sucks with a OBT with 250+ columns * etc, etc, etc, etcFor this reason I see OBTs as an occasional early version, but dimensional models as the feature-rich mature version of most analytical databases.",kenfar,2025-08-29 00:13:25,13,dataengineering,t3_1n2qrgu,False,

And so you proceed up the hill, washing the earth and narrowing your lines every time the absence of gold in the pan shows that you are outside the spread of the fan; and at last, twenty yards up the hill your lines have converged to a point—a single foot from that point you cannot find any gold.

nak0dvu,">Do you have any tips on how a junior can gain confidence and build experience faster in this role?You can't build confidence or experience faster than you can build it. We all learn at our own pace. Some learn faster, some learn slower.That being said, confidence comes when you can accept your circumstances and just live with it. Make a mistake? Be fine with it. Do a great job? Feel proud, but don't let it get to your head. People being shitty to you when you're trying to improve? Ignore them and keep your head down. This is all part of learning and improving.Second advice - if you want to be concretely better at stuff, only use LLMs when you want to save time doing things you already know how to do. If you use LLMs to completely generate the output you are looking for, you will end up with huge gaps in your knowledge. People hate the idea of spending time learning things, lean on LLMs to do everything for them, and in a few years wonder rage on Reddit about how they can't get a job because they get rejected for trying to use an LLM during an interview.",MikeDoesEverything,2025-08-25 09:30:44,19,dataengineering,t3_1mzlfgw,False,

na91qth,"Obviously, great work if you did that alone without much DE experience beforehand. I guess a few points to consider:1. How will the pipeline behave if the UI changes on the website you are pulling the data from, or if the website is down or behaving slowly? In my own experience, Selenium is quite limited to basic actions like “wait for page to load” or “wait until the export button appears.” I would assume you, as a BI Analyst, would probably know when the UI change happens since you are closer to the business user. But still, you don’t (at least you have not mentioned it) have any sort of monitoring or alerting and are just relying on everything working smoothly. So I would advise thinking about adding logging and alerts for those cases.2. Again, this kind of follows the second point, but it would probably make sense to add some retry logic when pulling the data if the website is slow on that particular day.3. Raw data is usually pretty fucking bad, and it’s the task of a Data Engineer to make the business see only pretty fucking good data. What I mean by that is: do you have any validation in place to prevent bad data from getting into your Power BI models? You mentioned you are pulling customer data profiles and geolocations, and this kind of data is soooo easy to get messed up - it’s insane. For example, postal codes being bad, or missing pieces of an address, like the street being available but not the city, etc. So I would think about adding some sort of validation for your data, if it’s not already part of the transformations you are doing.4. You are pulling the Excel files, applying and saving them, and then reading them and saving as parquet. Why? Literally, no offense, but why? You have two versions of the same file in different file formats stored. I would probably store the raw Excel files somewhere for archival purposes so that if you need to check the raw data, you don’t need to re-download them. But I would store transformed files directly in parquet to avoid unnecessary reads/writes.5. Create/replace tables is a simple, working strategy, which is cool, but really inefficient for big tables since you have to reload everything. I would suggest checking out `MERGE` or `INSERT...ON CONFLICT` statements for incremental updates so that if a row is unchanged from the previous table version, you don’t need to reload it. Also, I assume your SQL commands look like: `CREATE TABLE t1 AS SELECT * FROM 'file1.parquet';` Which is normal, but I would advise wrapping it in transaction logic. What does this mean? Imagine your tables fail in the middle, and you have 10 tables. Now you are stuck with 5 updated and 5 old tables - sucks, right? To ensure that your group of loading operations is atomic (meaning they either all succeed or all fail together), you must manually wrap them in a transaction block. That way, you know for sure that either all of them were updated, or all of them are in their previous state, but the data is still consistent between them.Again, what you did is really solid, especially for your first time, but maybe my wall of text will help you a bit. I am also open to any comments since I suck at DE and maybe messed up somewhere. Be very proud of what you designed.",Fiarmis,2025-08-23 14:19:02,7,dataengineering,t3_1mxzqt1,False,

A much more interesting discussion around this is how the AI boom is basically keeping the (American) economy sustained; how we’re on the verge of data center infrastructure bubble bursting similar to the telecom bubble the late 90s; how we’ll have trouble feeding electricity to all these new data centers and how electricity prices will continue go up because of that and because policy makers are putting the brakes on renewables; how all this new AI tech is amounting to little more low quality slop being generated at an unprecedented rate and we’re essentially stuck with it forever.

naqk2lz,"I'm a TL in Data Engineering.Reading your sample github, I would:- Trust you to write some functions- Trust you to follow an existing architecture, with existing code to use as examples to copy/paste- Put you on ""write the code"" tasks for solutions designed by more senior contributors- Expect you to learn from our mediors in the team- In the job interview, put (neutral, non-aggressive, heavy technical) pressure on depth of data engineering knowledge that I expect you wouldn't have (and that I don't expect/need you to have), to test whether you respond in honesty (""I don't know"") or in ego (anger, frustration)- Have an opening as a Junior (to potentially grow fast into Medior), depending on results/connection with the team/willingness to learn/honestyI would not:- Trust that you can write code without AI (worsened by [this file](https://github.com/mrpbennett/etl-pipeline/blob/main/src/api.py) of yours that has its import header duplicated, with a typical ""# Rest of the code..."" marker that AI sometimes does)- Trust you in your contributions with full independence/autonomy- Trust you with business-critical parts that require domain knowledge- Trust you to come up with an architecture- Trust you with processing of any significant volume, where simple python functions would be way too slow to use, or any part where multi-node processing is involved- Trust that you have deep knowledge of statistics, especially domain-specific ones (which can be okay, specialized members of the team will give you the formulas to implement in this case, just something to be mindful of)- Expect you to be able to give pipeline estimations or guarantees (SLAs, min/max guarantees for performance/timing/efficiency/hardware resources for a new process you're implementing)I would probably set my expectations for you as a Junior while you get started, with some general programming knowledge but no experience in data engineering, in the hopes that I can see you demonstrate Medior expertise after learning what you're missing from our mediors.Your github sample project shows general coding skills, not data engineering experience. And it's heavily focused on the parts you can copy/paste from articles or stackoverflow (basic email regex, basic dockerfile, basic fastapi setup), not the parts for which an actual data engineer is needed (considerations for filetypes, data structures, algorithms, partitioning, larger-than-memory processing, multi-node processing, data lineage, access control, data quality for a team of at least 10 to 20 contributors, etc).If you're humble, open-minded, you connect with the team, and you learn from them: all good. As long as you have enough understanding of the fundamentals (intuitive understanding, not leetcode), we can teach you the rest.If, instead, you feel bad about being considered a Junior at first, you feel a constant need to talk about having been Lead Solution Eng. in the past, and it's distracting you from learning the job -> won't last.Pay/salary would be Junior while you grow to Medior. If you have more experience than I would have guessed, or you learn faster, I could see someone get that raise within 3 months. If you have a normal trajectory instead, it would usually happen after 3+ years.----tl;dr: Seems like a lot of info, it boils down to:- Is going from Lead Solution Engineer to Data Engineering your genuine passion/interest? If it is, enjoy it, enjoy learning, let go of expectations. If it isn't, reconsider. It seems more sideways than upwards, which means reskilling.- Impostor syndrome can come from your expectations for yourself.

Like yeah, data is messy and unpredictable in ways that traditional software isn't, but that's exactly why you need better tooling and processes around it. The messiness doesn't go away just because you're cowboy coding your way through it.The schema as code thing is huge. We believe very strongly in general ""data as code"" principles at Tinybird (all resources defined as code and managed with version control). Seen a lot of people get burned because their production schema drifted from what they thought it was, or they made an upstream change that broke downstream consumers without realizing it. Having that versioned and trackable is just basic hygiene at this point.The local dev environment piece is important too. One thing that I love about webdev, specifically Next.js, is just spinning up that local next server and getting instant feedback on front end changes. We've focused on that a lot at Tinybird, making it easier for people to not only spin up ClickHouse locally, but actually test the whole pipeline end-to-end including ingestion and API layer. It's a huge shift in the right direction imo.I guess the key is not just blindly copying SE practices but adapting them for data's unique challenges.

Keeping all that infra running just to read binlogs in a small team setting didn’t feel worth it.One project I recently came across that sits right in this middle ground is OLake. Instead of going full streaming, it can just read from MySQL/Postgres logs in a more batch or micro batch oriented way - like you schedule a sync job with Airflow or cron or they even have temporal integrated in their UI offering, and it picks up exactly what changed.

nb2pqez,"TL;DR: gather requirements and build something that works for YOUR use case. Don’t shoehorn your functional requirements into a framework that wasn’t built to meet the functionality you need from your system.I personally like the medallion architecture in principle, but this is the classic issue with it: shoehorning your specific use case into a framework that doesn’t work for you. The medallion works well for what it’s meant to because it encompasses separation of concerns, e.g. land raw, untouched data in ‘raw’, cast, parse, and make data workable in ‘stg’, then join and aggregate data into usable datasets in ‘gold’/‘marts’. This makes trouble shooting easier and pipeline creation systematic. You architecture says to hell with that but let’s call it “medallion”. It’s not, when you modify data in “raw” it’s no longer actually… raw… the medallion architecture also wasn’t built with data catalogs (thinking catalogs in the observability sense, I.e a data dictionary, you may have a different meaning. Too many new buzzwords) or semantic layer in mind. It was built as a framework for what are now data/analytics engineers to systematically build pipelines. With that being said, forget the idea of using medallion architecture for your use case. Don’t shoehorn your functional requirements into a framework that isn’t meant support your functional requirements. I don’t like the idea of joining tables or building incremental models in “bronze”, but if it makes sense for your use case then great. Is it because you need that data for backfills/full refreshes of your catalog layer? Maybe use s3 to store that in partitioned files instead. Have a team super familiar with sql/dbt but not familiar with how to integrate with s3 and would be a hassle to train? Then that solution is out of the picture. One last thing: report specific layers are dumb imo. Don’t do that. That’s how you get one report that says revenue was X and another that says revenue was Y because analyst B was working with VP C who doesn’t believe GAAP needs to be followed precisely and wanted his dashboard to make him feel good. Or you’ll just get duplicate queries/tables. We have an “analytics”/metrics/semantic layer organized by what fact table it stems from. That’s what works for us, it may not work for you, but we designed it to work for our use case and tech stack",Routine-Ad-1812,2025-08-28 04:08:12,3,dataengineering,t1_nb2bwrc,False,
nb31frb,"I'm not sure where the confusion is. We are exactly making sure not to shoehorn our requirements to fit into a framework that isn't built to meet the functionality needed for our system.That's the entire point of the post and my comments here. Whenever there is a use case that comes in front of us that doesn't fit into the way we've structured our DBT project, we figure out how to fit it in, we don't change the requirements to fit how we're doing things.Maybe someone can actually expand on the downvotes to my comment instead of pointing out other things instead? I could be completely wrong with what I said, but I can't learn anything if we're not actually responding to anything specific in my downvoted reply. Only thing I can think of is that maybe DBT's recommendations have evolved since they've added semantic layers, since you would generally want to build semantic layers on top of your silver layer, so it should definitely fit somewhere into the DBT project.As far as how the medallion architecture works, I've seen what I've said recommended here and elsewhere before. It's like you said, just do what fits your use case. When you say raw, you mean something more raw than I might. When people at my company say raw, they mean something that you can use to rebuild anything that's raw. That might be renaming fields back to their original names, reconstructing an original field, or casting numeric columns back to varchars.That being said, I agree with you that once you starting doing more complex stuff like incrementals, joins, etc., it stops being a view into the original raw data and starts to become something more.However, if you asked me if these models more closely represented raw data in a bronze layer or business entities in a silver layer, I would tell you that these models more closely represented raw data. This is because the entire intention of these models are to surface a more curated view into the raw layer. They answer questions like ""I see that X from this data source is being mapped to Y in this other data source, why are these data sources related this way?"" Then you can go into the models for each data source and see how they've been transformed so that those models can be related together.For example, maybe there's some fuzzy search logic that builds an incremental mapping for related columns shared by the 2 data sources which then gets joined into each model. Does this change the raw data in any way other than adding new fields to these datasets? No, but is this logic that we think is simple enough that we would justify doing it on top of our source data? No. And does the result represent a business entity? Still no, because the business entity would probably be these 2 datasets joined or unioned together.Having said that, if your problem with my original post and not my comment is that I classified that layer as ""bronze"" and don't want me to call it that, that's fine. That's not my intention and frankly I don't care what it's called, I just chose to call it (in parentheses) something I thought others would understand. Maybe I didn't explain it very clearly in my original post, feel free to let me know.For your last note, thanks for the suggestion. I agree, we try to shy away from report-specific stuff as much as we can unless we have a really specific use case that really doesn't fit with what everyone else is doing (some nasty period-over-period metrics for example). I like your idea of an ""analytics"" layer instead, makes perfect sense.",simplybeautifulart,2025-08-28 05:43:18,1,dataengineering,t1_nb2pqez,True,

na8sz29,"You are going about it in a weird way. Go back to your management and convince them to apply the concept of an analytics window. I have worked on this problem multiple times already, most notably with logistics. It’s the same concept with deliveries in that open orders on the last few days of the month will only be closed many days after. My advice is that you get the highest possible time that the order is closed, use that as your window, and only calculate by then. This is similar to intra-day calcs where hourly measures have maybe a window of a few minutes, a variance expectation, and an end-of-day resolution via batch job. As an example: if closing an order takes 4 days maximum like in your case, then calculate your close rate on the morning of the 5th. Basically, you’ve given all open orders from the previous month the appropriate waiting time to close. This way, you can properly report on them already.What of the still open orders by then? Consider them unresolved. This is an analytical tradeoff your management should accept on a monthly basis. If they find this problematic, then do multiple checkpoints: an initial view a day after the month (highest number of open orders), a view after the initial window, i.e. T+5, and a view maybe 2 weeks after. At that point, you should be able to have extreme confidence in your data. Variance should be very low, except in extreme outlier circumstances.If revenue is being tracked using this order system, well… you’re doing it wrong. Or rather your company is doing it wrong. They should be doing that off of your invoice system, not your analytical data. It can be a placeholder, sure, but nothing says money earned as well as money that actually arrived in the bank etc. The best you SHOULD tell your stakeholders is that this is estimated revenue from orders and that it is not indicative of actual money coming in. That is for the finance department to resolve, not yours. You’re a data engineer.

nb9fhn6,"Salting is a good approach, when the tables you are joining is having many-many relationship. Let's say TBL A has 100m rows for same prim\_key you are joining on, and TBL B has let's say 1000 rows for the same prim\_key, now when you are doing joins, the result is 100m \* 1000 rows in single core/executor. Now let's say you introduced a new key with salt factor of 100 for eg. You pick the smaller table and do cross join and create 1000 \* 100 rows for TBL B, you add a new col in TBL A and 100m will be divided by 100 for each salt key resulting in 1m rows per each salt key. Now when you perform join, your executor is effectively processing still 1000 from B, 1m rows from TBL A --> final count per core / executor --> 1000 \* 1m.You can do the math for two large tbls, the only consideration is the table which is going to have smaller rows should be choosen for cross join candidate, and your executor should have enough memory to handle this data skew in the first place.

nar2zhj,"It really depends what tools you have available. I worked at a bank a long time and have dealt with similar challenges, with this kind of request, limited access to tools. If you have access to python and pandas, use it. Doing this entirely in VBA macros would be challenging. If your team has access to their own database server, that might be an option as well. The question will be where that script will live and run on a daily basis. The other challenge you are facing sounds like understanding how to join your data sources to get the desired output, and it sounds like even the final output structure might not be fully defined yet. You need to know exactly what level of detail your final output should be and work backwards on how to get there. My understanding as you described it, you need a current view of commercial customers based on the previous business day, at the customer level, their CCID (commercial customer ID), some data related to that at the company/business level, delivered daily to a brand new Excel file which will live in a shared folder where another team can access it. Where it's not clear, is what level of data you are looking for. If it's at the company/business level, you mentioned you only need one id per company, then what is unique about customers that you need? Dates? Their commercial status? If at customer level, should it be customer, account level? I see two levels you are looking at that you need to resolve, commercial customer (id), and individuals associated with that id. Look for maybe a relationship code in the source that has individuals, there may be a single individual with a primary relationship you can filter on, without knowing more, it would be difficult for anyone to help you with your join issues. It will be way easier to figure it out if you can import all that data into some kind of structured database environment, and pandas can emulate that.",Super_Ad5378,2025-08-26 12:21:43,4,dataengineering,t3_1n0fbyg,False,

Large Language Models use randomness in their response generation anyway, so there's a good chance this will give you some results in the case of a minor error. Just make sure you clear the LLM's cache if necessary so that it doesn't always give you the same result for a given input. More advanced approach would be to include the error message and the previous iteration of the pyspark code along with the repeated request. Yest more advanced approach would be to store error logs to disk and use those to generate some sort of repair prompt to be used in case of errors.Most important thing is to remember that if you've been doing any of these for more than five or six iterations and it still isn't working for you, that you're wasting time and should just write the code yourself.",ambidextrousalpaca,2025-08-25 05:18:54,1,dataengineering,t3_1mxxx07,False,

Perhaps different to where you are in the world, although realistically speaking you better be pretty fucking good and experienced if you're going to demand contracting rates which are typically quite high for an engineer. For example, I have a friend who contracts for a big pharma company in a Senior position managing clinical trials. I have looked at day rates for a standard DE role here in the UK. Our rates are not a million miles off each other given the gulf in responsibility and impact.Aside from that, this requires a mindset shift. As somebody who was self taught, I had the same problem of trying to measure myself and going down the very dark hole of asking, ""what jobs am I good enough for?"" which eventually devolved to ""will I ever be good enough?"".The cycle is this - you apply for jobs.

nafg16d,"But what do you want to understand?Kafka Connect is open source, that means you can dig through its code and see how it works. Basically, each connector has a set of identical tasks, each one of which is a virtual thread in JVM. The tasks are distributed through all Kafka connect nodes, so each node has approximately the same number of running threads. Source connector tasks each have Kafka producer inside, while sink connector tasks have consumers. If you understand how simple producers and consumers work, you should easily understand why distributing Kafka Connect is much easier than Kafka itself, since most of the work is done by Kafka itself (storing consumer group offsets for example). The state of Kafka Connect is stored in special topics. Debugging should be the same as with any other JVM application. It's usually possible to run connector or task locally outside of running Connect cluster, and it's even easier so with SMT.

The difference in velocity between a developer who can do these things, and one who can't is immense.**Find the true requirements**Don't trust your managers, PM's, or customers to be able to convey what needs to be done. Communication is the hardest part of the whole job and it's everyone's responsibility to be engaged and active in the conversation. That means you are speaking up, asking questions, understanding the why and how. When appropriate, suggest alternate solutions that make more sense than what comes out of the requirements machine. You'll save yourself a huge headache and a lot of time over massaging semi-correct requirements to be a functional product.**Code isn't always the answer**To a hammer every problem is a nail, and to a programmer every solution is code. But what makes a really great developer is getting out of the IDE every once in a while and getting a birds-eye view on the whole operation. There are mountains of tools available to us that aren't code for solving problems. It's all programming at the end of the day, just with different primitives. But if you can meet a business requirement with a $20 off the shelf solution that already exists... define a process that eliminates your requirement at no cost, or hook up some existing set of systems in such a way that you solve what would otherwise have been a large problem with little to no code that's a big win.Remember, every line of code you write needs to be tested. Kept up to date with changing requirements and compliance demands. Maintained for the lifetime of the product. Code is expensive.**Cut out the distractions**Yeah, I know, you work better while listening to youtube and passively grinding your firemaking cape isn't really that much of an attention suck. You're still getting work done. But... how about just doing those things later because regardless about how you *feel* about your distractions impact, they are slowing you down. Humans aren't particularly good at multi-tasking. And while you might be moving forward, you won't know what things you wouldn't have missed without the distraction. I listen to music without lyrics while I code, that's my personal compromise. Over the long term of many years examining myself it's evident that I'll be less productive with anything more engaging than that in front of me.**Collaborate**I wish I saw more of this. Especially in a world where many of us are working remotely, or in isolated cubical/office spaces. All of the things I've described above are easier to do when you don't do them alone. Get a teammate who's on the same page as you in terms of increasing velocity by taking your work seriously and then do it together. Sit side by side and engage in coding 'sprints' where you push for continuous progress for 20 minute periods at a time. Then rest, then repeat. Have pair programming blocks, where you work together on the same problem for an hour. Give space for 'state of the code' discussions where you just talk about what engineering problems you're encountering, and what choices or projects might change things to improve the engineering environment.**Take breaks**After so many hours of cranking out solutions, you'll get fatigued and slow. I remember grinding in school, getting stuck and getting frustrated near the deadline for a project. I'd spend 4 hours making meaningful progress, and then 8 just being confused, tired, and frustrated. Only to get 6 hours of sleep, wake up in the morning and look at my project and suddenly it was all clear. Take your breaks. Eat regular meals. Get exercise. Be well.

nbawgez,"Both can be hard if you are unfamiliar with them. Frontends can contain incredibly complex logic, as can backends. In my experience, finding client or server side code hard depends mostly on your familiarity with both the technologies being used, and the codebase. Once you become more familiar, they become less hard, whether frontend or backend. The complexity of backends can relate largerly to the distribution of services and their interaction with one another. This requires the ability to store a large, and complex mental model, which can be difficult. Frontends can contain complex physics based animations, or complex state interactions, which also involve having a clear mental model. Either one requires familiarity with the concepts and the codebase. If you are finding backend code harder to understanding, you'll get there. You just need to spend time reading the code, reading the docs, and learning about the technologies, and things will become clearer.

naqvypi,"I'm sorry about the negative comments you've received. People can be incredibly selfish sometimes. I've also been learning C and intend to learn C++ after. C has a variety of uses, one of which is that a few of the textbooks I'm interested in working through use C. Another important reason for learning C is that it forces a programmer to think more ""lower level"" than other programming languages, and learning how a program interacts with an operating system to use hardware is a useful thing for programmers to learn. Not essential, I believe, but useful. I intend to learn C++ after, because I like that C++ is object oriented, and I'm also interested in competitive programming.As far as you 80/20 rule, I think the way you described it sounds fishy.

With that being said, I've heard people claim something along the lines of 80 percent of the total work done by a system is done by 20 percent of that system. But the validity and applicability of a particular philosophy is not the point of this post. I think a good, small(ish) collection of problems for either C or C++ can be found in the first chapter of Kernighan and Ritchie's book The C Programming Language. The first chapter is a whirlwind tour of C, and there are about 25 exercises in it that covers enough of the language that the authors claim, and I'm paraphrasing, to get a programmer up and running in C.

nbc09e9,"It looks like most answers here are talking about programming-specific reasons, but here are examples where even non-programmers, and you too, 'naturally' start with zero:When someone is born, they are 0 years old. Their ""first"" year of life all takes place while they are '0' years old. Interestingly, there are some cultures that start *this* indexing from 1, e.g. in traditional chinese age counting, a baby is 1 when they are born. Even then though, you can generalize this to other time periods. A person's first 'decade' of life all takes place while they are 0 decades old. This is the same reason why we are living in the ""21st"" century even though the year begins with ""20"" and not ""21"". (Although note there's some annoying aspects of the definition of this type of 'century').In many buildings throughout the world, the ""1"" floor of the building is the one above the ground floor. More rarely, although I've seen it, the ground floor may even be labelled the '0' floor. I suspect this probably has other reasoning behind it, but it's at least tangentially related. Here's some simple reasoning for why counting floors like this works and might even help you to see what's ""nice"" about zero indexing in the first place. The ground floor is ""0"" floors above the ground. The second floor (labelled 1) is 1 floor above the ground. And so on, the nth floor is labelled n-1 and it is n-1 floors above the ground.(Side note: This ""number of floors offset from the ground"" idea is how arrays are implemented in C and many other programming languages. The first element has offset 0 to the 'start' of the array, the second has offset 1, and so on. So the reasoning and math lines up exactly with this floor offset stuff).Here is some mathematical reasoning for why such indexing is nice. Let's say you have 100 people and you want to split them into groups of 10 each. You could label them 1 to 100 and then split up the groups so that people labelled 1 through 10 are in the first group, 11 through 20 in the second, and so on. However, there is a nice property that you are *almost* able to exploit here... What if everyone in the first group has a ""0"" as their tens digit, everyone in the second has a ""1"" in their tens digit, and so on? We can't do this because the first group has the person labelled 10, the second has the person labelled 20, and so on. You *could* get this nice labelling if you instead labelled everyone from 0 to 99, so the first group is people labelled 0 through 9, second is 10 through 19, and so on.It might seem like the example above is contrived (and it does work 'extra nicely' cuz I chose 100 and we use a base 10 numbering system), but you can generalize it as follows. Say you have n people (and n is divisible by p) and you want to split them into p groups. Say that n = p \* q, so that each group has q people in it. Then, if you label these people from 0 to n-1, you could ask each person labelled i to find the result of i / q (truncated), and that gives them the ""group index"" they are in. So group 0 would be for people that are labelled 0 through q-1, group 1 would be for people labelled q through 2\*q -1, and so on. We wouldn't get this nice scheme if we labelled our people from 1 to n (in fact, we would then have use the equation (i-1) / q, which is effectively re-labelling our people with zero indexing!) Another interesting thing to note here is that not only does this setup work nicely with zero indexing, but it also naturally *results* in a zero-indexed group numbering system.The above example is related to why, when working in modular arithmetic, let's say the integers mod N, the 'canonical' form of the elements is usually considered to be from 0 through N-1. When you start to learn more algorithms, you'll see that many algorithms will work nicer or the algebra may be neater if we use zero indexing. (Note that there definitely are algorithms which work nicer with 1-indexing too, so this is more anecdotal than anything, but I think it'll still give you a feeling for why zero indexing is nice). The last example also relates to why using half open intervals i.e. \[0, N), is such a common paradigm in programming (for example, a python range includes the 'start' but excludes the 'stop'). The 'niceness' of using half-open intervals (which may also seem strange at first) is somewhat related to the 'niceness' of using zero indexing.I'm sure there's more such examples, but hopefully this answers your question in a more broad sense, and you see that 'indexing by zero' is not just limited to programming, and, perhaps unintuitively, feels more 'natural' when you think about it.",Phoenixon777,2025-08-29 15:34:51,12,learnprogramming,t3_1n36naw,False,

I also suspect this is related to the limitations of early systems. Way back, programmers were trying to make use of every bit they could because so little memory was available. This is the reason for two year dates and the Y2K problem. Back at the time, programmers thought ""Hey, that's two whole bytes I could use somewhere else that could actually be useful.""

If that's the case, I'm not sure if this experience is the same, but for us in the States, using office hours of professors, TAs, and the like is something that should be emphasized as important, but most people don't.That is, in grade school, there's really no concept of office hours from teachers. You have class time, homework, and that's pretty much it. If you have questions, you ask in class.Universities are different. Professors and TAs offer office hours, and you really, really should take advantage of them. Do the homework, go discuss it in office hours to just see what they say. Most of the time, the person having office hours will be completely alone and you won't be interrupting anyone else's time, because *no one seems to do this*. I took a graduate level Computability and Complexity class in my senior year. Another student and I learned the professor liked latte's. We'd buy him one and go to every single office hour he offered. We'd talk to him about the class, get extra help and insight into the material, and it was absolutely critical. Without that I would've failed the class, but I ended up getting an A.Anyway, that's just general college advice. For CS specifically, I'd say find the things you're interested in, whatever you're passionate about, and pursue those in classes if they're offered, and if not, find professors who can point you in the right direction (again, office hours!) to help you pursue them as side projects. I wouldn't worry about trying to learn as many languages as you can. Pick like two or three and learn them really well. Something systems level like C/C++/Rust, something very high level like Python, and something like Java/Go/C#/some other garbage collected but very productive language.

naksnb1,"You get to think briefly that everything should be *rewritten* in it, and that you have the ability to do that. Then reality smacks you over the head... (I joke, I like Rust overall).Once you get into writing things the Rust way (TM?) you get to worry less (but not forget about completely) memory bugs that can cause crashes or be exploited. The benefits are many and varied. Rust also has a nice type system if you're into that, and nice language-level support for tagged/discriminated unions, and matching. If you're into function style/idioms, you'll feel at home, but if you're used to OOP there's plenty to recognise too, e.g. struct/impl/traits. I've often said my ideal general purpose HLL would be a cross between C and Rust (yes, I know about Zig and Odin), because I like both but find Rust annoying to write (especially when code involves lots of explicit lifetime annotation) and visually quite information-dense (IMO).I much prefer C, me/my teams rarely have most of the issues that the Rust compiler guards against, but nobody who likes Rust believes you when you say that :) I like to configure debug and release builds from the get go, and use the sanitisers (address etc.) in debug always. I have a big list of flags I use for compilation config built up over the years. LSPs and a parser (e.g. treesitter) catch some typos (e.g. . instead of -> or missing a \*/& etc.) too.Rust has no bearing on your Azure cert AFAIK, and to be honest it hasn't seen massive uptake commercially (yet?). I know lots of businesses (previous employers or places friends work) that are still using C and/or C++ with no interest even in committing to writing new software in Rust, let alone rewriting anything existing, anecdotally. I say this to say that the Rust job market isn't what it is for other languages (e.g. your C#, Java, others like JS and Python) which are seeing lots of use in recent years.There are also better languages if you want to learn how to manage memory freely, as Rust enforces it's particular model.TLDR; Learn Rust because you want to.

nbaqkho,"Ok. I work for a consultancy— why am I saying that? Because every advice I give would work better if taken seriously. So here I go: It’s not your fault in feeling lost. Programming has certainly become a frontier extremely difficult to navigate these days— especially with the advent of AI. The only sure way to learn programming— and take my advice —is to try out open-source programs. When I mean trying out, I don’t mean only to use it, but also to download the source code and compile it yourself. Study the code in a Sensible manner, and augment it, or see how far can possibly augment the code without breaking. Documentation Is very important, but let me tell you an Industrial-secret: \[nobody, not even the guys who created Assembly-language itself know entirely what they are doing— nobody has the perfect idea atleast\]. What does this mean? Trial and Error. And only by using this method, can you fully accomplish learning Industrial methods of engineering software. You may have noticed a sinister pattern. There is a broad Inequality in the spectrum of projects covered in courses and tutorials offered on the internet. Even then, they are often too basic and fall behind industrial specifications. Even then, open-source softwares lag somewhat in certain areas, compared to the truly Industrial softwares produced by og Software-devs at the beginning of the Digital Age. This is because— and undeniably so — the best software is hidden behind a pay-wall, and rightly so. So, while dabbling with open-source is an excellent way of updating your learning, it also isn’t enough. But I wouldn’t recommend the ‘Grass-roots’ approach to programing— it’s just impossible. You need vast amount of people-hours to construct even most basic programs. Libraries develop, sure. But they are often by-products of designs intended for specific projects. This, in the end adds up to the inefficiency of the entire system. That is why, companies at-times resort to constructing their projects from as further back as possible— ie. CPU architectures. This is perhaps the best way to increase efficiency. What does this mean for you? It means, that using Libraries aren’t as good as making libraries. To sum up everything I said in a way beneficial to you: begin by using and testing open-source software; don’t become Frustrated knowing that you can’t make a software like ‘TempleOS’. Making an excellent and efficient software is as difficult as building the pyramids. You need large man-hours. Speaking of TempleOS. I am sure even Terry, the creator of TempleOS, understands how he was limited by the hardware— which was obviously impossible even for him. I say that, because people pretend as if it is the most efficient software ever written— it isn’t.",RudimentaryBass6853,2025-08-29 11:31:22,2,learnprogramming,t1_nbalv0s,False,

Here's my suggestions for what's been helping me.First start your own open source project. Work on a project you want to build, but look up the work flow and follow a basic structure large repos might use and make a CONTRIBUTING file based on some real ones from other projects. You can use it to learn forking, how do write an issue, how to write a PR, how to merge commits. When you're doing it make sure you write everything like you're writing it for someone else and tag any really easy things with good first issue. These will often get picked up by others. Then you'll get a chance to see the basics of what maintainers are looking for in other people's code, and you'll get experience with light collaboration with others. After doing this for a while you'll feel way more confident in how to contribute. Then you just have to find issues that are within your scope. That's easier said than done, but I'd look for medium sized projects that aren't as well know.

nba11xt,"This sounds like an AI prompt, but whatever.First of all, I think there is a hidden contradiction in your question:>In your opinion, what would be the best programming language for someone to start learning as early as possible, and why?>“What matters more for a beginner: ease of entry, or long-term benefit?”In the first question you asked what ""someone"" should do. In the second one you ask what a ""beginner"" should do. The term beginner suggests to me a person who is learning to play the piano. Learning programming is nothing like this. It is more like learning calculus. If you are trying to learn programming this way, I cannot advise you, because I don't believe you will succeed no matter which language you learn. So let's assume you are not a beginner.If you are a scholar, I recommend that you learn LISP. Every language that is considered a ""scripting"" language owes everything in its feature set to LISP. If you complete all of the exercises in ANSI Common LISP by Paul Graham, you will understand most programming languages better than 90% of all programmers. It is kind of like learning Latin. After this, every language will be easy.If you are an engineer, I recommend that you learn C. Every language that is considered a ""scripting"" language (and even most that are not) directly or indirectly calls the C standard library, and thus C. In fact, C has practically a one-to-one correspondence with assembly language, which means if you learn C, you can learn assembly and understand computer hardware quite easily. By extension, you will understand everything running on your system, even if you don't know all of the details of that particular language.If you are neither an engineer nor a scholar, I recommend that you learn Python. It is the simplest, most logical, most approachable, and one of the most popular languages. Anything that is worth doing can be done in Python, and if you cannot learn Python, you cannot learn to program in any language. However, if this is what appeals to you, I think you will be better off in another field, like data science.If you are only interested in computer science for the money, I recommend that you learn Java. You will have no trouble finding work, and you will never truly understand anything about programming or computers.

The idea I'm getting at is that knowledge of the concepts I learned in Java are helping me now, even though I never use Java. Now change the scenario and let's say I built projects with Java, but had to switch to C or C++. Then I'd be blindsided with memory management and pointers which take a long time to master, and time isn't on your side with so many bills to pay.Languages like Ocaml or Haskell are difficult to learn and I don't see many jobs for them.

This allows you to create an index on a *tokenized* field, so that searches can efficiently find only the rows containing those tokens. You can customize the tokenizer to do things like approximate searches, where the tokens are partial words instead of complete words. All of this is relatively straightforward in Postgres, but I'm not sure whether/how Prisma exposes it.If you need even larger scale, and you don't want your database to become a bottleneck for searching, then you'll want to use a search engine that's separate from your DB, such as Elasticsearch or Solr.

We were still coming out of the Great Recession and I had no idea what was going to happen. I only managed to land a job because I played World of Warcraft with someone who lived in the same city and he offered to refer me.It was a back office position, mostly trade support and compliance. Not riveting or lucrative stuff. At this point, I probably had two things going for me: I'd been working with computers in some capacity since I was 5, and I had recently done an internship where I was exposed to VBA and general scripting.After about 6 months on the job, I started playing around with VBA to automate parts of my daily tasks away. My manager was very supportive and so were my IT folks. After that, I snowballed because as I wrote scripts to automate my work away, I had more time to experiment. As I experimented, I collaborated with other teams to automate parts of their work.After a year, I got poached by a hedge fund. I learned a few more things, but it was a bad environment for me and I got fired inside of 3 months. Luckily, I had built my VBA skills enough that I got contracted to work on a year-long project at a large financial institution.After that project, I joined a consulting firm where I used my VBA knowledge to make Excel and PowerPoint do some incredibly complex things. After two years, I realized I needed more; I didn't want to stay in this niche and I saw the writing on the wall that this might all go away in the medium term. A friend from college I kept in touch with referred me to his company.That was my first opportunity in a tech company. But I wasn't a software engineer, more of a ""solutions"" engineer. But I applied everything I learned into this new role. Except instead of VBA and Excel, it was Python scripts, PHP, SQL, and a bit of Bash. I also made sure to understand the ins and outs of our entire tech stack.Two more years, I made my way into FAANG and haven't looked back since (I'm no longer in FAANG, but I'm still in tech, making more money than I ever thought I would).A few takeaways would be that networking is important, but it can take on many forms that are conducive to introverts (I'm one myself). How many people can say they got jobs through World of Warcraft? Another thing is, everyone runs their own race.

nakv9uy,"How much time did you spend learning the language.This is my approach to learning programming (academic) assuming you aren't really young (under 15).* Find a online course based on a real CS course (CS50x or MOOC Java or MOOC Python)* Do the course for about 6 months to maybe a year, making sure you do programming exercises* Learn some DSA* Then, start thinking about projects.Why this approach? I believe you need to know how a program runs before you start coding. Also, I believe beginners don't know how to pick an appropriate size project, and that if they start projects right away, they fail to learn the basics, in particular, control flow. That is, imagine you're a debugger (a program that lets you go step by step through a program). Could you do that without using a computer, that is, if I gave you a simple program, can you determine what it does?**Alternate approach**Many others find the standard method I've described boring and therefore hard to motivate themselves. So, they do the following* Pick a project* Google a lot to find enough relevant information to code it* Learn enough about coding while doing the projectWhat they like about this approach is they are building something which is something they *enjoy*. Does everyone enjoy this? No, they don't. But for those that do, this kind of thing is super rewarding.However, there are problems with this approach. The first is it works for only a small number of people. They're able to find answers to what they're looking for. They are able to learn enough about programming to accomplish the task.To me, this is the equivalent of going to a foreign country and trying to pick up the language on the fly. You read a few common phrases, and trust the people know enough English and can decipher your accent enough that you get by. Some find that approach better than an academic approach where you learn how to conjugate verbs and learn grammatical structure.When someone opts to do projects, they want to find something interesting and cool, but even the most boring programs you can think of (Hangman, Tic-tac-toe) are quite difficult for most beginners, and they want to write 3D first person shooters or have some AI or do some image or video processing.

na8ry5n,"ARM has a lot of documentation both in PDF and HTML form for AArch64, however modern architectures are completely different beasts compared to the 8086. For example on ARMv8 and above there are 4 privilege levels, which they call Exception Levels, with EL0 being the unprivileged level under which regular user applications execute, EL1 being intended for kernel supervisors, EL2 being intended for virtual machine hypervisors, and EL3 being intended for firmware security monitors.On macOS you only have access up to EL2, and that requires using either the Hypervisor or Virtualization frameworks to create a virtualization environment (the Virtualization framework is a very high level virtual machine implementation on top of the Hypervisor framework), but you can run unrestricted EL3 code on all AArch64 Raspberry Pi models, so if you're interested in privileged bare-metal development, the Raspberry Pi is likely your best option. On the other hand, M4 Macs are already on ARMv9, which is pretty similar to ARMv8 as far as unprivileged code is concerned but significantly different for privileged code as many system registers were added, changed, and removed since ARMv8, plus the M4 in particular also has 512-bit Scalable Matrix Extension support, so depending on what you want to do, that may or may not be appealing to you.General purpose AArch32 and AArch64 HTML documentation:* [ARMv6M, ARMv7, and ARMv8 assembly reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0801/latest/);* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 instruction set architecture](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/latest/)* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 system registers](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0601/latest/)Documentation specific to the SoCs used by the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 and their derivatives:* [Cortex A72 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100095/latest/)* [Cortex A76 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100798/latest/);* [ Generic Interrupt Controller core reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0471/latest/);* [Generic Interrupt Controller v2 specific reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0048/latest/);* [PrimeCell 0111 UART](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0183/latest/);* [BCM2711 datasheet (Pi 4)](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/bcm2711/bcm2711-peripherals.pdf).Other resources:* [Bare-metal section of the Raspberry Pi forums (I help there sometimes under the same name as my reddit account)](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewforum.php?f=72&sid=de4c2c97b2b1372281ef64d6aed3dc5f);* [Tutorial that got my feet wet on AArch64 (I already had experience with AArch32 from decades ago)](https://www.rpi4os.com/);* [Rust HDMI audio driver that I made for the Pi 4 and 5](https://github.com/CodexTextor/rpi-hdmi) (will not work on the BCM2712 D0 stepping SoC used on models of the Pi 5 introduced after I wrote that code because the physical addresses of the hardware are different).Note that there's no public official documentation for the BCM2712 SoCs of the Raspberry Pi 5, so all my code targeting that platform is based on my own reverse-engineering research effort that included reading the official Linux driver code from Broadcom, messing around with hardware registers on Linux to figure out how they work with a proper driver, and deriving knowledge from my experience with and available documentation for the BCM2711 SoC of the Pi 4, since there was very little community work done on this front when I got my first Pi 5.

nb6dbi6,"Disclaimer: im still in uni for CS, but after interviewing and reading up on what web dev vs web design is like in industry, I have a few pointers I want to share.At least in the realm of web dev and web design, some of the tools you would need for design would be Figma (building UI/UX designs), and other programs, but you wouldn't be programming much. But, im not all too familiar with design compared to web dev. If you are trying to design AND build them, learn CSS very well, classic styling tool.As for web dev, you should get yourself familiar with the different components, such as frontend (what users see on the webpage), backend (logic for website components), and database (storing data related to website). Also look into different frameworks, which are just groupings of tools and languages for building. Some popular frameworks include react/node, laravel (php based), and spring boot is gaining attention recently i think. With web dev, you also pay attention to different layers such as optimization, memory consumption, so if you're into optimizing processes, this could be a good path for you too.Personally, I like web dev over web design, although it's nice to know a bit of both. For instance, if you're doing freelance work as a web dev, it's important to know ui/ux design to make your websites look sharp and user-friendly. You should pick which path you want to take based on where you find satisfaction. For me, I absolutely love building something and seeing the hard work I've poured into a project after it's done.Best of luck, and everything will be okay no matter what you choose!",lonely-silhouette,2025-08-28 18:18:53,2,learnprogramming,t3_1n2icij,False,

nb6kaxc,"Oo that's a little tricky lol, I'm very familiar with web dev, but I do know some things behind software too. I think you can group languages into certain categories. For instance, processing optimization would be c++, rust, go. Memory allocation/optimization would be c or c#. If you're trying to program AI or ML integration or data analysis, look into python. Python is easiest to learn in my opinion, but it is not as fast as c++.But then again, im not an expert, so I would strongly urge you to do your own research so that you can figure out what you think is best. I personally like C++ most and it was the lang I was taught at the beginning, but it really depends on what you want to do!Also, just a quick tip that with being a good programmer, on top of having a language you know in depth, its crucial that you know how to adapt to new languages quickly. But don't worry, focus on one language for now, and understand the fundamentals of programming like data structures, algorithms, etc., and programming will become a lot easier.Let me know if you want to know anything more :)",lonely-silhouette,2025-08-28 18:52:45,3,learnprogramming,t1_nb6gyzs,False,

I would probably get a book, but only for very fundamental stuff like c++, javascript, or Java, although this is just a recommendation.Also, projects, projects, projects!! Practicing code in any way that is challenging yourself is probably one of the best ways to expand your skillset. Choose a simple project to work on that you have an interest for or would help you out in your own life. Just a fair warning that if you choose to use AI, try not to use it all the time, and use it wisely. I used to use chatgpt, copilot a lot when I first started out, and it's a trap, and it doesn't help you learn despite how fast you get things done. Really nail these concepts in by turning off copilot and learn how to read documentation too.Lastly, don't be afraid to fail. Failure is one of the best ways to learn. Don't be too concerned with what are the best practices for something at the very beginning.

If so then this is a great little project. Let me set some expectations for you though.There are different degrees of solving this because all websites are constructed differently. For simple websites this will be a good challenge for an introductory developer like yourself. As websites get more and more complex, and have multiple components and internal frames that get loaded, or use dynamic loading, this becomes more and more of a challenge. You could come back and revisit this problem for years to come as your skills grow. Some websites are almost designed to make what you are doing here next to impossible. So bottom line don't be surprised if what you build doesn't work for all sites at first, but it still will be a good exercise for your time, and possibly will make for an actual useful tool regardless. I'd recommend targeting Wikipedia at first as I believe its pages are constructed fairly simply.For a much more complex example, try extracting your receipts from Kroger or Costco.

Do this multiple times a day, since postings get updated all the time. Don't even bother with anything over 100 applicants. 0-10 is the sweet spot. 2. If you really see a position you like, tailor your resume to fit it. Use keywords directly from the job description and remove things that aren't relevant. I kept separate resumes emphasizing separate skill sets I have (e.g. a resume for AI skills and experience, a resume for web dev skills and experience, etc.). I found it worked much better than having a single resume with a combination of different skillsets. 3. Mention things you did the past directly, and use numbers to support them (e.g. ""Delivered a system that reduced customer errors by 50%""). One of the big things you want your resume to emphasize isn't just that you have experience in coding/data science/whatever, but how your experience was able to make an impact and deliver value. Don't be afraid to stretch out your experience to make that point, just be able to actually talk about what you did and how it delivered value.4.

A lot of those listings aren’t even real, and many of the “applications” are just auto-apply clicks. That’s basically spam, and these platforms aren’t great at filtering it. Even when a post is legit, most applicants aren’t actually qualified for that specific role. I’m not saying the job market is healthy; it’s tough. I’m saying a lot of candidates are taking the wrong steps.Instead of relying on LinkedIn or Indeed, follow sites that pull openings directly from company career pages and look for roles that truly match your skills. Create a resume and cover letter tailored to each posting. Optimize for ATS and naturally include the right keywords from the job description, both the job title and the required skills, then apply.If you’re focused on remote roles around the world, check out a creative method in this Reddit post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).Mass-applying to thousands of jobs is just noise.

You made a game and open sourced it, that takes skill.If you make a plan and present that to your parents, they will see it’s not your lack of initiative, it’s the fact that the rug (tech job market) has been pulled out so quickly from beneath you and there’s little to no support systems in place.Also +1 to stop searching for remote gigs.

Sure, few interviews let me *literally* Google (some have, I just have to let them know I'm doing it), but every other interview has always made it very clear that I'm welcome and encouraged to ask syntax questions to the interviewer.No interviewer I've worked with has ever been caught up on if I remember `.length` vs `.length()` (which I still get caught up on because of my heavy Java experience and my kinda recent transition to Node/Typescript). Nobody cares if I've memorized any of the syntax of the language I'm programming in. They care that I can program. That's why they're willing to answer syntax questions, which I've asked many times, and gotten offers from.I also don't recall a company that *forced* me to use a specific language. Hell, back in the pre-covid days we all whiteboarded in pseudocode anyways. But since I've been doing remote interviews, companies have always made it clear I was allowed to program in the language I was most comfortable in.

I had to ask *a lot* of syntax questions, needed some nudging, some hand holding, and I didn't even finish the whole interview before time ran out.And yet, they gave me an offer. My resume made it very clear I'm mostly a BE developer, I made that very clear in the HR interview, I made that very clear in the HM interview. They knew what to expect, they just asked the FE questions as a formality. It may very well be the case that you're not doing as well as you think you are in the Java interview.

Create a very simple bank account and a way to do a transaction between 2 accounts. Then make it work in a multithreaded environment.3rd round - still live coding but very pseudo-code stuff. Write very simple load balancer (no network stuff, just simple code no real integration), make it random, make it round Robin. Then few stuff about SQL, what is pessimistic locking, what is optimistic locking and how does it work, write SQL for it, show me how to use it. What is a transaction, a dead lock, etc..4th round - system design.. model a system that solves this simple X real problem found in our domain. Just a chat basically.1st round quickly filters out people who don't have basic knowledge2nd round verifies skills in OOP, TDD, multithreading (locks, dead lock, race conditions).3rd round again verifies skills in OOP (bit redundant tbh), but then goes into the DB and verifies that you actually know what is going on under the framework4th round verifies that you know more high-level architecture stuff.. message queues, redundancy, gateway/api/reverse-proxy, sharding... and that you can think bigger than just a few classes.I think these 4 rounds could be compressed in just 3 and be just as effective.

For smaller companies, UX oftentimes falls on frontend developers and/or product owners. Agile practices help inform frontend devs what works best by having a tight iteration process with customers. Though I’ve never seen that practically work out well. The best is to have dedicated UX people, who work with product, customers, and engineers to come up with a solution.

I can catch most production issues that actually matter and I care about with about 10% of the effort that completing a full review takes. many changes have no possibility of side effects significant enough for me to care, and theres enough test infrastructure in place for some components I just dont worry about it.architecturally we do database schemas review up front in a separate pass. i review every single one of those proposed changes. bad schema design is the bane of most of the annoying production issues I deal with. reviewing just an ER diagram also doesnt take that much time, and a lot of changes do not require database changes. I oversee 10 devs so if you're responsible for more than that YMMV.with this i often can get 4 decent hours of focused work a day, getting most reviews done early in the day and then near eod.

naudi6x,"I'll stick to answering your questions. PIPs are not a legal requirement. But they can be used as protection by the company to demonstrate that there were performance issues with the employee. The goal being to convince others that the company didn't wrongfully terminate for illegal reasons. In case the terminated employee decides to pursue legal action against the company.By placing someone on a PIP they create a paper trail (no matter how flimsy it is) that the person wasn't performing their job well. I suspect it's also to cause doubt in the employee's mind about the likelyhood of prevailing in court. By having a formalized process where they told you, that you weren't performing maybe that can convince you to just accept it and quietly go away.As for your second question there's only a few paths. One, do whatever they ask to get off the PIP if possible. Though to be honest it sounds like you wouldn't be happy in your current role (QA Automation/ not dev and poorly maintained code base). Two, resign. Three collect pay checks while looking for the next job until they fire you. Option three will yield unemployment.Each one has tradeoffs. E.g. if you get fired while on the PIP you probably won't want to use your boss at the job as a reference. If you have a long employment history and can use someone else as a reference that may not be a problem.I can't comment on disability so I'll leave that to someone else to comment on.I'm sorry you are going through this.

nbbdili,"I’ll try my best but in general the definition is fuzzy. When I interview with a senior engineer I tend to look for:1. Experience. Not in terms of years but in terms of lessons learned. I tend ask what project stays with them and what lessons they learned. How does it inform how they review designs and code. I’m mostly looking for people who have learned from their failures and can debug their code and designs and do the same for others. Do they have a story where they may have changed their mind after new information was gained or is it a constant stream of “my way or the highway.” This also means as a senior they do have a bit of a network and will have stories of how they talk to and manage people.2. Technical communication. As a senior, I expect them to be able to communicate not just for themselves but for the team and to be an advocate for reasonable designs while keeping the schedule in mind. I need them to tell me why things will take x days, not just that things will take x days. I want to know why they came to a specific decision and what other decisions did they consider. For people who have had a ton of experience doing this they will have a good signal to noise ratio.3. Team advocacy. Ultimately trust-worthiness and energizing a team are part of being a leader. Are they going to be a net gain of energy across the team under tight deadlines or are they going to be toxic? It’s hard to determine this within an interview, but as you work with them it gets easier to see. If they are motivated to work as an engineer usually that passion will come out in an interview and is actually hard to fake across multiple interviews. How do they interact with their maybe peers in the team/peer interview?4. It’s really corny but leadership. What I mean by this is that senior engineers shouldn’t argue from a stance of authority. Authority is given to someone because of who they are not because of the title they wield. How do they make their case? Is it with evidence and data or because they fall back on “experience?” This falls into the communication pillar too. If you have the experience you can tell stories and don’t need to say “because I’m senior.”5. Understanding of the scientific method. What I mean by this is I see engineering as the practice of making the same behavior repeatable. This means similar to science everything is a hypothesis to be continuously tested. SLIs, KPIs, etc need to ensure that we continue to be good. A senior engineer advocating for manual testing is fine as long as they have a plan for how we maintain that process and why we need to. Do they question our accepted reality or do they accept it without thought?6. Hard skills are a given and they should be fairly proficient in at least one language. This means they should be able to tell me how the language works and what it’s good for and not good for. They should have tried and tested ways to debug problems in said language and have a reasonably good understanding of how the language runs on a computer. Ie if I get a resume where the guy tells me he is a C++ expert of 10 years I expect him to be able to explain things like how vector or shared_ptr work or how exceptions work and how memory works for C++. They should have stories of how their language of choice is annoying or incomprehensible at times because with enough projects and lines of code all projects become annoying to manage in some way.",Antsolog,2025-08-29 13:46:15,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1n17b5u,False,

nb5tbs6,"Context: Currently a mid level SDE working in big tech inCanada, have been for my entire career (6 years).First, idk if UBC is definitively 2nd in Canada lol but its definitely one of the universities competing for 2nd with McGill and UofT. I can't speak much for ML, but I work in a team with over 50% of the engineers being MLEs. Most of them have PhDs, and the ones with a masters came from a top Ivy then straight into FAANG. No opinion on the matter, just providing some perspective. My team is also not Canadian, so unsure how different that is in Canada. There are benefits of staying in Canada. Not being an immigrant on a work visa is eliminating a source of mental strain. Canada is generally speaking more politically stable, and I find the Canadian cities I've lived in (I've lived for extended periods in the top 4 cities) to be much more chill than any cities i've been to in America. There is definitely a cultural shift. Safety is another one, if you compare a city the size of Toronto to any similar sized cities in America, it looks insanely safe. Violent crime rate is almost incomparable. We also have better labour laws, and great unemployment. If I get laid off here, I am entitled to like 45 weeks of unemployment pay of like 700 a week or something like that. All in all, personally as a Canadian I just cannot bring myself to want to grow roots in a tech hub in America like SF or Seattle due to the cultural and safety concerns. It might be irrational, but I genuinely like being in Canada, so I am willing to tank the downsides of it. Downside is obviously the pay. I worked in an Amazon subsidiary for multiple years and my American colleagues of the same level were being paid almost double what I make after you convert USD to CAD. That being said, that is not a good way to measure pay as our COL is high, but not as high as some would think. We also obviously have less companies to choose from, and the middle tier companies pay significantly less than the top tier ones, so you are going to need to bust your head and rely on luck to get into the top tier companies. That being said, its completely reasonable to get a good career and life working in tech in Canada. I have worked completely remotely for my entire career, going from a known Canadian tech company, to Amazon, then to a big tech company offering more pay. I was able to relocate to a MCOL city due to the remote job and I'm almost mortgage free before turning 29.

Get an internship and do a good job. Not only does this gain you real world experience that can go on your resume, but you pretty much get a 4-8 month interview where you can prove to the company that you would be useful as a permanent employee and hopefully you have a job when or before you grad. **Finding a job is a numbers game**. Apply everywhere, you won't hear back from 90% of companies, it's just how it goes. Just apply everywhere and familiarize yourself with the hiring process, it will help in the long run even if you don't get the job.**Take what you can get.** It's mostly only difficult to find a Junior position right now so don't be picky when you start your career. Work somewhere for 2-3 years then search for the job you always wanted. Right now you aren't *that* valuable to a company (no offense).

Everyone I graduated with ended up fine. This includes people who did stuff like polisci.Recessions and slow job markets come and go, the entry level job market sucks right now everywhere and its not good in any field.The last thing is I would have a healthy degree of skepticism towards what people say in tech about their own job market. The field is very prone to coming up with stories and drinking their own koolaid. You will read everywhere about AI, but reality is you have several compounding factors that makes the job market suck right now. This includes high interest rates, which effects tech more than other industries as that means there is less startup money and financign out there, over hiring during the pandemic, general economic uncertainty due to tariffs and current immigration system in the u.s.

What happens a lot is people name drop something somewhere that sounds like it might fit at a glance, but doesn't quite make sense in conjunction w/ everything else they added around it, I ask them a question about it, and they admit not knowing much about it, or worse they wing it, poking more and more holes into the design as they go.For example, we might be talking about performance, and then they add redis somewhere in the diagram, but it's in a suboptimal place, or they didn't think about cache invalidation or whatever, and then they start adding bandaid arrows and it just goes downhill from there.Another thing that a lot of candidates are surprisingly bad at is schema normalization, and that comes up quite a bit because data modeling is a sort of a ""checkbox"" topic.",lhorie,2025-08-27 04:18:42,2,cscareerquestions,t1_navudrk,False,
