nnfkk05,"I don't think data quality is purely owned by product managers any more than security, availability, and scalability are.The biggest issues in my opinion are: * Data & software engineers and product managers have little understanding of the impacts and contributing factors to data quality issues. * Data engineers build systems in which they copy the encapsulated schemas from source systems into their warehouse to then transform them. Well, yeah, that's a solution that is pretty much guaranteed to cause a ton of DQ problems. As opposed to having the source system publish domain objects that are locked down with data contracts. * Data engineers build almost no quality-control tests, no unit testing, no reconciliation checks, no anomaly-detection, and no field transform audits to track changes over time. dbt and great expectations are generally poor tooling that only address a fraction of this. * Product managers, given zero push from engineering, leave out all considerations of data quality - no SLOs, no dashboards, no investment. Which means it falls 100% on the engineer's heads.It doesn't have to be that way.

The way they do so is perfect for them.Marketing want a single customer view. Neither line of business collect the data in a form that allows comparison. You now have a data quality problem.The only way I have found to improve the data quality is to fix it at source. You do this by making the down stream data vital to the earnings of both lines of business. Customers get pissed off because, as far as they are concerned they are buying from company X. They couldn't give 2 hoots for the fact they bought product line A which is different from product line B.

One large org I used to work for had biweekly calls with representatives from each of our source systems and the warehouse team for that purpose.

BI for short.Data engineering can be, and often should be, a part of doing BI, but doesn't strictly have to be (depending a bit how you define DE, which is a different controversial topic). And DE is also applicable to situations that aren't BI. And BI is more than just DE, as you've observed - choosing how to model the data uniformly, for example, isn't really DE (IMO), although many data engineers also know a lot about data modelling.A platform that does all this stuff is traditionally called a data warehouse - and these days, that can encompass things that aren't strictly a data warehouse in a micro sense, but could still be described as a data warehouse in a macro sense. (Very little terminology in this area has really super-precise definitions that everyone agrees on.)Normalisation is actually not necessarily the way to go at all, for data you want to use for analytic purposes (""making sense of data""). _De_normalisation is often more appropriate. This is a huge discussion area within data modelling: a great place to start IMO is the book ""The Data Warehouse Toolkit"" by Kimball and Ross. Get the 3rd edition. This is not just a random book rec, it's a really foundational text in this field, covering ""dimensional data modelling"" aka ""star schemas"" Not everyone agrees with it but I don't think anyone should be critiquing it without having read it.In terms of tooling and platforms, you can build your own stack using tools (often open source) that each focus on one smaller thing, doing it well; or there are big enterprise offerings that aim to provide everything you need in one package. Databricks and MS Fabric are two of those that get discussed quite a lot.We settled on MS Fabric for my org (mainly my choice) and it's been a huge success for us.

And it is because most of their business systems are built by software engineers. * Sometimes they mature and separate the marketing/acquisition teams from the product teams and that is usually the death knell for centralizing product and marketing data.* That leads me to marketing data. It is usually the lowest requirement on the totem pole and at the same time it is the most difficult to deal with - it needs the most modeling, it doesn't ever rationalize (compared to accounting data), and its systems and tactics change the fastest. Almost no one ever gets this properly centralized/joined/productionized.* Sales-led companies (particularly the ones that don't have a digital product) revolve around the CRM (as they should, it is the *sales* system in a *sales-led* organization). Parallel efforts to pull data out of the CRM and join with other business systems are competitive for dollars and brainpower of decision makers. It is easier to build out the functionality of the CRM (apps and integrations) than it is to build out the data practice in the org outside the CRM.* In ecommerce of the last 6-7 years there has been trend toward Customer Data Platform, which I see as directly competitive to data warehouse. I have never met a company that said ""we are soooo glad we invested in that CDP"". Most never get fully integrated.

no0tx8t,"I can only speak to my use case so I’ll describe that and why I like using mostly python based libraries. We build lots of econometric models to forecast supply and demand of various products. We ingest various datasets from a variety of public sources and paid vendors. The datasets are not very big for the most part and the ones that are very large we typically only need a subset for any given model run. So we essentially have 2 classes of data pipelines. (1) get external data and bring it internally and (2) our actual model which is technically just a pipeline of tons of transformations on internal data. I'll talk about (2) first. A single model run will load well over 100 internally stored datasets and run various transformations, statistical and matrix operations, overrides and adjustments etc to spit out a final forecast. This is all done in mostly pandas, but some polars and duckdb mixed in. The types and amount of operations we do (thousands of cross dataset interactions between hundreds of raw/intermediate datasets) could not easily be expressed in SQL, and in fact can’t even be easily expressed in polars operations. (See this thread for more info on why: https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/23938). We use frameworks similar to (but not) Apache Hamilton to organize the models into modular units of logic that can easily be swapped in and out and overrided for scenario analysis. These frameworks also provide caching so that we can run our pipelines incrementally and only rerun portions of the pipeline that have been affected by upstream changes (kinda like dbt).For (1) this is much more standard ETL and there’s likely lots of solutions that we could successfully use. But what we’ve landed on is pure python scripts. Pretty much one simple script per data source using mostly requests and whatever database api we storing to (s3, sql server, etc). All these jobs are scheduled in airflow (using only the most barebones airflow functionality. Just a fancy cron for some minor dependency management) which gives us good visibility into operational health just from their standard task views. It’s a super simple set up, with basically no dependencies on large overarching systems or vendors besides Python/airflow. Basically free to operate and easy for anyone with basic Python experience to maintain.

In fact, I usually avoid them: * transform tasks are just sitting on kubernetes, ECS, or lambda, waiting for SQS message that indicates a new file has landed on s3. * These tasks may normally just have 1-10 containers processing data that arrives every few minutes, but can easily auto-scale up, sometimes to 1000-2000 containers like when I decide to reprocess historical data. * They read the small s3 file and process one record at a time - with pretty much vanilla python. The output is typically these days a parquet file.I use vanilla python rather than data frames because it's easier to write tests for the transform functions, easier to collect metrics on how many rows failed any given transform and then write out those stats when the file is complete.Now, is SQL, along with CTEs better than this? Well, if your data is already in the database then it could be faster. And it is easier to learn SQL than how to program - so SQL-based transforms could be built by non-engineers. But it will be more expensive, it won't scale as well, it will be much harder to test, and it can easily become very difficult to read - especially if non-engineers are building it.So, I'd say there a few pros and a lot of cons.",kenfar,2025-11-09 17:34:34,2,dataengineering,t3_1osobde,False,

How do I solve this?Your solution: 'It's engineering problem' is moving problem to somebody else. On top of that their data is in their systems where users enter data. To fix that you need to combine data from different systems and make corrections to data based on one system, that's basic use case for DWH. It isn't always possible to force people to enter correct data to systems or correct it afterwards.I'm currently doing a project where customers has about 100 salespeople and they make mistakes all the time when entering their trades to ERP. It's way too costly to fix their mistakes afterwards to ERP and you cannot train 100 people where rotation is constant to enter only correct info. So there is incorrect data and we fix it in layers above ERP. It isn't always realistic to except perfect data.In OP's case they don't have layers above their different ERP's so to fix data they would need those layers. Which is another project and it's going to cost.To summarize: In perfect world your solution is good. Fix pricing so only some of customers have to pay $75k/month.

nngmmh4,"The cleanest most ""correct"" solution I've seen on GCP is to switch to the KubernetesPodOperator. The gist is that every single task in your DAG runs in its own isolated Pod in GKE. This is where the magic happens: you can apply labels to these pods: dag\_id, task\_id, and most importantly, customer\_id. Then you just go into GCP's native billing, which can group costs by those labels, and you can see exactly how much a specific DAG for a specific customer is costing you, down to the penny But if a full migration to Kubernetes is too much, there's a ""good enough"" method. Instead of tracking dollars, track resource-hours. Airflow logs the duration of every task. If your workers are a standard instance size (e.g., n2-standard-4), you can build a simple cost model: cost = duration\_in\_hours \* cost\_per\_hour\_of\_worker. It's not perfect - you'll miss network and disk I/O - but it'll get you 80% of the answer for 20% of the effort and help you find your most expensive tasks",ummitluyum,2025-11-06 18:32:01,15,dataengineering,t3_1opw2z9,False,

If your Airflow workers are not dynamic or they use the same pools of compute for all tasks, having a tagging system that trickles up into GCP/AWS billing is likely not possible. However you can often tag individual 'task runs' of ECS/Cloud Run instances and have those trickle into billing natively. In my experience you do lose out on additional aspects like networking out, which can be substantial, and if you can't find a way to associate that you'd need a top level overhead you append onto each task or maybe by runtime. Regarding non-efficient tasks, what does that mean? Airflows native monitoring shows the Task Duration and Landing times. Perhaps also look at sensor runtimes to subtract from overall runs as they're 'efficient'.My opinion would be that Airflow is a task orchestrator and attempting to patch in some sort of cost observability natively would not work well. Use the systems that are native to billing are the way to go.

nn6epnv,"I've done this to subset data for micro-batches. It does work and you can create quite clean and comprehensive collected datasets with it, but there are caveats.First, if you have links between two entities of the same type (customer-customer) then you will need to recursively traverse this graph to make sure you get everything, otherwise some referential integrity or derivation can break. These links can themselves be derived links rather than explicit ones, so it isn't necessarily something you'll be able to pick out algorithmically right away. An example I had was that two customers could be linked via a shared account, but the relationship was in a generic customer-account table, and the account could appear multiple times. Pulling in a customer that wasn't initially selected could pull in *another* customer, because the third customer may be related to the second but not the first.Second, you may end up with 'orphaned' data if you have you have some entity that is disjoint from your entry. Ideally this is not the case, but if you have multiple domains that don't directly interact you may end up just dropping an entire domain. Similar to the prior point, this is mostly something you'll find along the way, and you just need to give yourself an additional entry point.Third, you may have reference data that you don't want to filter in this way because certain outputs or reports may expect all reference data to be available regardless of whether anything relates to it. For example some classification reference set where someone does an aggregation group by that classification -- they may suddenly see classifications disappear entirely if no data was joined to it. They may prefer to still see the classification, but get `0` values in the aggregate data. Again, not something you can easily algorithmically determine, it is more of a UAT process on your data selection.That said, this is afaik the only real feasible way to get a comprehensive random sample of the data at a given point in time. As long as you come up with an extensible and performant way to relate tables for key selection, to add extra entry points, to specify 'full copy' reference tables, and to specify 'loopbacks' on key selection, it is just a matter of configuring things.I am not aware of a 'standard practice' for this.

nn1o6n6,"I think you are right that data governance often grows out of other data domains like engineering or analytics. Companies usually learn the hard way why their engineering or analytics initiatives fail, and only then start thinking about governance. At first they try to handle it with existing people, and when it grows large enough they start hiring roles dedicated to it. In my experience this mostly happens in big regulated industries like banks, insurance companies or government. Small companies usually do not care much, and it is fine, because their scale rarely makes the problems severe, and a small team can still handle them. So yes, I would recommend looking at highly regulated areas like banking, insurance or the public sector. You will find more demand there.As for entering data governance, it is a bit odd. From what I have seen, these roles are not the most sought after in data teams because they usually require less deep technical work. But this may only be true in organizations where the governance practice is already quite mature. Data skills still help a lot, and most places expect them in governance roles. Many organizations are still in the transition phase, where governance is mixed with regular data roles. It is still common to see a data engineer who is also a data steward at the same time while his job description might not actually indicate that.",Kardinals,2025-11-04 12:49:22,2,dataengineering,t3_1oo5u6o,False,

nn1ps3k,"Thanks! That absolutely makes sense. I’ve heard similar things while discussing this with other data engineers. For instance, in countries like Germany where the automobile industry is huge, companies are starting to take data governance seriously. But instead of hiring an entirely new team, they usually trust experienced internal people from engineering or analytics and hand those responsibilities over to them. Of course, they often have one dedicated person overseeing governance to guide the engineers, but that’s usually about it.What’s confusing, though, is that some industries seem to treat it differently. For example, Lufthansa recently started hiring specifically for data governance roles, which shows that aviation and other heavily regulated sectors are beginning to take it more seriously. So it feels like while in some industries it’s still considered a “risky zone” for newcomers, others are already investing in dedicated governance teams.",UnusualRuin7916,2025-11-04 13:00:53,2,dataengineering,t1_nn1o6n6,True,

Because of that, roles inside data teams overlap a lot and people end up wearing many hats. So the recommendation to enter through any data role if you want to move toward governance is valid. It is often easier to pivot internally from analytics or engineering into governance or data management than to try to find a pure governance job from the outside.It can also be risky.

nnuzd78,"Genuine question for you OP, or to anyone else who wants to take a crack at it. I find most resources for learning when it comes to programming to be quite frustrating, and they don't explain enough. I was only able to do a semester of computer science, but I was attending a university generally quite well regarded for their computer science / cybersecurity programs. I ended up having to stop attending for financial reasons, unfortunately. Anyway, what I LOVED about their program is that it broke everything down to the fundamentals. It's been a few years so some of the following may be incorrect. This is just an example, but they had us learning C++ and started us off by learning how a computer works. Then they had us learning how a variable is basically just assigning a name to a block of memory, and storing data in that location. Or how arrays are sequentially assigned blocks of memory, so if you know where X index of an array is located in the memory, you can find the other indexes. How you can't dynamically increase the size of the array due to how C++ is reserving memory, how typing works, etc. I find that with most learning resources, they just don't even *attempt* to explain how a particular thing works beyond a basic level. But then when you try to wade into the waters of reading documentation, it's so filled with technical jargon that it's often incomprehensible to a beginner. I don't want to build legos and just slap stuff together. I don't want to know how to USE a particular programming concept, I want to actually know how it works. I recall when I was younger, attempting to build some small projects. Inevitably, I would write a bit of code that I thought understood in one project, and try to re-use the same concept in another project with a slightly different use-case, only to find that it fundamentally was not doing what I originally thought it did. When that happens now and again? Not a big deal. When that's happening pretty frequently? It becomes frustrating, and it makes me think that even when I can re-use a concept in multiple projects successfully, that I still don't totally get what it's doing. That's the issue that I have with trying to learn by just trying to make something. I care a lot less about making any one particular project, and a lot more about knowing how everything I'm doing actually functions. Anyway, huge block of text over.

I was young and inexperienced and stormed in and demanded an explanation why they had ""regressed our performance"". He calmly explained the situation. To get the release out on Saturday night he had to modify the structure of the data slightly...in a way that was incompatible with my traversal. He had spent about half an hour trying to figure it out, writing unit tests to test the old and new structure...old passed, new didn't, the issue he was troubleshooting came down to the algorithm. It had no tests other than the ones he wrote. No comments explaining the reasoning behind it. It was not obvious to him why a convoluted and non standard algorithm was used. He had to fix it, and had to support it, so he did the reasonable thing and replaced it with a well known algorithm that worked with his new unit tests. Problem solved, release shipped.Starting to sympathize with the predicament he was in I explained my concern...the performance wasn't ""optimal"". ""'Optimal'? how do you know yours was 'optimal'?"" I stammered a bit and conceded I didn't actually know...but it \*was\* more efficient. ""Benchmarks?"" ....""no...I never benchmarked it"". ""What cases does it work with""....""oh..this and that and the other...."". His response was ""how do you know?"". ""I tested it!"" .....""No...no you didn't. There were no tests. There are now. We know this works, when it works, and how it works."" I responded indignantly ""but it's slower"". ""By a couple milliseconds, a few dozen times a day it runs. Do you care about that? Why? Isn't it better to know it works because it is tested with cases we expect it to handle?""""Yeah. If I write unit tests to fix the trivial issue with the original algorithm can I replace it?"" .... ""I guess you can....but is a few milliseconds of execution time a dozen times a day worth the effort? Don't you have actual bugs to fix?"" ....""Yeah....""....""Then do it the next time you change that code"". It never had to change. I never put it back.If I'd written unit tests showing the conditions the traversal handled, what it's preconditions were, etc he would have fixed the trivial issue with it and gone about his way, me none the wiser. Because I did a shoddy job it became his problem, and he fixed it the most expedient way possible...reasonable while the entire release team is twiddling their thumbs waiting for a critical fix.If you don't unit test your code it doesn't really work.

You need to know what to learn and at what point. Then once you think you got it by reading the theory you must prove it to yourself by doing a project and using the theory to build something. Here the Odin Project also does a great job. You learn the theory and then you build a project they provide where for each project you need all the theory you were supposed to learn prior. The course is hard and takes a long time to finish but imo is far better than a 5 hour youtube tutorial. Just watching someone code or just copying a project is not the same as creating your own version of a project which you will be required to do in the Odin Project.

This thought is also why I ended up in a warehouse instead of being a software engineer with a great career. Through coincidence I saw a comment on Reddit where someone asked what's best way to learn web development? Someone said try the Odin Project. I went on the website and really liked what I saw and decided I will start to learn how to code but this time I promised myself that if I start I won't stop no matter what. This promise to myself would become very important later as I had several moments where I wanted to give up in the beginning because I couldn't solve some Javascript puzzle.At the same time I had the idea for an App that we could really use in the company I work at. For many years we used a whiteboard to do shift planing and it was really cumbersome so my goal is to develop an App for this but I had no idea how.7 months passed by and I was around half done with the Odin Project and decided I had enough know how to start developing the digital shift planer. If anyone is interested in the detailed development process of the App I wrote a long post in the Odin Project subreddit, you can check it out in my profile.Anyway after 3 months I had a working app that we now use for almost a year and as mentioned above I also won a company price for it. And after our IT guy posted it on the companies social media (it's a huge company with around 30.000 employees worldwide) I had several requests from managers around the world from countries like Taiwan, India and a couple of others for a demo. It turned out that they all are still using Whiteboards for their shift management. While this is happening I am developing an App that me and a buddy of mine plan to turn into a small company.All in all I spent around 3000 hours now with programming over almost 2 years. It's never too late of course to start but I can't help but think if I had put that effort in when I was 15 I'm sure I wouldn't have ended up in a warehouse.

And it doesn't get easier. I *think*, but I'm not sure, that we get faster at it.My steps.1. Reproduce the problem, if possible. Get to the point where you can make the problem happen every time. If possible. Understand the inputs and other things that cause the failure. There are some bugs that are intermittent. Those are the worst. You can learn about [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) someday, but not today. If it's your thing write a test case which generates the bug.2. Try to figure out exactly which line of code caused the bug. If you get a traceback or other error message, it can tell you this. The top line of the traceback (bottom line in Python, why, Guido, why, did you do this backwards?) probably shows you the source file and line number where the problem occurred.3. Eyeball the code and the error message. Read the error message three times carefully; it often tells you exactly what is wrong in a language you don't quite understand.4. Learn to use a debugger to step through your code line by line. Start stepping (set a breakpoint) a few lines before the suspect line and do step step step. 5. Try putting in a fix to the problem.6. Repeat these steps.7. If you get frustrated after doing all this, take a break. Get a good night's sleep. Sometimes the answers to my bugs have come to me in dreams.

You’re asking about a data structure, i.e. a specific implementation detail, while the text you’re referencing is explaining an architectural detail.In this case, a stream processing system just means a system that is continuously processing data as it is produced - in other words, the job is never “complete”, the system may just be idle at some point waiting for the next chunk of data to come in. Data is pushed to this system rather than the system pulling data into it.The implementation of this can certainly use a queue, and in reality a system like this will likely use multiple queues and/or stacks along and way.TL;DR a stream and a queue are really just different things, not necessarily a replacement for each other. A stream is some data coming from a source which may or may not have an end, whereas a a queue is just a FIFO mechanism for processing data. Consider an example outside of programming:- A “stream of people“ would describe many people passing through some point at some rate without necessarily defining a start, end, or quantity- A “queue of people” would describe a line for people to wait in a FIFO fashion. There may not even be any people in the queue at some point in time- A stream of people may be entering a building to go wait in a queue, to go wait in one of many queues, or do something else entirely- A long and fast moving queue might be described as a stream",TheRealKidkudi,2025-11-09 20:48:17,26,learnprogramming,t3_1ostgm4,False,

You can rig, I dunno, RabbitMQ or MSMQ or whatever to provide that kind of service too.But a message queuing system can generalize beyond that. You can have many producers and one consumer of data. You can have many consumers, and distribute the messages to them to balance a load. You can have lossy queues—that makes sense for some applications. You can replay events from the recent past. And on and on.Either one can handle data in near real time. A stream is systems-architecturally much simpler than a more generalized queuing system. Your Saturday night production incidents will be easier to sort out with streams instead of queues.

Setting out to build a huge system, which is what you have envisioned, is likely to result in feeling like its too big and burnout. I would encourage you to pick one small component of what you want to build and do that. Skip the fancy UI, make it a command line utility so you don't get bogged down with building a fancy interface. Stay very focussed on it and only it. Don't worry if it feels like you can't visualize it, you can add that later once the core is working. For example, ""signal processing"" is very general. What inputs do you want to process to produce what outputs? Pick one, say the ability to accept stereo audio and determine which side of the space it is on. Not where it is, just which side, ie left or right. Test it, first with unit tests, then using live data. Get it working, very well. Feeding unreliable data to the next step in the processing pipeline will create pain as you have to determine which component is unreliable. Then add multiple sources of input, ie two people having a conversation back and forth. Extend it to identify that there isn't a single source. Get that working. Then extend again to identify which side the sources are on. Get it working. Unit test everything so you don't accidentally break stuff that you had working. I could go on and on and on...but that is how you build a complex system from the ground up.Expect your project to take years working on it full time. What you have laid out is a \*massive\* undertaking. Spend ample time evaluating existing libraries and tools that do the things you want...it's almost always easier and faster to use existing components than to build your own. Beware of the licenses...don't use anything that you don't want to be restricted by in the future. You can always replace components with others or your own if you determine they don't work. That might be reasonable to get you past a hurdle, but can also be a waste of time if you try to use something and it just isn't suited. Rack it up as a learning experience and move on.Break everything down into manageable chunks. Days or maybe a week...longer than that does not provide enough structure or confidence in feasibility. Don't know how to do something in order to know how long it will take? Break it down into chunks that you can research until you know enough to have a good idea of what is involved and how long it will take.Did I mention breaking things down into manageable chunks?

Which is probably why different languages (and APIs) calls it write, print, log, out, or >> ... So what should your translation be? And if you choose the Spanish word for ""write"" as the function name for ""print"", then what'll you do when you suddenly come across another function called ""write""? Should that be called the same, or something different?And even if you succesfully translate all the functions, classes and methods, you still can't translate words like if, while, for, function, class, return and so on - you you'll still end up with a mix.And the worst part is - when you forget what a translation means, and come across some of your earlier code - you'll have no way of understanding what it actually does, if the Spanish-named functions are part of the program itself, or translations of the system-functions.

nnadgly,"> How to figure things out on my own?Kind of ironic that you're even asking this, rather than figuring it out on your own, no?The process is pretty straight forward - you think about it. You read about it. YOU BEGIN BY STUMBLING AROUND, LOST AND ALONE IN THE DARK until you trip over something that might possibly happen to lead you somewhere. You have no idea what you're doing or where you're going until you get there, only to discover it was a dead end, and then you have to backpedal and try to figure out where else you might be able to go - perhaps from a past breadcrumb, perhaps a different trailhead you found along the way that you can come back to.Figuring shit out on your own means being lost most of the time. If you are willing to accept that whatever you're trying to do - you're likely not the first, and your problem was probably already solved first 60-80 years ago, then there's a lot of academic research to do. It's reading, reading, reading...If what you're doing IS unique, well then you have to spend a lot of time just thinking, just trying stuff. Every failure informs you of what not to do and how not to do it. You have to know what you want to accomplish in the first place so you can measure how far off you are.> I want to know how I can truly figure things out on my own and study effectively without missing important or essential informationYou need to embrace that you're totally missing shit, all the time. There is a depth of knowledge in front of you that you have no idea is even there, but the more you learn of it, the more profound all future insights would be, the faster and better you will find future solutions.But don't miss the forest for the trees. I've been programming for over 30 years - I'm tickled that Unicode is backward compatible with 1830s telegraph equipment, and that means something to me, but it doesn't mean anything to you. You're not there and it doesn't have to matter.> while also avoiding wasting too much timeThis bad attitude is not going to serve you. NOTHING is a waste of your time. Thomas Edison didn't invent the lightbulb, but he did improve upon it. He said it himself - he didn't fail 10,000 times, he just found 10,000 ways how not to do it. That information was GOLD back then. You don't learn from successes but failures. Being lost and stumbling, ""wasting time"" as you put it is a very necessary part of the process, it builds your intuition, which is what you actually need - knowledge you don't know you have and don't have to think about, but it informs you. You may not yet be on the path you want, but you're learning all sorts of other things, and it always comes back around to aid you.",mredding,2025-11-05 19:08:35,2,learnprogramming,t3_1op92xf,False,

nns2uxn,"Yep, this is one thing I think a looooooot of execs either underestimate or don't even think about when they decide on a layoff.When I was laid off in early 2023, half the engineering department was let go, so from 16 people down to 8. Had a final meeting with my boss the day before my last day, and he told me they were told it was for two reasons:1) Rising interest rates were cutting into the bottom line and they were concerned about runway (they had at least several years at the burn rate at the time).2) They lost their CTO, VP, and Director for the engineering side of things, and the rest of the executive board didn't want to handle a team of 16 engineers directly, so to make things easier they decided cutting the team in half made sense.In the few months after the layoff, half of the remaining engineers left for other opportunities, taking the org down to just 4 engineers. Apparently this led to some panic with the execs, and they finally did what I and others wondered why they didn't just do in the first place: they promoted they very capable and well liked lead engineer to VP, giving them their delegation point.One of the staff engineers who remained (who I worked with at my job before that one) said they were considering seeing if folks who were laid off might be interested in returning, and flat out asked me, ""If we offered to bring you back, would you?"" Told him I'd really have to think about it, but given the reasons for why the layoff happened I would have a hard time being willing to trust the company wouldn't do it again. He understood and that was the end of that conversation. Sucked too because if I would have been able to just slide back into my job there, as it was before, it would have been a $20k pay bump compared to the job I'd started a few weeks before that conversation took place.Layoffs lead to further attrition, and it's usually the most capable folks in the org who have avenues they can explore to leave. My manager, for example, gave notice a week after the layoff to go be the founding engineer of another company a buddy of his had started, and had been bugging him to join.The entire reason I was at that job was the place I worked before laid off 20% of the company in early 2022, and the attrition afterwards was big. I survived that layoff, the first one I ever survived, but it sucked watching folks I absolutely enjoyed working with leave. Many of them ended up at one or two other companies, and I ended up at one of those companies when one of them suggested they reach out for me to expand engineering. Frustrated with the promotion process and not liking the new landscape of things, being able to interview for two hours (system design and leadership rounds to assess level, no coding) for a $25k pay bump was too tempting.There are mental aspects to these things that linger, for everyone regardless of whether they were the ones let go or if they got to stay. I'm not saying layoffs should never happen or are never necessary, but for all the ones I've been through they definitely felt too reactionary and didn't consider the aftershock among those who remained.",ModernTenshi04,2025-11-08 15:38:28,148,cscareerquestions,t3_1orqj3y,False,

Its ability to search through the codebase for context and examples is very helpful.3. Give it context. Point it in the direction of a similar test suite with patterns you want it to emulate. If you just tell it to write tests for Service X, it will do whatever it wants - which is usually not what you want. Point out patterns you want it to emulate (e.g., “Use fluent assertions and create separate expectation objects to compare results against”)4. Don’t trust the tests it creates. Testing is meant to find the cracks and AI is an agreeable little sycophant. It’s just trying to get tests to pass. So there’s a balance you need to find where you come up with how to test and the AI just writes it. Otherwise you’re in danger of coming up with tests that are meaningless but pass and create false coverage.",reddithoggscripts,2025-11-05 20:43:00,12,cscareerquestions,t3_1opdfhk,False,

My prompts for larger changes are usually about 2 or 3 good paragraphs.There's 2 approaches to this:* learn how to provide all the necessary requirements and context so that an agent can do everything all at once* break up your work into small bite sized pieces and have the agent work on those one by one.

The correlation between leetcode performance and actual job success is... not great.What I've seen work better is giving them a real problem from your actual workflow. Like pull up some messy production data and ask them to write a query to find something specific. Then watch how they think through edge cases, ask clarifying questions, handle nulls and duplicates. For Python, give them a small script you actually use - maybe something that parses logs or transforms data between formats. See if they can extend it or fix a bug you introduce. The best candidates will ask about the business context, not just dive into coding.Also consider splitting the time - 15 minutes on a practical coding exercise, then 15 minutes discussing their approach to debugging, testing, code reviews. Ask about a time their code broke in production and how they handled it. Or show them a piece of your actual codebase and see if they can understand what it does. These conversations tell you way more about whether they'll succeed than watching them reverse a linked list.

For example, when you know people underestimate, why aren't you calling them out then and there?

I've literally had to tell people ""don't tell me the number you think I want to hear"", for example, when I smelled a ""going through the motions"" estimate.On the code quality front, ""letting them failing"" is another way of saying to give people autonomy to potentially shoot their own foot (and then own up to it).

EM does a lot more in the realm of fielding requests for work coming from other teams. Understands our capabilities, commits us to work that is in our ballparkand so our tasks to start are usually very broad in definition, something like ""Add Drawer Login Component"" with really just the design files attached and some bigger acceptance criteriait's on us to break that down to the smaller manageable tasks, and point them as a group. Then they're just added to the queue for the sprint, that's what we've committed to. All unassigned.and so now, anyone can pick up any of those tasks, let's say given an assumption we all have similar skillsets. Maybe a junior picks up a task that is a little more difficult; they can either take on the challenge, or maybe a more mid or senior stops them and says - ""oh hey this might be a little more involved, but you can help me build this part of it"" and create another ticket.So now we're all trusted to get the job done by doing all the discovery and now we have to work a little bit more together, and everyone has an idea of who's taking what. Junior A is prob waiting on bigger design things from Senior B before they can start. The senior would be inclined to prep the junior on what they have to do. or get them to focus on something else while Senior B finishes.You, just kinda make sure that you're aware of the progress, and the more senior engineers are there to identify risks. And you need this teamwork to happen, in order for you to be able to focus on the more important thingsEngineers handle their own PR reviews, since they've been working more closely together they already have context of the changes, they've prob already done an initial once over, and things move a long quicker.anyway i think you get it but keep in mind this is the IDEAL state of things.

I’ve tried encouraging them to talk to me at anytime, set aside specific open hours on my calendar where we can get together, quickly responding to any messages, reminding everyone that I’m available both before & after standup every day, I welcome draft PRs to give my opinions on before they go too far off in the weeds.

no37w9k,"60 hours a week is a solid chunk of time to become good at anything, which equates to about 3120 hours yearly.Now here's the kicker, you either like your job or you don't.If you do, then you need to apply 20 extra hours to working more (if you're salary, if not then up to you),or if you don't like your job then apply that 20 extra hours on another subject. If you choose not to apply that time to your job then you're looking at roughly 1000 hours a year, which is what you need to ""master"" or ""grab the hammer"" I call it. Some guys spend 20 years in C++ optimization and still find new things out today, so they are ""masters"" or ""able to drive nails in one hit"". That's truly how I look at it, can you walk into an environment and within 10 minutes narrow down a root cause. If you can't find something that quick then you haven't spent at least 1000 hours studying.If you choose to apply those skills to your job then you also need to make sure you aren't a slave to it, then people can control you and make your life a living hell. If anyone questions why you're there so late/early, or you login for a lot of time, then you can gently slip in that it's part of your ""professional education"". Literally use those words.If you're Indian or Asian (in those countries) then I would be careful with what you give your boss, they could become abusive. If it's an American employer then feel free to work for free. Why? because you're not working for free, you're making yourself look better (job security) and you're progressing your skillset. The Key:Do not think that your devotion to the company will result in that job security or professional progression. You're using them for education while paying your bills. Companies will chew you up and spit you out so be careful with how you practice things at work. The Middleground:Study outside of your job things that will make you useful then either grab tickets you know you can do, or communicate that you want to try this because you've been working on it alone. Why not just self-study and keep it private? Well a homelab isn't going to teach you how to upgrade pods and update images in a production environment, you can mock something like it, but when your boss is breathing down your neck and crap is running down your leg then you'll be glad you worked in a real env. The Takeaway:Take advantage of having a job and a place where you can see things break live, that's where the money is made, not when everything is running well.If you are truly just a curious individual then forget everything I said and protect 20 hours a week to explore whatever you want. Having a job means you can buy GPUs, electronics, hardware, etc. maybe not the best but something for you to work with.

But there is something wrong if you cry in quiet and put your team and deliverables into risk. If you let them know, they can also communicate with whoever is necessary and take action earlier. This way, if you deliver stuff, perfect move on to the next thing. If you struggle and let them know, you will get the help you needed and everyone will still be happy because they know they can trust you.And second part is learn to be independent and you need to carry some of the burden the team have. Your existence should not be a burden for someone else but rather help them to carry it. Few examples of this could be, actively review pull requests.

nn7y9fn,"First, it depends on who they laid off and what role(s) you’re applying for. For example, Microsoft recently laid off a significant number of game devs and similar positions to reduce the financial bleed from their Xbox/gaming division, but Azure is their prime source of revenue and I wouldn't be super concerned if I took a position working in some aspect of Azure. Azure is _more_ than thriving.Second, look at the company in question’s health. Specifically, review their recent stock price history (if they are a publicly traded company), see if they are operating at a net loss, and read reviews from employees to see if there are any negative trends to watch out for if you were to join. (For example, if one employee review says that everyone backstabs each other, but the other 300 show nothing but praise, the backstabbing claim was most likely made from a bitter person who got fired, or at least it is very uncommon at that company. However, if more than half of the reviews indicate serious backstabbing problems, then yeah, that’s a major red flag.)",jrt364,2025-11-05 11:29:38,29,cscareerquestions,t3_1op07lo,False,

nn8yf0v,"This is kind of a brain dump, but hopefully it helps:There are four types of layoffs (at least):1. The company is doing bad and they need to cut costs to stay afloat2. Corporate greed - the company is doing perfectly fine but the shareholders aren't seeing enough profit so we're gonna lay a bunch of people off to get more ""efficient"", which actually means ""overwork the shit out of people""3. Bloat - the company is doing fine, but there's a bunch of people that aren't actually working on projects that are valuable and the company can realistically not justify keeping them around4. A team is no longer necessary because the product/service/whatever they support is getting axed because it sucks - the rest of the company is fineAnd that is the order of how unappetizing it should be to join that company. A company that is struggling so much that it needs to lay people off is not necessarily a company that will turn it around because of the layoffs - things might get even worse after the layoffs.A company that is laying people off because of greed is going to have a horrendous work culture where people are going to have to work long hours, where a lot of knowledge will have recently left the company, etc. So you're not necessarily at risk of getting laid off, but you're going to be dealing with a pretty shitty work environment for a while.A company that allows bloat to happen now might allow bloat to happen again - if they aren't disciplined in their hiring, it means there's a risk that you might be the next bloat they get rid of. So this is going to be a role in which you're going to want to quickly make sure you're attaching yourself to valuable projects.And lastly - sometimes shit doesn't work out. We're seeing this with Amazon for example - you signed up to work on Alexa and now Alexa looks like it's going nowhere. It sucks, but sometimes you do need to get rid of like an entire department because it's just not what the company can justify. And as long as you're not joining a highly experimental arm of the company, this shouldn't really impact you much.I think by now there are very few companies that haven't done layoffs, and a company that is conservative enough to never overhire will have their own issues - namely, probably some stagnation and some lagging the market.

nn7z5yd,"As always it depends ... but IME you should always prefer joining a company that is strongly hiring rather than laying off because:Company is doing well enough to budget for headcount. This may not be the case for a company going through layoffs which may also not even be corrected by said layoffs.Culture will be better. Stability of position may ""feel"" stronger and your psyche will appreciate it. The people will appear more at ease and will usually be more pleasant to work with.Management will probably have a better vision and plan to steer the company. With a company doing layoffs expect lots of changes in direction and reorgs.So basically, your thought exercise while not totally impossible is hinging on two assumptions: the company was hurting before and the layoffs are improving their standing, and that these companies would be even interested in hiring in the first place. If you were even able to get an opening at these companies, would you even want to work there?

nnzzpeh,"Hey, I’ve been through similar experiences and have a few opinions to share.1. You’ll improve code quality on the job. The alternative is to look at more code (open source) but I don’t recommend that unless you’re really passionate about it. Otherwise, it might add more stress. So, just try to criticize and improve your code base at work. Practice articulating what looks good and what looks bad, and why. Experiment with new ideas and you’ll learn faster. There are many signals to look out for in a codebase: does any part of your dev flow slow you down when building new features, are any parts confusing if a new dev were to work on it, do you have to update multiple places in code for a simple feature, etc. If you have few complaints then maybe your structure is solid after all. If you do identify issues, chances are that it’s something someone else ran into and found a solution for, so it’s always worth searching for how others approach things.2. The only way is to study and to practice. There are tons of online resources. One that I’ve used is GreatFrontEnd, but try googling or searching this sub to find some structured learning resources. Also, ChatGPT is a great tool to ask dumb questions and get good feedback. Chat is also a great tool to ask your exact question : “how do I rebuild my fundamentals in a structured way.”3. Similar answer: study and practice, using online resources. I’ll bet you know a lot more than you give yourself credit for, but maybe don’t have the language to articulate ideas. Again, you can treat AI tools as a dev buddy: before developing a feature, create your rough design idea and ask Chat for feedback. (Typically this would be done with colleagues, but if you don’t have other devs as resources, AI is a solid tool imo.)4. I recommend stopping your weed consumption until you feel less anxious about your career. If you can’t cut it out completely, I recommend reserving it for a specific time and in smaller doses, like at night after all responsibilities are done for the day and you’re ready to wind down for bed. This is a nice middle ground because quitting cold turkey can lead to relapse and a negative spiral. Reserving it for night time only is a guilt-free window for you. This way, you’re using weed as a reward rather than a coping mechanism. Just make sure you have a solid and consistent waking schedule. :)5. This is more life advice than just career advice: we’re human beings with finite time in this life. You’ll never have time for everything so a good skill to learn is time management. With this career revamp you’re working on, write out everything that’s on your mind, and then choose the ones of highest importance (it’s subjective and only you can decide that). For each item that you’ve prioritized and deemed important enough to focus on, break it down into smaller chunks. Rinse and repeat until you have less overwhelming and more actionable tasks. And most importantly, do the tasks! If they’re small enough to complete, it helps you psychologically build momentum. If tasks seem daunting it’s usually because they feel more ambiguous and that’s when our minds resort to coping strategies (like smoking weed or scrolling on your phone). In these cases it’s okay to dive in and try things out until it feels less ambiguous, and from there you can continue the process of identifying and breaking things down into a todo list (aka backlog).One last thing, I’d recommend looking into therapy as an additional resource. I know that it can be expensive and might feel useless, but here’s my take on it: it’s not some sort of silver bullet solution to all your problems. If you can consider “cutting down on weed and strengthening my SWE foundation” as a long-term project, then therapy is a great resource to use along the way. It’s similar to what you did here, you posted how you were feeling and some advice and strategies were recommended. But with consistent therapy, each session is like a check-in: here’s what we talked about last time, here’s what I tried, and here’s where I struggled. It’s a continuous, iterative development process, much like how we build good software products!Good luck, you’ve got this!",ConceptOfWuv,2025-11-09 21:22:33,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1oskmf5,False,

Right now AI is decently good, but in my experience, the more you have to keep re-prompting for changes, the worse and worse it gets.

But as you progress in your career and tackle more complex issues that AI just isnt good enough at yet, you will need to have critical thinking and problem solving skills that I think you are not developing because you are so reliant on AI.This ended up being a bit of a soap box for me, but tldr: solve the problem on your own and use AI as a faster typing interface so you can develop your problem solving skills better.",Rexosorous,2025-11-05 18:53:21,41,cscareerquestions,t3_1opb7wd,False,

nn4lesf,"Did this about a year ago. SA / sales-adjacent roles were not on my radar at all, I had 8YOE as a SWE. I just thought the role sounded interesting and applied. In terms of transitioning understanding the domain you’d be working in is as important if not more so than your technical experience, so if you can find an SA role that is focused on the industry you work in now that’s probably the best way to get your foot in the door. Interview process was relatively easy, not highly technical. I was asked to describe in detail my technical work on my resume to basically check that I have a basic level of technical skill and can approach a new project, do research, build any required new skills, and execute, but no leetcode or anything. Obviously being personable and charismatic is relatively important as well. I’m at a Mag7 company. I believe SAs here are paid roughly 10% less than equivalent level SWEs but the pay is more than double what I was making in my last job at a Fortune 25 non-tech company as a SWE. WLB here is good with the caveat being that any SA role is likely going to require some travel. I’ve traveled approximately 6 times in the last year which isn’t terrible but I have colleagues who are traveling once a month or more.I’d say career trajectory is good, in my company SA has a high level of visibility, and because it’s a very versatile role that spans sales, product, and engineering I think it would be fairly easy to transfer into TPM or engineering from here. I don’t personally find the work as fulfilling as SWE but I also think that’s partially because I haven’t quite hit my stride yet.

The whole functional programming paradigm, ES6, components, props, how renders work, Redux - all of it felt like trying to drink from a fire hose. I had anxiety and panic attacks over it. So I want you to know: this transition is genuinely hard, and you're not failing because you're finding it hard.That perfectionism/ADHD piece your therapist mentioned is huge though. Modern frontend development, especially in complex codebases, IS a constant stream of ""wtf is happening"" moments. Even seniors get lost in deeply nested components with no documentation. The difference is they've built up tolerance for not knowing and can sit in that discomfort longer.Also, you lost your mentor. That's massive. You went from having someone who understood the codebase to basically being on your own in a system with minimal documentation.The isolation is probably making everything worse too. Even if you go to the office and those people don't understand your specific codebase - they've been through what you're going through. We all have, even if we don't show it or are too proud to admit it. You could try working from coffee shops sometimes too, just to break up being alone all day.For me, it took 1-2 months of really intense, focused work before things clicked. But what forced me to lock in was when the stakes got really real. That kind of pressure made me focus in a way nothing else does, but it's also not sustainable or healthy long-term.Your manager's job is to help you thrive - you could try being really open with them about needing more structured support after your mentor left. Pair programming helped me a ton - you get to ask questions in real time and it actually makes both people more productive. If you ask your manager or even just another dev to pair with you on some tickets, most people would probably be down. And when you're stuck solo, timebox it - give yourself 30 minutes to struggle, then ask.You're 9 months in. That's still early.

You’re going to spend tons of time learning about C++’s misfeatures and warts, issues that don’t apply to any other language and aren’t general concepts.

It's fun to teleport across your document and edit entire words with as little as 1 or 2 keystrokes.

nnjqe20,"I have three pieces of advice from someone who has been in this game a long time and who has been in roles where I didn't feel like I was successful.First: If you onboarded at the end of August, then you are less than three months into this job. I have never been at a company where anyone really got up to speed in less than six months. If it's a large company, a fast-moving company, or both, it can take closer to a year.Two: We are all our own worst critics. We see all of our deficits and fuckups. Meanwhile, when we see other people's work, it's because they landed something, solved some problem, gave some slick presentation, etc. Don't compare yourselves to others. You will invariably be comparing your messy practice sessions to their greatest hits.Three: When the great jazz guitarist Pat Metheny was asked by an interviewer how he got so good, he responded ""easy, I made sure I was the worst guy in every band I was in."" Talk to the people whose work you admire. Ask them how they think about problems. If you see a slick piece of code or a clever solution, give it the old \`git blame\`, figure out who wrote it, and message them saying it's cool and asking how they came up with it. Pay attention in code reviews. Get a mentor who is more senior in the same org and role as you. Even if you are the worst guy in the band right now, *that's the position where you do the most improving*.I've been where you are now, and it sucks, but it doesn't suck forever. Stick it out, ask lots of questions, and trust that you'll get better with time.",TheTarquin,2025-11-07 04:59:10,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1oql05h,False,

No one will look at a GitHub you list on your resume that could easily be plagiarized. HR doesn't code. Can code on your own if you want to learn tech stacks but no need to polish for sharing.You're seeking entry level work. You just have to know the basics. Most of CS is work experience. Your #1 goal is to get an internship in any part of CS. Oh you know this. If you don't, your odds of having a job at graduation tank. You're competitive applying in your 3rd semester for the upcoming summer.An AI job is not an impossibility with work experience but the real AI work requires graduate school education. Can be in CS or Electrical or Computer Engineering. Entry level job might masquerade it's AI to bait and switch you. Oh you can use GitHub Copilot, big whoop.University prestige is very important for consideration of internships and entry level jobs, then maybe never matters again. If you're US, I call Tier 1 a Top 40 or 50 program or #1 or #2 in your state. If you're at shit tier, you need to transfer up. You're not going to have 200+ companies recruiting on campus for CS and engineering students and HR is more likely to not read your resume.For now, make good grades, apply yourself and pursue what you're passionate about, whether in CS or not.
