If you are not influential on your team, discuss with someone who is and work a plan. Come with some ideas for solutions rather than just complaints and figure out how to present them. e.g. switch to a Kanban-style workflow; keep the backlog groomed and in prioritized order; for tickets with firm deadlines find a way to indicate the deadline so it gets prioritized correctly. Each person works on only one active story at a time until it is in a review stage where they are waiting on approval to merge. Only then do they pick up the next story on the backlog assigned to them.This gives a clarity to bottlenecks, and focus to what is in progress as it is limited at any given time. It forces clear prioritization of the work each person needs to do next: if a new urgent task comes in, it's set appropriately at or near the top of the backlog. Other items naturally shift down.It does require constant grooming & prioritization, and attention to velocity to ensure the lack of sprint deadline does not cause people to slack off. In addition to that, you can start the week off with everyone stating their goal(s) for the week based on what they know right then. ( in a shared document) \- As the week progresses, each person jots a quick note here or there on anything that prevent completion, whether changing priorities, lack of information needed from others, blocking issues, etc. Or you check off the stuff you have completed in some way. \- At end of week, status is left as it is; the next week a new section is created for that week, and you don't go back and clean up the previous week's notes or ticket status.Over time you can read back and see the patterns of *why* work is typically underestimated.",Fun_Independent_7529,2025-05-26 13:49:59,37,dataengineering,t3_1kvtz7d,False,

muj0rr3,"I'm brand new to DE. I wanted to type up a pretty detailed summary of what I've learned about all of these tools and formats recently, when looking at what stack to use for my app's pipeline but, unfortunately, my hands are fucked... arthritis is definitely coming for me.My super short summary, then, is that traditional databases use a proprietary file format to store data ""inside"" of the database (meaning it's not a file you can find in your file explorer and open); modern tools like DuckDB provide a query engine and enable SQL queries to be run on open-source file formats like parquet. Importantly, for my understanding, you can run DuckDB queries over many parquet files as if they were a single table.For me, this has shifted the way I view what a ""database"" really is. I used to think of it as the thing that stored data and let me query it. Now, I view the query engine and the stored data as two separate things, with ""database"" still referring to the engine. Then, tools like Iceberg exist to define how multiple parquet files are organised together into a table, as well as dealing with things like snapshots, partitions, schema evolution, and metadata files... at the moment I view Iceberg like a notepad I would keep on my desk that says ""to query sales, read files A, B, and C into DuckDB"" or ""Added Row X, Deleted Row Y"" so it can track how the table evolves over time without taking entire copies of the table (it actually creates a new file called a ""delete file"", to my knowledge, that works kind of like a subtraction X - Y). That means there are now three parts: data storage, the query engine, and metadata management.My understanding of the blogpost is that DuckLake replicates the kind of functionality that Iceberg provides but does so in a format that is compatible with any SQL database. This gives the management of datalakes database-like transactional guarantees, allows easier cross-table transactions, better concurrency, better snapshotting by referencing parts of files, and allows for things like views (which I guess Iceberg and other tools didn't?)Moreover, metadata is currently managed through file writing, and when performing many small updates or changes, this can be slow, and prone to conflict errors. Tools like BigQuery can be even worse, as they re-write entire blocks that have been affected by operations. DuckLake claims to solve for this by storing the metadata in a database, because they're typically good at handling high concurrency and sorting out conflicts. Correct me if I'm wrong there - that's definitely the limit of my technical knowledge.... if I ever get to work with these tools, I'm sure it'll be good knowledge to have!",ColdStorage256,2025-05-27 15:13:22,29,dataengineering,t3_1kwnx2o,False,

Also, you can create tests using dbt to verify that the results you want match certain criteria - things like uniqueness, completeness, etc. it also has pretty good methods for tracking lineage and adding documentation, and you can create reusable macros across projects.

Originally, we just used DbtTaskGroup() from [astronomer-cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos), but this approach introduces a lot of overhead for large pipelines with many small models. Essentially, it executes 1 dbt invocation per model. When you have dozens or hundreds of models, and you're waiting both for Airflow to schedule tasks and then for the tasks themselves to spin up k8s jobs, this can propagate delays through your pipeline.

Don't know about airflow.* The automatic docs are indeed quite useful. You can write natural language descriptions of everything non-technical users interact with.* None that comes to mind. It just does a few things really well.* The complete opposite, in my experience. So much simpler than trying to keep data transformation routines in pandas-based projects.* Unless you really need specific features from dbt cloud (say, the graphQL API on top of semantic models), I'd just self-host. It's easy and any DE team should be able to do it without much hassle.* In my previous job (small shop, leading a small team), I considered implementing dbt for a couple of years before actually doing it and absolutely regret the wait.

Additionally, we have implemented data quality testing throughout. Mainly to ensure that primary keys are unique and not null. We are also defining foreign keys. This makes it easier for data consumers to use the tables and for us developers to understand to ensure that they are what we intend them to be. The docs site is nice, but I find that few data consumers actually use it. We use GCP. I love using dbt, but if I was to start over today I would probably use Dataform as it is fully integrated in GCP.

I never experienced it but you hear about the meme posts of “unpatched servers” so I doubt those are “reliable and performant”Both on-prem and cloud are susceptible to poor architecture, lack of resources with unrealistic demand for budget, lack of in house knowledge, etc. At the end of the day, the tools themselves matter far less and instead require in-depth understanding of trade offs to know what is the right architecture for different use cases.Lastly, on-prem and cloud both have a place in building Data Platforms.

You have to call the IT team, they have to call their manager, get approval, the guy who buys server racks is on parental leave, sorry you'll have to wait for 3 more months. Not to mention, the manager of that team decides to de-prioritize your request because guess what, when Bob Servers came back from leave he got a better offer from Google and left.

Are you talking about like adding columns or adding new fact and dimension tables? Any data warehouse will require maintenance, add new features, etc. but if you are doing a regular major rework, that is either a business issue or you may need to consider evaluating a skill gap on your team around data modeling.Lastly, this would be a poor KPI. Like some other folks of said, it would be similar to counting lines of code. If you are looking for some good KPIs, general ones that I’m a fan of are:1. Data Quality time to resolution. How long does it take from when a data quality bug is reported to it being fixed.2. How many Data Quality issues get through to end users. If you do not have a good data quality test suite in place, you will end up with a lot of bad data getting presented to end users which loses trust and can potentially be costly to the business.3. Data Platform uptime. The percentage of time the data platform is available and appropriately supplying data. An example would be is if you have a pipeline fail and new reports can’t be generated, that would be counted as downtime.Hope this helps. Evaluating the success of a Data Engineering team can be tricky because there is a lot out of our control so whether it is fair or not, we have to play what I call “a lot of defensive” to ensure we are in a good state.

muwcpa6,"Don't overlook the most common cause of this pattern however: they just built the most simple & obvious data pipeline and weren't aware that they should make it incremental and faster/cheaper/lower-latency. This happens all the time.And there's a number of significant issues with this approach: * Data pipeline duration: processing 50 TB of data is probably not happening in 10 minutes, whereas a single day's worth of data might. And that means that when it breaks it may be down for a *long* time. It may require engineers sit babysit it all night long, and multiple shifts of engineers to work together to get the broken data pipelines back online. That translates to engineer burnout, bad availability metrics and business outcomes. Painful fix processes also push teams to deploy new features less frequently rather than more - which is another bad outcome. * Data pipeline latency & update frequency: they're only processing daily because presumably their volume, and usually because they pushed back against more frequent runs throughout the day. It's rare in 2025 to find teams that really don't want the data more often - say every 5-60 minutes to reflect some data they just added to a spreadsheet, etc. Also, if they ran their pipeline every 5 minutes then it it would be far easier to deploy features daily instead of monthly or quarterly, and they could see when there's problem - in the middle of the day when all the engineers are available to fix them. * Restating history: there's no single simple answer to what to do when you want to ""change dimensions"". Because if your changes, possibly to fix an error, restate history now your data won't match what you've already published and have the business, and maybe customers using. It's great to fix errors, but it's not great to change history without letting people know. * Cost: it can be expensive to reprocess 50 TB of data on a daily basis. Say you're using snowflake and dbt, one could spend $500k - $1m/year on such a task, depending on number of models/complexity/etc, as opposed to a tiny fraction of that for incremental processing. And while some companies are rolling in the cash, it's always just a matter of time before belt-tightening happens and people need to fix that. * Why not do both? While I'm not a fan of DBT in general, in the past I've supported data pipelines that ran incrementally unless you ran them with a refresh option and then some also always ran a full refresh periodically.

This will let ClickHouse run your queries in literally milliseconds.e.g. suppose you have logs that have the columns: id (unique), timestamp, app, machine, country, message. Where each app runs on many machines and each machine is in a country.Here you want to set the ORDER BY such that the lowest cardinality items come first. Since you have few distinct countries, more distinct machines, many distinct apps and very many distinct timestamps it should be:ORDER BY (country, machine, app, timestamp)This will store the data sorted on disk in a way that will make GROUP BYs very efficient. You can expect queries of under 1 second on an 8 core machine.However also note that ClickHouse is very fast. Even if you don’t set the group by optimally it will likely still execute your queries in under 1min.Whilst it’s hard to give exact numbers I’ve given ballparks for what you can expect for illustration to help you decide whether you want to do it or not.Edit: another thing to note is that ClickHouse will compress your data to speed it up and use less disk.

The way our program is structured is around 6 months for the learning plan (since they are undergrad students we don’t expect/require previous experience or extensive knowledge) and the remaining internship period (this can change from intern to intern based on their needs/progress) is spent allocated on project (usually the same one).We don’t have any official rewards system, but as a team our approach it to give the interns opportunities to explore according to their development and interests.

mutzeq1,"Gotcha! Thank you for the clarity. This is actually a project I've completed recently - moving processes from legacy to Fabric PaaS. Yes! A lakehouse definitely can be the origin for a dataset and be the only 'source' for this data. The important aspects to consider before choosing to use the lakehouse as the origin location for the data will involve your governance and auditing practices, how robust your lakehouse setup is, how reliable your processes are to ensure proper testing / auditing. Etc. Its the same concern you'd have keeping a data set in any location. In reality, depending on your use case and how your data sources store the data once its extracted, once your lakehouse ingests the data from the external sources, the external source may not always maintain a copy of that data, leaving it only in the lake of the lakehouse. Same sort of idea as using the lake & lakehouse as the data origin for a 'new' dataset that isn't derived from a raw external data set. If you're performing transformations on the raw 'bronze' or even 'silver' data, you are creating new datasets likely being held ONLY in the lake or lakehouse, unless you then moved those datasets into a different warehouse or system.These new transformed datasets may be derived from the raw external data, but they are new datasets in tables in the lakehouse. I think you'll find lakehouses to be powerful and friendly for rule-based processing. If the lakehouse is ONLY being used as a glorified ETL platform, it's kind of a silly misuse of the power. (If you have a strong data governance program requiring you to maintain storage / system of record elsewhere, then obviously the lakehouse is not the long term storage place. But this has not been the case in my experience, outside of heavily regulated industries... which generally have so many redundancies in place the data ends up living in multiple places )For clarity in how this is possible: constraints being business setting the rules and editing the data set.im not sure exactly what platform you're working with or what type of lakehouse you have, but an example way to do this for microsoft fabric: 1. Create a rules table that lives in the Fabric Lakehouse (Delta format).2. Let business users edit those rules (via Power BI, powerapps, excel ).3. Build a processing logic (in Notebook or Dataflow) that applies the rules to a dataset. 4. Trigger the Fabric pipeline when rules change or on a schedule.5. Store the final result back in the Fabric Lakehouse. Because the users can change the rules themselves, be mindful to keep a table with every recorded change if you're concerned about data loss or potentially having a need to review the intermediary changes that occurred on the datasets.[Big ND energy over here - hope the details help]",nomdeplume2,2025-05-29 05:07:34,2,dataengineering,t3_1kxzcuu,False,

And why do you specify your filter conditions in lambdas? Spark has no way to know what you're doing inside the lambda -- it passes in the entire row so it cannot know what columns are being used, or for what -- so it can't optimise anything. For example, if you had a DataFrame with the tablename, api, and offset cached, then when you chain a proper spark filter off of that it can avoid making API calls for the other tables in the first place, because it can apply the filter earlier in the sequence (as the value never changes). It can't figure that out when you're using rdds and lambdas.Also, it has to serialise every row to python, so python can deserialise it, just so that python can execute a basic equality check.

mu68y4x,"> how about check pointing?RDD checkpointing should give you a similar effect, but only within a session and only if you specifically pull that RDD by id. If you rerun the pyspark code you'll generate a new RDD definition. Even though *you* know you'll get the same result, spark can't tell, so it is a new RDD.> I start from RDD but you start with UDFThat's not really the distinction. Both versions are running a python function on the executors with input args being sent over from the spark data. The only distinction with a UDF is that the `udf()` call is a wrapper so that you can call the function as if it were a spark function and send it column definitions, whereas in an `rdd.map()` you pass the function reference (rather than call it), and it takes the whole row as its arg.The main difference is to process everything once and just save the json output as text as you go with no further processing. That will complete the data retrieval step, without mixing in possible issues or errors from anything else that could unnecessarily cause you to have to hit the API again. It is a lot like making a 'bronze layer' for your overall process. There's likely little overhead in writing then reading back the data, since it can likely write the data while it is still processing requests, and also because spark is going to have to go over the data multiple times to infer the json schema anyway.> What is the benefit of using UDF over RDD in first place?Again, it isn't a UDF over an RDD. A UDF is just a way to wrap a python call so you can use it as if it is a spark function that takes columns as input, rather than passing a function reference and that function having to take a whole row.For one thing, it is a bit faster because spark only has to serialise (and python deserialise) the specific columns that go into the function, which can help performance when the row is very wide. It also means that spark can potentially skip execute the UDF entirely, if its output isn't required for anything.A benefit with using DataFrames is that spark can optimise things by cutting out steps that aren't necessary. Here as an example you can run locally -- just do a `pip install pyspark` and make sure you have openjdk17 with JAVA_HOME set. import json from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col, lit from pyspark.sql.types import StringType spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() data = [ (""A"", 0), (""A"", 100), (""B"", 0), (""B"", 100), ] input_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=""category STRING, offset INT"") input_df.show() def python_func(category: str, offset: int) -> str: with open(""side_effect.txt"", ""a"") as filewriter: filewriter.write(f""{category}:{str(offset)}\n"") return ""--"" python_func_udf = udf(python_func, StringType()) ( input_df.filter(col(""category"") == lit(""A"")).withColumn( ""python_func_call"", python_func_udf(col(""category""), col(""offset"")) ) ).write.format(""noop"").mode(""overwrite"").save()If you run this once and open `side_effect.txt` you'll see that it *only* has rows where the input data `category` column is equal to `""A""`. Spark *completely skipped* processing the other rows, and the python function was never called for them.In your original example spark *cannot* know what the result of the filter is going to be, because it is being done in Python code. Therefore it must execute the entire source RDD and push every row in its entirety through the filter function in order to get the correct results. This is what causes the execution of the 'invoices' json rdd to also hit the api for the purchase_orders endpoint, even though that data won't go into that RDD.If you use DataFrames from the beginning, and use a DataFrame filter to pick the table you are processing, spark will *only* hit the API for the rows that match your filter, even though you specified the filter in a later step. You could avoid this double-processing without even trying.---The actual suggestion is to stick with DataFrames and just save the data immediately. Then after pulling down the data from the API -- which is *highly* likely to be the slow part -- and saving it, you can just read it back to do everything you need. You *have* the data, you just need to process it. You can take the response json strings and write them out to 'text' files, then read them back in 'json' format and spark will do all the schema inference for you. You can even automatically split up the writes by table in a single pass by setting a partition on the tablename, then read back just the files for a specific table. from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col, explode_outer from pyspark.sql.types import ArrayType, StringType spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() # set up API calls data = [ (""Invoices"", ""https://api.example.com/invoices"", 0), (""Invoices"", ""https://api.example.com/invoices"", 100), (""Invoices"", ""https://api.example.com/invoices"", 200), (""PurchaseOrders"", ""https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders"", 0), (""PurchaseOrders"", ""https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders"", 150), (""PurchaseOrders"", ""https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders"", 300), ] input_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=""tablename STRING, endpoint STRING, offset INT"") def fetch_responses(endpoint: str, offset: int) -> list[str]: response_body = YOUR_REQUEST_RESPONSE return response_body fetch_responses_udf = udf(fetch_responses, ArrayType(StringType())) # define the process to fetch the data and save it as-is to avoid reprocessing due to errors responses_col = fetch_responses_udf(col(""endpoint""), col(""offset"")).alias(""response_array"") get_everything_df = input_df.select(""*"", responses_col) get_everything_df.write.format(""parquet"").save(SOME_SCRATCH_SPACE_PATH) # use the saved data to generate the per element data and save to separate folders per table fetch_each_col = explode_outer(responses_col).alias(""response"") per_element_df = get_everything_df.select(""tablename"", fetch_each_col) per_element_df.write.format(""text"").partitionBy(""tablename"").save(SOME_PATH_FOR_YOUR_JSONL_TABLEDATA) # now read back for your desired tablename - this uses the hive style partitioning to pick just one table invoices_df = spark.read.format(""json"").load(SOME_PATH_FOR_YOUR_JSONL + ""/tablename=invoices"")",azirale,2025-05-25 14:05:24,1,dataengineering,t1_mu012a9,False,

So that you can do the solution in a naive way and still get a passing, because is what I actually care about as a dev. You are able to understand and solve the issue, not that you can do in the most efficient way, that you only need to do it as a refractoring after it has been assessed that we need performance for that specific task.Classic example is to be able to do what they ask for string 10\^12 carachter long in less than 200ms.And that's bad for two reasons:1. A requirement like that in a professional setting would have probably been stopped at the source: why do you have a string this long, and do we really need a string this long ?2. A lot of times, the DP solution is worse than the native solution for smaller sets. Something simply because it's harder to understand and as a general rule of thumb you want to make your code easy to understand, and also because sometimes is just less efficient for small sets because it requires some overhead work that the naive solutiomn won't need and while the naive solution is 0(n\^2) instead of O(log(n)) for strings less than 200 carachter the naive solution can be faster.",LordAmras,2025-05-27 06:00:30,3,learnprogramming,t3_1kwbj94,False,

This is especially true when writing a one-off program, you don't know how much time invested into each component is worth, so those programming design patterns are now weighed with your desire to get something to work.

mucsto4,"I'm a professional programmer who started with those exact resources, and I think they're both very very good--especially together. Start with FCC and do the html/css/JS content until you finish it, get painfully bored, or feel like you're spinning your wheels. When you're ready to apply the js skills from FCC, start odin project for web development -- it'll show you how to use all of the syntax you've learned to build real things. Odin is particularly good because it's project-based and doesn't hold your hand, but for these reasons, it's good to have some syntax knowledge before getting too deep into it, IMO. It also teaches you common non-code skills that are necessary for building software in web context: version control (git/github), IDE/code editor setup, linux env setup (esp important if you're not on mac), basic terminal usage etc.That's the path I took, and I don't think I'd be where I am today if I hadn't had FCC and Odin. I stayed 100% focused on js, and if you're going for web, I'd suggest you do the same -- it will speed things up if you focus on one language. And with node, you can write backend in js as well. The earlier you get used to typescript, as well, the better.By the time I got semi-competent w/ React through Odin, I actually did a bootcamp. It sounds like the market is pretty bad for bootcampers these days, so dunno if I'd recommend it in 2025. In my case, I did the bootcamp after coding off and on for like 2 years though. So YMMV.

The idea was that you could write that in any text-editor you like, and then ""compile"" the source code to a binary program that could be run on its own.I use the past tense, because nowadays the differences are a lot more blurred - you can write programs in languages like Python and JavaScript inside spreadsheets (Google Sheets and Excel supports both, as far as I'm aware), or inside the browser, or custom applications, or you can write code on its own, but then execute it with a runtime. And often this runtime contains a virtual machine, and it is all very complicated, but you usually don't need to know - you just write your program in an IDE and then run it directly in the IDE while working on it, until you are done, and can run it from anywhere on the computer.I recommend getting started with Python - follow a tutorial to help you set everything up, and get something working.

Private tool servers, private agents, refactoring and tightening up RBAC on APIs to accommodate more dynamic access patterns... those are things that there won't be one vendor for. Those are the things that take you from chat app party trick to wildly better UI and capabilities for business systems.Also I'll note that just like the pre AI tech scene, the vast vast amount of positions will be not in innovation and R&D but in application development. Every shop will be building AI apps and especially extending and refactoring their existing systems to leverage AI, and the primary skill set will be building, not working at the bleeding edge of technology, but developing applications for it. UX is about to go through a bigger revolution than the smart phone. This change is going to make backends be designed differently. And platforms. There's about to be a ton of dev work, even with our shiny new tools that let us build feature X much faster than we could build it 5 years ago. We'll find ways to leverage lower experienced contributors, it just won't be endless frontend feature factories; demand for said features will go down with AI powered UX (not bolted on chat bot bs), and where they are needed, AI slop can handle that.

mub99m4,"I have a little over 3.5 years of experience, and I’m at a mid-level position. I work in web dev.If I was starting out again, I’d do the bare minimum to understand how to debug on my own and learning how to Google and find things on Stack overflow.After becoming barely proficient enough to generally get through difficult tasks that approach, when needed, then I’d stop utilizing that approach for learning. I’d then open up several AI models with free chat samples of their higher-end models (usually in the form of free credits that reset daily), and then I’d start building tons of projects.The AI assistance I’d use to help me understand things and identify unknown unknowns. You can’t just use it to build everything for you. Then you’re not a programmer, just a prompter. The goal is to use it faster than you’d have used Stack Overflow or Google to learn the same things.After building tons of projects, I’d get the experience taking a few live, such as web hosting, figuring out DNS, live database, live authentication, etc.After doing this, I’d research best security practices and go back through projects implementing them, and also trying to break them, to get a real-world understanding of how many insecure things you just built with AI’s help. AI isn’t thinking of security. You need to be. I’d download Burp suite, and learn the basics of using it. This is great for learning how to compromise your system and find vulnerabilities. You will find vulnerabilities. If you don’t, it’s not because you don’t have any. It’s because you can’t find them.I myself am still getting better at the security aspect of things, so I can’t give you much more advice there, but that’s a starting point!The thing is, I’m providing the value that many coworkers pre-AI were providing with much more years of experience than me. You need to use it to your advantage and speed up your learning to catch up and overtake many of them.You also need to acknowledge that you are in a competitive field, and you are competing with many smart people. You need to acknowledge that if you want to grow faster than others, you need to do what 99% won’t. For me, that was working longer hours for experience. It was jumping into hard tasks for experience. It was pushing for more work and opportunity and legacy code work and bigger features and more bugs. I was willing to do the dirty work when it came up, and I was also always willing to listen to my coworkers whenever they had constructive feedback.Some of my coworkers have described me as “starving” and “hungry” to learn. I think there are a few who it scares, because of how fast I caught up to them.The thing is, they’re working 9-5. I was willing to work 9-5, or 9-9, or 9-5 then midnight to 4, or over the weekend. It isn’t about the money. It’s about the experience. I don’t get paid more as a salaried individual. You need to acknowledge that it’s about the short-term suffering for the long-term investment.Finally, place yourself in positions where you’re not the smartest in the room, or the highest on the totem pole. If you’re the top of the food chain in an area, leave. It’s a waste of your time unless you’re building up experience by sharing to those with less experience. You need a bit of both. Sharing to others, and learning from others. Look for engineering meet-ups in your area. I was lucky to go to one with all staff and principal engineers, as the sole junior. Just being around them causes you to learn immensely. If you go to a meet up, and it’s primarily people in your own skill level, then leave.In code, don’t get caught up in the little picture. Remember the big picture. Sometimes, things should really be left a little less perfect, or maybe not as clean, if they’re very leaf-node-like. Focus deeper on the root areas of the code base, that affect many things.In the end, it also depends on your goals. My goal was (and is) to move up as quickly as possible, to make as much money as I can, as quickly as possible. My goal is to get higher quicker so that I can r/FIRE when I want to, where I want to, if I want to. I’m already in a position to coast FIRE.

You have Django, which is a powerhouse of a framework, making development of any backends very secure and reliable.Golang is very nice to use. Static typing makes it a lot easier to work with. Also, the performance is almost comparable to language like Rust and C++, especially considering how much easier it is to write good code in it. I personally quite like the community behind it. They seem to not like using too many dependencies, which alines with my personal preferences. Building a solid, thoroughly tested API in Go can be done exclusively using the standard library. It’s also very efficient. Small scale APIs and apps can run containerised on a few dozen megabytes of memory, which I imagine could be very good for freelancing, as it will lower cloud bills for clients. Unfortunately there is no Django-styled batteries included framework in Go, which can make development of smaller projects harder.I’m also going to add one more suggestion - Java.

muv132x,"I don't know the problem and am unsure if both snippets actually do the same thing, but: the reason why we use hashmaps is not correctness, but cost.A good hashmap implementation (including a good hash function) has a lookup complexity of O(1), while finding an element in an array, takes O(n) time. Same for index\_of, also O(n) time.So, completely disregarding the correctness, you have three calls to O(n) functions in your simpler approach, making the overall runtime far worse for large inputs. (EDIT for clarity: The inside of the loop changes from O(1) to O(n), so the entire algorithm changes from O(n) to O(n²), because of the outer loop)If you want to see it for yourself, choose a large integer (like 10\_000\_000) as your target, and only fill the array with random integers of less than half it's size. This way, your condition will never trigger, and you will need to go through the entire array. Now make the array of length 100 million, and watch the runtime difference.(This strongly depends on a good hash map / hash function for the values. This depends on your language.

muv5xrk,"searching for a given key inside a hash map is roughly an O(1) operation (depends on the implementation of the hashing function, but lets say it's O(1)). however, searching for an element inside an array (in this case, a python list) is an O(n) operation (with n being the number of elements inside the array), which means you are going to scan the array linearly looking for your element. if you do this linear scan for every element on your array, the time completixy of your full algorithm will be O(n\^2). there isn't a problem with it per se, but if for every n array elements you're doing n\^2 operations, your algorithm becomes very inefficient for dealing with arrays that have a really big number of elements.in contrast, your algorithm that uses a hash map (in this case, a python dictionary) has a total time complexity of O(n \* 1) (which is just O(n)), which means it scales linearly with the number of elements inside the array.it's also important to point out that there is a memory trade off in this case, because you're using additional memory to store the key-value pairs of the dictionary (in order to do faster lookups for the complement you're searching for).",rodrigowb4ey,2025-05-29 11:31:41,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ky7n2p,False,
muvpr4r,"So, as a baseline for Two Sum, I have some old times of like 50ms in Python 3.

To be more specific, you have to completely iterate through the array in the time it takes the hashing to complete. That said, I've played around with a problem that fit this scenario, and the performance difference was negligible on an array with a max size of 20 elements in Rust. Unless you're aiming for sub-ms optimizations, and have a problem that is uniquely suited, hashmaps are pretty much always going to be faster.",iamnull,2025-05-29 13:32:07,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ky7n2p,False,

The terms ""software developer"", ""software engineer"", and even ""programmer"" are interchangeable, they're not separate careers.There are lots of specializations, though. The largest one is web development - either frontend (the UI in the browser) or backend (the part on the server), but there are hundreds of others from AI to robotics.Software is a fantastic career, but keep in mind that it's extremely competitive these days and the typical entry-level developer has a 4-year Computer Science degree.

What kind of job or project do you want to do?2. What skills or technologies are commonly used in that field?I'm not too confident when it comes to frameworks, so I won't go into that. But based on my personal experience, here are a few examples of different paths you could take. Still, I highly encourage you to do your own research and explore further:1. If you want to make video games, it's useful to learn C++ and C#, along with engines like Unreal Engine (C++) or Unity (C#). C++ is a lower-level language, which gives you more control over performance, but it's harder to learn. C# is widely used in Unity and also good for building desktop GUIs.2. If you'd like to make websites, you'll need HTML and CSS to structure and style web pages, and JavaScript to make them interactive.3. Lastly, if you want to work as a data scientist or in the AI field, Python is the go-to language. Learn libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and so on. SQL is also important for managing and querying databases.Python is considered a high-level language, meaning it's easier to write and read, but it's further from the hardware compared to languages like C or C++. This means you have less control over performance, and in some cases, Python can be slower when executing certain types of code. If you want to learn JavaScript know that there's a lot of memes because it works in a.. strange way :face_with_tears_of_joy:Apart from this, you're surely making an excellent choice wanting to understand programming, I'm too ""at the beginning"", so this is everything I can give to you, hope I helped you brother!",CostRepulsive693,2025-05-23 20:30:52,10,learnprogramming,t3_1ktsh09,False,

I absolutely don't want to make light of bullying but the fact that this is not the other way around is certainly a thing... To be entirely honest the best advice I can really give you is, ""just allow yourself to get into it"". If you are just discovering it, the journey will take you somewhere. Lua is often used for modding games as I understand it, so you could maybe play around with some of that. There are frameworks for building web applications in Lua.

My personal 'prime directive' advice is simply, ""just pick something you would like to try to make and start trying to make it!"". When somebody crosses fields like this I always suggest mining their knowledge of their other field to see if there are any ideas you can think of that might be useful. It doesn't have to make you a billionaire, it doesn't have to even ever get used, it just needs to give you an idea to focus on, so you can use programming as a means to an end.... that's what you'll be expected to do if you work in the field and strangely it is also where you learn the most.

Websites like Squarespace offering building kits in which you can make the global layout without coding and then refine things via. added scripts and libraries. 2. WordPress 3. HTML + CSS, the default option for simple sites 4. JavaScript for interactivity 5. Python/PHP (or other languages) for server implementationsThe ""correct"" choice really depends on what you plan to make and what you plan to use it for.The long answer: HTML is technically not a full-fledged programming language, but more a tool to build the skeleton of the website. Basics you can mostly learn in a day/week. CSS is for everything style (fonts, colors, layouts, ...) and works as addition to HTML. For real-time interactivity, you need JavaScript. There are variations, but JS is the only language supported by basically all browser, which is why it is the go-to programming language for this.If you want your page to have the ability to save/access data, through a database or multi-user interactivity or such.. Then you generally need to have a programming language on the web server. PHP was most common for a long time, but nowadays you see a lot of people use Python instead. You can generally use any programming language you want on the server, it will effectively read data coming in from web pages, and produce web pages as output. It also deals with a file systems or databases.Unlike HTML and CSS, any programming language will take a lot of effort to master. So if you really want to build a web page that sits there and shows information, you'll be fine with HTML and CSS.Easy-Mode: HTML + CSS Medium-Mode: add JavaScript Hard-Mode: add PHP or Python (or other...) for server based interactions and databasesKind regards, Mr. Prototype and the Broken Pony Studios team (I am just an indie game developer who made his companies website :D)",TS_Prototypo,2025-05-29 08:50:21,1,learnprogramming,t3_1kxparp,False,

mu5ufnh,"Well, no, but also yes.CSS isn't confusing at all, it is, especially with changes made the last three-five years, a very well structured language to express how you'd like the design and layout of your HTML-document to look.However, most programmers suck at visual design, at understanding what looks good, what the rules are, what things are called, and how to plan or even talk about the design of a document. They often prefer some pre-baked incantations that they can just throw at the page, so it will look like every other page out there. Which is probably why Bootstrap became so popular in the first place, and why Tailwind is so popular now.CSS is very, very, very different from HTML and JavaScript - HTML is a structure, it is easy to see if one element is before, after, inside or outside another. And JavaScript mostly is a list of lines, all being executed one after another, so that's also pretty easy to understand. But in CSS there isn't really any structure, just a bunch of rules that more or less all apply at the same time.Some parts of CSS has to do the the individual elements, how they look, how much space they take up, or where they are in relation to other elements. Other parts of CSS has to do with the layout, how an element layouts other elements inside of it. Yet other parts of CSS has to do with how an element is layouted by the parent. And you don't really write the rules, you just set some values on some properties that is used by some algorithms. So it is a bit like programming where you can only change the values of variables - difficult.I think that this recent video from Kevin Powell: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-95kJ0eyzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-95kJ0eyzQ) gives a good introduction to understanding how to understand CSS :)",peterlinddk,2025-05-25 12:36:11,2,learnprogramming,t3_1kuyfqt,False,

Just a plain integer value of one.Now you have the multiplication of ""1"" and ""1.0"". One operahend is an integer and the other is a double precision floating point.

Then the two values will be multiplied together, getting the final result of 1.0.As for your second example of 1.0 * 3 / 2 = 1.5, you follow the same logic. First you have the multiplication of 1.0 * 3. The integer value of 3 is converted to the floating value of 3.0. The multiplication occurs, giving the floating result of 3.0.

This is useful a reference for people who *already know* how to use the library in question and need a reminder. Also a nice way, once you know how to use the library generally, to fully explore all the things it can do. e.g. what methods exist on \`class Router\`* Guides: Explore a single topic in *depth* ""How to route incoming requests in Framework X"". Good for seeing how classes/methods/functions can be used to solve real world problems in a single focused domain. E.g.

When researching ""how do I route with an optional parameter"" you also learn a bit about how the library processes routes in order; a month later a ""weird routing bug"" has an obvious and simple solution to you (""this route just needs to be higher precedence"").To write new code you need to read existing code, sometimes code right where you're working, sometimes code many hops away in a callstack. The more you read, the more you slowly build up valuable context about the code in totality, the better your future code comes.The acceptance criteria for AI tools in their current form is the same as an incredibly eager intern or early career professional: ""Well, *it works"".* A large application that is an accumulation of tasks completed to a ""well, it works"" level becomes increasingly difficult to understand and change.

I am not even sure if this helps but there are many columns that come from API but even there the naming conventions are different. Here's an example country_id is the column name in table1 and I need table2 to join at country_id because that's where the weather report comes from but the column is called weather_ids_country I thought this was a mistake so I asked the team they are like no this is correct.

mumt1ya,"So for each user, you want to store a list of ""interactions"", and then given two arbitrary users, you want to show the interactions they have in common, right? In other words, if you represent their interactions as sets (of IDs), you want the intersection of those sets.I don't know of any fancy general-purpose algorithm that can do this better than the simple, brute-force approach of just computing the intersection on the fly. Precomputing the intersections is not a good idea because if you have N users, there are O(N^(2)) possible pairs, and most of those pairs will never be queried.Beyond that, you just have to estimate/benchmark the performance and optimize for your particular situation. Here's a very hand-wavy and totally hypothetical estimate:* Let's say that for future-proofing, each ""interaction"" (the ID of a post or whatever) can be represented as a 64-bit integer, occupying 8 bytes of space.* Assume that a typical user does 1000 interactions per day, and has a 10-year activity history on the site (if your site is very successful). So you can store a user's entire history in 1000 x 365 x 10 x 8 bytes, or about 30MB. Maybe this compresses down to 10MB or so.* With an SSD that has a sequential read throughput of maybe 500MB/sec, you can read 10MB in 20 milliseconds. Double that for two users.* Actually finding the intersection between two sorted lists of integers can be done easily in linear time. So the CPU is unlikely to be a bottleneck.* If one request fully utilizes the SSD for 40ms, then you can handle 25 ""common interaction"" queries per second. If you need to do more than that, you can add more read-only replicas of the same data.* Don't forget to account for the disk utilization associated with updating the user histories when new interactions happen. This depends on your requirements, e.g. do the query results need to be perfectly up to date with the latest interactions, or is it OK to perform batch updates once an hour, or once a day?* Maybe you want to find the top 10 most *recent* interactions in common. In that case, choose your 64-bit IDs so that they are (exactly or approximately) increasing in timestamp order. Then if the intersection has a million IDs in common, you don't have to fetch a million rows from the DB. You just sort the integer IDs themselves (very cheap since they're already in memory) and then only fetch the largest 10.",teraflop,2025-05-28 02:46:03,3,learnprogramming,t3_1kx5jkn,False,

Honestly leetcode is only maybe 20% of the prep I do when I decide to job hop. Most of my time goes towards behavioral prep and STAR scenarios, but a decent chunk of time goes towards very general technical prep. Language-specific terms/concepts, differences between versions if it's relevant (Java 6 vs Java 8 for example), re-reviewing data structures, SOLID, the 4 fundamental OOP concepts, design patterns, etc.Basically a review of all the fundamentals that are things we don't consciously think of during our day to day, but we're doing subconsciously. The exact kinda stuff pop-quiz style interviews tend to poke at.For example, if I asked you what the L stands for in SOLID, and explain it, could you do that right now? I know I couldn't. But when I'm looking for a job, you bet your ass I could rattle off any of those letters from memory and explain them. I *have* absolutely been asked about SOLID/OOP before. I remember one interviewer off-handedly asked me ""What's your favorite design pattern?"". I'm not a theory guy really, so I'm not really thinking about the textbook names and definitions of design patterns day to day.... but I had prepped on design patterns, so I was able to give a great answer that cultivated a good discussion. My answer wasn't ""Builder... because it's the only one I remember"". I got that job.There's a lot of stuff in between a pure leetcode interview and a 2 hour pop-quiz session, most interviews may settle at a natural blend of the 2 types of questions.

They're not a fit for the role, they probably know this, but getting as many intros as you can is the name of the game. I totally get it, no beef here.For you this means: if you see a role where your skills line up, GOOD RESUMES STAND OUT, so invest time in your resume and then invest more time in it.2. Instant resume killersYour resume doesn't tell me what you've been doing the last few years! I know it sounds silly but I've seen some resumes that talk really in detail about tools and languages, and don't talk about... what projects you worked on and how they mattered in the big picture, who used your work, who you collaborated with to make things happen, what defects you saw and what you improved and how you did that.If all you talk about is having taken tickets and turn them to code with lots of languages and tools, I can only assume you're best suited for a role that needs someone to specialise in taking tickets and turning them into code.What I'm looking for is, someone who's interested in joining a team, who wants to learn and help others learn, who wants to improve things, and to build stuff that works which they're proud of. So.... Write your resumes to show me these: make each bullet show some mix of how you've worked with lots of types of people, learned from and mentored them, made small improvements, worked on projects, all while you did the bigger items you want to highlight.Illustrating these will impress me more than a contextless ""Shipped project megazorb in java 21, made a billion""3. Interview stuffI'm always rooting for the candidate. I am also always thinking of my team and thinking, ""how will this person improve us"". Keep that in mind when I'm forced to ask HR question ""tell me a time contrived event happened"". Beyond that, biggest pointers I'd give are\- I pass plenty of people who struggle in technical qualifiersIf you're struggling, don't panic, but don't try to hide it either. The aim of the interview is: get to know what we'll both be like to work with. If you feel like a question or task is about to sink you, this is now a chance to show me how you deal with what seems like a really big problem. We'll have plenty in the role, I'm certain you've seen plenty before, so show me what you can do.\- Never criticise past employers/colleagues. Just don't go there. Even if you've heard that rule and still think ""well this is close to criticism but I'm phrasing it objectively so its ok"", still don't. I don't know why, but people do it a lot. I don't know you or those people and I have know way of knowing if what you're saying is fair or not. Just flip everything to ""I'm looking for $goodthing"" and don't say ""past employer had $badthing"". We can lament bad jobs when you're hired\- Don't lie. I'm not always going to catch it, but when I do, it's just a straight decline. If you don't have a great example of ""tell me a time X happened"", don't make one up, just say: ""I've never had to deal with that exactly, as stated, but I have had to do Y or Z"". These questions are almost always about, how did you learn from bad thing, how did you get around obstacle. If you just make something up there's nothing real and human there and it does show through.

muj8j9p,">I'll do junior stuff and take low end salariesAnd companies won't believe you.One of the most important parts of recruiting is retention. If a company doesn't think they can retain you, they're not going to hire you.Lots of things can make a company think they can't retain you. For example, if you blurt out your salary expectation are $200k, but the company is only able to offer $80k, they're not going to even bother extending the offer. Even if you say ""Oh, actually, I'm totally willing to accept $80k!"", they're not going to bother. You already showed your hand. They know you want $200k, and they know even though you'll accept their offer of $80k, because $200k was your expectation you're going to continue job searching and leave them the moment you get an offer that's more aligned with your expectations.Another example, if you've gotten a PhD and are highly specialized in a niche area of the industry, and the company you're talking to is just hiring for a basic CRUD role... they know you'll be impossible to retain. You got a PhD, you're highly specialized. Even if you say to the company ""I'll be totally happy in your role"", they know it's BS. They know you'll be out the door the second you get an offer that's relevant to your PhD.That same idea applies to you. You have 10 YOE. You can claim you'll be happy with junior roles, and low end salaries, but companies know that's total BS and you'll quit the moment you get a Senior role with a Senior salary lined up. Even if it's the truth, from the company's perspective, they're not going to believe it for a second, and you'll fall into the ""impossible to retain"" category. No company will hire someone they don't think they can retain.All of that said, you can absolutely be a 10+ YOE dev and be part of the team, and code regularly. Most of us do. A Senior SWE is still an IC. A Staff SWE, and a Principal SWE, are still IC's. They still code every day, they're still an active contributing member of the engineering team, their responsibilities just get zoomed out a bit. Instead of looking at things at the single-Jira-ticket level, they might be thinking at the epic-level, or the quarterly-deliverables-level, or the company-wide-architecture-level. You're still extremely technical, you're not a manager. Plenty of people stay an IC their entire career, and you can too.But your problem is you're trying to stay on the IC-route, but aren't actually evolving beyond a junior/mid-level in terms of skills/contribution. So that makes you a very, very, very expensive developer that doesn't deliver on their price tag. And because of the aforementioned issue, companies aren't just going to continue paying you junior level salaries when you're carrying with you 10+ YOE.You need to dive into the deep end, and apply for Senior+ level roles. If you can convince a company you're ready for that role, even if you don't feel like you are, that's how you'll set yourself up for the next 20 years of your career. If you don't do that, you'll find yourself struggling a lot, and you'll claim ""age-ism"", but it's very much about your career path, not about your age.",SouredRamen,2025-05-27 15:49:26,72,cscareerquestions,t3_1kwq4ml,False,

muf3c4u,"tl:dr: I'm a full stack dev who is about to get laid off. I've worked at one company for 7 years, and that's the extent of my industry experience. Assuming work is going to be scarce, what other options are out there that i could look into with minimal or no need for additional training? Does that even exist? Trying to be realistic and proactive. Summary: I work on a team of developers for an enterprise company with a suite of proprietary web apps. All .NET/angular & nosql cloud architecture. I was promoted out of QA into development, but have not been given opportunity to progress, or mentorship, so I've had to learn everything on my own through hard won experience and the help of online coding communities. I only recently started using AI tools since I felt early on that it would limit my learning rather than improve it (honestly they only became strong enough to really help significantly in the last two years, anyway. I don't tend to work on stuff that an AI agent from 2022 could reproduce without errors or structural issues). I believe I may be about to be laid off, so I'm looking for advice on how to continue pursuing a career as a developer (aide from just trying to apply everywhere i can, obviously) - or, what adjacent options i could pivot into given I only have an Associates degree.The whole bloody story: I've been a junior web developer for 3 years. Before that I did two years as a QA Analyst and one year of help desk before that. All at this same company. The first year I spent as a developer, I spent a lot of time online doing courses like Pluralsite, MS Learn, OSSU, etc, so I was learning, but in my day-to-day I wasn't being allowed to work on modern infrastructure the rest of the team was working on. Instead, I was made responsible for maintaining a 20 year old piece of software primarily operating on old mvc and web forms. This was mainly to free up the other developers (who are all seniors) to work on the ""important"" projects. So I was spending 8 hours a day on bad examples and barely-functional software, while on my own time trying to learn javascript, .net, c#, angular, react, my sql, rxjs, etc. I have pretty severe ADHD that I'm on medication for... that didn't go well. They knew. I made a lot of mistakes, because it was difficult to apply what I was learning to what I was working on at work. When asked to create a proof of concept in modern architecture or refactor some complex logic, I would constantly be getting confused by outdated coding patterns and structural flaws vs newer stuff like onion and so on. I brought up multiple times that this was a problem and that it was impossible for me to learn anything this way with my disability, and was ignored. It was truly a ""sink or swim"" mentality. Eventually, I was taken off of development because they weren't seeing the improvement they wanted, and given qa tasks. For an entire year, I was not allowed to work on code and was entirely support. My title did not change. They moved me back into dev in 2024 as a ""last chance."" At first this went really well. People were shocked to see how much progress I'd made, because I WAS NOT IDLE during the intervening time. I'd still been studying and coding in my spare time while I was working on QA. I work for a company that has a suite of proprietary web apps used to track their assets, and most development is done in-house. I just helped them release a modern replacement for that 20 y/o flagship product, and being that it was just released, it has a lot of user stories coming in. As you might expect. Several other devs recently left, and all of their defects and user stories were reassigned to me. Because I'm taking the heat for all of these story points, and my performance is being called into question, I've been told-without-words that if I don't improve I'm going to be terminated. The company is young and scrappy, and they ""aren't interested in being a school"". I'm completely overloaded, sometimes literally working 80hrs a week just to keep up with the pace of seniors who have 20+ years of experience, and to be honest it's really starting to affect my health. Based on the way my coworkers are talking about and around me, I feel like it's going to happen soon (possibly this week).This company is hugely toxic (its one of those ""corporate family"" environments), and during this entire process I have never received a significant raise, so my compensation is still on par with a tester. I need to leave. I've needed to leave. But the job market is in the toilet due to the seemingly endless layoffs in our sector over the last years. With recent news from Microsoft, that doesn't seem likely to change. For what is worth: i do really enjoy the work. And my coworkers. But I'm absolutely killing myself over it. I routinely have anxiety attacks. The area i live in is expensive, and I'm not making it to payday as it is. In this economy, I'm looking for any advice on either how to continue pursuing a career in development... or how to pivot into something adjacent. I'm happy to move literally anywhere as we don't particularly like the northeast anyway. To be clear: I'm quite proud of where I'm at now, as far as my capability compared to where I started. I routinely work on tasks that would be out of question for a green junior and these days my code is much more structured and predictable. I have done a huge amount of skill acquisition in the last 3 years and I'm very confident in my abilities (with or without AI). My biggest detractor is my education status which stopped at Associates degree due to health and family issues. Thanks for reading. Any advice is appreciated. Good luck out there.",BookerPrime,2025-05-26 22:28:57,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1kvrs94,False,

The name probably has a leg up when it comes to recruiting, but the difference is small unless you work on something notable (in IS&T… you probably won’t).I got interviews at OpenAI, every other FAANG, Uber, etc etc and my Amazon experience was the focus of most discussions (mainly because it was most recent, but partly because it was more challenging work).In general, IS&T is a shitshow. Many contractors who, frankly, could not pull their weight. Apple is also frugal - despite, again, Amazon’s reputation here, Apple is pretty similar (low PTO, very few “freebies”, pays less than AMZN etc).

Disclaimer: Talking about the jobs I've had, I'm sure there are jobs where the programming is new / novel enough for that to be the main difficulty in the day-to-day work, but for me the times I've had to write truly hard code is rare, and almost always as a result of a poor architecture / up front decision. Most of the time the code does feel trivial to me.I've been programming so long that I can't even help new programmers all that much. I can mentor an eager junior or mid level, but my friend who wants to pick up programming and career switch I'm just so far removed from how I had to learn when I was 12 that I can't really empathize and my explanations would probably do more harm than good because I operate at a much higher level by default.",throwuptothrowaway,2025-05-23 20:00:06,15,cscareerquestions,t3_1kts6zr,False,

Don't think you should only work for pure tech companies. All sorts of companies hire developers. You have a gap since your graduation. It may make sense to take your graduation date off your resume. It's your call. Besides applying, studying a mix of LeetCode and practical skills. What do I mean by practical skills? Things you'd be doing on the job.* Do you understand how databases work? How familiar are you with SQL?* NoSQL?* Any cloud experience?* How good are your front-end vs back-end skills? Do you only know a language like PHP, or do you know languages that are more widely in use in corporate settings like Java, Python, JavaScript, React? * Can you build a basic CRUD app that uses REST API endpoints?* Are you familiar with Git? CI/CD pipelines?Those are a few things to get you started. I worked as a contractor at a large financial institution for a while. They were trying to fill some roles with people who graduated from a boot camp. 5/6 candidates could not answer extremely basic questions. I know everyone needs to live, but one guy said he had been driving Uber for a few months, and he seemed to have forgotten everything. The one person who was stronger ended up getting another offer elsewhere. While LeetCode has gotten more popular, there are still companies that don't use it. A challenge is finding a balance of what to study, etc. Some recruiters will tell you what their interview process is like, and others will not. A lot of people on this sub think that applying with what is effectively the same resume over and over will yield different results. Some people get lucky, but you should be trying to improve while you're looking. Otherwise, you're just someone who graduated and couldn't find a job. There are people with plenty of work experience who still don't know anything about cloud or NoSQL for example. There are tools and resources out there to become a stronger developer. It's been years since I graduated, but there's a lot of stuff that school doesn't teach you. One other thing, take any comments from the internet with a grain of salt. Looking through these comments, there's almost nothing of value in there. Remember the joke about most of this sub being unemployed students.

They can afford to be. A few years ago, the bar dropped quite a bit. There's also some argument for practical experience.

mug35yf,"English is my first language, but I learned Spanish well enough to present at tech conferences in Spanish, so I do have language learning experience.Regarding A1-A2 active vocabulary: you’ve gotta move a lot of stuff from passive to active vocabulary. Writing may be a good stepping stone to practice output without the time pressure of speaking. r/WriteStreakEN will give you daily corrections. You could even note in your posts that you want corrections that elevate your vocabulary.Also, if you have flash cards, work them in the “I need to produce English” direction. If you don’t have flash cards, maybe get started with some. I had 5000 words in my Spanish study list back when I was studying.Also: read. A LOT. Reading is huge for increasing a person’s vocabulary. Since English pronunciation and orthography are only loosely related, and we’re talking about learning new words, reading along to an audiobook may be wise to ensure you pick up the correct pronunciations.For specifically-tech stuff, watching conference talks might not be a bad idea; you can learn a lot of domain-specific vocabulary that way, and there are a ton on YouTube.Regarding filler words: spend at least one hour a week with a tutor doing conversation practice. If you can do an hour twice a week, even better. This is to get you practicing with the time pressure. As your vocabulary and production under time pressure improve, you’ll spend less time searching for words and trying to hide it with filler words. But also: are you using English filler words/sounds/phrases or ones from your first language? If first language, switch to English fillers. “That’s a really interesting question because well, you know, the thing is, when you consider all aspects of that topic…” is a nice long string of words that give you time to actually think of your answer without it just being “uhhhhh” or worse, a non-English filler like “eeehmmmmmm.”Regarding pronunciation: record yourself repeating after something you’ve just heard. Maybe you watch a technical video and pause and repeat back a sentence. Then play back the original and yourself and compare. You can do a fair bit of accent training this way. You can also hire tutors who specifically do accent coaching. If your native language has far fewer vowels than English (for example, Spanish has 5, and Italian has 7), then you will want to learn some new ones.

It was off by one on every function, because it does not understand anything and is just predicting the next token which breaks down when something goofy is asked for like in the assignment.

mtubap3,"I can empathise with you on some level. I'm also a SWE that works at big4 and constantly feel like i'm lost or not knowledgable enough. Early on, I also felt that I didn't get much mentorship and was just thrown into the deep end, asked to implement feature X, enhancement Y, or bugfix Z, in a huge codebase, with little guidance. Though, now I feel quite fortunate because I ended up learning a lot from those early experiences, a lot more than I think most devs early in their careers would.I also have felt the same way with AI, especially when it's crunch time and I need to really accelerate my output. Something that has helped me is treating it more like a search engine to find information I need, but I write the almost all the code myself. I really try to understand what it's telling me and will cross reference with other resources as well. This makes it so I really understand and know that I can backup the code I have written if i'm questioned during a PR. I also maintain a large personal document of just general CS concepts and fundementals; whenever I learn something new from AI (and confirmed it's correct), i'll add it to this document. So I kind of force myself to constantly learn and understand what i'm doing, while still reaping the benefit of AI.If you have been doing alright so far and it sounds like you spend a lot of time trying to improve outside of work, I feel like your feeling of being totally lost may largely be imposter syndrome. Sure AI can generate a lot of code, but you would still be reading and understanding it to ensure it is applicable for your situation and actually works. So I think you probably know more than you think. I also believe that completely cutting AI out would not be beneficial in the long term, because using it is a skill in itself, and is likely to just continue to get more important. Otherwise, it sounds like you're doing all the right things. Keep working on personal projects, use and learn technologies that interest you and that are in demand, and continue to challenge yourself with Leetcodes. You're still a grad (i'm assuming), you're not going to know everything straightaway and there will always be plenty more for you to learn.

mtw4tp4,"OP, listen to this advice. Don’t ask chat gpt how to write something for you. Try reading the documentation or looking at other code in the repo that does something similar and figure out why and how it works. After you write it, then ask chat gpt what it thinks or how it works but keep in mind it’s a probabilistic model so it could be wrong. Always double check with the documentation or look up articles by vetted sources that have written about the same piece of technology. It’ll give you way more insight.Technology is a huge field and there are so many layers as well as tools. I remember being a fresh new grad and even though I learned about the different components in computer systems and how memory is evicted out of ram and how different networking protocols handled communication. Getting my first internship all of that was so abstracted from me by the tools we were using that I felt like I had no idea why things were written the way they were or why we used certain tools.Take time to ask questions and learn the answers to those questions. Take notes and study them. Slowly it all starts coming together and years later you know exactly how the service or app you’re working on is leveraging the framework and language you’re using and working together with the os on the server or computer it runs on to do the things that it is doing. I will say this. I was overwhelmed at the beginning. I think most people are. I really enjoyed being able to build something by just writing some code. But it was extremely frustrating at times and sometimes I wondered if I was in the wrong profession. It took me finding out it was really rewarding knowing so much of how things worked to find passion in my career and stick with it.",ladidadi82,2025-05-23 19:48:32,2,cscareerquestions,t1_mtubap3,False,

This career doesn't have much stability and finding a good fit can be really hard.Additionally, my experience has been that people who stay with the same employer for long periods of time (5+ years) tend to have less varied/useful amounts of experience and will not generally have as versatile (or up-to-date) a skillset as someone who has had 3 different jobs in the same amount of time.There's definitely a lower limit though, a career that's only multiple years of 6 month contracts/employers, for example, does not look great to anyone, as it appears to signal that the employee can't ever meet expectations well enough to stay on anywhere.",SanityAsymptote,2025-05-28 16:36:16,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1kxh0ew,False,

mtwa4cj,"Data science is hard to break into without a masters or PhD and several years of experience in a data science role, so an offer for a data science role early in your career offers to jump start that process and makes future options easier and salary negotiations easier. If you’re at all interested in Data Science I would strongly consider that offer. If not then I would generally just focus elsewhere - Data Science doesn’t really work as a fallback plan or a 2nd option without a lot of school or a lot of experience. I wouldn’t consider internships unless they build significant skills or significant inroads at a company you want connections with. You’re trying to establish your career at this point so an internship is just a lower paid lower commitment job - it needs to offer enough to balance that out. That leaves the 2 backend offers and the SRE job in consideration if you discard the Data Science role. SRE is a bit more specialized - you won’t build those skills incidentally, it needs to be intentional. It pays well and is in demand, so if you enjoy it it’s not a bad place to focus your efforts. Backend Engineering roles are good general roles and hard to fault, but they don’t build a specific specialty either. Nothing wrong with just building general experience to start though. Id consider the SRE or DS roles if those fields specifically interest you. If a specific niche or field doesn’t feel right then just take a backend role and take the XP for a pivot later. I wouldn’t take the internship unless there’s a serious upside on the other side of it. Don’t take the opportunity for SRE or DS experience for granted though - it’s easier to get it early in your career. Later on you might have to contemplate a salary cut if you’re weighing mid / senior level vs having to step backwards to DS I. It’s hard to apply for DS II / Sr roles without experience in those roles, especially on a Bachelors, so the opportunity to get that experience is valuable if you have it (same for SRE).",Imoa,2025-05-23 20:15:18,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1ktrop2,False,
