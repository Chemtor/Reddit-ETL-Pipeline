It says that everything in the table should be about the *whole* key, not just a piece of it.* **Rule:** Be in 1NF and have no partial dependencies. This means that all the information in a row must depend on the entire primary key.* **Example:** Imagine a table for pizza orders. The key is the `Customer` and the `Pizza Type`.**Messy (Not 2NF):** | Customer | Pizza Type | Customer's Favorite Topping | | :------- | :--------- | :-------------------------- | | Sam | Pepperoni | Olives | | Mia | Cheese | Pineapple | | Sam | Veggie | Olives |The problem here is that the ""Favorite Topping"" is only about the `Customer`, not what kind of pizza they ordered that day.

Imagine what that table looks like, every time person A sees a doctor, you're writing to the database all the data about Person A, their name, their age, their gender etc. so if person A has 100 encounters, you're storing their gender 100 times. Same with the doctor. Every time the doctor sees a patient, if you store all the data about the doctor, you're storing their name every time. In addition to being very inefficient from a space perspective, it's harder to modify data later. Let's assume the doctor changes their name.

A company may become ""data mature"" or ""data driven"" by converting this byproduct into a core loop of the business, in fact even its moat, but no one starts a company with ""data driven"". When you're starting a company, you can build software that will become your moat, but you can't ""build data"".

It’s possible that the offshore resources will be entirely replaced with AI coding.

If this starts to become the trend, then you’ll no longer need to keep up with mastering what language or platform is the yearly favorite and focus more on implementing value - how to ensure AI assisted code generation is working successfully at your company. This would be a very interesting and disruptive time to be a data professional!

Keep in mind, if managers want to do this, they will have no issue finding offshore bodies to fill roles.So - as an onshore senior/lead Im happy I’m deep into a business domain (subject matter expert) and would be needed for more then my coding skills. If you are worried about this scenario you might start by asking how you can fit into this paradigm. If a company won’t hire you because you are not a 10 year expert on an acronym that was invented 2 months ago - then can you fit into a leadership/guidance position to enable “hot swappable” developers? I point back to the other comment in this thread - do you know Kimball? Do you know business processes, business data, and how to mature raw data into actionable insights which can reduce cost and increase revenue? If the answer is yes, you will likely be ok.

You can definitely learn to code in those but reviewing, refactoring, and optimizing takes a lot of on the job experience to do well.

A couple more angles from the Python side:* If your XML parsing logic is already in Python, you don’t *have* to switch over to Spark right away.

That way you can keep things Pythonic while still scaling to millions of files.* For cloud vs local: prototype on your laptop with Dask, then move the same workflow to the cloud when you hit limits. Tools like coiled make that spin-up pretty painless if you don’t want to manage the infra yourself. Worth noting coiled has other non-Dask APIs that might work well for scaling out arbitrary Python code (like their batch jobs api)So I’d say: if your pipeline is mostly parsing Python → Parquet, Dask can be lighter-weight than Spark.

nfkjucp,"Looking briefly at it as I'm working currently, its definitely a good idea and something I think the Open Source market is underfocused on. I see plenty of code based ETL orchastration (Dagster, Airflow etc) but less GUI options unless I'm missing something key. The issue I have there is that for bigger places, code based works fine, they can have dedicated DE teams but smaller businesses and onw man band operations definitely get a benefit from simpler to use GUI based tools. I know at one point this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for.One thing I'd suggest is trying to avoid a fixed requirement on docker containers or having a sprawl of dozens of individual components needing to run in tandem again for the smaller places/one man bands. They might not have capabilities to run Docker (IT blocking etc) and if the alternative is 15+ individual components all needing to be run at once then it'll be overwhelming.Your package avoids this currently so definitely worth sticking to that in my view. Outside of that some way to choose the destination DB engine would be good, Postgres is great and all but again smaller teams/OMBs might not get a choice and might be required to use MSSQL server or Oracle, or even just have a section within a larger warehouse like Teradata/Snowflake/Databricks that they get to use for operations.

I have asked my dba about version control and git. He said that he never needed it before and that if I want something on git then that’s my job. In all fairness the few times I have used ssis at work, I have it a shot initially when he asked me to, I put the packages in my own GitHub repo. Not it’s good that I have a version but I brought up that that’s just my copy from dev. I can’t see what’s on production. I’m not saying that I want or need production level access but I’d a real pipeline where there is some tangible proof that my dev package went to production aside from him saying he copied it to production. It would also be great for him in case something goes wrong with a new update then he can roll a package back to the previous working version.Overall I get your point and it’s valid and I know I get sucked up in the python vs ssis argument because that’s what started everything and I’ve felt that my dba outright didn’t listen to some of my concerns because I wasn’t doing things his way.

nfbt5qd,"Better observability and pipeline monitoring. Often pipelines fail and there isn’t any notifications on the ssis end to let me know. Recently I was told that he does allow me to use an smtp server to notify myself of failures. This is true and I only have one counter to it right now and that he doesn’t use the emails for the the packages he has built in the past that my team relies on so often I am stuck trouble with stakeholders emailing me because he doesn’t let me know that something went wrong on his end. This brings my next point.Better data practices. You could say that I could do this with SSIS and I could if I had the opportunity to but it’s not my environment and the dba will not let me try anything different in his environment. I want to standardize things like ci/cd and proper data pipeline monitoring as well as documentation. From my point of view it seems easier to do so with a tool that aligns better with my skill set and the skill set of my team if I cannot change anything in SSIS environment. I mentioned in another comment that the dba didn’t go for implementing ci/cd in his environment.Shorter product delivery times. This isn’t really because of ssis vs python. I could make an arguement like that but I know that that is subjective. This is more about man power and ease of deployment. There are more coders in my agency than gui developers and the business units are required to build their own data pipelines (dba words because he said that he doesn’t have enough staff who know ssis to support the business units. He only got two new people in the last few months and they aren’t trained.) from my point of view leaning into a coding based orchestration tool or a coding solution in general will alllow the business units to really build their own data pipelines efficiently and then IT and the dba can just manage production which is what he seems to want anyway. I guess I’m saying this will play to changing skillset of employees and allow the organization to develop faster as a whole instead of business units feeling frustrated by a slow IT.Technical debt. This one is tricky because I can see both the IT setup as technical debt and mine. My team is technically acting like a shadow IT in some ways and that always resulting in technical debt. However the dba is on an outdated SSIS. By that I mean he still uses msdb and hasn’t upgraded to ssisdb which would at least allow for basic version control. Additionally as I said, he doesn’t really have anyone who knows ssis well on his team and therefore if he leaves one day my organization is in a pickle. He can say similar for what I want to do but I am documenting everything I’m doing so there is at least that. Also I am training and have already trained people on my entire environment in case I leave. I do know that this point is probably the most debate point that I am making however. Overall I’m saying that if we move to a more modern setup that fits better with the skillset of those in and outside of the agency (outside matters since they are required to build their own data pipeline) then I think we can eventually get off ssis completely and overall have a more manageable system that more people are familiar with.I typed this up very quickly so it may not be the most clear response.",lilde1297,2025-09-20 23:02:56,1,dataengineering,t1_nezlx34,True,

Google also offers GCP and AWS has Redshift (not recommended). One other you might want to look at is Motherduck, which is quite a bit cheaper than some of the others. You could also go the postgres route as those are fairly cheap on a number of clouds, but aren't optimized for analytics workloads though they are usable for smaller scale warehouses.The database is the core, but then you need to figure out how to ingest the data from your source platforms to the warehouse and transform the data into table structures that support your reporting needs. Again, there are a multitude of patterns and tools available. A lot of companies with basic installs are using Fivetran or Airbyte to ingest the data and dbt to transform it.

Under the hood, NumPy typically uses C-level memory management (`malloc`/`free` or aligned variants) from the system runtime, though it also supports custom allocators.In contrast, I expect stampdb to have lower overhead since it uses a straightforward C++ `std::vector` for memory management. By default, `std::vector` relies on the C++ allocator API, which eventually ends up at `malloc`/`free` as well. Our current plan is to provide only the thinnest wrapper around the C++ core.

nf0ibqw,"So, are you doing this locally or on PowerBI service on the cloud?Personally, we started there, and then started working on a data warehouse so we had the data centralised, updated regularly and with a single place to find it, every report gets the same result. But, it's a massive investment, and 3 years in we're still working on adding components that our manager estimated we'd have done in the first 6 months.If you don't need that, its good, but get documentation of your code, your sql tables, try and centralise into a single semantic model if you can (short of data warehousing). But the one thing that we keep running into with people creating their own dashboards is that they change the queries, they're no longer performant, take forever, use more resources, and they're reloading and recalculating the same details x 10 different queries in a power bi dashboard x 10 dashboards.So, consolidation - if you can at least run the data out to a table, and then have any dashboards read from that table, then you'll be saving yourself.Try to source control your dashboards.If you're using PBI online, if you can use things like datasets, that centralise the data, go for it.Stored Procedures may give you more centralised control, semantic models are more or less exactly what you're creating in PowerBI anyway (source -> dim/fact tables + relationships + measures).Creating a centralised semantic model/warehouse that has all of your tables and data in one place, that you write your code and measures and everything once will definitely allow you to reuse it multiple times and is a big win.",-crucible-,2025-09-19 04:05:29,3,dataengineering,t3_1nksner,False,

I’m coming from a DBA/SSIS/sql-heavy background though, and those approaching from a more software engineering background will likely recommend different approaches based on their favorite tech stack and their CI/CD and version control preferences.I’m not a big fan of text-to-sql or promptql-style approaches mainly because I feel like that’s something that should be more for data exploration and presented to the end user rather than a way to streamline your reporting pipeline - all my opinion though, I just don’t like that added layer of abstraction from data when I’m thinking about robust data processes.",dgwyr,2025-09-19 16:51:52,1,dataengineering,t3_1nksner,False,

neu90h0,"As to advantages:Some very useful features become much easier if you have multi-table transactions / true ACID compliance. Sure, not all use cases need those. But when you want them, they're very useful indeed. To begin with, without multi-table transactions, to try to emulate them, you end up implementing compensating transactions:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transactionWhich are difficult to get right, are eventually consistent (meaning, in the interim the inconsistent state is visible, and no guarantee on how fast your comlensating transaction will succeed, and generally just are a pain. They don't add value or spark joy. There are also other features that are a lot easier to add to an engine once you have full ACID support. For example, zero copy cloning a table - the copies can be modified independently, without data duplication for the shared parts:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/tutorial-clone-table-portalOr having a transactionally consistent snapshot across tables, instead of trying to use Delta time travel to achieve it:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/warehouse-snapshotIsolation wise, we get true snapshot isolation within the engine - queries via the Warehouse either see changes in no tables or all. The individual logs aren't written perfectly simultaneously though, so Delta log consumers benefit from that less, but still some - can see some parts of a multi-table committed transactions sooner maybe, but is guaranteed it's part of a committed transaction, not potentially part of an emulated multi table transaction that failed and will have a compensating transaction trying to cover it up sometime later.Performance, we can potentially batch up multiple transactions into a Delta log entry. We have a nice fast transaction log, instead of relatively slow block blob storage operations being required on every individual commit.Locking, iirc, mostly the same - could maybe support pessimistic locking though, which iirc Delta can't.

Your API integration experience is actually really relevant since data engineers spend a lot of time building ETL pipelines that pull from various sources.

Disable Offline Files on the share and use wired only.

Check for cascade deletes and filters that might hide “missing” rows.\- Better: move the backend to SQL Server Express or Postgres on a small VM, link via ODBC so Access keeps working.

Write each user into SEPARATE ordered extents into S3.Step 3: Run a single historical spark job to rewrite the data into historical logs for each user in the order the tables were designed in. Select where id > 0 && id < step1.table_id_seq. Upload those to each users extents.All queries are now embarrassingly parallel, and you control the data, not Snowflake.If you are under 100TB you can do this in under a week with a handful of spot instances, S3 and just one engineer (yourself).These cloud vendors are literally selling shuffle debt as a service due to SQL destroying physical locality at ingest.

So here would be the steps:- Tell the AI of your choice to write some small application.

I wager it could say things like: “So, the AI said it wrote X using Y method. Whaaaaaat is happening - I better check the documentation for Y.

neve673,"I will go in the exact opposite direction if some comments here: This is a tough question to answer, because it doesn't really matter. I mean, languages are cool and all, but learning a new programming language really is not that hard, once you already know how to program. You can learn any language similar to the ones you already know in a week. The more important question is: What kind of project structure, architecture and patterns do you learn. If you are going for ""applications and tools"", that can also mean many things. GUI or no, Desktop or mobile, which target audience does it have, what should it do? If you want to be the most versatile, able to learn ""anything(TM)"" that might come up in a few weeks time, I would suggest having experience in at least one project / language out of all of the following categories (and each project must have a minimum complexity to ""count""): \- 1 web based frontend. Can be pure html/css/minimal JS, or be fully based on a JS framework. maybe a homepage for a simple business, without a shop, like a bakery or a hair salon. \- 1 non-web based frontend. A C# GUI in windows, a Java App on Android, a Swift UI on iOS or a QT-App in any language you want, it doesn't matter much. Probably a complexity between a calculator and a calendar would be good. Games work, but are normally structured differently, do I would advise against using a game engine unless you want to stick with gaming. \- 1 complex application, written in a low level language, optimized for speed. A raytracer is the classical option, because it has good visual feedback, but a compiler, OS parts or a real time embedded component can all work. Suitable languages are C, C++ and rust. A compiler has the additional benefit of teaching you more about programming languages in general.\- 1-2 APIs. It is great if you have both written a REST (or similar) API, accessible through the web (in theory, you don't need to deploy) as well as a library, that exposes a C-standard API for use from other programs. They are pretty similar in conception, but quite a bit different in practice, and understanding how both of these actually work, can be hugely helpful, even if you are only using them, and never have to build them again! You should 100% have experience in one Object Oriented language. The best options are Java and C#. OOP (or some half hearted attempt at OOP) is still the standard in most industries. Additionally, you should be comfortable in a language, suitable for scripting. Python and JavaScript, but also Bash are all options with different advantages. You need to know at least one. I think everyone can learn something from trying something completely different, so you should have done one project in a completely functional language. Haskell is my favourite, but F# and Clojure are also options. You will have to re-learn to think about programming, which is exactly the point of the exercise, not to use this exact language again in production.

You will learn as you go, that is just the nature of the field. The knowledge snowballs, yes, but getting a new project, having no idea how to complete it, and having the skill to research and teach yourself is THE most important skill you can take away from formal CS education.AI is a research accerator and a peer programmer in your pocket. My employer recently started expecting us to start using AI like we've been using IDEs -- a core tool to speed and supercharge our development. So start/continue using AI as your coding partner and a research aid. Don't vibe code - hell no - but anything you'd search the internet to know, ask AI first, then dig a little deeper, fact check it - its the faster version of digging through stack overflow and stack exchange and reddit to cross reference the collective knowledge, right? And have AI write code, do a peer review, build on what it writes, feed it back in - go back and forth with it, like you would peer programming. Use it to bounce ideas around and fill the gaps in your knowledge. If you rock up to an interview with the skill of knowing how to utilize AI effectively in your development, then you WILL be the most attractive candidate, because, honestly, a lot of experienced devs are behind the curve figuring it out and we're feeling the heat from our employers with all their crazy high hopes for AI.If you like web dev, there are still plenty of jobs out there, even if the job landscape has thinned out and changed in the last 5-10 years. But also be open to try anything - I NEVER thought I'd end up a web dev, I didn't do well in those courses in school so I thought it was the LAST thing I'd ever do, but I'm SO GLAD I gave it a chance and I ended up liking it so much more than I'd ever thought I would.Also, I got lucky: I was a year and a half out of school and struggling to get an interview for junior roles and was kicking myself for not trying to get an internship the minute I graduated. Some internships will accept you shortly after graduation, but most won't accept you more than a year out. But when I reached out to a connection about a junior role at their company, their company countered by offering me an internship which turned into a full-time offer and I've been there nearly 3 years now. So 1) If you want workplace experience after graduation, definitely don't give up on internships (plural, even if you finish one, don't assume its gotta be one and done); post-grad internships are out there and experience is experience and employers love demanding 2-3y of experience from new grads and junior devs for some crazy reason. 2) Build your connections, reach out to your connections, never stop making them even after you land a job; they don't stress that enough in school, hell it probably should be it's own course its that important.",elanestra,2025-09-19 04:54:46,2,learnprogramming,t3_1nk1wan,False,

So for these languages a lot of it is just learning slightly different syntax for the same thing, and learning to navigate a differently structured standard library.Then you occasionally hit concepts that is completely different and nothing like what is in the others. going from languages with implicit memory management to one where the programmer has to do explicit memory allocation and de-allocation for instance is a pretty big leap. In the languages you listed c++ is probably the hardest language to learn weather you learn it, first, second or fifth.And then you have languages which are just different. Javascirpt has prototype inheritance, yes even the modern versions with a class keyword still don't work the way you would expect them to. Really Javascript is a Lisp with C like syntax, and it works best if you treat it as such and write functional rather than object oriented code.

nfkx4oe,"What the other commenter said. ""Efficiency"" like you describe is what managers see to juggle scrum points and velocity. It's a useless metric for actually working on code.Imagine programming as a gigantic space of possibilities. You're searching for positions (programs) in that space that fulfil certain functional (the thing the program should do) and usually some non-functional requirements (memory/time constraints, being readable and maintainable). There's not one solution but many, but they are far out (as far as lines you need to write to get there). Each line you write gets you closer to some solutions and farther from others.Unless you have decades of experience and the program is quite small, it's usually not possible to just ""see"" a good solution and write it down in one go. You need to iterate on it, write parts of it you know will likely be part of a good solution. And even identifying those is lots of experience. Often you'll have to rewrite parts to make it work.The first running prototype is usually garbage because it shows the meandering path you took to get there. Restructuring and cleaning up your solution is still expected when you work on large programs, so that the overall commit history doesn't look like a rabbit on acid typed it. This is something that is discussed in professional settings as well. If coders think refactorings are necessary, who will pay for them? Some teams just silently do them as part of other tasks, others try to communicate the need to higher ups.> I've tried the Algorithmic thinking tip from the FAQ to help me plan the processes, but I don't notice classes and objects immediatelyThat part of the FAQ is not for planning programs.

nfdwzo3,"There's a concept called the Entity Component System model, or ECS which solves this issue in a way that also makes writing high performance code much easier. The idea is that instead of having discrete classes for different kinds of creatures, items, or other game entities with all sorts of complex logic attached to them, you create simple data structure called an entity. An entity is usually nothing more than some kind of ID value, like an integer, UUID, or even a string. You then ""attach"" additional small components to that entity which give it additional properties. It's these components that hold the data that would have been held in the class. So the `hasHealth` component would hold maybe 2 numbers, max health and current health. All of the logic for the various components is handled by a set of ""system"" classes. Their job is to handle the logic associated with the various components. For example, the health system would handle adding or removing health on entities with a health component.Typically the way ECS are written let you query the world for entities with specific components (or the components of an entity and such), or sometimes more complex conditions like ""has components x y and z, but not a"". This query then will find the components that match and produce a list of entries which can then be processed by the system.This is probably complete overkill for what you're doing, but it's becoming a very popular way to write games. It gets rid of the awkward problems that come from a more object oriented approach, and completely strips all dependencies between components and entities. This allows you to build up unique entities simply by combining different discrete components. Of course, for unique interactions you would occasionally still need to make 1-off components, but a *lot* can be done with only a small collection of basic components when you can freely mix and match everything, and implementing new kind of entities is often just a matter of figuring out what components they need.This roguelike tutorial in Rust does a great job of explaining/teaching how you might use an ECS in a roguelike game: https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/chapter_2.htmlRoguebasin has a very basic Python implementation of an ECS: https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Entity_Component_SystemThere's a ton more information on ECS out there, this was just meant to give you a very very rough idea of the overall concept. There are quite a few ECS libraries out there in a whole ton of languages, but it's not that difficult to write your own either (at least as long as your not trying to squeeze every bit of performance out of it).Here are a couple blog posts that explain ECS and implement one:C++ - https://www.codingwiththomas.com/blog/an-entity-component-system-from-scratchC++ - https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/C# - https://matthall.codes/blog/ecs/Here's an ECS FAQ: https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq?tab=readme-ov-file",Bobbias,2025-09-21 08:23:15,24,learnprogramming,t3_1nml899,False,

Nowadays this topic is often called ""serialization"" i.e. turning some abstract data representation into a serial stream of data, and back again.Just as one example, look at how the [""Protocol Buffers""](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/) binary encoding format works. It defines a general-purpose way to describe ""messages"" in terms of their fields, and each field's type determines how it is encoded, in such a way that you can always tell where one field ends and another begins.It uses the same ""length prefix"" approach that you'll see in a lot of other formats, but it also uses a variable-length encoding trick for integers, which means that small integers take up less space than large ones. This applies to the data itself, but also to the type/length metadata.Reusing an off-the-shelf encoding format like Protobuf will save you a lot of tedious manual work.Or if your goal is just to obscure the data from casual viewing with a text editor, you can just do something even simpler and compress your JSON representation using something like gzip.

As you are trying to create your own format you'll have to make something up yourself. There are catalogues of already taken magic numbers online.Then goes header. On offsets from the beginning of the file specified by the format specification there are several numbers telling information about the file: time of creation, modification, size, etc. For example, if you specified that bytes from 16th to 24th will mean time of last modification, you take amount of milliseconds since UNIX timestamp (start of 1970), transform it into a 64-bit integer and write into these bytes.One way to add arbitrary data to your file is to add the list of offsets. Say on predefined position of 32th to 40th byte you write the offset to the first bit of an array of entries in your binary file. Computer follows this offset, where you write, in sequence, offset to next array if it exists (or 0 if it doesn't), amount of offsets to various elements in this array, and then list offsets, each is a 64-bit number. Now the reader can read and save them. By following these offsets, it may find your data. Data entry may look like an integer specifying length of a string or array and then bytes of this data.",Qwert-4,2025-09-18 00:40:47,2,learnprogramming,t3_1njsucu,False,

Since u are already halfway through this bootcamp program, I personally think u should finish it.Put AI out of your mind for now. Some people may not be able to afford using AI for many years. Since there are conflicting views of how advanced AI is now and how quickly it can learn and develop much further, I wouldn't stop learning just in case the idea that AI will take over everything in 5 years is wrong.Besides, there is not enough fresh water in most countries for the water needs of AI facilities in addition to supporting humanity. That may slow things down. Since the facilities need more land area but also cool temperatures, why can't they be built at least partially underground to conserve both land and water?Perhaps u could focus on building things that would help build up city services or get things modernized for underdeveloped areas.I understand that everyone wants to make lots of money, but since u have found a full-time job already, u have set yourself on a good path to make a life u want. Maybe your idea for using IT could help u work with non-profits and places that can't pay hundreds of thousands up front, but that u can help because u want to serve the public.

Case in point, my entire cycle has been spent refactoring something that was written in January (I'm guessing with AI tools) that is beginning to break in subtle ways.Though the job has undoubtably changed with these new tools at our disposal, I think there will continue to be software engineers for the foreseeable future.

Hell, when I’ve tried to make a script to teach a topic, I’ve found the code suggestions to be exactly what I was going to write for my tutorial/guide. Amazing! For really basic, cursory stuff. Stuff that you’d find on a blog or YouTube video where you have to assume the viewer knows next to nothing and will stay for 5 minutes.Anything more complicated than that, and AI breaks down. Writes way more code than you need to solve a problem, solves the wrong problem, solves the right problem in the wrong way. It’s important to be concerned about it in the “I should know about this” sense. It’s currently not important to be concerned about it in the “this is going to change my whole career trajectory” sense.At present, AI is really just a better version of intellisense, the automatic code completion. Serves the same function, and that tech has been around for a decade.You can never hurt yourself by having more skills. Stick with it, but I think it’s important to have a source of intrinsic motivation: some project you want to do for you.

nfovzv1,"Repositories are self-contained dependency trees of commits. Every repository has an index or staging area which is where you add the changes that you intend to commit eventually. The staging area acts as a temporary safe space that is not a full commit and to which you can restore your tracked files if for some reason you aren't happy with the latest changes, and the changes saved to the staging area can also be restored. When you make a commit, only the changes tracked in the staging area are used.Commits in a repository are uniquely identified by hashes, which look like long strings of random characters that are in fact generated from all the information that they save. Commits contain the hashes of their immediate ancestors, the differences in the code between them and their immediate ancestors, the names and E-mail addresses of their authors, a timestamp, a message explaining what they change and why so that other people in the future can gain a deeper understanding of why specific changes were made, and optionally a digital signature to reinforce their authenticity. Commits represent snapshots of branch states at specific times.Since commit hashes aren't easy to remember, git provides the ability to tag them with more remarkable names. Tags are often used to record milestones, like the official version of a project at that point, but they can be used for anything you want, and can always have descriptions independent of their respective commit messages.Branches represent distinct and possibly concurrent development paths, and every git repository has at least one conventionally named main these days or master in the past, however branches can have arbitrary names. Branches are simply alternative HEAD pointers, you can create a branch from any commit in the repository, which will result in its HEAD pointing at that commit, and after that every commit you make to that branch will have the original commit of the branch as an ancestor in its history. Branches are typically used to avoid cluttering the main history of the project with irrelevant versioning information related to refactoring, bug fixing, feature development, or even to continue developing old versions of the same project concurrently to the main branch.Remotes provide the ability to name external repositories, and are intended to synchronize with the work done by other developers. Each branch can also track a single branch on a remote repository, which is typically used to synchronize with an upstream source of truth, and doesn't really need to have the same name as the local branch. Pushing to a remote branch attempts to append your changes in a local branch to the remote branch, whereas pulling attempts to append the remote changes of the remote branch to your local branch. If this succeeds then the resulting trivial merge is called a fast forward, otherwise you will be required to resolve the conflicts before the local and remote repositories can be synchronized. The HEAD of a tracked remote branch is pointed at by REMOTE_HEADMerging is a process in which two divergent branches, both local or one local and one remote, are synchronized by a commit that addresses all the conflicts. Since only local branches can be written to, the merge commit is always created locally. After a merge all the concurrent commits are added to the history of the local branch, which can make the commit history rather confusing to understand. A different option to merging is rebasing, where all the divergent changes in one of the branches are added on top of the other branch, but this too can mess up the commit history, because if both branches have been getting concurrent commits, the timestamps in the resulting history where all the commits to one branch are logically applied after all the commits to the other branch will result in a history of commits that are not progressive over time, so git also provides the ability to squash commits, which can be used to coalesce a range of commits.Reverting is the process in which the changes made by one or more commits are applied in reverse to a branch, effectively resulting in those changes being removed from the code. Reverting commits does not alter the commit history of a branch, instead a new revert commit is created specifically to remove the changes, at which point the author of the reverse is given a chance to address any conflicts that might prevent the operation. Switching is a process in which git is instructed to go back to any commit in the repository. If the switch is made to a branch then the local files will be updated to the HEAD commit of the branch, otherwise the switch is considered headless and no commits can be made until a branch is created to track them. Resetting moves the HEAD of a branch to any commit on the repository, which can result in some commits becoming unreachable and eventually garbage collected.Stashing is the concept of committing your changes to a local commit tracker and restoring everything to how it was in the previous commit. Stashes are global and as such are completely independent of branches.Other concepts like pull requests, forks, and releases are specific to GitHub. Pull requests are just regular posts to a repository linking to a branch on your own repository whose changes you would like to get merged with the remote repository. Forks are just other developers cloning your repository under a new repository on their own account. Releases are essentially tags on steroids that you can use to provide ready-to-use builds of your project.Git is also quite versatile when it comes to rewriting history, however this is a fairly advanced subject that I'm not going to touch on here since it requires a good understanding of its fundamental concepts. Rewriting history can sometimes make commits unreachable from any branch, and These commits are kept around for a while but eventually git's garbage collector gets rid of them, however this grace period makes it possible to recover them, so even if you completely mess up a repository it's almost always possible to manually recover everything back during this period.Hopefully this comment covers all the basics with enough detail but without being overwhelming.",Fridux,2025-09-23 00:31:03,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nnyadm,False,

Since you have an Arduino, you could start with a simple programme that uses the Arduino to control an LED.Here are some things you can try in order:- Make the LED switch on after a second (a basic ""Hello World"")- Make the LED flash on and off (teaches loops)- Add a push switch to the circuit and have the switch cycle the LED between on and off states every time you push it. (teaches you events)- Use the push switch to turn a flashing LED on and off (combines events with loops)- Add multiple LEDs and build a binary counter from 0 to `n` (teaches `for` loops specifically)- Pushing the button resets the counter.- Add a second button that changes the behaviour of the LED (e.g. switches between flashing and counting; teaches functions/separation of behaviours).Everything you do with the LED, you can do with a servo, relay, transistor, or anything else that can be connected to a circuit.Once you've worked out how to control output with a button, you can think about using different kinds of input, like using a thermistor to react to a temperature change, or an LDR to react to light levels.",marrsd,2025-09-23 10:44:49,3,learnprogramming,t3_1nob8pb,False,

You hear a song enough and you can recognize it. We communicate with symbols and logic.

So a breakdown of an example you gave in another comment. -Program in C (language/format)-Seconds to minutes (formula)Even if you don’t know that 60s = 1 min by memory, you can find the formula and write it down. The C language will have a way to write the function, the variables and handle any printing or user interaction. That’s the part you gotta know or find out about the language beforehand (like rules or properties). The coding skill comes from being able to write down that broken logic into the computer code. So you gotta be familiar with the language and how it works. But in general terms you can do things for everything. Problems will sometimes have a full sentence to just say something is equal (the same) to another thing. You can usually simplify it into formulas or terms like: 3 bananas + 3 apples = 6 fruit. Instead of thinking “how pretty we can say something” in the language we’re thinking “how fast can we make a computer understand it”. I can say “I would like 6 of that delicious fruit, please good sir.” or I can say “6 fruit”. In logical terms they mean the same. “I would like” implies addition for me, which would different to “Here you go, some fruit…” which would mean a loss for me.

I'll try to answer each of your specific questions, as well as point you to reading material for each of those areas.>Based on my understanding, I have to `tsc` client and server since the browser and node can only read js.Let's talk about each of those two separately, starting with your client. You are correct that the browser can only read JS. However, since you're using Vite, one of its built-in features is that it will automatically transpile your TS to JS ([docs](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html#typescript)). Therefore, you don't need `tsc` to do that — and, therefore, you *should* have `""noEmit"": true` in your frontend `tsconfig.json`.Moving on to the server, Node.js recently added native support for executing TypeScript directly ([docs](https://nodejs.org/api/typescript.html)), so you *might* be able to use that. However, if your hosting provider uses an older version of Node.js that doesn't support that, then yes, you are correct that you'll need to use `tsc` to transpile your server code.>I had a hard time outputting a dist folder when I ran `watch:ts` because I had `""noEmit"": true` and `""emitDeclarationOnly"": true` in my tsconfig.json file.If you want to better understand each of the options in your `tsconfig.json`, I recommend [the official reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/). In general, official references for anything are always the most up-to-date, reliable, and comprehensive.>I get `Named export 'SupabaseClient' not found. The requested module '@supabase/supabase-js' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.` But my package.json has `""type"": ""module""`, and tsconfig has `""module"": ""ESNext"",` so why am I getting a commonJS error? Make sure to read the error message very carefully. It is not saying that *your* code is CommonJS; it's saying that the Supabase package is CommonJS, and as a result, named imports might not work. ([MDN source if you're not familiar with what a named import is](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#named_import))This is pretty easy to fix — since they don't want you using a named import, simply use a default import instead. If you want to understand why CommonJS modules might not support named imports, this is explained in [the Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#commonjs-namespaces).",abrahamguo,2025-09-20 22:22:35,2,learnprogramming,t3_1nma549,False,

nfbr4nx,"> Where can I read up on how the whole ecosystem works so I'm not running into one problem after another?...I don't want to follow a recipe but rather understand the chemistry behind certain types of food combinations.You've got a few things going on. We'll skip Typescript for now.All node.js projects are defined using a `package.json` file. This file's primary purpose is to allow you to define the structure of libraries or applications you write. If you ever publish an app or library to an external repository, such as npmjs.com, this file will be used by Node to work out which file bootstraps your code, what dependencies it requires, and so on.Usually, we aren't publishing packages, but we still use the `package.json` to manage dependencies, which are located in (and downloaded from) the npm repository by default.The `package.json` file is managed by the `npm` command. For example, `npm install` will install the dependencies listed in `package.json`. `npm run` will run any script defined in the `scripts` property. `npm test` will run your test suite, defined in the `scripts.test` property. See the [docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json) for a full breakdown of the file.Dependencies are installed to the `node_modules` directory.In the old days, modules were included in Node.js apps using a system called CommonJS, in which you export variables from modules by adding them as properties to an object called `exports` (e.g. `exports.bar = bar`). You could then import it with `var bar = require('./foo').bar;`. The path has to be relative for modules you define. For dependencies installed via npm, it would be `require('foo')` to load the module from `node_modules/foo`.The trouble with this approach is that you always had to import the entire module, even if you only needed one thing from it. If that same module is imported multiple times throughout the code, that's a lot of redundant duplication; so ES modules were invented to allow you to import/export specific vars and only those vars (e.g. `import { bar } from 'foo'`).This feature has to be enabled in Node.js before it will work. I don't recall if it's backwards compatible with CommonJS or not, but the error you reported above (*The requested module '@supabase/supabase-js' is a CommonJS module*) suggests that either it doesn't, or it doesn't by default.I expect there will be a supabase package that does support esm, or a package that provides Typescript bindings.Typescript is a language that compiles (transpiles) to Javascript and has its own additional syntax. It's described as a superset of Javascript, meaning that it should be able to read and understand JS, but I swear I've had issues running normal JS through the compiler in the past. Anyway, Node only speaks JS, so you have to run your TS through the `tsc` Typescript compiler first. In order to import dependencies into a TS programme, they must themselves either be TS, or be JS with TS bindings. These bindings are located in files with the extension `.d.ts`.Bindings exist for pretty much all popular dependencies now.I've not used Vite so I can't help you with that.Here's a simple config I wrote from scratch for an interview I had to prepare for recently (that never actually materialised). The expectation was to do a live coding interview using Typescript and a setup of my choice.

Each of these cells has a class called ""datavalue,"" and from that HTML file, you could write a script that grabs everything out of any cell with the ""datavalue"" class, so you end up with a text string of ""003F00502040003F00502040"".... (I assume that there are also rows with 00, 04 , etc.)The screenshot is a [hex editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_editor) of some kind -- I don't know which one but they basically all do the same thing: they open a file and let you directly see and edit the raw data. Right now you don't have the actual raw data, though, you have the text ""003F00502040003F00502040"" etc., so you'd have to convert that to the equivalent data file.

Doing `cin >> text` when `text` is a `std::string` just reads a single word, defined as a sequence of non-whitespace characters. The other words are left in the input buffer. So after first reading the word `""Going""`, then the next time you try to read an integer, the next word will be `""to""`, which can't be parsed as an integer, so it'll fail.

With QA/canary/code review/rollbacks etc and even if a mistake makes it to prod typically it’s fine and a learning experience. Whereas in a social setting first impressions are very important.

nf0pch8,"I mean literally every post on Reddit tells you this lol.Anyway, I was always a weird nerd, hung around nerds, shy non-popular guys etc. But because I was always great at sport and athletic I would hang around jocks and even gangsters so I learned how to get along with alot of different people.This is a big question so there's nowhere to start really but for Reddit I will say this, biggest killers for the guys here are the following: Introverted, self awareness and over-valuing intelligence. I can explain lol.1. Introverted: People use this as a self-built cage rather than just a label. It shouldn't even be a label the way this word has a mental hold on people on Reddit. Firstly, yes you can be naturally inclined toward introversion or extraversion, but there's caveats. Being introverted or extroverted doesn't neccessarily mean bad at social interaction versus good. I've seen plenty of extraverts who fucking suck at social situations and introverts who are great, they just prefer to be alone more often. You can be good at social skills and continue to carry your special little introvert label if you want, it's just going to be a little harder than if you were an extravert ***simply because you're getting in less reps.*** An extrovert will try and fail more = more chance for success. Also, you can switch between being introverted or extroverted, this isn't WoW where you can't cast a spell because you chose the paladin class. You're allowed to try being extroverted for a week, year, decade if you want.Like OP said it will feel weird at first, but ask any guy who got ripped from being fat if he felt like a natural in the gym the first day he picked up a weight. Nope, he worked through the pain and embarassment and got the reward. The good thing about social skills is that it doesn't even take that long, nor do you have to always be the social guy.. you can just learn the skills and keep it in your back pocket until you need it.2. Self awareness: Reddit copes alot by thinking that extraverts in engineering are just ""smooth talkers"" wrong. Smooth talking is a skill that comes with social skills, but it's not the whole pie. Some social people over-use smooth talking and get found out real quick and exposed, luckily here on Reddit we're all extremely intelligent and know what's best for the world so that won't be our issue... right?There's a negative connotation in engineering for having good social skills and confidence. I get laughed at by my friends for having ""good english"" and ""talking shit"".. like that's something to be embarassed about? In reality, I have great language skills to explain things to people of all levels, and I can basically nail down concepts into managable pieces for customers to understand without confusing them with jargon.. that's a skill that requires intelligence, humility and understanding concepts. Engineering isn't just about calculating numbers really fast, or memorising a fourier transform, we're here to sell products and create ideas. You NEED to be able to communicate those ideas or else the math and physics is lost in the void. What's the point of being able to create nuclear power if the government is scared of it and thus bans it because you can't explain to them why it's neccessary. 3. over-valuing intelligence: In the sense that people here like to min/max intel stats, that's great. More intelligence is always good, but again that's not a license for you to suck at conveying your ideas or to treat people like shit. Yes conceptually a team of really high intel nerds will be good for a company, but in reality we live in a market where we need to promote ideas and actually be able to understand from person to person. You can't do that by being very intelligent but a dick or can't explain your ideas to people in simple terms.",whathaveicontinued,2025-09-19 04:58:06,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1nkttp4,False,

nerk8w7,"The pattern you usually see is this: if someone comes from very humble beginnings with no networks, no capital, and no guidance, and still becomes wildly successful, there’s usually an incredible amount of luck involved. Like, you know, fortune striking them at just the right moments.Take Steve Jobs as an example. People often point out that he was poor, which is true, but he also got some extraordinary breaks that almost nobody gets. He met Wozniak, who happened to be a genius at building computers, at exactly the right time. Woz let Jobs run with the business side, they launched their first product, it took off immediately, and suddenly Jobs was financially independent. Apple went on an upward spiral so fast he never really saw any serious failure early in his life. That kind of alignment is rare.If you’re coming from very humble beginnings, you usually need multiple strokes of luck like that to become extremely successful. Getting to moderate success or financial independence is possible with hard work, but the billionaire-level outcomes are much harder without serious tailwinds.Finance and tech both show this in different ways. Finance is even more network-heavy. Running a fund is all about raising money, and raising money is basically a game of connections. Technology is also about contacts in the Valley when it comes to big fundraising rounds, but the barrier to entry can be lower.So if you’re poor, you can still make it, but you’ll need a lot of luck. Even if you claw your way up, the climb is steeper. No contacts, no capital, and no safety net mean it will take much longer to reach the same level as someone who started with connections.",StoicResearcher,2025-09-17 20:06:12,112,cscareerquestions,t3_1njiusd,False,

nfbftw1,"I've been on both sides of this. I started my career as an 'ambitious overachiever,' burned out hard, and then tried the 'maintain boundaries' approach. Here's what I learned. **As an Ambitious Overachiever:** From my personal experience, going above and beyond only **works if you're able to ""showcase"" your work.** That is, people in the company need to actively **see you as someone who goes ""above and beyond""** in order for it to matter. You should also make sure to **document your achievements and positive feedback** received so you can later present them to management when discussing raises, promotions, and so on. I would also say, though this is also another personal experience thing, that **going above and beyond in every category is both ineffective and leads to burnout.** It's better to **have one project which you own/lead and excel** **at** at a time, and do the ""regular"" amount of work on your other projects. In addition, it is important to build rapport. You don't have to be an extrovert per se, but **people should leave feeling positively after talking with you.** On the downside, **career progression** at any one company inherently **depends on how much room there is for promotion** and the budget of your department. Plus, overperformance makes you advance faster but rarely do you ever skip progression tiers. You may be a truly stellar, outstanding, junior engineer, but you won't get promoted to senior engineer immediately. You'll likely just spend one year less in junior, one year less in mid, and so on. It also only partially protects you from layoffs--**you'll be the last junior engineer laid off**, but if they're **laying off all junior engineers you're still gonna get laid off.**Something I learned the hard way is that no matter how much of a ""go above and beyond"" employee you are, **one period of poor performance**, even if do to extenuating circumstances, **can very quickly destroy your reputation** as an overperformer. If this happens, you should immediately look for a new job unless you really love your current workplace. I also found that **opportunities to truly excel can be difficult to find and sometimes even be gatekept.**It is important to remember that much of **your excellent performance will evaporate** when searching for a new job **unless you're able to show public artifacts** which showcase it. Maybe references can do this too, but you need to tell the new employer to actually contact them. I got laid off without any public artifacts to show off, and it made job searching ***much harder.*****Do great work but maintain boundaries approach:**I took this approach after burning out, though that burnout was partly due to a toxic coworker. I found it to be less stressful and often my outcomes became more consistent, which many employers value more than someone who does overall better work but in an inconsistent fashion. In general, it's only seen as a bad thing at (healthy) companies if it's the kinda role where overtime is inherently expected or a startup. How your work itself is recognized largely depends on your manager and how well they understand it. I'd say your manager's **subjective perception of your work matters far more than the actual work quality.****Advancement** felt like it **depended** more **on the state the economy**. Good economy, relatively normal advancement rate. Bad economy, slower advancement rate and layoffs. **Summary/takeaway:**Brute-force 'tryharding' is rarely worth the investment and often leads to burnout. If there's a project you can take ownership over, do that and make sure to 'show it off' like a salesman. Make sure to have evidence to support your skills for both internal promotions and getting jobs elsewhere. **Be an intelligent, strategic achiever who works to own and lead projects while building the skillset you want, rather than an overachiever for the company you work for.**",Luke_Ghostblade,2025-09-20 21:44:59,55,cscareerquestions,t3_1nm908c,False,

nfbln86,"More is more obviously, unless you're blatantly doing the wrong thing. The question should be more nuanced though- people (especially engineers) LOVE to microoptimize on a single variable when that isn't actually productive because our lives are multifaceted (e.g. either minmaxing saving money, or being a yolo spender). My practical recommendations are 2 things1) oscillate based on priority. Some projects are important, high-vis, high-impact and will leapfrog your career more than the rest of your work combined. Spending a bit more effort here pays dividends. Similarly, if you're close to a promo you care about, it's worth doing a bit extra. Rest of the time, it's okay to just do enough.2) understand the rubric better. Unlike school where assignments are graded 0-100%, work is very ambiguous. Understand who controls your career trajectory (usually your direct manager and maybe skip level), and optimize for success. Find ways to proactively make your manager's job easier, and make your manager look good to their management. This will do the most. One anecdote I've shared a few times: I grinded really hard when I joined this job, manager denied my promo again and again based on random nitpicks from career ladder doc. I eventually threw in the towel and said fuck it, that manager left, my new manager was chill and I kept sandbagging. I'd be responsive and helpful on shared projects, but I was also literally playing video games during the day (wfh). Despite all this, my new manager pretty soon put me up for promo successfully without me asking, and handwaved a bunch of career ladder ""requirements"".

nffepxg,"For anyone wanting a career in anything, it is very important to highlight your accomplishments for this very reason. Keep conversations up with your manager (ask for skip level 1v1s) to ensure you stay in communication so your manager can continue to gauge how you are doing vs. what your lead is saying. That then allows your manager to know how to work with the lead to make them a better leader as well. It is not being arrogant when you say I’ve worked on this and this and this and these are the outcomes. If you mess up, own it and say I learned my lesson and don’t do Y again. That goes a long way and gains lots of respect, which helps with stability.It doesn’t hurt to put feelers out there for other jobs, but each job has his own crap to deal with. I would evaluate the opportunities you have and get vs. this lead being a pain. This lead may not be here for forever either. If the lead is your only problem, do skip level 1v1s and go from there. Remember, everyone is learning. The lead, yes is being not a great lead, but likely it’s their first time being a leader and trying to figure it out and needs some guidance. Just like you when you first started. Try to highlight the wins with the lead too! Maybe that will get them thinking more positively as well. And maybe the lead is thinking of you as more senior than you are due to the work you are doing. So reminding them how young in your career you are can help.Regarding leaving the field, this is more of a corporate life issue than the field. I deal with this in cybersecurity (got a degree in compsci so why follow) too. You will run into these issues no matter what field you are in. Unfortunately school doesn’t teach you how to traverse corporate life. I say it sounds like you are doing a great job and have a lot of opportunities to grow. Do skip level 1v1s with your manager, communicate what work you are doing and the outcomes with both your lead and manager, and see what happens.

It's difficult to tell the difference between early career and experienced commenters, and good advice is often counter intuitive.

People complain about the rising popularity of full stack development. They say they refuse to learn frontend or backend because that will just lead to your employer expecting you to do two jobs. That's not true. Learning more skills will make you more efficient at your job, saving you time. It will also make you more competitive on the job market, meaning it will be easier for you to find a job with good WLB. There's more than enough dedicated frontend or backend work. If an employer is going to overwork you, they're going to do it regardless if you know full stack or not.Second is becoming more senior destroys your WLB. That's again not true. The things that destroy your WLB are getting a senior title before your ready and getting a senior title at a mismanaged company. Some people get thrust into a tech lead role 3 years into their career. These people are usually stressed AF because they don't have the experience to do it effectively, and the fact that they were promoted means the average level of experience is lower then theirs. That means they're going to be even more stressed trying to bail out all of the people on their team, because they also don't have the experience to do their jobs effectively. Don't try to avoid promotions.

That will be your next job application!Or at least, given the 85 or so companies I have worked for or with, that's how it's had to be. Anyone showing ideas above their station, well, you know yourself now what you get.Second, despite what most people would like to think, there is no top exec keeping an eye on you, ready to pluck you for stardom! I have only ever seen a company's butt tighten up like a snare drum when it comes to spending money on someone, i.e. promotion, training, etc. This whole idea of the company needs to value you or needs to encourage you, that's not the aim of the game for most companies.And to people who just want to say, ""I guess you worked for shitty companies"", 85 or so in so far, I've yet to see it any different. If yours is different, let me know how to apply! Even the nicest of places to work get fidgety when you tell them you've gone done achieved something big that's worth a lot more on the job market.

nfrtp5f,"I’ll just say I think you’ve made the most important first step which is noticing that something isn’t right while you still have plenty of time to course correct. “Back in my day” we worried newbies weren’t building fundamentals due to the easy access to StackOverflow and worried about copy-paste developers. Unfortunately I can’t say these worries were fully unfounded but things didn’t turn out nearly as bad as the grey beards liked to complain about.LLMs are so new that we don’t have a lot of “tips and tricks” built up so unfortunately I don’t have much in the way of practical advice beyond just developing your personal discipline.A couple of things I think you can try:- Use screen time limits to restrict access to the LLM apps and sites you use - My thinking here is you can’t go cold turkey but you can time limit and make its extended use impractical- Switch search engines away from Google to something like DuckDuckGo or Kagi. For compsci/tech I recommend Kagi and I think they have a student plan - My thinking here is a) googles quality has declined and b) their Gemini integration is too hard to avoid- Consider timeboxing algo learning/studying on pen and paper away from your computer and phone. - Basically try like “I’ll do an hour w/o internet and see how far I get and then give myself X minutes after to research any questions I have” - Look up “pomodoro timers” if you haven’t heard of them yet that technique is hepful for focus- Any time an LLM does generate an answer, commit yourself to finding a non-LLM source that confirms the answer - Don’t ask the LLM to cite sources, go find a source by hand. At least here you build up your researching skills even if you’re worried the LLM reliance prevented you from learning the core subject. That’s honestly more important anyways. Realistically the skills you need to build here are being able to go to articles and documentation to build an understanding. Memorizing a red-black tree algo is less important than knowing what they are, why they are useful, and how to find and evaluate a source that you can use to remind yourself of implementation.My last bit of advice is don’t beat yourself up when you “fall off the wagon”. LLMs are so new and temptingly useful *enough* that we don’t know as an industry/discipline how to deal with their impacts and deficits. We’re learning by observing your generation, sadly. Learning “the old ways” is important not necessarily because they’re better but because those charting the new way of doing things have to know where we came from in order to guide us to where we’re going.",dcousineau,2025-09-23 14:26:56,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1no2dy8,False,

I'm too old to put up with that shit, the market being bad wasn't relevant in my decision to start looking for a new job.I prep very lightly for about a month. I'm not targetting FAANG, or anything insane where you get tossed leetcode hards back to back. I do practice *some* leetcode, but a lot of my prep is refreshing fundamentals, system design, language-specific quirks, behavioral, etc. I only really spend 30-60 minutes a day, sometimes more, sometimes less, sometimes not at all. My goal is to not burnout on the job search itself, so I'm not forcing anything.I had 11 YOE at the time, so I was applying to Senior / Staff roles. It took me just under 3 months, and 82 applications. All of them were cold applications online.Tips for those struggling.... you need to be able to identify which part of the process is breaking down, and actively try to fix it. Don't just repeat the same exact thing that isn't working and expect it to suddenly start working.If you're getting literally no interviews, the problem is your resume. Hard stop. A lot of people read a bunch of resume advice, get people to review it online, even pay professionals to review it, and then just assume their resume can't be the problem after all of that.Well, the proof's in the pudding. If you're not getting interviews, it's your resume. So instead of blindly believing your resume is good, look into some differing advice. There's the ""meta advice"" you'll get on this subreddit (impact, KPI's, etc), but there's *lots* of different approaches to resume writing. Try some conflicting advice, and build a 2nd resume from that. Maybe even build a 3rd or a 4th all using different strategies that disagree with each other. Then A/B test those resumes. This is something I did in the middle of my job search because I had a hunch one of my titles was hurting me, so I started using 2 versions of my resume.If you're not struggling to get interviews, consider yourself lucky. It's much easier to improve on whatever interview techniques you're struggling with. Reflect, be honest with yourself where you're weak, and work to improve whatever that is. And don't sleep on the behavioral/communication aspect of interviewing, it can be hard to point the finger back at yourself and say you're not doing a good job at communicating, but you need to be able to be introspective.",SouredRamen,2025-09-22 16:00:19,15,cscareerquestions,t3_1nnonqn,False,

nfd2ed2,"I actually gave a short talk about this last week. My short opinion is ""yes, but a bubble doesn't mean the technology is worthless"". Right now what most people call ""AI"" (which is really just a small subset of generative AI) is almost definitely in a bubble. There's an unbelievable amount of investment in it, a ton of business ventures that use it without a clear plan or analysis, and a lot of integration in places where it doesn't add much value. There are also a lot of people banking on it doing things in the future that it doesn't do right now, and putting money into it based on an assumption that ""it'll do everything we need soon"".There's also an issue at the very top. Companies that provide the service are not making money off it yet, and they will need to either raise their prices or lower their costs to make it profitable in the future. They're all hoping to win a market share and then hike up the prices. This is disastrous for businesses which are, by-and-large, planning as though their current rates will be stable forever.Unlike blockchain/crypto, however, AI does show many profitable use-cases. AI does work that would cost money, and it provides services people will pay for. Business analyses DO show that AI is successfully being used by businesses sometimes. It's just that most businesses don't know what works or doesn't work, and are using the technology blindly.I would liken it to the ""Dotcom Bubble"". The internet as a business technology was absolutely in a bubble in the 90s, and that bubble crashed. It wasn't because ""having a website for your business"" was a bad idea, it was because people were trying to do it without a good plan. Nowadays every business has a website, but unlike the 90s we've established clear use cases which provide value instead of just guessing what works and what doesn't.I expect AI to be the same. AI will ""crash"". There will be downtime where a lot of businesses disappear, and from the ashes will rise a few clear uses where generative AI is used by almost every business.",dorox1,2025-09-21 03:52:13,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1nm9i8a,False,

Whether you would call that a bubble depends on what you think will happen when the market for the technology moves beyond hype into a mature, useful stage. There are many realistic and valuable business applications for LLMs, computer vision, etc. These tools are incredibly powerful and will only get better as the models get refined and as more skilled developers work on them (whether they are newly trained in an ML-specific context, like me, or they're crossing over from more rigorous, traditional SWE backgrounds).I'm currently a manager in a non-technical role but taking point on some exploratory AI projects, and I'm looking for a role as an ML engineer down the road. What I'm paying attention to, both in my current role and in my job search, is whether the product brings real business value. Investors and execs don't understand this stuff, they see how quickly and confidently chatgpt spits out text and they believe it's magic that's going to relieve them of the burden of workers. Dishonest hype men are more than happy to take advantage of that. But if you actually understand how these models work on even a rudimentary technical level then you can smell the bullshit from a mile away. I'm not going to peddle bullshit and I'm not going to go work for bullshit except as a last resort. I think that very few companies can survive selling bullshit (though some do) but I won't be surprised to see a lot of snake oil AI startups go under in the next few years, so I don't want to bank on that for my future.",WendlersEditor,2025-09-21 01:46:10,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1nm9i8a,False,

Not only that, but a lot of fields like customer support, legal, animation are getting distrupted by AI which is great use case for the technology. People can point to OpenAI and Anthropic not being profitable, which is the same thing as almost every other tech company when they are in hypergrowth phase: you invest money to gain market share. With that said, with AI now the startup landescape is changing.

If you have a medical facility near you, any communities related to them are also a good place to look because a lot of doctors have nannies. New residents and med students with kids in particular may be looking to nanny share to save some money. Your other option is to aggresively consolidate your day and hire in-home help for that time. For example, make your working hours 9AM-1PM (or whatever). Find a part time nanny who is willing to do 4 hours per day. Then tell work that your hours for meetings and other syncronous work have shifted into that mid-day block or to hours when your husband is home. Both of these options, a nanny share or a part time nanny, will run you a similar cost to high quality infant daycare, but will keep your child from getting sick with all of the daycare sicknesses.

new0fsz,"People here have good advice but I'll tell you my story as it's very similar to yours. Advice at the end.Some background here: My wife and I had twins 4.5 months ago. My wife is a PM at a startup (she has anywhere from 2-4 hours of meetings a day), I'm a senior dev at a more established company (I have 30 minutes of meetings per day), and we both WFH full time. Also, I often can get away with working 10 hour weeks but the occasional crunch time for a project means I'm working 40 hours. My wife had \~3 months of maternity leave and I had 2 weeks of PTO that I used all up front when the babies were born. Ours were also underbaked (lol) at 37 weeks which is actually full term for twins. Our twins for the first \~4 months were also EXTREMELY clingy and could not be put down. We we wearing them almost all hours of the day.Our original plan was to attempt to balance them between meetings and work - we thought this might be feasible since my meeting schedule is so light and my working hours are extremely flexible.Towards the end of my wife's maternity leave, we realized things were only getting harder with the twins. On days where I happen to have a few extra meetings and she does as well (nearly every day for her) we really didn't have a backup plan other than 2 screaming babies behind me on camera or me skipping meetings. So in the final week before she went back to work, we hired a nanny who came to our house to watch the babies from 9-2. That offered us enough time to get things down and squeeze our meetings into this time window and then do any work we needed to follow up with later in the evening. Even this was not a very sustainable lifestyle as we found ourselves far too often working into the night when we were exhausted from taking care of twins most of the day. Our nanny didn't end up working out - she was unable to care for the babies as they needed a caretaker who had more energy (you can read my previous posts for more context here) so we ended up letting her go a few weeks ago and we are currently on week 3 of working while taking care of the twins. Let me tell you, it is extremely difficult. I take meetings in my airpods with screaming babies and then run out of the room to give my scrum update and then immediately after (2 min later) run back into the room to continue looking after them. I take meetings on walks. I cram as much work into their short nap windows as I possibly can. My wife and I both work late into the night to make it work. It is HARD. I would not wish it on anyone.My wife just put in her 2 weeks notice and work and I just landed a new job that gives me a raise to cover enough of her loss in comp that we should be fine for her to just be full time SAHM for now.TLDR;My situation is slightly different than yours - 2 WFH parents with 2 babies. But I think you also will find (especially with your heavy meeting load) that it's just not sustainable. You might make it work for a few weeks but inevitably you'll find that you can't dedicate enough effort to either work or your baby and likely both will suffer for it.My advice would be to spend the time now (before you go back to work) finding people in your network/community/neighborhood who would be interested in nanny sharing and then find ways if possible to reduce spending in other areas of your life to free up some funds for this. It's not going to be easy.

They can even say ""Great!"" and not be lying, because what a ""Good WLB"" is is very subjective. They may genuinely think their WLB is great because they only have you working 60 hours instead of 80.So instead, ask them about stories. In the exact same way they use ""tell me about a time when..."" questions on *you* to gain insight into *you* as opposed to directly asking. ""When was the last time the team was missing a deadline, and how was that handled?"", ""How are deadlines decided, and who decides on them?"", ""When do most people generally come in/leave for the day?"", ""When's the last time the team got an after hours support call and how was that handled?"", ""What's considered 'crunch time', and how often is the team doing that?"", ""What are your expectations of \[role\]?"", etc, etc.There are many, many different answers to those questions.

Because a lot of the Mediums are generalizations of Easy problems, and the Easy problems give you a good foundation of key techniques.Once you find a solution to an Easy, take around 10-15 minutes and think if you can find a faster solution. On Leetcode it is usually to tell if there is a faster solution by the speed/memory distribution.Once you get the hang of Easys, then start doing Mediums that are semi-related to the Easys you've done. (For example, if you did an Easy in strings, do some Mediums in strings. If you did Easies in arrays, do some Mediums in arrays.)

Stop testing yourself on stuff you haven't practiced yet.Learn the concepts and ideas behind ""algorithms and data structures"". Actually make sure you understand what it is about, how things work in principle. Then start practicing. Do not try to solve as many questions as you can, but look at a question, understand it, and work your way not just to a solution, but to understanding what it does, and why, and how, and explain why that is better than sub-optimal alternatives.Once you're good at that, you should have very few problems with leetcode anymore.There are problems that you'll absolutely have to memorize.

Started at 75k and worked my way to about 90k (not a huge bump but defense doesnt pay that crazy). I decided to jump ship during the last hiring boom of covid. Ended up at a big tech company (one of the bigger ones) for 200k TC. I took it without even thinking. Defense - i loved my co-workers and was moving up the latter quickly. It was so chill and the work was fun and easy. I did 20 hours of work and chilled the rest of the week. I was my team's scrum master and developer and i didnt think about work after 5 pm and was a top performer. There werent any real deadlines and i could sit on a task for 2 months and nobody complained. Big tech - things got hectic quickly. I was working for their cloud service. What i didnt know is that cloud is where work life balance goes to die. At first i wanted to respet my balance and stuck to 40 hour weeks for the most part. Then it slowly got more and more hectic and since i was remote id idnt realize my coworkers were pulling 50-60 hour weeks sometimes mroe. so after a year i obviously was behind the rest and even if my work was to my standards, they compared me to my coworkers standards and i got less than average. I drank the kool aid for a year and worked like crazy. Matched the 50-60 hours but i realzied i just didnt lvoe the work but the economy was shit so i kept it going. After a year i got another bad review and a few months later fired. Im not saying dont take AWS, for the money it sounds amazing. You might have a way better experience than i did. I know someone who works for AWS, has 300k+ in TC and it's one of the easier AWS projects where people sign off at 5pm and dont think about work. They dont even have on-call. You could land ion a project like that or you could land in a project that requires 80 hours from you in tough weeks. Im just saying sometimes the fame and fortune isnt what it lives up to be.

I didn't have it or any AWS experience and was hired since I used Azure at my last job. The cloud certs are the only ones I ever see and only about 10% of the time. Less relevant for that 10% if the company uses 1 of the other 2. So you see, low value but not zero.Rest of certs are scams.*How do you stand out more after graduating?*1. Work experience. Nice if the job is a similar industry. List technology you used on the job because no one wants to train you. Make the hiring manage believe you can make significant contributions with minimal training. Easy to get the chance if they like you resume.2. Greater than 1 YoE, resume can be 1 or 2 pages, or 1.5 is okay white space kind of looks bad. Use a big font if 2 pages. Honestly, big font is underrated. Eye tracking surveys you can search for show HR reads you resume for less than 8 seconds. Don't make it an adjective fiesta. I list the tech stacks both in the job descriptions and in a separate section at the bottom for ease of reading.3. A select few companies like seeing community involvement such as volunteering. Can attend young professionals events and maybe make friends at companies that are hiring. Adult kickball leagues, I know multiple married couples that met on teams.4. Sounds obvious but be within driving distance of the office. I don't list my full address, just City, State, Zipcode. Remote jobs all well and good but those get the most applicants.

neqvwfm,"Azure deployments, scripting with Python and Bash, FastAPI, and Databricks is good mix of cloud engineering, automation, and backend development all valuable and marketable skills. Being expected to figure things out on your own in a small team is actually pretty common in consulting. A lot of firms put people on islands where they have to be the expert, even if they’re still learning. It’s not a bad thing but it also means you haven’t had the chance to see how larger dev teams work day to day. Your role ties with Cloud Engineer or Cloud + Automation Engineer fits well. If you want to move toward joining a dev team, you could focus more on backend development with Python frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Django) and data tools, while still using your cloud knowledge to stand out. If you want to stay close to infrastructure, doubling down on Azure certifications and automation tools would make you stand out as a cloud engineer. If you’d rather move toward development, deepening your Python, databases, and API building skills will help.Before you leave your job, build a clear learning plan, pick projects to show off your skills, and maybe even contribute to open source to give you the momentum you’re looking for. That way, when the market improves, you’ll be ready to land the kind of structured dev team role you’re aiming for.

Squarespace definitely has a pretty chill wlb and has a good engineering culture + you should have a very supportive engineering manager. There were regular company-wide panel meetings for engineers to showcase their recent work and share interesting news and upcoming tech. However, from my own experience, the product management and roadmaps can be a little shaky and if you are the type of dev that prefers autonomy and moving at your own pace, you might feel bogged down by all of the meetings and politics between different teams & departments.As the other commenter said, options are definitely a crapshoot and thats part of the reason I left for a startup where my options would have a little more upside + I could have more eng & product ownership. By the time I left I had a few years of stock refreshers that were worth about 75k a year in straight up equity which were then converted to plain cash payouts after SQSP went private. The change to options was def a downgrade for me given that any potential value hinged on growth in valuation and going public again or doing a stock buyback/other liquidity event. At the time that I left a lot of people viewed the valuation target from the company leadership as a bit aggressive but who's to say that they can't meet it with some aggressive catch-up against their main competitors (eg. shopify with a current valuation \~25x that of Squarespace when it went private).I'd say to not make the jump just because of the potential value of the equity, but if you're looking for a good engineering culture and interesting product to continue your career growth I would definitely suggest considering Squarespace",steiner26,2025-09-22 03:30:05,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1nlw0dz,False,
nf9swh3,"For software development, the languages that companies value most right now are Python (super versatile: backend, automation, data science, AI, security), Java (still huge in enterprise and backend), C# (popular for backend and enterprise systems), C++ (more specialized, but strong in systems, embedded, and performance heavy apps). You might find backend, automation, or even systems programming a better fit. Python is especially powerful because it crosses into both software development and cybersecurity. For cybersecurity, it’s useful for scripting, automating scans, and working with security tools.If you’re interested in cybersecurity, focus on Python scripting for automation. Networking basics (which you’ve started on). Linux security and command line skills. Certifications like CompTIA Security+ or CEH (these can help open doors). If you’re more interested in software development, building a few solid projects (maybe a command line tool, an automation script, or a backend system) will help you stand out.EU companies often look for flexible engineers who can do multiple things.

Sometimes, a little down time is what we need to fully integrate the information we learned during an intense crunch. \>  I could chip away at tech debt or make our testing more automated, etcI'd let this be the primary **work** focus, something simple that will keep you engaged with work while being low stakes and not too stressful.

Most online resources that are interview related will likely just be reviewing leetcode solutions which is cool but at that senior level how you design is way more important. Other than that'd I'd honestly just go onto github, search up repos using spring boot and review previous pull requests and/or open ones.There's no one trick and everyone has their preferences unfortunately so whatever you decide you need to make sure you know why and be comfortable defending it.

nfsnwr1,"My advice would be to start off with a Data Science bootcamp. It really helped me understand certain concepts. You would also benefit greatly from learning and understanding Probability and Statistics. Also, do some practice projects and add them to GitHub. One thing I want to mention is that tech is one of the career paths that have a brutal interview process, where not only you get the typical interview questions, but also they would ask some questions relating to the topics at hand plus coding problems. Tech is also one of the most in demand jobs right now, so you may struggle a bit to find one. Anyways best of luck to you.",POKEGAMERZ9185,2025-09-23 16:51:18,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1noki62,False,

nftqcdu,"Depends on what you want., I'd say $80k-$85k is reasonable but here's what I would do... Ask them, politely and with some humor to keep the mood light, if $90 is possible. When they say that's probably a stretch and might be a bit too difficult and offer you whatever they have planned, you have two options; 1. Ask them if they can stretch for it (it's a VERY low risk of them taking the offer back, I have literally only seen it happen ONCE in my life)2. Accept whatever their offer is.Here's some insider info from someone who's been in the hiring side convos, starting someone at the top end of the pay range would be pretty difficult unless they're basically someone who's 100% getting a promotion by the end of their first year. The pay range represents something called the **pay band** that the job role typically exists within to account for annual raises over time. When you hit the high end of the band that means the only way to get a raise would be to receive a promotion. Since you're a new grad it's HIGHLY unlikely that they'll start you off at the absolute END of the pay band since they'll want to account for your first year effectively being a learning year where they won't really be able to argue a promotion for you. All of this is contextual to each company and some job listings actually come bundled with multiple pay bands put together (this is where you get those WILD pay ranges where it's like $90k-@225k) because they'll actually pick your level based on where you land in the interview. If you have anymore questions (this isn't written very well and I'm sorry for any confusion) please feel free to ask.",No_Reading3618,2025-09-23 19:53:27,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1noby9j,False,
nftthf0,"I concur with the other poster: Shooting for 80-85 seems reasonable.The problem is that, as a new grad, you might not have much to differentiate you from the next guy. So you don't want to give them a reason to choose the next guy.My take is this:Don't name a number if you can avoid it. Whatever the excuse is - there's a lot on the net about how to handle that.After that, I think it's about framing. If you say ""$90k or I walk""... you're probably going to walk. But if it's more like they come in at 65k and you say ""Hm, the range for this role is up to $95k, and I was hoping that given that we could start in the top half of the band. Would there be any room to move there?"" And, I mean, they might say no. But you're a) not being demanding and b) providing justifications. I wouldn't push it too hard, but most of the time asking politely will at least not tank the deal once you're at the negotiating stage.",olddev-jobhunt,2025-09-23 20:08:17,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1noby9j,False,

nfpgmuy,"Yes to both. Don't overthink the process, don't pay attention to those kinds of things.Interviewing doesn't happen in FIFO order. Just because you're applicant #531 doesn't mean you'll be the 531st person they consider.Interviewing tends to happen in batches. They may look at the first batch of 100, narrow it down to 5 people they want to talk to, and then go through the process with those 5 people. This can take several weeks. If at the end of that, none of those 5 people work out, they don't just go grab Person #6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 in queue order out of that initial batch. They'll go look at the *next* batch of 100, applicants 101 through 200, and pick another 5 out of that batch. So applicant #101 might be the very next resume they look at when they're ready.Same idea applies to the age of the posting. Companies aren't interviewing hundreds of candidates concurrently. Interviewing takes time. Weeks. Sometimes months. And things rarely work out in the first batch, or the second batch, or even the third batch, so they may be actively looking for months.I've gotten offers out of postings that had hundreds of applicants, and that were over a month old.At the end of the day, never disqualify yourself.
