n4in6mg,">Anyone else been through this transition?Yeah, but not in DE. I was a chemist before and basically had this problem. I had experience on paper although over time I never really improved. It goes without saying this was well before the advent of AI and also chemistry is a field where all of the answers aren't on Google.One of the reasons I wasn't improving was because I didn't like the field I was in. I didn't have passion to improve and felt like I was entitled to more than I actually deserved just because I had X years of experience on paper. In the meanwhile, people who were much younger and less experienced came in and were smashing it purely because they had drive, passion, and a desire to improve.Lost my job during the 'rona pando, attended enough interviews for a chemistry job and didn't get any offers even though I felt the interviews went well.I thought I was a great chemist who was underappreciated. In reality, I was discovering in real time that I was a subpar, disgruntled chemist at best. Thought I was faking my way through the interviews, getting all of the technical questions right, but in hindsight, none of it mattered because even though I knew all of the answers, there's no point hiring somebody who doesn't want to be there which is the energy I gave off subconsciously.Offering this as an alternative perspective because sometimes the answer isn't necessarily trying harder.Paraphrasing although a famous MMA coach once said that there are a lot parallels between life and your style of fighting. Loads of people in the martial arts community start trying to emulate their favourite fighters without considering that style might be unsuitable for their physiology, essentially training on ""hard mode"" by doing something they aren't designed to do instead of putting energy into discovering their own style. Life is similar - people try and obtain success or financial freedom by copying others and wonder why they have to work so hard to achieve so little compared to the person they're trying to emulate, essentially being on hard mode by their own design.We are all designed to do something well and it is up to us to find what that is.>How did you push through?

Especially when you work with things that are closer to ML, that have testable behaviours that only manifest when working on a huge dataset with specific patterns. This is not an intractable problem, though. You still can factor your code correctly and cover with unit tests as much as you can, and write queries for ongoing data quality monitoring (a good data analyst will be a very important ally in this activity). For more complex stuff, talk to your platform/infra/governance people about having a ""sandbox"" environment - prod data but all the sensitive parts masked. Nobody understands the complexity?

You don’t want to make sure your 300 billions records are unique every time you add a new row.But the concept of unique identifier should be introduced into almost all tables. That unique identifier is normally a surrogate key. Surrogate key are unique identifier derives from other fields. For example a md5 hash of the concatenation of 4 columns. This give you a unique identifier.What’s great about surrogate keys is that they are not random. You get consistency in any systems, if you migrate to another platform your surrogate keys are still valid and that’s very powerful. Also you can reproduce the same results over and over again, which is not possible if you use a UUID generated by another system for example.Then depending on the tool you use you can validate the uniqueness of the fields yourself. There’s some reason you might want to do this yourself and not the system like you would have in a normal db and is that because you can have multiple time the same records or a different version of what you consider the same records.Since the DW is for analytics you might want to analyze those different records which are not unique in your raw layer but could be in your marts.So it’s a powerful thing to let you control de uniqueness of the fields yourself.Obviously if you don’t manage it you’ll probably end up with a lot of duplicates.

So all the 'user' dimensions would be in one table (and it would probably have a companion SCD table), all the 'session' dimensions in another etc. Then these can be `join`d and de-normalized in gold to expose to BI tools as needed while analysts can still have some flexibility by using the silver tables.

From a Hudi angle, it is not just an open table format though. It is an end-to-end *lakehouse platform*, that integrates ""storage engine"" capabilities (much like a DBMS) with a table format (the metadata) on top of open file formats such as Apache Parquet.Hudi offers built-in services for ingestion (like Hudi Streamer), table management (clustering, compaction, cleaning, rollback), and catalog syncing. These services are deeply integrated and natively supported, allowing for fine-grained control over write-side performance (with the ability to run asynchronously/inline), recovery, and data quality. Work is also underway to add a multi-tenant caching layer that bridges fast ingestion with low-latency querying across engines.

Assuming your whole team is fundamentally competent, the frequent late nights suggest someone is promising too much and/or failing to manage expectations. The bad news is that can happen anywhere. But if it's the norm, then it's probably time to move on and parlay the recognizable name into a better role.You can definitely find consulting companies that take quality of work more seriously. I don't know how to vet them besides just talking to people in similar roles. When you do, ask about the sales process, the role of vendor partnerships (this can almost singlehandedly determine your technical focus!), how they go about scoping, how satisfied clients generally seem, etc. If you get engineers to answer those questions, that will shed a lot of light on the kind of environment you might be stepping into (which is tightly linked to the kinds of clients your sales and marketing people are able to reach).(Edited to add: If those discussions make it sound like that firm is bent on pitching solely AI everything these days...huge red flag. Obviously I'm speaking from my own biases here, but IMHO it's a recipe for perpetual scope change at best, and completely unrealistic expectations at worst. Too many un-serious people selling to other un-serious people who are spending still other un-serious people's money for no clear reason. Naturally, YMMV.)By way of background, my data career has been solely in consulting. It's been about 10 years at a couple of relatively small firms (in the 100–200-person range) so I don't know what things are like at much larger ones. I have worked in-house before but in a very a different field. Overall, I'm satisfied with my career path, but it has its drawbacks, especially if technical learning is your *top* priority.There have been long periods where my technical skills stagnated. Once I've reached a certain degree of experience with our bread-and-butter projects, most of the work is on the business logic and requirements side, not the technical side, since I've probably done it a dozen times before.Obviously I'm always keeping up with developments from vendors we typically use (and what's new from others to some extent)...but it's not like I'm frequently taking on entirely new kinds of projects. That's not a bad thing in my book! All those less- or non-technical skills are extremely important. What's more, even if selling the same solution repeatedly isn't the most technically exciting, it's one way to keep increasing your effective hourly rate.Granted, my favorite clients have been smaller ones (like a few hundred staff members or less) who need all kinds of random data things solved. Sometimes that does require unfamiliar technologies, which are often equal parts fun and frustrating at the same time.

n4s63t6,"Alright, this post can make good use of additional clarity.- Is primary_hash just a fancy way to say ID?- I hope you understand the implication of hashing, because in this context it is a trap, and you’re jumping right into it. First, order sensitivity: {a:1, b:2} and {b:2, a:1} can spit out different hashes depending on your algorithm—hope you’re normalizing inputs. Second, collisions: no hash is truly unique, so your primary_hash or payload_hash could, in theory, screw you over with duplicates. Third, compute cost: hashing big payloads (especially JSON blobs) chews up CPU. For large datasets, you’re burning cycles when a simpler key or checksum could do the job. Also, good luck debugging when someone tweaks the algorithm. Do stick to lightweight identifiers or deterministic keys unless you’re solving world hunger.- Your source system just yeets full or incremental loads at random? You're really telling us is just a coin flip? Scour their docs for a pattern—there’s got to be one. If it’s truly a coin flip, build a check (like record count or metadata flags) to detect load type. Then branch your logic: full load = overwrite or merge, incremental = append or upsert. A simple if-statement saves you from nuking 95% of your data.- Why the urge to slap a boolean is_current on everything? Your UPSERT logic already yells “this row’s alive!"". Regarding your last_loaded_ts: you just called it business_ts few words before!- Detecting deletions always come down to one of two. Check if the source emits delete events (docs, again). If not, periodically poll for IDs and just IDs. Another news: although a row is being deleted from the source system, it's not mandatory you have to delete it as well: just flag it (aka soft deletion). Overall, if you can ingest incrementally and poll for just IDs, you are saving money and drastically simplify the process.- Data retention: S3 (or Fabric’s storage) is dirt cheap for raw data and time travel queries (i.e., SELECT * FROM table VERSION AS OF '2025-01-01') have been invented in the 90s.

For incremental loads, we only update records that actually appear in the batch - never delete based on absence.The trick is tracking what constitutes a ""complete picture"" at the source level. We usually maintain a separate metadata table that tracks when each source last did a full refresh, so we know our baseline.**Storage and history management:** Bronze is the wrong place for long term history imo. We keep maybe 30-90 days in Bronze for reprocessing, then archive to cheaper storage. The real historical tracking happens in Silver where you can be more selective about what actually needs versioning.For cost control, consider:* Partition by load date so you can easily drop old data* Use Delta's time travel for short term history, separate archive for long term* Not everything needs full history - focus on business critical entities**Quick pattern that works:*** Bronze: Current state + recent changes (30-90 days)* Silver: SCD Type 2 for entities that need history* Archive layer: Compressed parquet in cold storage for compliancea reference of 3 tier architecture: Bronze, Silver, Gold layers: [https://cdn-cednl.nitrocdn.com/ZIEpBLjPiSWpOcIdsSTlIdzcQJzKTmWw/assets/images/optimized/rev-21cfb01/www.datatobiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Azure-Medallion-Architecture.png](https://cdn-cednl.nitrocdn.com/ZIEpBLjPiSWpOcIdsSTlIdzcQJzKTmWw/assets/images/optimized/rev-21cfb01/www.datatobiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Azure-Medallion-Architecture.png)What kind of data volumes are you dealing with?

This allowed us to keep multiple versions of the same logical fact.Because we knew this system could always easily backfill fixes or reproduce old history under new business rules we could move fast.Effectively full refreshes are easier to test and debug because they should be idempotent.

Your pipeline might be written such that it extracts a delta of changes in the input db table and writes them to the output. This is because just copying the whole table every day is too expensive, and the changes are expected to be small, so could instead use a smaller machine. Now what do you do if the processing logic changes?Of course there are solutions to write a pipeline such that it handles both entire data and deltas, but those solutions always depend on the specifics of the input.

n44cwdj,"Howdy! I’m an Aggie (grad school in stats, not DE) and a Sr. DE working in Dallas. I was actually part of the industry DE group that A&M was talked to when they designed a bunch of the DAEN classes. I was one of five who chipped in on DAEN 323. They wanted folks who had industry DE experience as well as advanced stat training, which is actually a pretty small pool.The DAEN major is… fine. The small group of junior/mid-level CS faculty who pushed it to completion haven’t worked in industry, and they *really* wanted it to be more data science-y, which is why there’s a weird amount of semi-niche statistical topics (I love bayesian methods, but they’re generally a grad-level topic for stats, and they’re not really useful at all for a DE to be familiar with), and mandating that the DE students take the two required ISEN classes is silly. There’s too much statistical/ML methodology (which is awesome if you want to go into ML enablement, I’ve done it and can tell you that it’s a ton of fun) for the average DE, and especially the entry-level DE, and the tradeoff is that there’s not as much cloud education in there as I and most of the others thought there should be. They get you into databases early, which is key, but I’d like there to be more database coursework. Fortunately, you can do those extra DAEN technical electives.That said, you’ve got a few classes in there that rock for developing your practical skills. The DAEN project classes are a high point that have some good projects that would shine on any junior DE’s resume that I’ve reviewed in the last three or four years. I would strongly recommend augmenting those classes with more database coursework than the one required CSE 310 class. Overall, I’d say the program is about as good for getting you into DE as just doing a CS degree, and I’d strongly note the dual caveats that:1. your first job almost certainly will not be in data engineering. This is not an entry-level field, your first job will probably be in data analytics, and you’ll progress into DE like most of us did.2. This is a new program, and they’re still working out the kinks.

Some management did, C levels definitely had it, except for technical C-suite who held PhDs instead.Imo spend your time on something else, and working at a place like that is really not as difficult as you expect, but your best path in would be going to a good school, doing well, interviewing well and living nearby.

Most technical roles at places like Citi, JPMorgan, or Bain don’t require or expect a CFA.

Things like:* Learning how to wrangle financial data (from market feeds, statements, or transactions)* Building dashboards for KPIs like revenue, risk, or portfolio performance* Working with time-series forecasting or valuation modelsThere’s strong demand for data engineers with finance context—it’s just more about hands-on skills than credentials.

n4pn6zs,"I've done between 150 and 200 of these animals. The process is very similar regardless of the tools. Let me give you the high points. The goal here is to make sure you accomplish something, have a defined finish line and don't just resell them back the same used car they were driving with a new coat of paint.1. Make sure there is total agreement as to WHY you are doing this. You need this before you use any brain cells on the technical or tools side of the house. This needs to be in writing and preferably signed off by all stakeholders. None of these reasons will be technical. They will all be business oriented. This step needs to be very well documented and agreed on. Don't let anyone push you to rush this one. I usually take 3-4 weeks for this. Sometimes it takes longer. These are all of your project success criteria. Why was a decision to replicate what you already have made? The longest path to anywhere is a shortcut.2. Now that you have that, figure out WHAT they don't have that they need. Every single one of these needs to tie back to a WHY. If it doesn't tie back to one, discard it or update the WHYs and get sign off again. I'm talking reports, dashboards, messaging, etc. Do not start coding yet. This is also where to start to identify if you have the data to achieve these items. Don't limit yourself to the current state of affairs. I cannot emphasize how important it is to tie these back to WHY items. ""Because we've always had them"" is not a reason. Validate existing data products to see if they are sufficient or even needed. This is where you start to clean house on all the crap that data warehouses collect. This stage will also start to get you thinking about the relationships between the types of data. Not a data model, but a bit higher than that in conception.Nothing up to now has been technical but these are by far the most important parts of the projects. It will be very tempting to jump into the weeds, don't do it. Your post already suggests you are starting at the wrong place.3. Now you can start to design the data warehouse. I would start with the data model. Figure out what type of model you need. Don't take what is already there unless it can be heavily justified. An operational data store is not the same as a data warehouse. You don't get too many opportunities to do this in any one company. Throw away all of those marketing terms. They won't help you. A traditional three tier DW has never steered me wrong. Activities, like data cleansing and data standardization, tend to happen as you move the data from one tier to the next. Stage is used for landing data. I tend to make my core in 3NF and any data products (stars, materialized views, etc.) in the semantic layer. You do not need to have everything built out before you start using it but do have as much as possible planned out and written down. Generate regular deliverables to the business and be able to show how they address the business needs you identified in step one. If they can't be tied back, ask yourself why you are building them. This is a VERY high description of how you refactor or initially design a data warehouse. It may seem overwhelming but just break it down into chunks and always be thinking about the future.

Get your view definitions under version control on GitHub then use GitHub actions to push them to postgres when you make updates. If performance starts to become an issue, then look into an orchestrator as you might need to start materialising these into actual tables.- make sure your view definitions are under version control. Look into dbt to make this easier to manage.- on data viz, sure you can use tableau but I personally have found it a bit clunky when I've used it in the past and it can get very expensive. Recently started using Sigma computing - less pretty dashboards but I think way easier to use. But honestly if you use one of the usual suspects (Tableau, Power BI etc) management can't really blame you. I don't really know anything about Kibana but if that's working for you why reinvent?- on natural language querying - your job on this is to NOT implement anything and find a diplomatic way of telling management it's a bad idea. If they insist you try it, look at setting up AI agents where you can constrain their behavior to running queries you predefine, and prompt it to say 'i don't know' if non technical users stray out of those guardrails.

Then you need to carefully think through your BI architecture because you are paying to move data off AWS to Azure, so you want to minimize that as much as possible. If you do it by caching on the Azure side for performance, then it requires you to move all the potential data that people could use across to make it available. You could also use direct query, where it queries every time someone refreshes. You only pay for the same query compute once a day because Snowflake caches the results, but you still move the data to Azure every time. So it has an impact on your gold data architecture, how you develop your data products and the extent to which you have decentralized access to a variety of data.

Our tech is oversaturated with buzzwords and abbreviations for no good reason.So I've read the article and I find it very interesting. I agree with many points, especially about idempotency. And I also have a few questions:1. From my experience, layered data platforms aren't made only for the sake of business. Materializing intermediate datasets with pieces of business logic can be necessary to maintain good cost/performance ratio. Especially when the data is big, and your ETL system can only handle data increments in a timely manner. At the same time, proper naming convention and an appropriate architecture (Kimball, DV) makes the data easier to navigate. Does this align with your vision, and if not, why is your way of doing things better? Or is it?2. Implement all transformations as pure functions - it makes me think you're advocating for ETL process instead of ELT (aka using compute engines like Spark for data transformations). I make this assumption, because implementing pure transformations using sql is much more tricky, and people with expertise in sql, but no expertise in OOP may struggle to do it consistently. Even tools like DBT require careful model design to achieve real idempotency.

Developer/Team/Enterprise are all tiers within dbt Cloud, and yes, the semantic layer for PowerBI is Cloud-only. Fusion is a feature within the Cloud product.Here's the thing though: we were on the Teams plan and everything was fine until we hit 8+ people. Then dbt Sales basically forced us into Enterprise tier. The initial quote? $300/seat/month on a 3-year contract. Even after heavy negotiation we only got it down to $220/seat/month.For context, that's $26,400/year for 10 people, which feels pretty steep for what's essentially a task scheduler running on top of open-source dbt.If you're just getting started with the engineering side, I'd honestly suggest sticking with dbt Core + your own orchestration (Airflow, GitHub Actions, whatever).

n4w99jv,"Hi u/tech-man-ua I don't have extensive experience with Liquibase, but I may be able to help, drawing on my general experience with databases and Flyway. 1. Talking about your example, I would split them up, keeping one change per changeset. Also, createTable and createIndex should not be considered a single operation. It is very common to create indexes sometime after the table is created. e.g.. Create the table, ingest the data, then create the indexes.2. Again, I would not keep them in the same changeset. Having the CREATE OR REPLACE clause helps make the change idempotent, but the function and the trigger are still two different objects.3. I believe in this case, you should add a rollback for the trigger.Again, as I mentioned earlier, I don't have experience with Liquibase, and I'm aware that following the guidelines strictly can make everything more laborious, so please take it with a grain of salt. I don't think you should be so strict if you are creating the database from scratch, for example. In that case, I would develop changesets to create multiple foreign keys and indexes, for example.

Our official SLA is 3 hrs but in reality we process the data in around an hour tops end-to-end. The input is approx 500 JSON files a minute, essentially a new version of each business object in each file, and the output is 280+ delta tables. We use only custom-built pyspark notebooks to accomplish this, no DLTs, with a combination of continuous batch job workflows and ADF-triggered readstream workflows that run for 24 hrs then time out using a query listener to recycle and restart during off-hours.The first crux of the data feed is to transform the incoming JSON into a collection of 280+ tabular and relational “bronze” tables. This first crux is the essential schema transformation from an object-oriented data view to an analytical and relational-database view of the data. No data contents are modified, only the schema representation.The second crux is the creation of a merge statement from the collection of “bronze” tabular tables to the final collection of “silver” tables. We have 6 workflows that run this second part with about 75 tasks for the big ones, 20 for the smaller ones, that all use a status table as a readstream to know when parsed, tabular data is ready to merge into the final silver tables.

If the schema changes or more columns are available, *as I remember it* you get a warning/error, that something has changed in your profiling. Not the actual change I think. But again, not sure.As for point 4, it generates a report that you manually have to click on and open. Actually quite nice overview in the automatically generated reports with stats on all your metadata in your profiling.

n5bj6it,"For operational use cases - take the data, do something to it, send output to some downstream system - your instinct is correct in that trying to shoehorn the “medallion” concept into this sort of flow can be counterintuitive. My team and I went through a lot of back-and-forth on whether we wanted to support such use cases in our Databricks environment, or wanted to keep them separate. There were arguments to be made for separate - the data volume of these use cases is lower than our analytical workloads, and so Azure Functions/Logic Apps could be sufficient. However, then we would need to use a non-Databricks orchestrator, which would be a bit annoying for some of the multi-step operational workflows. Doing it in Databricks meant that all of our data jobs live in one place and are orchestrated through one set of tools, regardless of whether they’re operational or analytical in nature. Databricks Asset Bundles have been great for us in this regard, in terms of allowing us to define our job configurations as code. Once we got past that, we came back to the medallion. We landed the operational data in its own schema in our bronze catalog, but rather than moving it to “silver”, we created an operations catalog that serves as the use-case layer for all of these operational pipelines. They’re still sourced from bronze, and in the future, we might source analytical “silver” tables from either the bronze or operational catalogs, but this approach has been working well for us.We leverage Databricks secrets (backed by Azure Key Vault) for all of our connection secrets, and give our service principals READ access to the scope in each environment. We have also modularized our code for SFTP/FTP into a helper library so we don’t have to maintain the same logic in each pipeline. We try to stick to asynchronous patterns for our downstream writes (e.g. we drop off a file somewhere and some downstream system picks it up), but if we had to, we could also make a direct API connection and write our data that way.

n4dy17a,"What is it that people generally struggle with? It took me about a month (full time) to go from understanding practically nothing about programming, to being a passably competent junior developer, back around 10 years ago.I did spend a lot of my teen years building and tinkering with computers, and I was able to make static websites, but that was all I knew going into it. Perhaps having that basic understanding of how the hardware worked helped.I knew I had to learn C#, and that I would be doing web app development for work, so I just set myself the goal of building a social network site, not one that would be live anywhere or with scalability, just one that technically worked.I wrote out the list of features I wanted, profiles with personal info, picture uploads with compression, posts with comments and likes/dislikes, a friend list with the ability to add or remove people, and a search to find people on there.I looked up how entity framework worked, and followed about 30 mins of a tutorial for setting up a code-first database, but made models for my own project instead of copying the tutorial ones. I do remember having a little confusion on how to store and model references for comment chains, but google and a stack overflow post helped with that.Then I did something similar for authentication, integrating it with the models I had already made. After that there was some googling on how MVC worked, and how to pass models around. I’m pretty sure I went overkill on that, as I didn’t know just how much ‘just worked’ and how much I had to manually implement.After that it just sort of snowballed. I’d move from feature to feature, working on each, and googling very specific things when stuck to find stack overflow or random blog posts, which I could just read through and then implement myself. The second half of that month was a lot of fun seeing everything come together and work. I’m sure if I could find the codebase today, I’d shake my head at the quality, but at the time, I was very proud of it.Honestly, I never found any struggle at all when it came to learning the basics and putting something together. I didn’t hit a brick wall until I was getting into things like trying to implement algorithms directly from academic papers, and that’s mostly because I don’t always follow the terminology or notation correctly. There’s also usually a couple of times a year I come across some incredibly elusive bug that takes me a week to figure out. I find the hardest part of the job is looking at large projects written by other people with a differeng style, and having to unpick everything and figure out how it works. I know when I was a teenager, I always wanted to learn, but never did because I wanted to do everything perfectly first time and not waste even a second of time by picking the wrong thing, but as soon as I needed it for work and just had to figure it out look for a new job, it turned out to be so simple I wish I could have gone back and slapped my younger self for all the delaying.I’m curious, which part in the process is the challenge that makes it harder? This post is interesting, but it definitely feels like there’s a degree of overkill to the process!If someone can really verbalise what makes the whole thing a challenge to them, perhaps I can help? I know it sounds weird, but I’ve been doing it for so many hours now that it’s hard for me to imagine not being able to, but I would very much like to help if I can somehow!As for your conclusion about shifting mentality, that is one thing I do try to reiterate to people, nobody in tech support or software development really ‘knows’ it all, we just know that if you sit down and do some searching, as well as thinking through each problem step by step, you’ll get there in the end, there’s not much to it. Yes, some stuff gets passively memorised over time, but other than a handful of keywords and simple logic, you don’t need anything else to start working on a project. You’ll be slow, sometimes it takes a while to find the correct answer online, but overall, you can fundamentally do it.I do think some people believe we’re joking when we say that 50% of the job is figuring out what to google, but it is mostly true. Programming languages are not actual languages, you don’t need to converse in real time, and therefore you don’t need much stored information to do it. It’s far more like a trade skill, like plumbing or carpentry, anyone can do it, the difference between a new learner and an experienced developer is simply how quick and how well polished the result is. If I give you some wooden planks, a saw, a hammer, and some nails, you can build a table. It might be a shit table, it might collapse as soon as you put weight on it, but you can do it. After you do it once and find the flaws, you’ll do it again better the next time. The same is true here, if you have an IDE installed, and have a web browser and a list of keywords, you can build an app, it might crash, or be slow, but you can build it, then you go again and you’ll do it better and faster next time.",Kezyma,2025-07-21 18:34:49,3,learnprogramming,t3_1m5lmth,False,

And again.You wanted a way to 'describe it in English', and this is possible. You distill the core of the problem by focusing on what you want to do and the nouns in the problem description. You must first clearly state your problem. For example:- Problem: ""I want to know how often a word appears in an array of words and write this to the screen.""Distill the core:- array of words- count how often- word- write to screenTo do this, I need:- An array of words (so I must define this).- A way to keep count (so I must define some data structure for this).- A way to look at each word in the array. (Thus I need a loop to pass by each word in the array.)- A way to decide if I already counted the word before (if yes: increase counter; else add word and set counter to 1)- To Write the result to the screenSimple code (pseudo; language is not important yet):```define array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana]define keep_count = objectfor every word in array_of_words {decide if you counted the word before}print_result(keep_count)```Now you have the array of words, and a way to keep count. The thing you didn't work out yet was ""decide if you counted a word before"", so that's what you do next:```if word is in keep_count {increase counter for word by 1} else {add word and set counter to 1}```So now you put that solution into the previous block of code:```define array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana];define keep_count = objectfor every word in array_of_words {if word is in keep_count {increase counter for word by 1} else {add word and set counter to 1}}print_result(keep_count)```Then refine it a bit:```define array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana];define keep_count = objectfor every word in array_of_words {if word is in keep_count {keep_count for word: increase by 1} else {keep_count add word: set to 1}}print_result(keep_count)```And you're done.

I’m hearing more and more from career services and from friends in the field that these kids are getting fired, if they are even getting jobs at all.

Making use of tools that are magnifiers are really only going to help experienced software engineers. You can’t amplify nothing and expect that to go well. College assignments are designed to be bite sized and have rails. We design them so most students can figure it out and learn. Of course AI can do an ok job at those. Your classmates are losing the chance to learn how to learn and believe me, look at what tech looked like in 2005 and see if you don’t agree that the one skill you need to get in college more than any other is learning how to learn things on your own so you can adapt.

n4npcdv,"If AI can write code, it can run a company.If there's ever a point where you lose your engineering job to AI, everyone in almost every industry that touches a computer will.Currently AI writes dog shit code and the people that love it write dog shit code.The issue with the job market right now is that the economy is absolutely fucked and particularly the CS industry. A lot of venture capital dried up post covid and the value of the american dollar was cut in half almost overnight.There's also billions if not trillions in AI startups that haven't even turned a real profit yet. That money invested in AI isn't going into proven tech like solar, wind, electric cars that are a future trillion dollar industry.So it's really convenient for large companies (like amazon, meta, and microsoft who all have gigantic investments in AI) to say they layed off 20k employees because ""AI could do their job."" If that's true, show me a video of AI doing all the coding and customer service. I don't believe it.These companies are probably tightening their belts in a bad economy, pinning it on how awesome their AI investment is doing, framing it as profit and saving money, boosting their stock price. And when interest rates on loans go down, they can hire everyone back.A lot of these companies were also ""benching"" people. Hiring top talent employees just so that they don't go build a competitor product.Realistically they probably laid off a ton of benched talent and other people they didn't need. The economy is awful so it will be harder for them to find a job. There's less access to capital so they probably won't be able to find investors. They can blame it on AI, watch their stock price shoot up. Save a ton of money on paying humans, and make their minimum corporate loan payments.Meanwhile your classmates are drinking the AI kool aid that startups have been pumping out for decades.If an LLM can code better than a fresh graduate, there will be no reason to hire young computer scientists. I doubt your friends are thinking this far in advance.That said, there are tons of papers on how LLMs and ML are close to the limit on how effective they can be. I think all large AI companies summed together are taking about 1 Great Britains worth of power to run. That's an insane amount of energy. Elon is using coal to power Grok which is mind blowingly stupid. It's causing health problems in the surrounding community near his data centers.I think every time you want a significant improvement you need an order of magnitude training data increase, as in add another 0. 1b > 10b > 100b > 1t. One trillion is 1 thousand billions. It's not just a big number. It's a number so big that there may arguably not be enough data to train it at a certain point.When AI trains on data that AI generated it fucks itself and starts outputting shit. This is a theory as to why so many giant LLMs like claude and chatgpt are getting worse. One reason might be that the nicer version is behind a paywall, but the other is that these llms might be consuming so much AI generated text that it's degrading them permanently and there's no real way to separate human from AI generated content on a platform that has billions of users.You may actually get to watch an entire industry enshittify in under 5 years, which is pretty cool IMO. It might be a once in a lifetime event.Advances tend to be S curved in the sense that you logarithmically increase a plateau of improvement, and then you get a material advance in conditions or approaches that allow you to exponentially increase towards another limit. Vaclav Smil's book on growth is basically like reading the back of a screwdriver but it's great at illustrating this point. It's almost a law of progress given enough resources.Realistically AI will increase, but it's largest limitation is energy consumption and training data requirements. These two things are kind of inherent in ML from what I understand and a lot of what people are doing to improve ML is incrementally improving it.My theory is that there will be a new AI paradigm that will be cheaper and require less input. Remember your brain can pitch a baseball, play chopin, cook a 5 star dinner, drive a racecar, and fuck elons mom and it only runs on the amount of power it takes to run a lightbulb.My recommendation would be to recognize that your friends are idiots, the hype is a smokescreen, and to just get good at coding and pass your classes. You will more than likely struggle more than your peers in school. As the problems get harder, you will struggle less and they will struggle more. And when it comes time to get a job you will be extremely rare in that you can actually code and your peers cannot.

A degree program is best, but it can be self taught.For the vast majority of jobs you'll want to start turning your problem solving to questions like ""how can I make this the most robust?""

n4xrz63,"Well, I teach in college. The highest rate of finding a job was in the hackathon club. And the second highest rate of finding a job is in the competitive programming club. So don't feel bad.Being good at competitive programming means that you learn how to recognize fundamental problems fast and how to get to a solution fast. And how to debug complex problems fast. This is all very valuable.\> What can I actually *do* with these skills? Is there any career path that values competitive programming? Or should I just start from scratch with web dev like everyone else?Well, new flash for you. There are essentially no applications out there that are not fundamentally web applications. Today anything that is user facing is either a mobile app, a game, or a webapp. Every other kind of development are essentially in support of application developers. Why do we make operating systems? So that we can make applications to run on them! Why do we make databases? So that we can make applications better. Why do we make AI models? So that we can use them in applications.So should you learn webdev. Yes, you absolutely should. Because most applications will be web apps. Now you don't necessarily need to be extremely good at it. Especially if you are going to work in more inner layers of computing. But no one will take you seriously if you don't seem like you can cobble up some application up.I personally never really do front end work. I hate it. But the easiest way to share what you do is to set it up as a webserver of some kind. I tend to focus on the back end pieces where most of the interesting computation happens.What should you do? Where should you go? I don't know. It depends on what YOU want to do. But it seems to me that you want to solve deeper problems than making a cute applications. And good for you, I hate that shit too. How are you going to get a ob, well, you are going to need to find company that does this kind of work. You need to figure out what you care about and what you want to do.There are plenty of database companies. There is plenty of work in server administration, cloud, and infrastructure. There are plenty of needs in AI, model, development, optimization. There are plenty of jobs in various kind of data mining. We still need compiler people. I had a student hired to write kernel modules. There are a lot of ""systems jobs"".To qualify for them, you need good system understanding.

You figured out how to write some algorithm in the fastest execution time possible and out in day to day life people are writing integrations to make 2 systems talk to each other, aggregating data from 3 different databases into one export, building API's with infrastructure that scales based on user load.>Or should I just start from scratch with web dev like everyone else?Yes, its what is in demand and jobs are looking for. You are more than welcome to say ""well i don't want to learn web dev"" and attempt to land jobs on old stacks no ones taking (like winforms) but if you limit yourself to just c/c++ your options become even smaller (game dev, embedded dev...etc) as a new grad.There are backend, front end and full stack roles.

n4tf4j7,"I've tutored coding for almost 10 years (both as main job and as side gig). Here's some of the things I found from students who were in similar situations (1 hour a week schedules).I saw a comment below that said to teach them ABOUT the world of programming and computing, rather than actual programming, and I think that is the way to go given the constraints. That being said, here are some opinions/advice for IF you have to go through the programming route:\- Language Choice: Don't use Unity if they aren't going to be doing things on their own time. I tried with a student once, who specifically asked for it. The result was that nothing got done, and nothing was learned because there isn't enough time to understand concepts without homework / self learning. Sure, he could memorize some scripts, and make something move, but at that point, is that really programming? I eventually convinced him to move to Python.\- I would center my approach around the concept of ""how computers work and how to think systematically"". If you make the content of the class enjoyable, and make the learning fun/interesting, then they will want to do more on their own time. Instead of making a curriculum around ""how much can I get them to learn in this time frame?"" (As other users have said, that is no where near enough time), make it be ""How do I get them to learn a few cool stuff and develop an interest in wanting to learn more?\- The above point is why I would pick something like python, or even html/css/javascript (yes, 2/3rds of those aren't ""programming"" languages). The reason being the lower hurdle of entry to getting something they can make working, and they can see they made. I used to believe that if someone wanted to learn properly, start them in C. Nowadays, my viewpoint has changed to ""Start them in python so you can hook their interest with a lower bar of entry, and THEN dump them into a language like C#/Unity/Language of choice once they understand the basic concepts and are interested in the next steps"". Heck, if they are interested in AI, staying in python is great.\- You said you tried before and it was too confusing for them. I don't know how you explained it, but I'm going to give 2 extreme scenarios as an example. Look at this from a students point of view. \- Scenario 1: You go to class, you need to either learn what int main(int argc, char \*argv\[\]) means, or be told to memorize and learn it later. The former means needing to learn functions, args, arrays, return types, and more. The latter is encouraging not critical thinking. After that, you do printf(""Hello World"");. Then you need to learn what compiling is, and how to run the program. All that for Hello world. \- Scenario 2: you go to class, you type print(""Hello World""), and it shows up on your screen the line below. You made something. Your teacher can now introduce concepts one at a time, each with you making something. For example, maybe you introduce variables next, and create a Hello, name. Then functions, and create a print\_spam. So on. Since I was tutoring, I was able to tailor projects to each student's interests (Instead of random number generator, I can do random kpop member or something), but for a classroom, it should be more generic, and maybe more open ended as a project.\- Going to say this point again: with so little time, The best curriculum in my opinion is one that gets them interested and learning how to think critically, rather than one that dumps as much info as possible that they may or may not retain.",MagicHatJo,2025-07-24 00:46:36,29,learnprogramming,t3_1m7okmf,False,

This requires operators that return their left-hand operand for use by further operations.So basically, the stream operators exist to allow a convenient and concise way to output multiple values.In modern C++ you could accomplish the same goal with a variable-argument function using templates, but early versions of C++ didn't have the advanced template features needed to make that work.",teraflop,2025-07-23 15:24:31,53,learnprogramming,t3_1m7bu98,False,

n54t68i,"Great write-up! I’ve also been using Codefinity, and I totally agree it’s a solid platform for beginners, especially if you're starting from scratch or looking for a structured way to learn Python and other programming skills. What I appreciate most is that it's very hands-on. You can write and test your code in-browser without needing to install anything, which makes it super convenient for people who don’t want to mess around with IDEs right away.In terms of beginner-friendly platforms, Codefinity definitely ranks up there. The lessons are bite-sized, which helps with consistency and reduces the feeling of being overwhelmed. I also found the AI assistant to be surprisingly helpful. It’s great for quick explanations when you're stuck or just need something reworded. That kind of interactive support is something a lot of other platforms don’t offer, especially not at this level of integration.However, the pricing model is a bit of a downside. Like you mentioned, it’s not very transparent upfront. You get into the lessons and then suddenly find out about a subscription. I think they could do better there. And yes, some of the early Python lessons are very basic, which might not be ideal for those with prior experience. But if you push through the first few modules, the content does become more challenging and engaging.What I’d love to see from Codefinity is more intermediate and project-based learning paths especially for things like data analysis, web development with Python, or real-world app building. That would make the platform not just a good starting point but a long-term learning tool too.For anyone searching for a Codefinity review, wondering if Codefinity is good for beginners, or looking for online platforms to learn Python, I’d say give it a shot just go in knowing the pros and cons. It’s especially helpful for people who like learning through doing, rather than watching endless tutorial videos.",JoseMcMaster,2025-07-25 18:36:19,1,learnprogramming,t3_1m7yf1z,False,
n54tw0d,"Thanks for sharing your experience! I’ve been testing out Codefinity myself, and I think it’s a pretty underrated option for learning to code especially for anyone starting out with Python or just dipping their toes into programming. If you're searching for an honest Codefinity review, here’s my take::check_mark_button: **What I liked**:* The platform is clean and beginner-friendly. No need to install any software—you can code right in your browser, which saves a ton of setup time.* The course structure is well-paced. Lessons are short, interactive, and easy to digest without feeling overwhelming.* The built-in AI assistant is a nice touch. It’s not perfect, but when I got stuck or needed something explained in simpler terms, it actually helped me move forward instead of getting discouraged.:magnifying_glass_tilted_left: **Things to be aware of**:* As others have mentioned, the pricing model isn’t super transparent. You’ll probably get into the learning groove and then be hit with a subscription prompt, which can be frustrating.* The early lessons might feel *too* simple if you already know the basics. It starts very slow, but it does pick up and get more practical.:bullseye: **Why I’m using Codefinity**:My goal is to learn Python for data analysis and later move into web development. I’ve tried platforms like Codecademy and Udemy in the past, but Codefinity has been the one that’s helped me stick with a routine. The gamified elements and instant feedback really help with motivation.Overall, if you're searching for the best platform to learn Python for beginners or wondering is Codefinity worth it, I’d say yes with a few caveats. It’s great for building foundational skills, but you may eventually need to supplement it with more project-based or advanced content from elsewhere.Curious to hear what others think have you used Codefinity for longer than a few months? Did it help you move into real-world projects or jobs?

n4gr972,">my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going onThis sounds like what people call a ""mental block"", and I think learning to defuse that involves a lot more learning *how to learn* than it does learning how to do computer science. Heads up, this is probably going to sound more like I'm trying to give you therapy than anything else.**Step 1:** Validate yourself. *It is totally normal to struggle learning this*. It's a hard fucking topic, half the resources online are dogshit, and significantly more than half the people you meet online trying to talk about it are probably going to call you dumb and/or lazy. You're not. You're allowed to struggle, and in time you'll come to learn that failure is positive; but I full appreciate that it doesn't look that way right now.I'm a senior dev and data scientist. I've dropped out of multiple degrees. There are some leaderboards on leetcode-esque sites where I'm in the top 100 in the entire world. Sometimes I make mistakes that a child would laugh at.The struggle is just part of the journey, and comprehension will come with practice and time.**Step 2:** When your mind is settled and ready to be curious/compassionate, think back to that feeling of ""my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going on"" - what's *actually* going on there?What's going on is your brain throwing up barriers; an anxiety response, not necessarily a cognitive one. ""It's better to stop trying than to risk failure"", or something along those lines. I bet you do know a bit about programming. I bet you could tell me what a variable is, how to make one, probably what a function is, and so on. Remind yourself of the things you *do* understand and try to connect them to what you're currently struggling with.We beat anxiety by breaking things down into tiny little pieces until they seem surmountable. We win by starting very very simple, and going very very slow, if we have to. Every time you don't understand something, every time that ""I don't get it"" response pops up, *stop struggling*. Tend to it. Take a breath. Talk it through with yourself - break it down into the smallest, silliest subproblem you can. Address just that one tiny subproblem. Didn't work? Break it down even further. Take a break the moment you feel like you're making negative progress, because that is a real threat in these kinds of situations.**Step 3:** The real outcome we're looking for here is a mindset change, because (as much as it sucks) coming up against frustrating or overwhelming problems is just a part of doing programming. It's tempting to think ""how do I avoid this?"" but it's more productive to instead think ""how do I process this and learn from it?"" - because it is gonna keep happening.When your brain wants to say ""I don't get it"", try to reframe: you don't understand *yet,* you're still in the process of learning.

You'll improve over time.Try something simple like building a number guessing game. Add features to it: make it so you can select a difficulty which sets how wide the range of numbers are. Implement a limited number of guesses. Etc etc.Take what you learned from that and do something more complicated. Try making a shopkeeper for a fake rpg game. Add items to buy. Make them have descriptions, and a cost. Give yourself an inventory. Give yourself a wallet. Make it so you can list items in the shop. Buy said items. Maybe use CLI-style commands to buy the items. Make it so you can buy multiple at once. Add ways to earn money. Make them more complicated. Eventually turn it into a playable CLI game.There's just so many ways to learn how to code that are better than staring at tutorials all day. Learn how to think like a coder first. When you have all these requirements/constraints, sit down and think about how you might write code to make it happen. Look up how to actually do that thing you need. For the guessing game, clearly you need a random number, lets say between 1 and 10. Look up how to generate a number between 1 and 10 and store it. Look up how to get user input. Look up how to compare values. Look up how to let a player guess again if they are wrong (aka how to loop). Etc.

I'll give an example:My first project was building a game. This wasn't web (I used Python), but the same idea should apply. A bit of Googling led to me learning there was this nice Python library called Pygame. I poked around at tutorials just enough to figure out how to display stuff on the screen, and then I started designing my game - thinking about how I needed a hero, platforms, monsters, etc., how to represent those in classes, and how to draw things on the screen. A bit more Googling revealed that a game typically has a ""main"" loop with a delay at the end where the goal is to get user input, update various things (hitpoints, etc.), and draw the next frame. So I mostly figured out how to do that but had to turn to tutorials for a few things like animation and how to make jumps actually look like jumps.So you're still using tutorials, but you're using them **as needed** rather than following a long tutorial beginning to end. I do find when looking at a tutorial to help with a project, it's useful to first try out a few simple examples in a small program before incorporating into your project. So in the example I gave, maybe I'd make a small program to display images or even little filled-in circles on a screen and then try to make them move in some pattern.If you want to try full stack, Flask and sqlite are pretty beginner-friendly for the backend if you don't mind picking up Python.

n531350,"That's the wrong approach. Randomly changing things will likely break stuff.Here's the analogy. Imagine you have a car (and I'm no mechanic), and it's having some issues. You open the hood of the car, and start randomly doing stuff, hoping the problem will go away.Do you think that's a solid approach to fixing the car? Would a real mechanic do that? No, they would try to figure out what the problem is. Of course, being experienced, they have a series of tests they can do to isolate the problem and the confirm it is the problem, and they have an idea how to solve the problem.In a way, you need to do the same. Randomly changing your code is not going to fix it just like randomly doing stuff to a car engine won't fix it. You need to understand your code.Because I've taught beginners, I've seen this ""I do random stuff and hope to fix it"" before. Why do beginners try this approach even as they would admit, it won't likely work.It's because the code looks daunting. If I say, tell me what each line of code does, one step at a time. Be the computer. Do each step. To a beginner, that seems like crazy slow. It would take forever to do that (even though they wrote the code). Random fixes is a lot quicker. Do something rather than do the right thing which is slow and tedious.OK, so some steps.**Determine why you think your program is broken**I've had students who tell me their program doesn't work. When I press them, and ask ""what's wrong"", they just say it doesn't work.What they really need to say is, ""I think this is wrong because when I put in value X, I get answer Y, when I expect Z"". Those three parts are key. What input (X) did you use? What answer (Y) did you get? And what answer did you expect (Z)? This is the first step to debugging. Why do you think it's wrong?**Try a smaller input**The next step is to put in the smallest input that causes the problem. Sometimes, we'd give students some sample inputs that were pretty lengthy. Their code would break, but it was hard for them to figure what was going on because the input was so lengthy, they didn't know what part was causing the problem (imagine the input is an array of numbers).The first step is to see if it can handle the smallest input possible (say, an array with one element).**Test your functions**A smaller version is to test functions. Determine* what are the input parameters* given certain input values, what are the output values**Write more small functions**Instead of writing one big `main()`, break things up into small functions. Then, you can test each function.Write a comment for each function and give some sample inputs and expected outputs for that function.**Test as you go along**Don't write all the code with no testing, then test after you wrote all that code.

A lot of people immediately assumed this means that they are obviously training Copilot on your private data (not human eyes). But again, it's not worth the risk to a company as valuable as Microsoft to play these kinds of games.

This is an important rule because you don't want the code point U+0045 to mean the letter E in Unicode Version 3, but the letter W in Unicode Version 4. Code point reassignments would invalidate all earlier documents.If you accept this rule, then the following three desirable properties are incompatible:1. Related code points are grouped together in sets.2. Sets can gain characters in future versions.3. All assigned code points are contiguous beginning at 0.If you break rule 1, then you lose sets.If you break rule 2, then it means that if you need to add a related code point, you have to start a new set (which will probably have just that one code point in it). This basically makes sets pointlessSets are useful because they let you check things like ""Does this code point require a font that supports Cyrillic?"" more conveniently, as well as allowing those checks to continue working even when a new version of Unicode is released. Any new Cyrillic characters will take a previously-unassigned spot in a Cyrillic set. You need to update your code only if a new relevant set is defined, like ""Cyrillic Extended-B"".Sets are also useful for parallel development. If Team A is working on a new Cyrillic character, and Team 1 is working on a new Ethiopian character, they can each choose an unassigned code point from their respective sets and start writing documents with it to see how well it works. If you didn't have sets, then maybe Team A gets unofficial number N and Team 1 gets unofficial number N+1. But Team 1 gets their code point approved first, so now they have official number N, and this disrupts both Team A and Team 1 as they both have to go back and re-encode all their documents. (And we don't like re-encoding documents. See first paragraph.)Rule 3 isn't important. You shouldn't be rejecting unassigned code points anyway (except perhaps for those marked as ""permanently unassigned""). The Unicode Standard has recommendations for [Unassigned Characters](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L1999/99191.htm), namely, to treat them as generic characters with default properties. This allows your code to continue working when previously-unassigned code points become assigned.So the question is based on a false assumption: That it's important to be able to reject unassigned code points.You don't want your program to reject a person's name because it uses a newly-assigned CJK character, or to reject a product description because it uses the newly-assigned Rupee symbol *₹*.",dontwantgarbage,2025-07-23 15:39:35,2,learnprogramming,t1_n4bo25a,False,

n4x76y8,"There's just two elements crucial for recursion: \- reliable and deterministic stop condition (VERY important): a way for the function to stop using self and return a plain value, based on a condition (which you seem to have) \- calling itself in a useful way if the stop condition is not metThat's about all you need to know to implement recursion, and you seem to understand that. Now, it depends greatly on what your project is, but in a typical project there's just a few scenarios where you'd use recursion. The fundamental one is when you're working with a hierarchical data, especially with arbitrary number of levels (so a tree topography basically). This can happen with stuff like tables (where row can have sub-rows) or file system.I would personally try implementing a flattening function (i.e. turning a list structure where there's a few top level elements to begin with, but each can have some children, of which each can have some children..) and the output should be a flat list of elements (flat list of all parents and all children, of all levels). When you're done you can move on and you'll probably forget about recursion for a long time. Also, keep in mind that most conventional (i.e. not purely functional, like Haskell) languages are not necessarily built to deal with recursion natively, and using recursion can cause stack overflow (due to every call being put on stack, instead of simplified/ignored, like a language natively supporting tail-call recursion would).

n50nxv9,"TTF fonts don't contain the right kind of information to do what you want. A TTF contains curves representing the *outlines* of characters, [like in this example.](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/101761/the-description-and-interpretations-of-truetype-font-points-and-curves) If you click that link and look at the diagram of a lowercase letter `a`, you'll see that it consists of two closed curves: one defining the outer boundary of the letter, and another one for the ""hole"" inside the loop. There's no straightforward correspondence between those outlines and the pen strokes a human might use to draw a letter that looks similar. (For instance, a lowercase `t` consists of a single outline but would be drawn with two strokes. A capital `H` has one outline and is drawn with three strokes. An `O` has two outlines, and is drawn with only one stroke.)For the kanji diagrams you're talking about, somebody had to manually draw each character's strokes in a vector graphics program. This data was released for free by the [KanjiVG project](https://kanji.sljfaq.org/kanjivg.html) and now lots of other websites and apps use it.A bit of googling turned up [this project](https://github.com/brownvc/decoupled-style-descriptors) for the Latin alphabet. It includes a dataset with letter strokes from a bunch of actual people's handwriting, plus a data-driven algorithm to generate new variants by interpolating between them. You might find it useful as a starting point.Once you have the strokes, animating them is fairly straightforward e.g. by varying the SVG `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties over time.P.S. In principle, you could imagine using various computational geometry algorithms to extract the [""skeleton""](https://scikit-image.org/docs/0.25.x/auto_examples/edges/plot_skeleton.html) of a letter in a TTF font, and then try to reconstruct a set of strokes from that.

But once you have the job, use everything at your disposal to own some serious projects at the company. Make it so those projects practically rely on you for development and would cost to bring anyone to replace you. This gives you leverage and the ability to negotiate your salary to what you need.Now in terms of either learning MERN or data science or AI/ML, do all three. MERN gives you the ability to create apps. Data science gives you the ability to analyse and use large quantities of data. ML/AI gives you the ability to create more autonomous applications. You can combine all three and having all three gives you more leverage and flexibility when you want to land jobs.I speak from experience, I did an AI and robotics degree at uni. I’ve done ML and worked with current LLMs. While doing my degree I learnt the MERN stack. However my current job is a senior full stack software engineer where I use primarily next.js with sql and other tech stacks. But it can shift from different languages like Python some times too for data analysis etc.I mainly learn the MERN stack from Brad Traversy on YouTube he has great free tutorials.I believe everyone in the tech world should have at least one front-end and back-end tech they’re comfortable with so they can build stuff quickly and MERN can be the one for you.

n5c6k68,"A `set`/`{item1, item2}` in Python is what is called a hash map. It's a bit of a complex topic, so I'd suggest watching a YouTube video about it, but here's a short explanation:Imagine you have a library of books. You could store those books in a `list`. If you store those books in a list, though, you have to check every single book to see if you have `Harry Potter` in your collection. Instead, you can put those books in a `set`. Books in a set are stored in piles. Each pile contains all the books starting with the same first two letters. So, to check if you have `Harry Potter`, you go directly to the `Ha` section. You don't have to go through the entire library.Now, let's say you only want one copy of each book, and you are given another copy of `Harry Potter`. You go to the `Ha` section and check for `Harry Potter`, if it is there, you just toss your new copy.

n5cdxe2,"The key idea behind sets/maps are that they use the value itself to determine its position in the list. As an example, take a string ""Hello world"", which you want to add to the set. We call hash(""Hello World"") and it returns the hash for that string (lets just say it is number like 66457). Then, we use that hash to determine the index the string belongs in, in the list. An easy way to do this for this example is to use the modulo operator. So say, our set implementation has 10 ""buckets"" (each bucket is an element in the underlying list), we can do 66457 % 10 = 7 so we place the string ""Hello world"" in index 7 of the underlying list(i.e. we place it in bucket 7).The core idea here is that we never had to iterate through the list of buckets, we derived the index from the value ""Hello world"" itself. We dont have to look at any index other than index 7 for duplicates because (assuming our hash function is deterministic), ""Hello world"" *always* maps to index 7.However, there is a problem. Say there are 10 buckets, but we input 20 elements. Since there are more elements than there are buckets, its inevitable that some buckets will have multiple elements in them. Because of this, it is actually true that we have to do some iteration to find duplicates. If there are multiple elements in bucket 7, then we have to search the bucket to check if ""Hello world"" already exists. I'm not completely sure datastructure python uses to represent buckets though, if its lists then yeah there would be iteration but technically it could be any data structure.",greenspotj,2025-07-26 23:05:14,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ma5kqi,False,
n5cnih9,"Others have answered the question of *approximately* how Python's sets are implemented using hash tables, as a high-level overview.If you want to see how they are *exactly* implemented, the source code is all there for you to read, but it's in C rather than Python.When you call `set.add()` in Python, the corresponding chain of C functions is [`set_add`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/clinic/setobject.c.h#L435-L445) → [`set_add_impl`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L2144-L2151) → [`set_add_key`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L365-L373) → [`set_add_entry`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L122-L208). And `set_add_entry` is where the actual work happens to find the object's slot in the hash table and insert it. Python's hash tables use [open addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing), so the function needs to try multiple slots until it finds either an empty one or an existing object that's equal to the one being inserted. Sets are fast because on average, this loop will terminate after a small number of iterations, *if* the hash function gives random-looking output *and* the fraction of occupied slots in the table is not too large. In order to make sure that second condition holds, the code calls [`set_table_resize`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L253-L330) to rebuild the table with a larger number of slots whenever the table gets too full.",teraflop,2025-07-27 00:03:18,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ma5kqi,False,

n5cjjrk,"Yeah. Let's go really simple. I have a hash function that reads each byte in a value as an integer, adds them together, and then performs % 100 on that value (the remainder after dividing by 100. We'll say that this evenly distributes values across 100 possible output values. Then I have a contiguous array of 100 pointers. The result of hashing a value tells me what index that pointer is, and since I know where the array is in memory, that means the hash function tells me the exact memory address of the pointer. The pointer takes me to another memory address for a list of values. It's a list here in case I have collisions - multiple things hashing to the same value. I can reduce this by having more ""slots"" by, like, doing % 500, or % 1000, but that would be overkill if my set was only to hold 5 things. Or even 100. The chance that after I hash I need to loop through 3 values that hashed to that value isn't worth overallocating.So in a set, every value has a specific place where it belongs.

n5aafln,"First off, it's good that you are even interested ahead of time. You don't typically need to prepare much for college courses ahead of time, but if your goal is to become a programmer then it could be time well spent.I would simple start dabbling with Java a bit on your own. Lots of ways to do that.Try to find out which editor will be used in your course, and then learn how to set up a barebones project.A few things to poke around with:* Find cheat sheets for Java, and the editor. Sometimes these are useful just to focus your attention on some useful subset of those things.* Learn how to create and run a barebones project (often IDEs will have templates for this, e.g. File -> New Project > Application, or something to that effect).* Learn how to print arbitrary things to the console.* Learn about the fundamental data types. * Learn what the major options are, learn a bit about the nuances between integers and floating-point values and what the limitations are in a computer and why. (Other courses will likely cover this in greater detail, so don't get too stuck here if it's confusing at first). * Learn about `null` in Java, and its utility, risks, etc. * Learn about boxed vs unboxed types. (boxed types can be null, unboxed cannot, which can create issues that are good to know about sooner than later). * Learn how variables work, and how the values are passed around. Fundamentally all variables are copying something, but what's being copied varies based on whether you're dealing with an object or not - so as a newbie programmer you need to come to grips with this so you align your expectations, especially when you start using functions.* Learn how to use a debugger in your IDE. * This is probably my biggest tip for any programming-heavy courses. Knowing how to use the debugger will be extremely useful. It lets you stop the execution of the program at a specific line, and gives you a birds eye view of all the data that's in scope at that location, as well as the ""call stack"" (and variables in scope at those locations). Being able to see the call stack and the data in scope is your way to see a good slice of what's going on at a moment. * Another tip here would be if you have code that's doing a lot of work, or perhaps once you get to recursion, you don't necessarily need to have a specific line of code in mind, you could also simply hit ""pause"" to see where the program is at that moment that you hit pause. Sometimes this comes in handy to diagnose why something is slow. I recently used this at work to quickly diagnose a source of slowness - I reached the point in the program where there was some sluggishness, I hit pause, I looked at the call stack which gave me the first clues, and then I looked at the data in scope which explained everything. * Saves you from wildly guessing about what code changes to make when things go wrong. New programmers in college will often save assignments until the night before, and then end up pulling all-nighters because they needed more time and they run into bugs along the way and try to make changes slowly through trial and error. Using a debugger will shave off many _hours_ from those sessions of work out why something is not working.* Learn how to use assertions, and how to write code with good ""functional cohesion"". This doesn't mean using functional languages necessarily * Programming is fundamentally about ""execution"" and functions are the units of execution. So it makes sense to write code where you have really simple, crisp, easy-to-understand functions that don't try to take on too many responsibilities. * Write testable functions. A little tip is to just slap ""assertions"" at the beginning of your `main` function. That's a poor man's test suite, and a huge boon to you as a student. Have your code assert that the outputs of those functions are correct, given certain inputs. This alone will prevent you so many headaches when doing your programming projects. It will prevent a lot of instances of even needing to use the debugger, letting the debugger come in only when needed. Where people often hit walls as students is having to untangle their own mess, so the idea is that assertions on functions will be your early warning system for problems that show up as soon as you modify your code in a bad way. Lots of projects or homework will have you start coding something simple, and then ask you to make certain changes that complicate your code. Those changes can be a source of headaches for new programmers because you don't have enough hard-won foresight yet.* Knowing how to use the debugger and how to write simple assertions will supercharge you in programming classes and you will run circles around the other students who don't know those concepts. It's a very practical thing that, at least when I was in school, wasn't taught until certain courses, or was very easy for students to overlook because it's easy to get overconfident and think you don't need those things.* Use an LLM _wisely_ as a guide tailored to your exact situation. Be a proactive student here, be an ""active learner"", get the LLM to teach you, not just dump whole solutions onto you. * Another smart thing here is using the LLM to guide you through things that don't matter quite as much and that you'd have to look up anyway. For example, there's no way you'd know or easily figure out certain Java APIs. Maybe there's utility in trying to figure some of that out yourself, in terms of the ability to read docs, e.g. reading through the list of functions available and their params, but the fact is a lot of APIs are the result of someone making arbitrary naming choices.",two-bit-hack,2025-07-26 16:13:44,2,learnprogramming,t3_1m9vwnf,False,

Getting interviewed at one of these jobs without connections or a top tier degree is basically impossible. Partially because there are not nearly as many openings now as there used to be, partially because these jobs have always been somewhat like that.

n47f0rw,"I have worked at Microsoft for around 20 years. I have one child because of the hell i went though, and honestly, the career tradeoffs I made to get here were massive. I got into computers in the 80s and 90s because I loved tech. It wasn’t for money. It was about building real things. My first job I made very little with a master degree, and houses were 700k in my market so what choice did i haveToday, it feels like that’s mostly gone. The environment is toxic. Long hours. Metrics over mission. Leadership focused on checkins and politics. AI is treated as a silver bullet, but it can’t support production systems, do system-level architecture, or even explain tradeoffs. Meanwhile, junior devs are skipping fundamentals.The deeper issue is consolidation. I’ve been saying since 2010 that tech consolidation is killing innovation. Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia — they’ve absorbed everything. These companies hire away the best talent, buy or kill their competitors, and dominate infrastructure, tooling, ads, and now AI.And it’s not just technical. These same firms dominate lobbying. They block regulation, slow down privacy reform, and sideline competition. The result is fewer paths for meaningful work, less room for diverse ideas, and an industry stuck in its own gravity.If you are early in your career, ask yourself — what are you building? What will still matter in 10 years? What kind of work do you want to look back on? I’m almost 50 and only now able to pivot toward something more meaningful. Not everyone gets that chance.Big Tech is locked in a late-stage consolidation loop. The real risk isn’t that AI will take our jobs — it’s that these companies already own everything that matters.I recently spoke to an intern that quit biotech to come to microsoft because of the money. Bio tech was too long of an education for a small payoff. I did the same thing i told him decades ago (ironically it was machine learning at the time for me). Examples of consolidationMicrosoft buried Netscape in the 1990s and early 2000s. They bundled Internet Explorer with Windows and effectively crushed Netscape. The DOJ sued Microsoft for antitrust violations.Google crushed the independent web between the 2000s and 2020s. They bought DoubleClick YouTube and Android. Promoted Chrome through their services. Changed SEO and AMP to shift power away from independent websites.Amazon destroyed retail margins between the 2010s and 2020s. They used AWS profits to subsidize logistics. Cloned successful sellers. Took over cloud pricing and APIs.Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014. These were classic defensive acquisitions bought to prevent competition.Apple locked down iOS during the 2010s and 2020s. The App Store became a monopoly channel. A thirty percent fee was enforced. Alternative payments were blocked. Global antitrust cases are still happening.Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018. They took over a neutral developer platform and deeply integrated it into VS Code Copilot and Azure. This ties directly to the subject here. Google Meta and Amazon now dominate digital ads. They control over seventy percent of US ad revenue. Independent publishers lost funding. This led to lawsuits and legislation.In the 2020s the AI land grab began. Microsoft gained exclusive rights to OpenAI. Google folded DeepMind into its core cloud and search. Meta released controlled open models. Open labs cannot compete on compute or data.Regulatory capture and lobbying is widespread. These firms lead global lobbying budgets. Amazon and Google each spend around 20 million dollars per year in the US. They consistently resist antitrust data privacy and right to repair efforts.These companies buy all the AI tech. Absorb the talent. Fold it into their own platforms. The same thing happened with general tech talent. They inflated salaries and pushed smaller companies to the margins. This is not just a tech problem. Comcast charging for Netflix access is the same idea. This is why we had to fight for net neutrality.At some point hyperscalers need regulation. I am not anti capitalist. I believe in markets. But capitalism only works when it is balanced. Capital should flow to where it creates value. When one player has too much it is like poker.

In cases where I can't, you probably didn't need the tool anyway because you would've got it eventually. It's also very telling because you don't see it in any other job role. I interviewed a set of executive assistant candidates for a GM, and even in role-skill exercises, the cadence of answer, the breaking down of a problem, all is very similar. If it's a SWE and they're cheating, they're getting it right immediately, are unable to describe a solution (and then immediately turn into a CS professor), or they can explain something perfect, but cannot tell you any other way to do it - even when another approach is taught hand-in-hand and is basically a pair with a given algorithm.You would be shocked at how common cheating is. I'd say maybe 5-10%, with more new grads cheating than experienced hires.

There are even periodic calls to ban or flair or otherwise discredit new grads or junior developers for being too pessimistic due to ""not having enough experience"", even though they are, by far, the largest part of the industry and the greatest indicator of it's health.Even today, anyone who dares complain about the state of the industry is often derided for being mediocre, told that ""there are no problem for goOd dEvelOpErs"" and fed other pointless misinformation. Most developers are somewhere around average. This average has risen a lot over the past ten years. If these people can't find jobs, the industry has a problem. It's really that simple. Tech isn't going to die as an industry, but macroeconomic trends mean that it's only going to become more competitive for developers.",ObjectBrilliant7592,2025-07-20 08:13:02,12,cscareerquestions,t3_1m4dv4r,False,

Towards the end of the project, the deadline would loom, and the real problems would start to appear.You’d enter “crunch mode”, which truly sucked, deeply sucked horribly. This could go on for a month or two. Eventually you’d launch and settle back into the beginning phase of a new project. This was a HUGE relief. Then you’d do it all over again.Sounds bad? Well enter Agile which aimed to solve these problems, supposedly. How? By turning everything into a constant drip of 2 week sprints. Every sprint is a deadline.

Our RTO policies changed and I started coming in every day and it made a huge difference. Beyond that, nothing helped more than becoming a subject matter expert. Try to find a niche that you can learn more about than anyone else. Is there a part of your job processes that feels like toil, or takes a long time, or nobody seems to fully understand? Spend some time trying to improve that thing. Research alternative tools, try to write documentation (the kind you wish were there for you right now), see if you can reverse engineer it.You will probably get stuck early on, or feel like you're missing some fundamentals, but that's okay. Ask questions when you can, and keep chipping away at it. Eventually, when you have something that you think is an improvement over what's there (probably won't be all that hard to get to that point to be honest) you can let it be known that you've created a new resource or process, and get some people to review it. Chances are good you'll end up being a go-to person for that thing in the future. You'll have very experienced devs coming to you for help/advice/best practices in that domain.From there you'll probably incidentally pick up a lot through the process.

It's not walking into a tech conference, exchanging business cards, and aggressively shaking hands. It's not cold messaging people asking for some awkward ""coffee chat"" even though you both know you're just trying to milk them for a job.That feels fake as hell because *it is* fake as hell. But it's also not networking.Our network is made up of our *friends, family, and colleagues*.That's it. So in order to ""network"" you expand upon 1 of those 3 categories. The family category's tough to expand, you're kinda stuck with it. The colleagues one you expand throughout your career as you work with people. The people you've met and worked closely with in college also count as colleagues (even if they're *both* friends and colleagues). The professor you saw weekly in office hours, or the TA you had a good connection with are colleagues.The ""friends"" category is by far the easiest to expand. You expand this category by.... making friends. That's it. There's nothing more to it. They don't need to be technical either. Someone working in sales is able to refer someone to SWE. They're character checks for the company, not skill checks, that's why they still interview you. Hiring unknowns off the street is risky for companies, because character-red-flags are easily hidden and don't come out for months. Hiring someone that an employee they already like is vouching for is significantly safer.The reason meetups are so commonly suggested is because getting into a room with a bunch of people that all have a shared interest is a great way to *make friends.* If you go to those thinking you're gonna get a LinkedIn connection, you're not going to make any friends *or* connections. Go into those because you're interested in X, and the friends will follow. Doesn't need to be technical either. Go to a rock climbing meetup, go to a model train meetup, hell, go to your local dive bar and buy a stranger a drink and get to chatting. I've made life-long friends that way.The bad news is none of this is a quick fix. Making friends takes time.

n4rpxe9,"Not ""nowadays"", but ""always"". I'd go so far as to say it's only a matter of time at every company.It's a very common pattern for management/upper-management to get replaced, and for a company to tighten the belt and shift their culture to the toxic-side.That part's out of our control.What's in our control is how we react to it.WLB is my #1 priority. Even if a company tries to turn up the heat, and introduce toxic expectations.... I don't let it alter my WLB. I do the best work I can from 9-5, M-F. That's non-negotiable. Management can scream about deadlines, ping me after hours, etc all they want. Doesn't change anything about how I behave. At most a 5:30pm text will get is a ""OK, will take a look tomorrow morning"".There's an extremely clear divide between my work life and my personal life. This divide lets me disconnect after 5pm, no matter how much BS is going on during the work day, no matter how stressful it gets. That stress waits around for 9am the following work day.I've had companies ""tighten the belt"" before, but I've always stood my ground. If they fired me over it? Oh well, the culture was toxic anyways and I was already looking for another job. But in reality they never did. The last time this happened I even got a pretty massive *raise*.Toxic management *loves* to take advantage of people that don't establish any sort of boundaries. Really they'd be stupid not to, it's free labor. But when you establish boundaries as the employee, more often than not, nothing's going to happen.So whenever this happens to your company's culture, firstly establish boundaries and stick to them in the short-term to keep yourself sane.

It might guess wrong sometimes and do some wasted work, but overall things happen way faster than if the cpu was just waiting around.Another analogy is like competitive games/sports.

AI has a lot of flaws but if used properly, its a tool to augment a developer...not replace. People hyping AI like its going to replace people either have a vested interest in seeing AI succeed (and we are using AI loosely here, they are hyping up LLLMs), parroting the hot takes they see online for engagement, or haven't really ever coded anything beyond a basic todo list app.Also, my advice is to not utilize AI while you learn. Just like lifting weights, your brain is a muscle and if you never learn how to learn, and AI can't figure out the problem, your going to be SOL. Utilize your time in college to learn how to figure things out and think critically, don't let AI do that for you. I tutored online for 3 years and the number of students that utilized AI for their learning but had no clue what was going on was huge, they are likely now running into issues finding work because if they manage to land an interview, they certainly aren't passing them.My view, there is going to be a lot of work in 5-10 years fixing applications built utilizing AI because everyones mandating it be used in the work place to make devs more effective. Theres already been studies where usage of AI has been a net negative in productivity. Personal annecdoate, worked on an application where a guy vibe coded an integration into sales force in c#, in order to find a patients next appt date, it had to look back through all 35 years of patient data (all patients) in order to find one patients future appt date.

Balance hobbies and hanging out with friends, forgetting about anything career related during those times. This should give you a boost of confidence. Also, you have to attend networking events in your area.

n584ota,"So to start, this can vary a lot from person to person, but this may take a fair amount of time to pan out. With today's market, you got to be pretty competitive (4-5 years ago, you had a better chance of ""getting lucky""). Working full-time is a pain, and even putting just 10 hours a week into transitioning into SWE can be hard. All-in-all, I wouldn't be surprised if it took you over a year to line up your first job.I will say though, as a self taught dev with no degree, you got some strengths here: You have a CS degree and you've been working a job that will generally look respectable on a resume. I do think you have a pretty healthy shot at transitioning into SWE, but the market is bad and it's pretty rough out there.I'll assume you have some rough experience with programming (how to reasonably use classes, functions, if statements, for loops), or at the very least, all that will come back to you pretty quickly.If you want to get into fullstack, I would start off by focusing on Java / Springboot for backend, JavaScript / React for frontend, and use Git. I would ***probably*** recommend taking a Udemy course (I never personally tried Udemy, but I often hear good things) for both React and Springboot. You can just watch a YouTube tutorial for Git. Try to get to a point where you can work on a project pretty consistently. Just have one project you're pretty committed to.After that, there's interview prep. Go through the roadmap on https://neetcode.io (mainly focus on the video explanations, don't waste a ton of time trying to solve questions yourself at this stage). After the roadmap, do some random questions LeetCode, and try to get to a spot where you have like an 80% chance of solving an unfamiliar medium-level problem in under 60 minutes (if you haven't solved it after 2 hours, just look up the answer and try to think where you went wrong).More than anything else though ***talk through the problems***. You wanna be good at ""solving"" problems because sometimes you get ""assessments"" (basically you have to solve a LeetCode problem before getting to interview anybody), but for ""interviews"" you need to be good at talking technical. You should look up ""mock coding interviews"" on YouTube interviews to see what mean here.You should start applying before you're 100% confident with anything though (you're never going to be 100% ready to start applying). In fact, I would honestly recommend you just start sending out like 3 applications a week ***right now***. Just half ass it, get it out of the way, and get used to it. Don't waste too much time ""waiting to feel ready"" (I wasted a lot of time on this back in 2021).For your resume, skim through the wiki on r/EngineeringResumes. You'll have to adjust a bit though because of your background, but do what you can to leverage your current work experience (be detailed), and mainly try to sell yourself as ""an important team member that holds some key responsibilities and/or accomplishments"". I know that can be really awkward, but again, I think you got quite a respectable role.And finally, as far as applying goes, apply to any role that looks reasonably relevant, doesn't look too ""specialized"", and asks for less than 5 years of experience.

Maybe I'm taking the wrong courses. But yeah, I just started learning Java with Spring Boot tonight. Decided to do a common project (Making a Letterboxd ""clone"") , but rather than watch a video tutorial, I'm using chatGPT to learn. At first, it's been giving me a bunch of code snippets to paste and I'm going through with that to learn the process in how to make a project from start to finish with a backend and frontend, but I think moving forward, I'll ask it to give me less code snippets and more just explain concepts and theories with examples without the code directly related to the project I'm working on. Perhaps I'll try to get the fundamentals down again, maybe make a solid project or two (Nothing too crazy) and then start applying within the next week or two.

For whatever reason, I could not adapt to what it took to pass interviews.The random trivia questions just get me. I don't have memorized small little stuff like making random SQL queries verbally or specific syntax or concepts for coding languages. I've gotten better at it studying and getting live interviews for months - even then I'm still missing questions sometimes. I HATED that feeling of completely blanking out on something that sounds easy, but the pressure and the fact I just Google this stuff when I need it at work made it so hard for me.Part of it was me stretching the truth in my resume, but early on they wanted me to be able to talk more deeply about CI/CD, and cloud/devops + QA experience. I just didn't know that stuff and lost a lot of early interviews bc of that. After I studied some major concepts and talking points - it was good enough for most interviews but some people would DIG in and expose me.I'd get a small coding live assignment that would be similar to a homework you'd get in first/second year college - but you have 10-15 minutes to do it.

A legit CS program is 30 hours of graded assignments per week, timed exams, testing of theoretical knowledge and practical skill, plus weed out calculus/chemistry/physics failing the bottom 1/4. Tests your work ethic. You're a beginner like I was. Doesn't matter anyway, you don't get hired in CS without a CS or Computer Engineering degree, which is harder and also overcrowded.",NewSchoolBoxer,2025-07-20 08:47:12,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1m4jbcv,False,

n488tmm,"I'm based in the US, studied Math, and am transitioning into CS. I would say definitely go the CS route. If your country has a bias towards math degrees that's something to consider, but CS is prolly just a lot easier to convert into concrete/hard skills than math especially with respect to getting a job out of any of this. I actually really love math and theoretical CS, if you angle your CS course load correctly you could essentially study the overlap of both fields (Type theory and functional programming in CS has strong relationships with Logic and Category Theory in Mathematics). If you at all consider moving to another country, CS will prolly be a lot more immediately transferable.Unless you're interested in some specific fields of mathematics that don't lead into the CS route/lead into other career routes (analysis, probability theory, etc), go the CS route.Also as someone wanting to one day go into CS grad school, getting into CS grad school from math may not be impossible but it feels like it's definitely not as direct as having a CS bachelors ;-;Honestly, to me, CS and programming feels like applied algebra. Especially if you go in the functional programming direction and have a nice, strongly typed language with things like algebraic data types, designing a program getting statically analyzed by a compiler feels like algebraic mathematical thinking. Even if you're more of an imperative programmer or like low-level stuff, math actually is even farther away from that. So if you want to learn mathematics in some sense to widen your perspective, a well thought out CS course load and maybe some reading on the weekend can definitely do that.

Since these interviews can involve some tricky scenario-based questions that require thinking on your feet, I actually built [interview AI](http://interviews.chat) to help people navigate exactly these kinds of technical discussions and practice articulating their problem-solving approach in real-time.",akornato,2025-07-26 05:53:24,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1m9hh42,False,

n56an96,">It's become clear that getting a solid industry job, is a lot harder these days without a CS degree. The bootcamp/self-taught path (even if it's associate degree) rarely works anymore unless you're exceptional.It's almost impossible without a CS or Computer Engineering degree. Every entry level job gets over 100 applications so HR filters by degree for a sanity check. I like your plan.>as eventually staff/principal SWEI don't think that's what most people really want. At Team Lead, I was working 50 hours per week with 15-20 hours of meetings. I had responsibility to my team and the whole business unit such as tracking work intake and discussing if defects could impact other departments. For 10% more pay. Then it's a pyramid, rank in Top 10% of employees at your grade for a chance of making Principal. You made it that far? Now get 5 DMs per day of people asking you for help who will blame you if you don't. Be married to the job.>That said, I enjoy the field (I genuinely like math, I like coding (just not obsessed)) Me too. Coding isn't my hobby. I like it but it's just a job. I'd rather do most anything else in my free time. I don't know an accountant who does accounting for fun when they go home. I stepped up my math and statistics knowledge.
