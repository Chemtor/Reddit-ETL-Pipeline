msdz10t,"I have a recent real world example of this, I think.I work with data from social media platforms. Instagram just deprecated their “plays” and “impressions” metrics and replaced them with a new metric called “views”.“Plays” was already a replacement for an older metric called “video_views”, and “plays” measured initial plays on Reels only. The new “views” metric includes replays. There was another metric deprecated called something like “reels_aggregated_plays” which included replays on Reels and therefore matched the new “views” metric.Also new “views” populates for post types that traditionally wouldn’t get “video_views” because they aren’t technically videos: think carousels, images. New “views” are basically “impressions” but they’re higher than impressions for reasons we don’t really understand yet.For almost a decade now we’ve been charged with creating cross-platform data sets that measure total video views. How do we do this when the metric you’ve always used for video views no longer exists, and views happen for more than just video? What we’re saying was a video view in March 2025 is not the same as what we’re saying was a video views in May 2025My point is: this sucks ass. How are you going to validate these changes and explain the data to stakeholders?

msc6kfj,"I’m a DS so what do I know. But here’s my two cents.I work at an org with a hybrid cloud approach. We have on-prem data, some data is in Oracle or db2, and my division mostly lives in Synapse.The Synapse data is often pulled from those other sources (via Synapse Pipelines or stored procedures), cleaned (usually in SQL, sometimes in pandas), and finally dumped into a table.Notice - there’s no bronze layer. I think this is the definition of ETL since we transform before we load. I could be wrong.What’s nice about this workflow: it minimizes costs and it reduces cognitive burden since, there’s fewer intermediate tables.What stinks about this workflow: it’s hard to reason about data lineage and there’s little to no audit trail. Where does this variable come from? Have to dig deep in some low level db just to find the source. If a table churns out questionable data, where did the mistake happen? Is it in the transformation logic, or was there some miscommunication with the source table? Again, tricky to understand. So while having a dumping ground for raw  data seems redundant and can introduce extra expenses, sometimes it’s worth it. I believe that pattern is called ELT, since you load the ugly raw data into a new source system before cleaning it.Another benefit of the bronze layer or ELT approach is that it can reduce the number of ad hoc queries against the low level transactional database, which slows everything down. And having the raw data under the same roof as your data warehouse’s clean data, again, opens up new forms of exploratory analysis.A nice compromise, instead of having permanent intermediate tables, is to have trunc and load tables that are refreshed at regular intervals. That way the data doesn’t eat up so many costs, but there’s still an audit trail for testing and observing data lineage.",BrisklyBrusque,2025-05-14 21:00:15,8,dataengineering,t3_1kmq1ew,False,

The reason is not so much the pleasure of starting a new project with them or the time it saves when starting. It is rather the ease of on-boarding a new member into an established tool, instead of spending months training the person to a highly specific home-cooked solution. I am also speaking from experience of being on-boarded into this kind of home-made complex ETL.Scala had some history as a DE language because Apache Spark main UI used to be its Scala API. Then it introduced a Python API with similar performance, so the complexity of Scala could not be justified, and the language is globally dying for all its niche use cases, as far as I know.So for me, it's not really a question of language, Python and SQL are consensual kings and here to stay.

Just because it’s used a lot doesn’t necessarily mean people like it a lot. Python is a very easy language to get up and running with, which is (in my opinion) why people who aren’t Software Engineers (ie data analysts/scientists) use it. Since it’s used so much by them, the data ecosystem ends up using it a lot in general, so it then bleeds over to tools used by actual engineers.I personally loathe python for basically the same reasons you outlined.

ms4t471,I think the flip side of this is that python makes it easier to write extremely unopinionated highly meta sort of systems that just eat up basically anything they get given. Doing this same sort of thing in other languages is much harder and almost immediately devolves into an explosion of complexity that can quickly become very hard to maintain and understand. Other languages are all fine and good when all your data is super well behaved and you have control of it at every layer. Python really is the goat for handling flaky weird sorts of stuff coming from systems outside of your control. This is why Python has largely won this particular race. Real world data doesn’t always have nice structure to code up as some nice fixed schema and you still need to be able to handle it.That said certainly there is a move within Python to use pydantic as the core serialization and deserialization system that builds basically better data class objects. Then your actual business logic Python code can simply check that it receives an object of the type it expects irrespective of internal complexity of those objects and their construction.,TheRealStepBot,2025-05-13 18:17:18,3,dataengineering,t3_1klpzaf,False,

We had legacy C# desktop stuff, legacy web stuff (ASP.NET/PHP/ColdFusion), and more modern web stuff for the time (ASP.NET + Angular). I still used to write a lot of data engineering-like tasks in this job - financial services, so tons of integrating with SFTP servers and writing/ingesting XML everywhere. Heavy SQL Server stuff underpinned all of this, which is how I ended up in data. My track in data was BI developer -> data engineer in wealth mgmt (Python/BigQuery/dbt) -> data consultant (Azure/Databricks/Synapse) -> tech lead in retail (Python/BigQuery/dbt) -> senior engineer in security for retail org (Python/BigQuery/dbt for analytics, Splunk for SIEM + security automation). I am a very code-heavy data engineer. Everything I do is in code except for dashboards, which I wish I could change. Regardless - and I get downvoted into oblivion here a lot for saying this - I don't view data engineering as anything close to software engineering. The needs, requirements, and use cases are all entirely different. Your average software engineer will fail even the most basic data modelling task these days. Most don't know SQL or even touch a database directly. Your average data engineer will struggle with anything beyond a basic CRUD app. They are different specialties and the code for data pipelines is simpler by many orders of magnitude. I have watched this time and time again with data engineers thinking they can just switch between the two. I even think if I tried to go back to my old ways in the C# ecosystem I would have a really hard time (forgetting that I'm about 10 years older now...) Any pivot is possible, but keep in mind it will take a long time. It took me something like five years to fully move to data engineering after a complete reskill, and that was still with my prior SQL history. I was just lucky that I had all the soft skills in my back pocket so I could get promoted easily. re: stakeholder stuff, I've always had to do things and figure out requirements on my own, so I think you need to develop that part of your brain a bit.",mailed,2025-05-12 05:26:22,34,dataengineering,t3_1kkip1h,False,

Aside that, in both cases I had to talk with stakeholders to gather requirements and have to understand hard skills to design, deploy, debug and optimize my solutions. In that meaning I think that data engineering is a subset of a software engineer, you need to know which SWE tools you should focus to solve your specific problem. That is the same for any engineer such as a front-end, back-end, computer graphics or embedded devices.Personally having experience as both for me makes me able to talk with any kind of engineer to understand how data is generated and how it can be integrated in any part of a system (from internal data generation until front-end).

If transformed in python, then also depends how custom is the transformation framework. The more custom the more SWE. Here also a lot of data analytics and modeling.- Serving data’s - same as ingestion- infra - more dev ops- security …So to sum it up: data engineering is very broad discipline.

Postgres for sure is one of those, but for your use case you'd want an Analytic (OLAP) Database so you could use Clickhouse.Doing rankings is a typical analytic task with a window function. Establishing relationships, the full table scan part is just part and parcel of what a traditional database does but you going in and actually mapping the relationships you could use a CTE. Better yet would be something like dbt (data build tool).Now I'm not saying you'll be accessing all 225G's at once in which case *maybe* you won't hit your 32G of system memory limit. I'm not sure queries you do plan on running. But to be on the safe side just use a traditional analytic server like Clickhouse and if it turns out that the queries you end up running don't have huge joins or aren't working with tables that are 60gigs at a time in size then you can just use DuckDB.Edit: How you end up modeling this data and what queries you run against it might be a separate issue. I think the baseline technical aspect is to get you up and running. Actually one thing I hadn't considered is you can just keep running everything in Postgres since it's already in it, and then use DuckDB with the postgres extension known as pg\_duck[https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/postgres.html](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/postgres.html)",data4dayz,2025-05-16 23:55:48,2,dataengineering,t3_1kodif8,False,
mspw4xq,"> orbits/predictions that would require going through the entire database more than once to establish relationships between planets/stars and calculate distances based on multiple columns and making sub queries based on the resultsThis aspect sounds like you want to step out of SQL for some steps, or at least generate intermediate tables. Generating a subquery based on the results of another query isn't really how CTEs work - a CTE just creates a view or 'virtual table' that you can query from. The 'going through the entire database more than once' sounds like you want to do some kind of iterative work, where you want to save the results at each step and move on.This doesn't necessitate using a particular DB, but you might want to think about how you would approach some of these things in another language. Using Python, for instance, lets you make use of many different tools that work well together, it will let you take an imperative approach to calculating things, and you'll be able to easily write output data to files and review them using csv/jsonl/parquet formats.You would also be able to set up long running processes to be done incrementally. Say you create a list of all systems 'A' to calculate the distance to all other systems 'B' - if this would take a long time, you can store a table with which 'A' systems have been done. Then your imperative program can just find the next 'A' system to calculate, and do the calculations for that. This sort of chunking might make processing more resilient to timeouts or memory issues.> if making multiple smaller tables with a few columns (5-10) or a single one with all columns (30-40) would be bestIf you land on columnar storage like parquet, or duckdb's internal storage, then it doesn't matter how many columns you have. Their data layout means that all the data for a column is stored together, so it can completely skip over columns you don't need. The general tradeoff with columnar systems is they often make it a bit slower to pick out individual values. So if your main way of using the data is to grab out the data for a specific system, this isn't as efficient.If you have a row-based store then you might be better served with multiple tables if you can organise columns into groups that are often used together. For example if coordinates aren't often used in conjuction with other columns, but you want to do a lot of work comparing coordinates, then you could split that off to its own table. If all the tables share the same primary key, and you make sure they are all indexed the same, it should be fine to perform joins between these tables. This is likely a relatively small optimisation, since it really just makes disk reads a bit more efficient.> The best database option that would basically be read only...This mostly means that something based on columnar-storage will be fine. You aren't updating rows, so you don't need anything transactional. It doesn't preclude row-based systems either, so essentially everything is open to you.If postgres is working for you, just keep it in there. That's fine.SQLite probably won't work - it doesn't have a compressed format, and you'll likely run into issues with the large data volume relative to disk size.If most of what you are doing is running through lots of data at once, then you could convert the tables to parquet files and query with something like DuckDB, Polars, or Daft. Each of those also make it easier to script with python and exchange data from an sql processing model to an imperative one in python. Daft may have a benefit that it has a built-in method to spread execution to multiple processes on your machine, so if something goes oom it can recover and retry, and can spill intermediate steps to disk.Or, as others have mentioned, you could add an extension for duckdb to get data via postgres.---In general, I'd leave things in postgres for now and see if you can point things like DuckDB at it, and see how their processing model works for you. Polars [can connect to a database](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/api/polars.read_database.html) and [so can Daft](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/integrations/sql/). If you're going to hit OOM issues it will happen in this processing step regardless of how the data is stored, so if you try out a few different processing engines working off of the existing postgres data, you might find what works for you.If any of these tools work for you, then you might consider shifting the data to parquet format as it may be smaller to store and more efficient to read. Every one of these can write data out to parquet ([duckdb](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/guides/file_formats/parquet_export.html), [polars](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/api/polars.LazyFrame.sink_parquet.html), [daft](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/api/dataframe/#daft.DataFrame.write_parquet).",azirale,2025-05-17 00:37:35,1,dataengineering,t3_1kodif8,False,

I would find the mid-point for a given crag (or section if it’s really big or they are far apart etc) and just map that weather prediction by “area”. That will simplify things A LOT.

All of which are *mostly* identical in schema, but not totally? Our group is pretty good in dbt and managing CI/CD with it. But handling the replication is what's slowing me down on this project, and all these expensive tools do a lot more than replication, so in a way we don't really need all that functionality if we are cool with dbt (or maybe eventually sqlmesh but IMO it's not quite mature enough yet to where I want to use it at large scale, but maybe that's being overly conservative).

In cell-based architecture, we develop various products and services in these cells that contain a grouping of cloud-based resources.

You can mock database connection and data to test the AWS Lambda Function code without production data or the live database connection.That being said, if you're testing things like canned reports, dashboards or even ML process, then you just need to look into generating dummy data or completely anonymizing the data much like they do in healthcare.

Although they’ve implemented a few more training sessions for newer employees, it still does not seem sufficient.

Heck, single enterprise SSDs can be a lot bigger than that these days. But it depends on how much compute you need to do. Also depends on the size of your host / VM / whatever. But a modern mid to high end server can have hundreds of cores and hundreds of GB of RAM and dozens of TB of storage. I generated a certain well-known benchmark dataset at 100TB scale on a single VM once, only took like a day or two with brute force and ignorance. Granted, that VM was either one of the insane Msv2 Azure VMs, or maybe a Standard\_D96ds\_v5, been a while. And those don't come cheap if you don't work for the cloud :D .You still do have to think about multi-threading or multi-processing here - but can maybe avoid networking.B) You could try to adapt Spark APIs to SLURM.It's by no means an *easy* thing to do.

You can mitigate this to some extent by using more partitions, so that the work is more spread out. To get the benefit of the partitions, you need to either provision more instances of the consumers, or have a mechanism to increase the number of instances when work increases across multiple partitions. This will increase your operating costs.The extent to which hot partitions matters depends on the characteristics of your system and the context in which you work.

mrwncjc,"You should read about Git itself, what it's purpose is, and how it works fundamentally. Git is the actual tool here, it's an industry standard version control methodology. Github is just one of many tools that harness the power of Git. You can practice using Git directly on your own machine without using any other tool (and without even using code) if you want. You can just use a text file and practice committing and merging changes to the text via git.The basics are, essentially: You have a code base. You want to make one or many changes to that code base, but you want to keep the current state intact so you dont lose your functionality. You create a branch, which is an exact copy of that same code base. You make your changes to the branch. You test the branch. If it's a failure, it doesn't matter because the ""main"" branch hasn't been modified yet. When you get it to work properly, you merge your branch into the main branch. Now your main branch reflects the changes you've made. Repeat. It gets a little more complicated when you've got many people working on many branches at a time, which is when the pull requests and reviews come into play. That stuff exists so that someone who is familiar with the code base can be a second set of eyes, check your work, make sure there aren't conflicts with other people's work, etc. The whole construct exists so there is an easy way to do parallel development work on the same code base without actually changing the working code before the changes have been tested and reviewed.",omfghi2u,2025-05-12 13:01:58,226,learnprogramming,t3_1kkrb3i,False,

mrwqqjz,"I think when trying to learn it often ends up sounding more confusing than it actually is as a concept. Obviously there are layers and layers of complexity but at first I would try to understand at its core what it is. Imagine there’s a massive library of handwritten books and your team need to make various amendments to different ones. Someone has written a list of requirements for you. Your team divides up the tasks. Your first task is to remove any mentions of parrots from “My Life as a Hamster (1974)” - don’t ask why. Better not to ask too many questions in this team. To do that, you check out the single book (My life as a hamster) from the library and tell everyone else you’re doing it for transparency. You do your stuff. Now you could just go and pop the book back on the shelf as you’ve finished but what if you’ve made a mistake? Instead you put it in a little box for “review” and your other team mates can have a look and check they’re happy with your work. Once they are, it goes back in to the library. Yours is now the correct version for that book. Of course you don’t want to shut down the entire library while you do your job which is why this strategy of checking one book out, making changes, getting it reviewed and putting it back in works well. Everyone can be doing different tasks at the same time. The library itself remains central and “pure” - hopefully with your robust review box, no mistakes are getting in. The library is a single point of truth - everything in there has been approved and checked and is correct. Any mistakes are picked up in review. Now instead of a library, as a developer, what you’re working on is digital. It means that people are working on all different books (files). Sometimes people might even be working on the same book but doing a different task. While you’re doing your hamster task, someone else is updating page numbers in all rodent books including your hamster one. Sometimes this can cause a bit of confusion if you make changes to the same page but luckily Git gives you a nice simple (ish) way to fix these and decide which changes to keep when there’s such a conflict.Most importantly, to reiterate, despite all these complicated changes all happening at once, the library itself is pure and “correct” - because people cannot make changes and put the book back. They need check out books, make changes, then put it into the review box (make a pull request) and others in the team must approve it before it goes back in (gets merged in) to the library. It may help, moving away from the library analogy, to imagine the alternative. Imagine word documents named version1, version2 etc. imagine everyone trying to change it at once. Everyone saves their own local copy. But someone else has changed the same bit you were going to. Whose bit goes in? Soon nobody has any idea which version is the right one. People are no longer copying the original. - they are copying version 17. But oh wait, while you were doing something, version 18 became available and now all those changes aren’t in yours.",Schwicke,2025-05-12 13:22:14,22,learnprogramming,t3_1kkrb3i,False,

I'll use some Free Pascal as an example, because that is unfortunately my favorite language to work with. In C/C++ // no ternary if (X > Y) { return X; } else { return Y; } // ternary return (X > Y) ?

What I did was to set myself projects which interested me that we adjacent to the kind of tasks I'd be doing in a job. In my case it was an analysing books to understand the relationships between characters. I also had other ideas around web-scraping for data journalism type use cases.

You can develop a JAVA app on Windows, Linux, MacOS and be reasonable certain it will run in the Android OS.I would ague against C++ as the king of the OS, C is more the king of the OS development. Mostly because all the popular OSes were developed when C++ had more overhead and ran slower, so writing the code in C avoided those issues. You really don't want your OS to be slowing you down. The Linux Kernel for example is all C and now Rust maybe, I'm not sure. I suspect Windows is all C. These days C/C++/Rust are good because they compile down to native CPU instructions so your program has the least amount of overhead. There is a cost however, in that you have to handle idiosyncrasies between hardware and OSes yourself. This may be as simple as just compiling for that hardware, but can have other issues.C# and games I have no comments on. My guess would be time to market, some programming languages let you produce code faster with fewer bugs, the code may not run as fast as code written in another language, but as long as it runs ""fast enough"" then people will buy it, the company will make money, and the developers will get paid, so everyone is happy.",pixel293,2025-05-14 17:50:16,8,learnprogramming,t3_1kml1l7,False,

msbd8iz,"It just depends. You have the enshrined problem (this language is used for this field, so all the tools use that language, and at some point its hard to 'break in' with another language to do the same thing, even if it would be great for it). You have the 'no can do' problems, like java has a ton of things it simply will not do without arm twisting and work arounds, like operator overloading. Not a big deal you say? Consider some linear algebra: AX=B. In C++, that could look like B = A\*X; In java that has to look like B.assign(A.multiply(X)); Now imagine an equation with 5 or 6 pieces in it written the java way... it looks nothing like the math and is hard to write, hard to read, and hard to maintain. There are several other key things java does not directly support that make it frustrating to use for some tasks, including a bizarre workaround just to have an unsigned int. Java has nice stuff too, though: it works pretty cleanly on various OS without the frustration that some C++ projects can present when porting. C# is tied heavily to windows, and windows has 'won' the gaming audience by and large. Less so today, but like the enshrined problem with languages, gaming is enshrined in windows very heavily (compared to other desktop OS). Between that and game engine support and native OS tie in, it has a leg up right away. Then you add in the pointers and other support that push it towards C++ and away from java's rigid approach, and its performance, you start to see why it pulled into the gaming industry. Java got (and deserved) a bad rep early on for being slow, and while that has been fixed in a broad sense, it still suffers from the rep and the reality (it still isn't as fast as c++ when push comes to shove). So to sort of try to answer.. its a mix of the language's performance, tools, design, and so on alongside an almost 'social' problem of getting a foothold in an area that is already dominated by something else. New languages come and go, but the ones that stick and are used heavily in any field get there by being better than what was used before.

mrvxgcc,"You not only need to ""learn programming"". Learning a programming language is like 1% of what you need to learn. The most important aspect you have to acquire is thinking like a dev. Problem solving skills above all else. Languages are the easy part, especially these days where like 70% of the main languages follow the same syntax and if you're able to use one, you'll get used to another one in a few days (OOP related). Besides that, most jobs not only ask for a language, but a specific set of technologies such as Docker + Kubernetes + GCP + Java + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL. Learning development isn't learning a language, it's learning to solve problems. How you solve those and which tools you use is another topic and most of the time you can choose between multiple tools to solve the same task. Another - in my opinion - important aspect is that you need to be able to explain complex tech heavy topics as simple as possible without using the word ""code"" once. Many companies work in agile environment with different products, roles and departments and you'll have a lot of meetings where you have to explain what you did in simple terms so that every PO understands it. In your case, you should first find out what you're lacking the most, which will probably be problem solving skills as it is for most devs. If you have not even build a single private project yourself once, it's very unlikely that you're ready to work in a professional development environment in a year. Developing a private project and developing a b2b project as an example are totally different worlds. But thats just my take. Ask 10 devs and all 10 will have different opinions and approaches. The most important question right now which you should ask yourself is ""what exactly do I want to achieve?"".",IsRealPanDa,2025-05-12 09:37:23,9,learnprogramming,t3_1kkly00,False,

Imagine you try to write an app that opens a window, shows a pink screen, then a special effect and changes to blue. If I'm in a new language first I look at how to write a function in general. Assume we do this in python. So, at this point I only know the function syntax work, what do I do next? def makeItPink(): pass def showEffects(): pass def makeItBlue(): pass def main(): makeItPink() showEffects() makeItBlue() main()Then I thought about it and got to the conclusion ""to make a window pink, how do I get a window first?""Lookup for frameworks for GUI, choose some one and realize that I should create the window before and pass around the handler in my main, so I modify: def createWindow(): return GuiFramework.Window.new() def main(): handler = createWindow() makeItPink(handler) showEffects(handler) makeItBlue(handler)The idea is that you split what you are trying in the different steps you currently understand that happen in your app, then you try to refine every step one by one. In the process you introduce as many axillary undefined functions as you need. At every step, if you got stuck in something, you leave it as an undefined function and continue with the rest. Eventually you reach a point where no more undefined functions are left except the problematic ones and you focus on them. This doesn't apply for big projects, but people planning big projects learned how to design them by doing things! The most important part of the process is that you move to do things! Otherwise (at this beginner stage you are) you get stuck forever and don't improve!Note: If you are refining your steps and you have to see a tutorial about it, do it.

You want everything right now and without effort. You probably spent more time searching for an effortless solution than just doing simple exercises.## How do you use FPThe answer is simple: if you want to ""edit something"", you create a copie with the new values you want.Imaging doubling the elements in a list. In procedural programming, like C, you would do: ```Cfor(int i = 0; i < myarray.size(); ++i) { myarray[i] = 2 * myarray[i]}```here you are modifying the content of `myarray` in place.If you use a comprehension, then you create a copy of the list```pythondoubledarray = [2 * x for x in myarray]```## Why FP ?FP isn't as popular as procedural/OOP, which is a shame IMO.FP has a lot of benefits, for example, the non-mutability helps the compilers to optimize, you also remove the need for synchronization primitives.But that's all there is to it. FP is also less prone to poorly written code.In procedural, people (not just juniors sadly..) wll just start to code without further thinking and will put `if` here, a `loop` there, now they get the data from the database, .. it becomes a mess hard to follow. This is because they declare ""how"" to do the changes: ""take this value here, change it, reassign it, ..)(Of course, there are coding guidelines like ""short-circuiting"" or ""input-data-output"" flow, but people don't know/respecr them all the time.)Instead of telling the computer ""how"" to do it, just tell it what you want: ""double the values in the list"".I always make the junior do a bit of FP when they start, this helps them take good habits",divad1196,2025-05-11 06:50:33,3,learnprogramming,t3_1kjdboe,False,

mrphv0n,"I see you have problems understanding the lack of mutability, let me try to help. First, conceptually.Since there's no mutability, if you have a state in your app, you need to explicitly pass it around. In the most basic way your functions would have a type like this doSomethingWithState:: BoardState -> (BoardState, a)This means, I took the old state of the app, then I generated a new state with the modifications I want, and a value related to whatever this function did. If all your functions have a type like that (accepting a state and retrieving one state with modifications) then all what you have to do to ""update"" a state, is to propagate to the functions the new state. If you think about it imperatively, you may get the sensation that they are wasting a lot of memory cloning the state. The truth is that a compiler would try to optimize this to mutate in place. What? Think about it, the compiler may see (in this imperative pseudo python code) def something(state): (newState, value1)= doSomething1(state) (newNewState, value2) = doSomething2(newState) return newNewStateAs long as value1 doesnt refer to something inside newState, the compiler can see that you used the `newState` only to pass as argument and is never refer again. So it can generate code that performs updates on newState to generate newState2. The compiler may choose to do this optimization or not. That's what it means that is declarative. You stated your desire to transmit the state of the app, the compiler chooses if it would remain inmutable, or not. You stated what the final effect is and the compiler filled the details. One example where mutability is nice: If you are parsing a string s, you want to try to parse something and restore the state if it fails, without immutability you need to explicitly clone the state before trying and restore it manually it after. With immutability you only need to use the old state that is still available. About nested loops, you use recursive function, you need to capture all the variables you are regularly mutating in your imperative loop. You put all of them in a state and that's what you pass around in your recursive calls, a state modified by your recursive function. def loop(state): (s2,a) = something(state) print(a) return loop(s2) def main(): state = makeInitialState() (endState,a)=loop(state) return aA more concrete example: def sumToNImperative(n): acc =0 for j in range(n): acc+=j return acc def sumToNPure(n): return sumToNPureAux(n,0) def sumToNPureAux(n,acc): if n>0: return sumToNPureAux(n-1, acc+1) else: return acc The nice thing is that with TCO the pure version can be compiled to the equivalent for loop. Again, the optimization can or cannot happen. That depends on the compiler chooses.",omega1612,2025-05-11 05:54:29,1,learnprogramming,t3_1kjdboe,False,

msi21ld,"I’m a little late to the party but I’ve played with elixir and nix so here’s my 2 cents. When you’re writing functional and declarative, there is no such thing as a side effect. A function can read its input, and spit out something new, but it can’t touch the original data. And since you can’t modify any data, you can’t really use iterators like you usually do. You can still walk through items in a list, but instead of enumerating what your current index is, you’re simply stepping to the next item until there’s none left, applying a function to each item, and appending the result to a new list. So `result = [x*2 for x in list]` is python syntactical sugar for ``` Result = []for x in list: Result.append(x*2)```Instead of telling the computer “find the item at i index in this array, then do x to it”, you’re saying “give me the output of this function for every item in this list.”Hope this helpsEta: I think a lot of these concepts are easier to understand if you’re actively using recursion instead of loops.",obiworm,2025-05-15 19:24:41,1,learnprogramming,t3_1kjdboe,False,

Let's try to untangle one of the most common knots. Stack accumulation is not directly related to CS learning process. So learning Django doesn't teach you software engineering, and ""learning backend"" doesn't automatically make you good at building systems or understanding how AI works. It just makes you... someone who knows Django.Stack accumulation is something needed AFTER you formed yourself, understood what you need and you're asking yourself ""what are the best, most common, tools we can use toward this?""Or if you want to become job ready on a specific path, pretty fast.But If you're serious about AI, you'd get way more value starting from the actual foundations: data, computation, algorithms, programming principles. Learn how software works, not just how to wire things together. Then, when you build something related to AI, you’ll know how and why it works. And how to improve it.TLDR, before picking stacks, pick a direction that teaches you how to think like a builder, not just how to glue tools together.

Then build the relations between the different nouns, in terms of pure OOP how the player interacts with the dealers, what is the ""protocol"" between them, which ""messages"" does the player expect the dealer to handle, which ""messages"" the dealer expects the player to handle, etc.Maybe you should begin with simpler designs?

And even then, be very careful with it, keep it absolutely minimal, and don't layer it. Especially multiple inheritance.Don't use static props and methods in your design. They are typically just a bandaid on what could otherwise be done by regular props and methods.

Don't modify values inside objects other than self. Use getters/setters. That way you can intercept the modifications and ensure that the data within the object is always consistent.Try to have classes that are either mostly/fully just data, or mostly/fully just functions. Those are your ""nouns"" and ""verbs"", analogical to the structs and functions in non-OOP languages.Be perfectly happy with making a class which is only instantiated once. In fact, most of your classes should probably be instantiated only once.""The problem with OOP is that you want a banana, but you get a monkey holding a banana, inside the rest of the jungle"" - someone else's quote.OOP is too much. It's a huge pile of features. The worst thing you can do is trying to use them all just because they exist.Consider this: goto and global variables exist too.Write a basic class that doesn't inherit anything, add regular methods, regular properties, one constructor if needed to pre-fill the properties, and then instantiate it and use it.

Python dominates the market at the moment despite slow af, just because it's simple enough and there are many libraries. My suggestion is to look at Clojure/Clojurescript, as they would give the most benefits for someone without any experience right now. The reason being Clojure is a Lisp that runs on the JVM. This way, you have the best of many worlds in one, you would have all the libraries of the Java ecosystem helping you. You then can use Clojure, which is a Lisp and is excellent for functional and meta programming, and Clojurescript compiled down to Javascript so you'll be able to leverage the webs too. (Without the need to master Javascript or Typescript, besides Clojure is much more flexible and powerful than both Javascript and Typescript)Another perk is that Clojure compiled down to Java also, so if you want to target the mobile phone too, it'll be a nice perk. Clojure's flexibility, capability and expressiveness will amaze you and ruin your taste for clunky languages.",Frenchslumber,2025-05-11 18:02:04,5,learnprogramming,t3_1kk6vz3,False,

So, in general, in real-world software, multithreading should be your last choice, not your first. There are other choices. To give you an overview of some other choices, read this (from the Kotlin programming language): https://kotlinlang.org/docs/async-programming.html Anyway, while we're talking about other choices, the Go programming language offers Goroutines. I think the Kotlin programming language also offers some sort of Coroutine type functionality. The Scala programming language offers The Actor Model in the form of Akka (you can search for ""Scala Akka"" or ""actor programming model"" for more information). Akka can also be used with recent versions of the Java programming language even though it was written in Scala (both Java and Scala run on the JVM). Microsoft and C# ported Akka over to their platform with Akka.NET . The Erlang programming language has its own implementation of the actor model which I assume is sort of similar to Akka. Also, a lot of programming languages (like Kotlin, Scala, and Haskell) offer some sort of parallel immutable data structures with built-in automatic multithreading. Oh, and in a lot of cases programming languages use async callbacks/promises, like JavaScript. C# has its own async keyword and await keyword for that purpose. The Scala programming language has its own implementation of Futures, which facilitates multithreading and asynchronous programming and is sort of like JavaScript callbacks/promises. Kotlin has a suspend keyword and libraries for working with that sort of asynchronous stuff.But yeah, in real world software, low-level multithreading should be your last resort, not your first.",Anonymous_Coder_1234,2025-05-11 06:16:18,3,learnprogramming,t3_1kjtyc1,False,

mrpwiwq,"Multithreading is one of those things that affects design in so many ways that, unless you design your code with it in mind from the ground, it must not be done, especially in C++, which isn't exactly a memory-safe language, so forgetting to properly synchronize memory access anywhere within your codebase can potentially lead to race conditions. This is different in Rust, where suddenly changing to a multithreaded implementation will simply result in the compiler refusing to build the code until you fix everything, and this is also one of the reasons why I wonder why people are still choosing to start new projects in C++ these days.Regarding your specific problem, if you decide to listen to my advice and reimplement everything from scratch, I recommend looking up the Entity Component System architecture, which would greatly benefit your project, minimize potential threading problems (or completely eliminate them in the case of Rust), and maximize both CPU cache efficiency and thread parallelization.

It's not the fastest way to do it, but if you have an unordered array then you might provide the ""somehow"" as \`return max(the\_current\_number, the\_max\_so\_far)\` then by the end the the\_max\_so\_far variable has whatever the max value of the array is.Or you could have an ordered array of chapter objects that you want to output into a combined book, so the ""somehow"" is like \`return book + this\_chapter.to\_s()\`So instead of a big ugly loop with temp variables you could just do \`book\_text = chapters.reduce(string.empty, (book, chapter) => book + chapter.to\_s())\` To be clear, as with basically everything in programming, you can of course do all this without \`reduce()\`, and you just have to choose based on clarity of intent whether to use it or not.",PeteMichaud,2025-05-16 01:15:06,5,learnprogramming,t3_1knod52,False,

Hardest part of learning something new for me is being overwhelmed by so much new stuff that I don't know where to start.Anyway, hopefully this explanation of reduce will help:So you said you understand map and forEach? Perfect! You're close to understanding reduce because all 3 share one foundational behavior: Run a function on each item of the array.Now, here's how they differ:forEach: You want to just call the function for each item in the array. You don't necessarily want to do anything to the items or the array itself and you don't want to return anything.map: You want to transform each item in the array into a new value. Example: You have an array with the values 1,2,3? Use map to transform the array into a new array with the values 2,4,6. The key here is your goal is to transform the original array into a new array with new items. The new array is an array of the same length as the original. Start with 3 items in your array? You'll end with 3 items in your new array.reduce: Similarly to map, your goal is to transform the array into something else. However, that something else can be anything! With map, you return a new array. With reduce, you return a new ANYTHING. You can turn the original array into an object (most common use case) or you can return a number, string, boolean, literally whatever you want. Example: Have an array of 1,2,3?

mslb9ez,".reduce isn't easy to understand - it seems very counterintuitive, and the documentation is clearly written for someone with a different background than me :)My suggestion for understanding it, and in general understanding complicated concepts, is to remember that everything in programming is invented to solve a problem - and that that problem could be solved before that thing was invented, just in a more complicated way!That means that you can always write code that does the same as .reduce (or any other operation) - it will just be more convoluted.So try to do that. Write a function to, I don't know, calculate the totalPrice of a list of Product objects, each with its own price ... Here's the solution, just so you know what I mean: function calculateTotalPrice(products) { let totalPrice = 0; for(const product of products) { totalPrice += product.price; } return totalPrice; } Then, when that works, write a more generic function, that doesn't know about product.price, but takes another function as a parameter, one that returns the value to add to the totalPrice. Meaning that this function should be able to calculate any total.And continue on to you have basically re-implemented .reduce with your own code.It is important that you write it yourself, using your own thinking, and not get the solution from somewhere else, because it isn't about the solution, it is about the thinking that goes into it.That is how I learned most of the array-functions (filter, map, etc.), coming from the old procedural way of thinking, I wrote my own implementation (with loads of bugs and imperfections) to understand what was going on. And the benefit of using the builtin functions, is that other people know what they mean and can read it quickly, but having to understand someone elses implementation always requires having to read a lot of code, until you realize: ah, he's just reducing!",peterlinddk,2025-05-16 08:18:14,1,learnprogramming,t3_1knod52,False,

I prefer VSCode (even though I program on Linux).That said, you can use Vim keybinds (and custom keybinds) in VSCode, and you can use VSCode keybinds in Vim.Overall, I'd argue that Vim will slow you down (at least at first), and you're better off trying it out later when you have some more experience under your belt.

msiqqyg,"Generally with ui dev, you will want info to flow in a single direction control -> model -> view where the control is simply the way the program receives input, the model is the internal model of the program, in a game this will be the simulation, and the view is how this is all displayed. Now this is a broad model of how a ui program works, there are many other paradigms used, however in event driven architectures it can mostly be boiled down to mvc or model view control. With games or any ui program with a simulation info does kind of loop in the simulation/model. But this still doesn't really break the previous statement, how paradox games work is in the event handling side of things it is basically 2 steps repeated over and over: get players input then compute new state, when one of the players is lagging what happens is its basically blocking on the get players input stage, the simulation doesn't look at real time it looks at simulations slices (ticks), and so to the simulation everything comes in at the same time, but at the get players input we know that isn't true.

msipel9,"essentially the engine paradox games are built in (like stellaris, cities skylines, europa universalis, victoria, hearts of iron etc.) have a dynamic tick speed that throttles based on cpu usage so you never really FEEL lag. Instead the game just runs slower and it takes longer to pass time in the game. Rimworld has a similar system where it aims for a set tick amount per second and throttles to a slower tick speed to try and prevent lag by slowing the game down.Lets say your cpu can handle 100 calculations per tick. In essence what happens is if over the course of the game you go from 100 calculations per tick up to 1000 calculations per tick over the course of a game, then the tick speed will get 10x slower by the end and you shouldn't in theory see your computer drop below 60 fps",TheSassyfrasLife,2025-05-15 21:18:54,2,learnprogramming,t1_msioc9j,True,
mskuq7w,"They lag absolutely, but it's process overflow. RimWorld still lags, but I think it's caused by two things.1.) I'm pretty sure there's some bottom floor to the rock speed so instead of lowering the speed any more, the game lags2.) there's some fundamental problem in the Clausewitz engine paradox games made that causes the game to lag when hitting that lower bound where it processes stack up causing lag. I assume this is bc the CPU usage is wildly inconsistent second to second due to a possible lack of multi threading engine architecture, so the games frequently max out cpu usage at 100%. This is why the lag can sometimes disappear when lowering game speed by one level even though tick speed didn't change.RimWorld does not have this problem in my experience and only really experiences lag from running out of memory (or poorly optimized mods).",TheSassyfrasLife,2025-05-16 05:34:16,1,learnprogramming,t1_msizmrq,True,

One for the simulation and one for UI and displaying.Assuming you can always handle UI and display at 60fps (which can never be guaranteed), then if you drop below 60fps, you first only slow down the simulation, to give yourself more time to display.If you break up the simulation into tiny, very short ticks, for example by not simulating the entire world in lockstep, then you can essentially cut off the simulation at virtually any moment.So, your UI can be 60 fps, you can zoom around and move your mouse, but if you look at your characters up close, they're moving slower than they should. Well, and if it becomes too slow, it's probably worth sacrificing some FPS to recover some simulation speed.

I understand it might sound harsh and there will be people who feel we should say yes to you and send you on a boondoggle. But in all honesty this is not the path for you.1) It is a VERY competitive field. If you're struggling to learn the absolute basics you are going to drown here.2) It requires good social skills as much as anything else. Developer jobs are not Hollywood cases of a dude in a basement. You need to be engaged with the business. Able to drive conversations about needs and requirements. To provide feedback etc. So do not go down this route thinking that it is some easy path in that regard.There are many paths in life. Dev is not for everyone, and if we take your comments here at face value then it is not for you. Have a look at what options there are that better suit your interests. Regardless you will have to develop your social skills. There is pretty much zero exception there, so if I were you I would work on addressing those first.Then start exploring options. Careers are hard because often we don't know what we don't know. Which leads people to aim for the high profile stuff like software div / engineer / lawyer.

ms26vtm,"Recently I freelanced for a UI-focused company, and I picked up some interesting practices from how they structure their frontend work. They use Tailwind for styling and Next.js for everything else. Here’s a breakdown of their approach:**Start with a clear theme**They rely on design tokens to keep things simple and consistent across the UI. It helps centralize color, spacing, and typography decisions early on.**Component architecture: two clear categories**- Templates:These are dumb components. They just display what’s passed in via props. No state, no logic. In Next.js, these are implemented as server components.- Traditional components:These do the heavy lifting: handle state, run computations, etc. They render templates and manage the layout. - **Avoid prop drilling by leaning into composition**Most components accept a children prop. That, combined with smart layout components, makes it easy to nest and compose without passing props down five layers.**Type safety everywhere**They use TypeScript, and schemas are defined using Zod.Types are derived from the Zod schemas, so you get strong typing and runtime validation in one go.**Always validate backend data**First thing they do with any data from the backend: run it through Zod. If it doesn’t match the schema, it gets rejected. This protects the app from unexpected API changes or malformed data.**Some of my own preferences that I mix in:**- For complex state, I like using a reducer. It can grow big, but having all actions in one place keeps things maintainable. Plus, reducers are easy to unit test.- For simple state, I lean on signals (when available). They’re lightweight and reactive, perfect for local UI state.- I’ve also grown to like the “crash fast” philosophy: use assertions to catch incorrect assumptions early.

msluu71,"I recently left microsoft. The answer to the compensation gap goes beyond ""Wallstreet""and the now gone ""WLB"" lie the company pushed. It is that they are frankly just cheap. As others have mentioned too, the SLT executives also don't pay for quality execution and productization either (UI/UX, actual internal tooling, Quality assurance testing, organizational software to actually help PMs and engineers, etc.).It's not just being cheap on Total Compensation. Internally there's very little travel and expenses budgets, morale events are gone and often paid by managers, no free food or snacks, the equipment is cheap, internal IT is garbage tier, we had to fight to get replacement computers. Also, those bonuses were structured in a way to be weaponized. You NEVER hit max bonus and more often hit midpoint or less if the manager just disliked you.People like to joke about Amazon's ""frugality"" leadership principle. But there's a difference between the definition of frugal (pay for just enough) and Microsoft's cheapness.Edit: Let me add one more cheap thing. Microsoft just had their 50th Anniversary. I would say that's quite a milestone for a big company, right? Let's just say when Windows 11 came out, we all got to pick out pretty fantastic goodies (sweaters, premium jackets, memorabilia's, etc.). For the 50th...I got to pick out a Teams background.

ms62j0d,"I think in some instances it is just never having enough money and constantly moving the goalposts for yourself. Having said that, there are two things I tend to think about:1. Stagnating is a great way to jeopardize your financial future. You stay at the $170K company with a chill job, you don't keep advancing in your career, and then in 10 years when the company decides to lay you off... now what? Recruiters want to see growth, and you will just be able to say ""I've been in the same spot for like 10 years"". Especially in an ageist industry that evolves quickly, you really don't want to find yourself obsolete at 40.2. Inflation. When I graduated college 20 years ago, $100K was a lot of money. Now you need $160K to have the purchasing power that $100K did back then. So if inflation is going up higher than your salary (which is likely if you don't seek advancement opportunities), you might gradually lose purchasing power - and pretty substantially.3. Even with lifestyle creep, you will often find yourself accumulating wealth in other ways as your salary goes up. Bigger 401K, the bigger house you bought gets a bunch of equity + appreciation in it, etc.4. Accumulating extra experience early can actually land you in better work life balance later.

Once that's done, chronical your open source contributions & post tech-related content on there.

The market is tough right now and you're going to have to suck it up and basically throw everything you have at this if you truly want it. Each thing your do here increases your chances of success: Before interviewing- leetcode hard, follow neetcode roadmap to fill in theoretical gaps in knowledge, once you have an interview focus on problems given from that company leading up to interview- time every leetcode problem to 40 minutes. Don't look up the answer until you finish the timer. Every single time you fail to solve a problem, work aggressively to ameliorate your weaknesses. - come up with a methodical problem solving process. Don't just change things and run them praying it works, get good at thinking about what you're going to do to your program and similating the output before even typing. Get good at running your own test cases against your code in your head rather than relying on printf debugging- get as many swe interviewers you can to give you mock interviews and giving you mock interviews- fill any gaps in your text stack that you may have (frontend should be angular, react, nextjs and typescript, backend should be Java , spring boot, postgres, mongo, redis)- brush up on AWS knowledge of core services including networking, security and databases, - build example projects that actually work and document them very well on your GitHub and publish live links to your portfolio site and GitHub. This is a good chance to combine both stack knowledge gaps and AWS knowledge gaps all in one shot- create a portfolio siteSomewhere in the middle of the above after some leetcode and projects are under your belt:- dont be as stringent about pay- expand the set of rules you're searching for (i.e. SWE, SDE, SDET, full stack, backend, frontend, SRE, ops, devops, etc...)- be willing to relocate- get as many swe interviewers reading your resume as you can- ensure your indeed, LinkedIn and resume are fully beefed up and peer-reviewed- don't just cold apply. That's completely useless. Cold message recruiters, hiring managers, team members, random recruiters / hiring managers on LinkedIn, connect with family members, old colleagues, old peers, anyone and everyone. Don't seem too desperate, don't ask strangers for referrals. - always smile, be punctual, dress appropriately, take your time, make the interviewers feel comfortable like it's a conversation and not an interview, show no ego whatsoever, appear extremely eager to learn, admit when you don't know something rather than guess and embarrass yourself, have a list of thought provoking and insightful questions to dazzle interviewers, and AGGRESSIVELY ask for feedback and FERVENTLY correct all of your mistakes every single interview, after enough interviews there will be no more mistakes left. Most importantly...- keep your head up, realize that if you keep trusting in the process you will come out ahead.

It is your responsibility as the senior reviewing PRs to provide feedback to the person making the pull request that enables them to address your concerns with their code.OP, your issue here is that Mr.Newbie isn't pulling from your developer branch to merge the latest set of already merged code into their code, assuming your org is using *proper* version control guidelines of developers having personal branches per story, the team having a dev branch for every sprint and PRing work from the stories to the dev branch, then the dev branch to the main demo branch, then the demo branch to the production branch for use by the users. If your org is managing branches properly, the issue here is that Mr.Newbie wasn't pulling from the developer branch before PR'ing their branch to the dev branch. These conflicts tend to happen when multiple people are working on the same file. If anything, your frustration at this common inconvenience is itself indicative of a relative lack of experience working with version control in a group setting. **Try to be understanding of what it is like to be inexperienced with unfamiliar tools and a good mentor for the newhire.** Everyone is new to these tools at some point in their career, even you.Once you are both pulling from dev before PRing to dev, you'll have to *intelligently handle any merging conflicts on your local build***, so be sure to push your changes before pulling to ensure you don't lose any work if you make a mistake.** Try to become a mentor for the newhire and retain a positive attitude about the team expanding.

I ended up getting a pretty good TC (220k TC: 155k cash, 30k bonus, 35k stock). I think I posted my resume before, so you can take a look at my previous experience. In general for a new grad, the bands are pretty tight (I could only get 10k higher even with another job offer as leverage). The big disparity in pay comes from the differences in companies. You shouldn’t be asking if your experience gets you $X, but rather if your resume (and interview skills) can get you into a FAANG-level company. Given the job market, this means you need something that makes you stand out on paper and in person. Also, I would recommend not doing a PhD unless you’re really, really passionate. It’s not really a “pass the time” or “get more money” thing. Especially due to the DoE budget cuts, full funding may be unstable in many places over the next few years. This means you need to be competitive in your lab/department to retain funding if anything gets impacted.Also, maybe it’s an anecdotal experience, but all the professors I’ve talked to said it’s a slight red flag to do a PhD at the same undergraduate school since you want to diversify your research and education.",s118827,2025-05-11 19:29:57,38,cscareerquestions,t3_1kk87tz,False,

It's pretty much:* HR Intro Call* 1 hour Hiring Manager / Tech Screen* On-site / Virtual On-site with 4 - 6 interviews 1-on-1 with a SWE lasting about 1 hour each.Back when I was a new grad in 2006. The interview process was generally:* HR Intro Call* 1 hour Hiring Manager / Tech Screen* On-site panel interview for 2 hours / 2 interviews 1-on-1 with a SWE lasting about 1 hour eachFrankly it's harder to get an offer now, because companies are more picky. They are scared to death of a false positive hire and will sacrifice the false negative hire all day every day. I personally think there are tons of talent out there that with some ramp up time on the job would be an excellent SWE.Every company I have worked for over my 15 YOE never really had issues hiring once candidates applied. Granted these were non-tech companies in non-tech cities so they were not hiring out of the same pool of candidates as bit tech companies. If you could do reverse a string level problems with C or C++ you would get an offer. These companies were fine with ramp up time and showing candidates, at all levels, what they needed to know to do the job. Just finding people that had an aptitude for being a SWE was the problem. Aptitude does not mean some rock star coder, but could wrap their head around concepts when shown to them.Granted I've never applied to a startup, so maybe that world is different.",diablo1128,2025-05-14 18:15:20,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1kmlbya,False,

msk2mhc,"It is much more a consequence of the company values.Bad work culture and bad work/life balance aren't the same thing than having high operational target metrics.Amazon has an intentional culture of employees being always working, always tethered to operations, and committing to die at the job. They make you feel bad for taking more than a week of vacation in a year of 12 hours work days. That's more a correlation than a causation but Bezos doesn't see it that way and since he's writing the checks, that's how it works. This is not specific to AWS and affects other areas at Amazon which are less tied to operations. Regardless they built the narrative that such shitty conditions are simply the result of the nature of the job, that if you're not always on the edge of burnout, the business will crumble and the competition will overtake them. Most people have known nothing else so they believe it.Other sectors and countries have laws so that demanding jobs don't ruin the life of people. For obvious reasons, truckers cannot drive more than X hours per day. Airline pilots must observe rest times, etc. Because obviously pushing these limits isn't good. It doesn't mean we can't have trucks and airplanes, it means we had to find ways to make it work and compensate for the demanding conditions of such jobs, often in the form of regulations against abuses. Companies still find ways to be competitive.In some other countries if you are on-duty you need to be compensated for that even if the pager doesn't ring. Being available for the job is considered a work related duty so it needs to be compensated. If you join the call for an incident the law requires the employer to clock hours in addition to your regular pay -- even if you're not an hourly employee. On holidays you get up to double pay. And their online services aren't more or less reliable.The US tech has close to no worker protection laws so the only things that retains companies to crush employees is how long they want to keep them and how easily they can find a job elsewhere. That somewhat works if the job market is balanced and companies are compelled to watch wlb to be attractive. This is often made easier by the general American narrative that government is a bad thing, that politics are here to trick us not to protect us, so employees hope for their company to do the right thing by themselves and rarely think about forms of civil action.",JonTheSeagull,2025-05-16 02:08:53,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1knc2kx,False,

mspdckj,"Humanities undergraduate, who has a remote job. Here's my take.I think STEM careers has no say in this topic given its more a recent development. Next, I believe that you have been AI, but not the way you think. Globalization (and adajcent concepts), especially outsourcing/offshoring, is the pre-cursor to AI. Therefore, you've been replaced/displaced AI already.Additionally, no jobs are truly secure, whether in STEM fields like tech or in the humanities and arts. Oversaturation is inevitable due to an oversupply of applicants compared to demand. As a result, higher levels of skill are increasingly required to break into any field, especially at the entry level.Why do you think graduate-level education is often needed to enter humanities or arts careers? STEM, especially tech-related fields, is only now experiencing a similar shift, where advanced education is becoming necessary as well.Whatever happens to humanities and arts careers reflects the ***ALL*** of the job markets, because these fields are typically the first to be affected by economic shifts. Why do you think AI targeted them first? In every way, the humanities and arts act as the foundation of how the job system operates.And lastly, the point of a degree was never really about getting a job. It’s always been about credentials and access to additional services like; attending career fairs. The actual education? That’s secondary. The degree is just the entry fee, not a promise of anything.With that in mind, do whatever you want, but stop whining that “the market is bad.” The market has always been bad, and it’s only getting worse. Some careers just get hit earlier than others.

If you are happy with the money you make, the company culture, etc. It's ok not being the guy who is always innovative and working on things that change the world. We are told from the second we decide to be engineers that we need to work on things that change the world and when we are stagnant we feel like we are ""stealing money"". Staying at this company can increase job security too. Im sure many people your age are job-hopping to more money but more stressful jobs. Your company may appreciate how you stayed, give you huge promotions and when it comes down to layoffs they wont consider laying off a person who has been there 10+ years and knows the system and someone who everybody loves. To see the other side of the coin, it is completely fine being the person who wants to work extra create innovative code, etc. All i say is dont do it because you are under this impression SWEs need to be on the go all the time.",Broad-Cranberry-9050,2025-05-13 18:07:44,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1klsemb,False,

The work wasn't particularly stressful and I was growing, but my wife who I met there went on to greener pastures before me and started earning more than me from the job hops. The two of us working just barely managed to put together enough money for a down payment on a house.I started doing some open source which got some traction and that eventually led to another job for like a 60% increase. A couple years later, that open source project got me scouted into a big tech company for another 150% increase. My pay at this company more than doubled in the 8 years I've been there. I make and have enough money now that I don't really need to work anymore (I still do because I like the work, but my wife quit the rat race)By contrast, there's this guy that occasionally posts in salary progression threads here who worked 15 years in a single non-tech company with the steady 3% raises throughout. He was at low one hundies mark when he left his job and hasn't found a job in a few years, last time he gave an update.I think these two points should give you a decent idea of the range of possibilities going forward from where you are.

It's only a matter of time.With that knowledge, I hold onto a good WLB for as long as it stays good. I have no interest in job hopping just to make some more money, I already make plenty.

At least at my company, we have no team level managers. I run a team, and I'm a senior engineer. The next layer of management is on the ""team of teams"" level. I do like this, and although a lot of project/product management falls on me when it comes to planning and execution, it's a lot easier when the managers just trust me on the technical details, empower me with a team to get the job done and the right set of people to answer my questions, and just step back and let me do my thing.In my role, the managers just worry about goals, and how we allocate resources to go achieve them. For me, that's easy to deal with: everything we do must be towards some goal, I can get that done with the team, and management makes sure that impact/effort ratio remains high.After all, what I want for everyone on my team is to have a good, impactful review period which translates into good reviews. Instead of fighting management, I get a lot further by thinking of them as partners in the process, where trust is a two way street, and we are on the same team.

ms5alfy,"> I appreciate being considered for leadership, but I don’t think this is the right move for me, especially with everything else going on. How can I say no to this without raising red flags or burning bridges.I would say no. stick to two main points and do not provide any other reasons for saying no.1. I appreciate being considered, but no. best case scenario you say this and they say ok and do not ask any follow up questions.2. (If asked why), I want to keep focusing on my current responsibilities as an IC over taking on a new role at this time. I feel my contributions are best delivered as me working as an IC. I am not yet in a place in my career where I am interested in exploring a managerial position. I know these kinds of opportunities only come so often, but I would still rather focus on my IC work at this time than step into this team lead role.If you stick to just ""no"" and ""I want to focus on my job as an IC"" as your two talking points, you really don't give them much room to try and convince you otherwise. it won't come off like you are looking for other work, it will just look like you prefer to be an IC and don't want to be a manager, which is common.",CVisionIsMyJam,2025-05-13 19:41:55,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1klqtq7,False,
