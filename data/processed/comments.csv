Yet, none of them really solve the core data issues like nulls, duplicates, redundancy and many more. The simple and old school style of sql, bash scripts and crontab jobs can do much more than fancy tools. It makes feel like we all should go back to roots using pure sql for most part for pipelines processing and maybe little bit of Python here and there.

Namely, in the same order as the diagram: - big data specialist- DWH specialist- data analyst- data engineer- database professional- BI analystThe fact that big data specialist comes before DE, although a DE is in general considered a big data specialist, may just show how the DE title still lacks recognition. At the opposite, surprisingly DA and DS are put together whereas there could be a giant gap of skills between an SQL DA and a DS expert in ML.

n7dywxi,"Duckdb is an “in process” database. It has its own scheme for storing data in memory and disk. However, it’s also able to “connect” to other sources besides its own duckdb stored data file. For example it  can access and query parquet and csvs as if they were tables. Even more interestingly since it’s “in process” it has full access to the memory space of the process. What that means is that it can actually connect to a in memory pandas or polars dataframe and run queries on it as if the df was a table and it can write the results back to pandas df. So you can do something like this:```df1 = pd.Dataframe(…)df2 = pd.Dataframe(…)df = duckdb.query('''    select a, sum(x) as x    from df1    inner join df2 on …    group by a''').df()```",HNL2NYC,2025-08-07 09:33:12,131,dataengineering,t3_1mjudxc,False,

Actual data is written to data pages. So EXPANING the length, should not cause a full page rewrite of a given page, since nothing needs to get rewritten. Already existing page splits, are not effected either, its already a pointer to another page.So, it should be rather harmless, to change the variable length, as long as it gets increased. Decreasing the length, I'd be a bit more careful, but should functionally behave the same. Not having a clustered index... it should not affect that change, since if I know how mssql works internally, it will check every row, if it complies with ""new column meta data"", so a full read trough of the entire table. It doesn't matter in reality, if that table is a heap or a clustered index for a full scan.I'd say, plan for a couple of minutes of outage, and go for it.

I believe they can be useful for getting your baseline but they aren't something I have chased. I would very much do it on a case by case basis. If you start at an employer they might require you to get certain certifications and they would pay for them.What helped the most? I joined a team which was pretty small, mostly focused around data science. My programming skills were really solid but my database skills were not great. I was able to learn enough database work to get through the door and focused my effort on using software experience to really push standards in the team and improve confidence.What would I not waste time on? I don't know. I don't think doing the PhD was the best use of my time but I can't go back and change that so I'm happy enough with the result. DE wise, as I've specialised into data I already had a solid foundation. There are technologies and prototypes which were a waste of time but there isn't really anything I would regret.I appreciate this might not be the sort of feedback you were wanting to get, I am only one person and there are different thoughts around how easy it is to break into DE.

I agree with the comments about consulting mostly, but I doubt they would put you on client work or at least throw you to the wolves like they would with an employee. Having worked both for telcos and consulting, I will give you some thoughts:Consulting: you will probably work on one or a few projects. They are looking for prospects to hire when you graduate so it's like an extended evaluation. Consulting is good because you get exposure to different industries and projects, so you learn skills and approaches you might not pick up working elsewhere. One other thing that's maybe overlooked is that you learn how to sell and explain your work, which is valuable in companies later when you need to justify a project or hype it up beyond just explaining the technical side. Working there as an employee though can be grueling not just because of the hours, but because you need to build your career often with little help. They assign you to some client and expect you to pick up the skills you need. They usually do give you some support with a mentor role, but they might be good or just suck since they are assigned. So it can be a stressful experience depending on your personality and resiliency.Telcos: this is a good option because you will get exposure to a lot of processes with a lot of data flowing. It's mostly structured though, but really teaches you how to deal with high volumes. If we are talking a bigger telco like AT&T or whatever then they tend to have all the tools and applications so you aren't looking at a kludged together mess like in some other companies. There is data stored around all the different processes that go on in a telco, so while the product isn't the data platform, it's probably as close as you are going to get.

Dagster does the orchestration for me, as implied, then dbt does transformations after data has landed in Timescale, also orchestrated by Dagster.I can't really speak to how the performance would be with loading data into Snowflake via Sling, but it backfilled about 300GB of data on the initial run in under 6 hours and every 4 hour incremental loads take around 20 minutes (though this could probably be optimized much further).

n6jpuu1,I think the majority of the criticism in these articles is saying iceberg is bad for transactional workflows which it is. Additionally it offers no alternatives,ReporterNervous6822,2025-08-02 16:16:14,24,dataengineering,t3_1mfrvpt,False,
n6lqpxm,"Holy shit this is such a misleading and confused take. Not least right off the top the idea that transactions are meant to be row inserts. You’re doing it wrong. A transaction is intended to be a single large block of rows. To wit contention is intended to be low.Taken together, that you think iceberg is a transactional database is your main problem. The design desire of iceberg is to be able to have atomic writes to disk from ephemeral stateless writers for the purpose of retaining and accessing large amounts of data for long periods of time. Any alternative not involving optimistic concurrency necessarily involves a single stateful system that needs to be on for as long as the data needs to be accessible which is absurdly dumb and massively expensive. The only reason databases and database servers exist is to literally provide a lock. To the degree you can avoid locks you can cut massive cost by making the computer independent of the retention process. Don’t get me wrong iceberg is very rough around the edges and leaves a lot to be desired but that you neither understand why it exists or what it’s good for wouldn’t be something I’d publish this widely on the internet.",TheRealStepBot,2025-08-02 22:57:37,21,dataengineering,t3_1mfrvpt,False,
n6m1my6,"The author continues their absolutely-detached-from-reality rant against Iceberg. They've essentially looked at a sledgehammer and decided that it is 'not a serious tool' because it requires more effort, is more unwieldy, and lacks a claw compared to a regular hammer.The article indicates it is a 21 minute read, so I'm going to be somewhat brief here, but essentially other than various truisms the entire thing can be broken down. The article is also quite sarcastic and derogatory, which gives me the impression that the author is more interested in puffing themselves up than earnestly engaging with the problem space.I'll pick a few things that are emblematic of the disconnect between the author's basis for criticism and what iceberg is actually for.---> It also means that the overhead of each file is large (in the order of 1KB).Iceberg (and DeltaLake/Hudi, I'll not mention again) is intended for storing many gigabytes to terabytes and petabytes of data in a given 'table' -- a few KB of overhead is going to be less than 0.001% of the data you're actually reading or writing. You'll likely have more overhead within the parquet files themselves if they've been split relatively small, and your choice of compression algorithm is going to have orders of magnitude more impact.> Putting the burden on the clientThe entire point of the base layer of 'lakehouse' implementations is to decouple storage from the compute. That is: *there is no server* to even consider to be 'putting the burden on the client'. You may as well complain that trains have to run on rails.> If clients need to write manifest lists that point at all Manifest Files - we have already leaked the location of every single S3 file worth stealingThe path to an S3 file is not sensitive data, it is protected through access control to the bucket. You may as well complain that clients connecting to databases leaks the IP of the database.Iceberg is not intended to solve row-level security for you in the same way that parquet does not solve row level security. It simply isn't in the scope of what it is trying to solve, because it isn't seeking to replace a database.> Did we not learn in CS 101 that if you need O(n) operations to append to a list, you are probably doing something wrong?This section completely ignores something that the author *should* know quite well, that sometimes you exchange processing time for space consumption. For metadata files the repeated data is utterly insignificant compared to all the other reads and writes that are happening, but because we're dealing with remote storage accessed over a network then when reading it is much more efficient to retrieve a single larger block of data than make many individual requests.In fact the author later whinges that a query has to do sequential 2 metadata reads to locate the parquet files it needs - so they *do* understand the benefit of compacting data together, but they just choose to ignore that in this instance so that they can heap more derision on Iceberg.> Optimistic Concurrency - Why it does not work! ... is there ever a point to optimistic concurrency control? ... In Iceberg, two concurrent writes to a table will ALWAYS be in conflict A section in which the author almost realises they may be lacking some perspective, but plows on ahead anyway.First of all, Iceberg is considered about the overall efficiency for readers and writers that are operating in completely isolated processing environments, and when writing data they are going to be writing a *lot* of data and it may take a relatively long time (seconds to minutes). A complete pessimistic lock would prevent concurrent non-conflicting writes, which means you could only ever effectively have one writer to a table, which would be an unnecessary restricting if you have pure-append ingestion processes, and pure-append ingestion processes are very common in lake/lakehouse implementations.And yes, you can have non-conflicting *data* writes even if the metadata writes are conflicting, but as I've mentioned in here the metadata is insignificant compared to the data in intended use cases. Getting a writer to rewrite even a 1MB metadata file is a significantly better tradeoff than having them sit idle for many seconds to minutes, when their compute runtime is costing you money. And that's if they even get a conflict - subsecond timings on completion of concurrent writes is pretty rare for the intended use cases.> ""Tables grow large by being written to, they grow really large by being written to frequently"".Complete bullshit. My largest tables are either full snapshots taken periodically from sources, or they use streaming ingestion with buffered writes. In fact streaming ingestion is directly a use-case for optimistic concurrency - each partition can have a separate writer and they can all write data concurrently and commit periodically.> Did I mention that 1000 commits/sec is a pathetic number if you are appending rows to table?Absolutely unhinged criticism. The target format is parquet and the default row group size for writers is on the order of 100k to 1M rows. To hit a required 1k commits/sec you'd be looking at ingesting >100M rows/sec and 100GB/sec of *compressed* data while having each individual parquet file be committed one-by-one with a thousand independent writing processes.What you would *actually* do is have a partitioned writer that has 1000 concurrent parquet writes, and it commits once per second. The author is just *inventing* problems.> Intermezzo: Iceberg REALLY does not want to be a databaseThen why are you critiquing it like it is one?This is ridiculous.

n6xog97,"ETL vs ELT is a form of shorthand.Rather than neatly dividing data processing into two types; it encourages you to think about the steps.Extraction, is typically ""given"". You're generally bound by the transfer rates of the source and they provide the data in whatever format they choose. It's always going to come first.Loading, is a more variable step. You're still bound by the properties of the target storage. But since you choose what you're writing you have some more control of the process.Transformation is extremely variable. You usually have a lot of freedom in deciding how you transform the source data into target data. That includes breaking up the transformation into multiple steps.Moving from ETL to ELT is more about breaking up the T than it is about actually saving it to the end. The actual process is typically more like ET1L1T2L2T3L3...T1 is often limited to very simple transformations; de-duping and some light error checking is common. Then it gets written to disk in ""raw form"". We keep this work light so it can be fast and reliable. Since real systems have errors, we want to keep this simple so we minimize the chance of dropping data.T2 typically cleans the data. That typically takes more work since we're looking at the data more carefully and changing it more. We then write that to disk too since there are many different things we might do next.T3+ are typically curation steps that answer specific business questions. They can be very expensive to calculate (there are often dozens of JOINS going many layers deep) and they often drop data (often for speed or security) so we want to keep those older versions too. These final versions also get stored so the business users can access them quickly.None of this makes much sense in small systems. They're techniques that are used in ""big data"". I would practice the basic tools (SQL, Spark, Python, etc) and supplement that by reading case studies on data deployments.

We were less dependent on each other, and if something blew up on our face, the repo separation contained the blast radius.At the same time, we actually had some monorepo happening too. For the sake of fast shipping we opted to use Meltano to run Airflow and dbt. This meant those three ran off a monorepo, and it was indeed good at moving fast, but it also hit a scaling wall within 6 months of going production, since airflow had to run with only a single worker in this mode. We took Airflow and dbt out of the repo and into their own, and man, we paid a bit of a price - but it was worth the initial velocity.Looking back, it's almost like making the Conway's law work for you: we had a poor, immature organization communication structure in the data engineering team, so mirror that structure in multiple repos. If your team is collocated and cohesive, go reap the benefits of a monorepo. In this world of AI-augmented coding where context is everything, having a monorepo seems to enable that well: our dbt repo is monorepo, and it has such a rich context that many people in the company write analytic queries in Cursor with that repo open.",figshot,2025-08-08 23:53:00,1,dataengineering,t3_1ml6i3p,False,

The engineering effort is usually related to scaling the solution, making it run reliably and in a timely way for the consumers, and the PMs and data consumers might help with the final details of the business logic.It's hard to know all of the details about all the source tables, but I prefer using as close to the source events as possible, usually that way it's easier to understand and know who to talk to about them, or at least use well known and validated ""canonical"" sources.We try to have a aligned definition for what a production worthy product is, meaning in general terms it is well tested, validated and monitored. So if there is push for ASAP delivery and some of that needs to be sacrificed, we will not put the production tag in it, it might be out in an experimental way, and this helps us with our process while still providing value at a timely manner, while still being ""agile"", but it's very hard to not allow experimental to be treated just like production and tech debt to pile up as everyone needs everything ASAP.Edit: About the process, the process is there to help you, not for you to follow it, so if something feels off, encourage changes and iterations on it.",well_well_well__,2025-08-06 17:33:27,10,dataengineering,t3_1mj9qph,False,

If you're very strong in all aspects of SQL (Joins, CTE's, order of execution, etc), then you're solid for a DE role. Now focus on data modeling which is very hard skill to get good at even after years of experience and many fail interviews even at senior levels, it's unfortunate truth but it is what it is. Take some Udemy courses, watch YT videos on dimensional modeling. There are plenty of free project YT videos on building pipelines. Since you're good with Oracle, start there for a valid certificate that you think can relate to DE role, even a data or solution architect certificate would be good on resume but experience always precedes certificates. Learn distributed compute and storage (Snowflake, Databricks), one is fine. Databricks has uphill learning curve compare to snowflake. Pickup little bit of cloud (AWS or Azure), one is fine since the concepts can be applied across. Google cloud isn't very popular compare to the other two.

n7g9nd3,"A ""data perspective"" btw - another guy wrote about the messaging part, also valid.SCD is slowly changing dimension, and there are type 1, 2 & 3 - then hybrid variations depending on how old the design was.In modern times, we simply use SCD2 or SCD Type 2, which is row-based tracking of the business key - what makes a row unique and never changes, and tracking changes to the data portion, what does change over time.A good example is a credit score, ship to address, customer address.Some ERP systems have SCD2 tables labeled as \_HIST or \_History, but for DW purposes, we break down information from top-down, then bottom-up, then build what is missing in the middle as layers of transformations.So if you tie sales to geography and your customers are the general public, they move a lot, so you need to track at-that-point-in-time where they lived. A transformation would be calculating longitude & latitude for that address, that the X & Y coordinates don't exist in the source system.So the world of DW is easily a year full-time university course, of course lots of courses online too.So... At least once... A relationship between to tables, inner join or left join. In DW world you avoid left joins like the plague, unknown data will actually have a pre-defined value.This is domain / entity specific, like when you specify 1-to-1, 1-to-many, 1-to-0. So at least once would be 1-to-1 and 1-to-many.If you load a product table and a sub-table is color, another is category and sub-category, depending on the (various) sources you can have a product with no color, no category or sub-categ, you must assign a value for the missing data, so that INNER JOIN always works.So you'd have a DIM\_PRODUCT\_CATEGORY with a surrogate key and business value 'UNKNOWN' or 'NOT DEFINED' even though in the source system that category doesn't exist.You have to remember that DWs are report orientated and tools like PowerBI and the analysts using them will not appreciate having to render NULLs and won't be happy with missing sales numbers.",SirGreybush,2025-08-07 17:18:14,3,dataengineering,t1_n7g2iif,False,

You may find yourself really enjoying the work AND the company. In this case you'd want to make sure you're building relationships there and ask about a potential conversion to FTE after graduation, or at the very least an extension on your internship.If you find yourself enjoying data-related work but don't necessarily see yourself staying with the company, you'll want to start researching about different data-related roles (Data Engineer, DBA, BI/Analytics Engineer, Data Analyst, etc.) and continue building applicable skills. You'll also want to be aggressively applying for internships for related roles.If you don't have a particular affinity for data related work but still want to stay in CS / tech, then you'll still want to be aggressively looking for internships or junior roles.

Usually it will create new partition arrays and concatenate at the end which is very slow and not ""quick"" like it implies in the name. The proper implementation is done in-place. If you are solid in DSA and coding fundamentals, even if you don't know the quicksort algorithm, you will probably be able to look at it and realize that allocating a bunch of new memory each recursive iteration is very inefficient. Almost all sorting algorithms implementations are done in place since speed is very important.That said I think AI has huge potential value in acting as a teacher and mentor if prompted the right way.

This website doesn't deal with finding a job, but is great for knowing \_what\_ to learn in many technologies and career paths: [https://roadmap.sh/python](https://roadmap.sh/python) . If you don't have direction, that gives you it. Also join smaller online communities where daily discussions happen, so you can see not only what's in the tutorials and curated content, but how things work day-to-day.Skill itself is not enough to find a job. Yes, the market is much tougher than it was 5 years ago, but programming is still the right choice if you have the brains for it. It's going to take hard work to get a job, but the value/effort ratio is much higher than that for other jobs. The best case scenario is to know someone that can introduce you to the right company: trust and a feeling of community are valuable to companies that know what's good for them. So see if you, your family, or your friends know someone like that. Even if they don't have an opening, they may introduce you to further connections of theirs. Listen to their advice and don't take anything for granted.If you can't find that person, it's time to polish your CV and hit the job boards. If you're not at all comfortable with your skill level, aim for \*\*PAID\*\* internships. You might need to apply to hundreds of jobs. It's going to feel like a slog, but it's worth it. Be respectful, definitely don't let AI write your application or emails, the lack of effort is noticed. Many companies won't notice a presence of effort either, but you're better off without them. When you see a company you really like, try to prototype an open source project in the same domain as their product, and put it in the application. Best case scenario they see the effort and dedication, and they'll know you can be valuable to them, worst case scenario you have one more small project in your portfolio for the next company you apply to. There was a period where being disruptive and extra casual gave you a leg up, we're no longer in that period: be respectful (don't confuse this with submissive) and professional. Remember the people on the other side are people too, and if you can make their life easier by being honest and not making the interview/email tough for them, they're more likely to want you as a team mate.Best of luck, and if you have any more questions feel free to ask.",towc,2025-08-03 14:05:58,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mgdw2w,False,

No one here can tell you if your approach is good FOR YOU.In principle, your approach seems not bad. You should keep in mind as you go through these exercises that no matter how many repositories you comb through, you will only ever be touching the tip of the iceberg. The world of software development has more ways of doing absolutely everything than you can shake your fist at, and you will never become an expert by just looking at other people's work.I suggest as you go through these exercises, instead of trying to rebuild the same thing you just observed from scratch, establish a cadence of identifying problems that can be solved or improvements that can be made with code. While reviewing repositories, take notes. Then, when using the concepts you discovered in these repositories in your own solutions, do not allow yourself to look at the repositories at all. Instead, look at your notes.And remember as you go through this that it is not recreating other people's solutions that makes a great developer. I understand you're just trying to get started, and that's fine. But be aware that at some point you will want to detach completely from the example repositories and make an effort to implement a novel idea without any example to guide you.

n72ludf,"Guided projects or starting simple makes far more sense. You want to learn the skill of WHY you're coding something, not HOW to code. How to code comes out of having a need that prevents you from attaining or achieving something that you want. Figure out the why, and the how will come with experience. With your approach, you don't know why code is written in a certain way, or why code is written at all in a project to some extent. It's a lot easier to learn when you know what the end objective is, and what success looks like. It's a measurable, achievable milestone, rather than aiming at some amorphous end point that isn't anchored to the amount of experience and know-how you have.An analogy; if you play chess for the first time, you may think that a good approach to play is to just capture as many pieces as possible. Unfortunately, chess isn't so simple. An 1800 ELO player is going to make moves that a 400 ELO player simply cannot even begin to understand the justification for, even if they understand the how, which was simply to move a piece legally. So you might be able to go into a mature code base that people acknowledge as being well-written. But you have no idea why it was written in that way, the intentions, the problems faced, the historical context. And if you can't figure out the why, then I might as well hire an LLM over you, because they at least know the HOW even better than a human, even if they have no idea WHY they're writing code in a certain way for a certain purpose.",HotDribblingDewDew,2025-08-05 15:50:19,3,learnprogramming,t3_1mia1yc,False,

Lots of libraries already exist, and also, most of them have easy-to-pick-up interfaces because they're generally developed ""Pythonically"".Now - when you're learning ""programming"", you're learning several things at once: the fundamentals of programming (data structures, algorithms, what a variable is), and also a specific programming language (do statements end in a semicolon? how do I import something from another file?), and also a particular development context (how should my project be structured? How do I invoke build tools?).**Python is very good at simplifying some of this**. The ""learning a specific programming language"" part of it is pretty simple, and the development context is easily simplifiable (it can get complicated in real-life deployment situations, needing to navigate pyenv etc - but that's not anything a beginner needs to worry about in order to get started).**The tension is this:** Because Python has an active community of senior developers, who have coalesced on specific ways of working (canonized and blessed particular by the BDFL), there are some corners of Python that don't feel right if you've been exposed to other kinds of programming - some of which might actually be ""harder"" than the level of abstraction that Python works at!For a long time, this manifested for me as: *every time I try to learn Python, I pick a simple project and implement it - but feel like I haven't gained any knowledge about the language*. It was like it was too easy - like there was so little friction that nothing stuck in my brain.What made it click for me was to fully synthesize the idea that ""programming Pythonically"" is a distinct skill, and that ""knowing how to program"" *in general* was helpful for it but by no means sufficient for it. Similar to learning piano after learning guitar - there are definitely some conceptual overlaps and transferable skills, but some things that ""should be"" easy are suddenly hard, and other things that ""should be"" hard feel weirdly easy.",autophage,2025-08-06 15:04:40,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mismzw,False,

n761ae2,"So when you move from C-like languages to Python you have to avoid ""thinking in C."" It is kinda hard to explain but every language has a ""mental model"" you have to adhere to. If you use a ""mental model"" that is incompatible with your current language, it creates a sort of mental fog and you will get stuck. I can tell you have a C model because you used words like ""iterate"" and ""insert."" I know Python programmers use them too but these words don't mean quite the same thing as what you have in mind. The mental model for C is ""memory"" like little pieces of boxes of data that you manipulate. This data has an address and a type. Variables in C are really pointers (of specific type) pointing at memory boxes. The mental model for Python is more complicated because it has multiple fundamental types. I will just use colloquial naem since a lot of higher languages all share these types. They are scalar, array/vector, hash-table/named-array, and pair/dict. Note they are not interchangeable. When you program them you have to keep track of which type you are dealing with. This may seem trivial but it is a big difference especially with the issue you have. You see, an array in Python is not the same as an array in C. An array in Python is ***a type of object*** while in C it is just ***an array (a continuous line) of memory boxes.***This means you cannot think of insert as ***iterating*** to the right spot of the memory and ***insert a box*** and move the rest of the box over to the right (assuming going from left to right). In object oriented languages like Python, you just simply use the object's method to insert. Doing it any other way is just creating trouble for yourself. In some sense this gives Python its ease of use but it also creates a strange weakness. Python programmers often have trouble adjusting to lower level languages like C. It is your problem in reverse, except it is a lot harder to overcome. I do not understand it completely but I feel it is like learning a manual clutch car versus automatic. It is easy to learn automatics because you do not need to understand much to start much. On the other hand, you need to understand the gear boxes to have that mental picture of the gear switching process when you drive to feel the gears switching into the right positions to get it. If you are already accustomed to something easy why would you ever bother and want to struggle with something hard. You will just quit. So, congrats for learning a C based language first.e: a big weakness of higher level languages, most but not all, is that you cannot create new fundamental types. You might be asking what other types could there be? A lot actually, pretty much everything you find in the standard C/C++ library.",kcl97,2025-08-06 03:12:25,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mismzw,False,

n6u5cis,"> I've tried multiple times but it never actually made any sense, what is a bool, what is a float, what is a class,These are all things that are explained, along with their use, in a proper *fundamentals* course.I'd say to get started doing a proper course, like the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki or the CS50 series from Harvard (not the videos, the real course on EdX, Coursera, etc.). This will give you a solid baseline to work from. I suggested Python, because you mentioned *Godot* for Game Dev and Python is closest to GDScript (which is basically a specialized Python).The fundamental data types are easily explained:+ *boolean* - a ""yes/no"", ""true/false"", ""on/off"" value+ *int* - a whole number+ *float* - a decimal number---*Class* is a bit more difficult: it is a scheme, a blueprint for data (fields) together with behavior (methods) - it is a generic description of what can be stored and done with something. Think of e.g. a *Poker Card*+ it has a *suit*+ it has a *rank*+ it may have a *numeric value* (mostly for sorting, or similar, or for a point value)+ it has a *face* (image)+ it has a *backside* (image)+ it can be *face up* or *face down* (which decides what the card will report when asked) all the above are *data* - they are *fields*, *attributes*. Then, there is *behavior*, the *methods* - for a Poker Card these are fairly simple: + It can report its rank (provided that it is face up) + It can report its suit (provided that it is face up) + it can be *flipped* (toggled between face up and face down) + it can *draw* itself Now, you have a *concept* of a *Poker Card* - a full description of the data and behavior - this is a *class*.As such, this doesn't say anything about a *specific* card yet. That's where *objects* come into play - they are the *concrete* implementations, like the ""Queen of Hearts"", the ""Ace of Spades"", etc. Each card in a Poker Deck is a concrete *object*, an *instance* of our *Card* class, of our *blueprint*.----When to use what is a different story. This comes with practical experience. The more programs you write, the better you will understand what to use when.Note that in my description I did not (apart from ""class"" and ""object"", ""boolean"", ""int"", ""float"") use *any* programming language specific terminology as these *concepts* are common to most programming languages.Exactly here is where good *courses* (like the aforementioned course), not just *tutorials*, shine. They explain everything from the ground up and give you ample practical exercises so that *you* have to do the work and understand the subjects.You will need to sit down and start from zero with a proper course.

I thought of an idea where you can select the items you want to upgrade to and it will tell you exactly the costs and items to upgrade it with and give a plan on that.With any project break the idea / problem down to smaller objectives you can easily do. For the above I would do something like:* Hard code the upgrade data and item list for now* Create a function that can calculate the upgrade route of selected items* Display the items that you can select * Display the upgrade route once items are selectedNow always keep your project simple and hard coded, then you can start adding improvements. For example I can connect it to a database, maybe supabase or MySQL or mongodb, etc. I can also connect it to authentication so users can save their ideal upgrade builds, presets, etc.You want to always start small, then incrementally add to it.

Github is basically just a place where people can upload code to the internet, but taking advantage of git it allows members of a group to work on different parts of the same code in a structured way. The idea is this: you first set up a base project with a main ""branch"". Each user can then branch off of the main branch, essentially making a copy of the code in the main branch, that they can edit on their computer. When one person has made good progress on some feature or part of the code, they can then ""merge"" their code into the main branch. The other users can then ""pull"" that code while working on their branches to make sure everything works well together.This is a really high level description that misses some of the main features of git, but it's definitely the tool you want to be using for this sort of thing.As for designing a game, as with any moderately sized project, the MOST, and I mean MOST, important part is planning. Don't just have each person writing their own bit of code without knowing how the pieces will connect. Literally draw diagrams on paper detailing how different classes will interact, what functions each class will implement, etc. before diving into the code.

n7ebxgi,"There's a common misconception among those new to the software industry that all code is brand new. Most code is legacy code, that is, code that's been around a while, maybe years and years, and you're fixing bugs or adding features. It's rare for a company to ditch their code, find the next new language, and rewrite the entire codebase. One big reason is lack of documentation.I worked on software where the customer would want various features added. It had grown over the nearly two decades it existed until no one really knew the full extent of what the code did because, surprise, surprise, it was never documented. But even if it was, rewriting is only nice for the programmer. The end user generally doesn't see much. Rewrites often introduce bugs and leaves out key features because the developers never knew what all the features were.This is why certain languages hang around. Many newcomers think the industry is quick to jump on languages like Rust and abandon Java, but it's not just the language, it's the massive amount of code that runs and works. More than that, it's the data. If you switch platforms, is your legacy data compatible with the kind of data the new platform expects? In electrical engineering terms, this is called an *impedance mismatch* (which causes inefficiencies in power flow).For PHP, what I heard was it was easy to write, but hard to maintain. That is, people wrote bad code. It was blamed on PHP, more than the coders. It also came when the web was young, so there were still chances for other web frameworks. I'd say the 2010s were the era of these web frameworks. React, for whatever reason, won out over Angular. Vue and Svelte came later, but when a community heads to one framework/library, it creates a critical mass which forces others to join.For example, most web devs need to know Javascript. They could use Dart, but Javascript seems more essential, and so Dart (other than through Flutter) didn't come to replace Javascript.Often, there aren't exactly technical advantages. For example, most people agree Python is a pretty slow language. Despite that, it's become the language used in numerical methods, data visualization, data mining, machine learning, and AI. How did it do that? The main attraction was its simplicity (ish). But also, it allowed for code written in C to look like Python functions. If it were written in native Python, it would be very slow, but because it was optimized in C, a compiled language, these libraries run fast.Python has a huge set of libraries that do all sorts of things. After Java, Python may be the second most popular language taught in US colleges. It's become the language to use for AI coding, so everyone jumps on that bandwagon.But, it could have been Ruby. It could have been Clojure. It could have been a brand new language (unlikely).

I learned through codecademy for basics then in my sales role out of college I built a tool for myself to automate some of my role. That became surprisingly successful despite being simple as hell (literally my first project ever). It was just a webscraper with beautiful soup 4. My point is more so that the problem here is about hiring and understanding the market data. If you study it in depth (this is actually my educational background ie HR) yes there are less jobs and that has directly led to waaaaaaaay more applicants per posting which means a waaaaay smaller chance of your resume ever being seen by a human and its ultimately just making it clear how awful the entire hiring process always has been ... imo the worst process in the world by far and so companies are often relying on referrals from employees as they tend to work better given that the employees can typically be more trustworthy than a resume and team cohesion and ability to get along with the team is one of the most important things any typical hiring manager is gonna care about (not saying that this should be the case). So why i bring up my case is that getting a job is just sales and referrals are a great way to do sales. If they know you and like you they will hire you. Especially at places that aren't truly NASA or OpenAI or FAANG. I personally feel that most job advice in this subreddit feels like its skewed towards those companies because they did truly use to hire 1000s of juniors but there's still millions of 20-50 person companies in non tech intensive industries that cant tell good from bad skill level to begin with and are hiring.I'll also add that no one told me about the functional programming job route and how surprisingly little competition there is for some of these companies. While some typical job postings will have over 1000 applicants these functional jobs will have less than 50 and even then its not hard to beat out the other 50 Lastly the other nuance to share here is that alllll industries right now to the best of my knowledge are crap for hiring.

Personally as an interviewer, I am always very interested in hearing about projects people have written just because it interests them. - Document your projects, and make them representable. I like seeing Github URLs on applicant their CVs, but interviewers are likely not going to check out more than 1-3 projects. Pin or highlight the projects you are most proud of, provide them with good documentation, if possible with screenshots or in case of a web app: a demo website. Make it easy to run.

It’s a muscle, not a gift, and it takes time and the right kind of practice.Instead of rushing through LeetCode, start small and deliberately:Pick simple problems (like on Exercism, Codewars, Edabit, or even structured platforms like Dataquest) and write out your thought process before coding anything.Read “*How to Solve It”* by Polya, it’s not about code, but about how to approach problems methodically.Watch CS50 lectures (especially the problem-solving parts), and go through hands-on projects like “*Build Your Own X* “ when you're ready.Also, don’t panic when you get stuck. Practice tracing code with pen and paper, talking through your logic, and working with a study group or mentor if possible. Avoid relying on AI tools until you've tried solving it on your own first.

n7acxlr,"Let's start by noting that not everyone understands the language of a problem description. Sometimes, things written in English still require translation into their native language. This is the first thing you can try.Then you can try solving the problem from two perspectives. Let's call them top-down and bottom-up.When solving from the top, you try to understand the highest layer of the problem, the business layer, from the solution's perspective, and then break it down into smaller problems, abstraction layer by abstraction layer.When solving from the bottom, you usually find some lowest problem to solve that you know you'll have to solve, and you build on it with successive steps upward. Sometimes you can create more such starting points and combine them into a single whole.I think solving from the top is easier and clearer, but I've also met people who solve from the bottom-up and were able to write code effectively.It's also worth trying to find solutions by analogy to already known solutions and the source code written for them. Here, you can use two sources, provided you can describe and connect the dots to the problem. One is the internet and its resources, and the trick is finding similar solutions. The second is looking at the code and finding similar implementations. For example, if you need to create a button with a message, and you already have another one somewhere in your application, you can see how it can be done, and that's a starting point for your own solutions.A final, but quite helpful, step is to write the documentation for the problem or function yourself. Not necessarily for the sake of maintaining it, but to understand the essence, clear your mind, and describe the problem. If you can't describe the problem, it's possible that what you're trying to do is intertwined with something else, insufficiently thought out, known, or documented. An example would be writing the documentation for a function before implementing it. If you can't write it, it's likely that you don't fully understand what you want to do. You might not be trying to implement one function, but two (or more) at once, and the problem isn't broken down into manageable components. Writing documentation, if successful, will force you to clarify what needs to be done, and implementation is then more of a detail.Some solutions also involve trial and error, retrospection, and retry. This happens, and don't be discouraged. Not everything can be built in one go.Summing up all the above, you'll definitely be trying to break the problem down into smaller components in some way, iteratively, step by step, until you reach a solution.

n6jpce4,"This is a lovely sentiment and there are some good tips in here. But this also assumes that the candidate is able to consistently get through to have an actual interview with an actual person.In reality, few companies will even respond to your applications. I actually get a little thrill when I get a rejection email (I’d ballpark it at about 10% of my applications actually receiving a rejection). You have layers of AI filtering before you can even get to a human. And I can assure you that the AI filters do not care about the super exciting hike I went on last weekend even if it could create that moment of good vibes with a human that you are emphasizing.The hiring system IS adversarial. It’s turned into a sheer numbers game, a game of maximizing your odds of getting through the AI filters and still coming out vaguely believable on the other side. If I actually got a chance to speak with people regularly, I’d have a much different approach to how I apply, believe me. But I simply can’t afford to spend an hour retranslating my life experience into a bespoke application for every job listing when I know there is a very low chance anyone is even going to look at it and a lower chance I’ll beat out the other 300 people who applied for it within the first 5 minutes of it being listed.And while my heart goes out to all the gainfully employed hiring managers who find pressing a button to blanket filter out candidates a bit distasteful, I can assure you it feels infinitely worse on the other side where there are *actual* stakes (like can I feed my family next month).Again, I’m not trying to trash you or anything.

n72gyzw,"It sounds like you are in front of a fork in the road for your career. Ultimately, you gotta decide what is it that you want to do. I recommend that you don’t prioritize what you love or are passionate about. Obviously it is amazing if you love/are passionate about your career, but that does not give you much flexibility. It’s fine if you don’t stay in CS/SWE, but I think the answer for leaving should be more nuanced than “it’s not my passion”.So to dig into that a bit deeper, why did you get into software development 6 years ago? Have the reasons back then changed? You mentioned that sometimes you wish you never had to look at code again, is there a specific reason why? Are those reasons innate to coding itself or the conditions of your workplace? One way you can test that question is by trying to learn some fundamental computer science theory. TBF this is an assumption, but I strongly suspect your bootcamp set you up to learn programming languages and frameworks and it didn’t teach you the fundamentals and theory of computer science. I think that’s important to learn in order to develop some passion since it makes the field an actual study, not a traded skill.I’ll use history as an example since that was your major. A lot of people don’t like history because they see it as just the practice of accounting of the events that happened in the past. To them, it feels like there’s “history” and there’s “current events” and the two aren’t connected much in their view. But a historian will understand how history is both a representation of the past and current events. They understand how history gives us a critical basis for evaluating human sociology, economics, politics, etc.There’s an analogous experience that a SWE can have with coding and computer science. It’s obviously not going to get nearly into humanities studies like history, but its conceptualizations extend in their own ways in surprising ways.If you read this and think “I really don’t care about any of that and I have no will to invest my time in that”, that’s totally fair and it would give you important feedback for your dilemma. At the end of the day, whether you are passionate about it or not, you gotta have a mind that is curious to explore your professional field. If your mindset is similar to that as a cashier who doesn’t wish to expand their skillset in retail, then you’ll remain stagnant just as a cashier will. It may feel like you shouldn’t be stagnant since you obviously work in a field that requires more skills than being a cashier. But stagnation isn’t about where you are currently. It’s about how you are growing. TL;DR: Try to invest more time in learning CS fundamentals and theory to see if it will give you a new perspective for finding interests in this field. If it doesn’t or you do not want to do that, then you’ll remain stagnant should consider what would you be willing to do that for and how can you make a career with that.",Doub1eVision,2025-08-05 15:27:36,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1mibizp,False,

The technical interview REALLY depends on the company. I'm interviewing for C++ positions, so the company will ask you questions about the non-trivial part of the language most relevant to them (examples are virtual methods, exceptions, thread synchronization, templates, stuff like that). They will also ask you general language and data structure questions(examples: the differences between map and unordered_map and between list and vector), and they might throw a leetcode-like problem in to see whether you understand concepts like big-O notation. Some companies can also ask you a bunch of really low-level questions where you'll need to know about alignment, big-endian vs little-endian, and the C standard library.The behavioural interview is the basic HR questions(like ""what was your biggest fuckup?"" and ""why are you switching jobs?""). One company I worked at gave me a personality test, but it was a legit one developed by scientists for professional orientation purposes, not something like MBTI(and the company itself was really nice and chill).

Layoffs started happening, and by the time my number was called, about 7/8 months later, about 60% of employees had been let go. Stock price was in the toilet. But my strike price was really low, so it was still something. From my several millions on paper, I ended up getting about $75K out of it. Not horrible. That would be worth about $150-160K today. Not life changing money, but enough to put a downpayment on a couple of houses. Which in turn appreciated to where it is life changing money. So indirectly I guess I did get those millions.Once I was laid off, I chilled out for about 2 months, I played a lot of golf.

I’ll warn that to someone with my level of experience it’s obvious that this sub is full of people who are barely into their career, and people who have done very little research into other careers.I can get another job easily even in this economy. It would be hard to get a job that pays as much as my current job does, but I’d still be making at least $180k. There’s very, very few other careers that can say something similar short of becoming a doctor. The reality is that becoming a software engineer is still one of your best options.Breaking into this career is hard. But so is breaking into most careers worth pursuing, and at the end other options will generally offer lower rewards than this one. If you network well, apply seriously and broadly, and do proper interview prep, eventually you’ll land something. I started out in a QA role that paid me less then my pizza delivery job, now I make nearly $300k.Far too many people in this sub preach about how you have to be passionate about software. That’s bull. The majority of the highly successful engineers I know, I’m talking people making over $300k, are very transparent they are only in it for the money. Passion isn’t a requirement. Being willing to work hard is. If anything the passionate people were the ones who tend to get suckered into longer hours and lower pay.The only career people can even try to compare with the perks of software engineering is the trades, and that’s largely coming from people who don’t know much about the trades and are parroting what they’ve heard. The trades, on average, don’t pay nearly as much as software engineering. There are some exceptions, but even those tend to only pay the level of highly skilled senior software engineers, if we compare them to the exceptions for software engineers then engineering pay still generally blows the trades out of the water.Trade jobs that pay well are also highly competitive, trade jobs are limited to in person job opportunities, they’re incredibly hard on your body, they often require long hours, and they are rampant with sexism such that it’s hardly even a real option for women. Depending on where you live your race might also be a problem for the trades. If it were as easy to make a ton of money in the trades as some people pretend it is then everyone would do it.

n72rfde,"I’m a software engineer with 19 years work experience. There will always be a need for software engineers as technology progresses. Here are the things you need to know, not immediately but keep them in mind:1. New tech is always coming out, so you have to be comfortable constantly learning. For example, you should absolutely be taking classes about AI, ML, and LLMs in college. 10 years from now, there will be something else. You can’t just sit on knowledge in this field like in other fields, you have to keep learning or you get left behind. 2. Microsoft tech stack isn’t used many places outside of government. Focus on Python and/or Java, as they are the two most popular in the real world. Learn fullstack eventually so you understand how the systems interact. 3. Learn system design. You will learn more about the components in college, the earlier you learn this the better. Hellointerview is really good for this. 4. Obviously DSA is critical. You need to be very comfortable with this. You will learn it in college, but getting started early can’t hurt. Lots of resources online. 5. Learn cloud. Again, Microsoft tech isn’t used much. AWS is king, followed by google cloud. I would recommend learning AWS. You don’t have to be an expert but learn how to use it and what the different parts do. 6. Make a GitHub account and work on projects. Especially anything cloud related and/or AI related. 7. Don’t buy CS books (except school books). Everything you need can be found online, for free. 8. I would recommend taking computer engineering instead of computer science, if you can. It’s half CS and half electrical engineering. You will learn how both the software and hardware work together, and if you decide you like hardware better, you can easily pivot to EE.9. Learn CI/CD fundamentals. Again, you don’t have to be an expert, but understanding how real releases to production work will help you be a more mature software engineer. Be comfortable setting up a build in something like Jenkins or Azure DevOps, for example. 10. Learn version control. Git is by far the most popular. ——Maybe I’ll add more if I think of anything else.

n7lrdn9,"Having interviewed with them three times, the answer is an unequivocal and resounding **yes**.First, there is little to no communication between recruiters, much less between departments. The first time I interviewed, I got the OA from two different recruiters and the one who had actually reached out had to send the other one an email letting them know I was already working with him. It's absurd that they don't have a system to take care of these issues.Second, they have way too many ""leadership principles,"" and they contradict each other - you can't ""dive deep"" and ""insist on the highest standards"" while also having a ""bias for action."" Their methodology for evaluating them is also extremely flawed, as they ask a question per LP and that is the only data they use to determine how you did. I told a story in one interview about being asked to lead a technical presentation for one of the biggest banks in the world after being with the company 90 days. I then learned (shout out to my recruiter for giving me any feedback) that I scored poorly in ""earns trust."" Yeah, okay.Third, they basically abandon the whole ""data-driven"" methodology with their myopic ""raising the bar"" principle. Who decides how good the ""average Amazonian"" is? Through what process? Twice I was told I was ""at the bar but not raising it."" Another way to say this is that they acknowledged I was better than about half the people there but they will continue to be employed by Amazon but I'm not good enough. Never mind that one of their LPs is ""hire **and develop** the best"" - if you're not one of the best already, you're not ""raising the bar"" and they're not interested.There are some things they do well. They leave the qualifications intentionally vague to cast a wide net, and it's not just for show; they do genuinely give interview opportunities to a lot of engineers (like me) who wouldn't get them from someone like Apple or Netflix.

Work on those, ask quesitons, etc but at the same time: \- Learn the version control system / branching strategy / release schedule / rollback policies etc better than anyone else in the organization. You'll find that most people are fuzzy on large parts of it and you'll be able to solve and prevent many problems simply by not being fuzzy.\- Find out where all the documentation is and start reading it. It will be of varying quality and often out of date but get comfortable with the org's business, architecture, network infrastructure, personnel structure, etc.\- Talk to as many people as you can, in all roles and departments. Learn what they do. You will eventually save someone from a million dollar mistake because you will have awareness of things that no one else does. Make people like you and see you as useful. You will get many more opportunities that way.\- Learn your tools and technology stack deeply. In the AI era it's more important than ever. It just takes a few books. Learn everything about Java, be able to talk about the major features that were added at various milestones and why you would use them.

Or maybe AI will let them be halfway useful to someone, as they bridge the role more towards PM and req analysis.The regular juniors... the usual experience with interns/juniors is* They just sit there waiting for you to tell them what to do.* They need clear instructions on what to do* They just focus on getting something out that works, not thinking of maintainability, testing, scaling, etc.* Try to sneak in their favorite language, library, framework when you aren't watching* Always push for a rebuild from scratch rather than understanding the code.All of the above is replicated by LLMs. The regular and senior SDEs aren't necessarily better coders, we are just more proactive about what to do, suggesting improvements, watch for the above and know when to do each, ensure things are mantainable, thi k of broader picture etc.None of these are difficult, but is hard to explain and normally something you learn by experience. A junior who quickly learns the above and acts more grown up will do well ""overseeing"" LLM coders. How to upskill people like that is a difficult question. One of the most useful classes in my university ended up being our software engineering class where we went through more ""BS"" type stuff like requirements, project planning, etc and built a big project as a class. Universities might need to dedicate another semester to that type of classes including LLM coding as part of building something large and making changesOf course, the next couple of years are going to be rough as companies try to upskill their current juniors, drying up the need for new juniors. Ideally what would happen is that any efficiency improvements would result in more projects so the labor market would be the same, but we're in this in between where that hasn't materialized, so companies are hedging their bets and holding off hiring until they know if there are efficiency improvements and more projects can be put in their 2026 plans and/or how their HR budgets change.",ZenEngineer,2025-08-08 18:01:56,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1ml190k,False,

n6uyhw3,"Totally feel you! It's frustrating when your day job doesn't expose you to the kind of scale modern job postings demand.The way I see it, side projects or open-source contributions are a solid workaround.

n6mv81f,"I did OMSCS, after I dropped out of a bioinformatics PhD, so I both know what it takes to get into grad school, and did OMSCS.OMSCS does have some research opportunities, but they are a bit limited and remote, so you have to really push. It's very much a class based masters and the majority of students don't do any research. If your goal is to find advisors, ones who can write the type of letters that get you into grad school, you can certainly do that. I'd ask on r/OMSCS for stories, but I know it's possible.I was also interested in Type Theory (Haskell programmer at the time) and unfortunately I didn't find any faculty working on that. I wasn't going back to grad school (did that once), though, and my main focus for doing the program was to get a better grip on CS fundamentals and help grow my industry career. For that, it was extremely effective and I got into big tech pretty soon after graduating. I did find this: [https://omscs.gatech.edu/research-opportunities](https://omscs.gatech.edu/research-opportunities) I'd check that out. All that said, the way I got into a PhD program was by working for a professor as a lab tech, doing good work, and getting into the program hosted by the school. To get into a PhD program, grades and papers help, but what it really comes down to is one professor with influence speaking on your behalf.

So because of that, most folks don't see the reason to do a PhD. The main exception is FAANG or Quant Finance Research Scientists - almost all want a PhD. There are great professors - Joyner, Jeff Wilson, Jay Summet - who would be willing to write a letter if you do well in the class and are active in discussions and office hours.The biggest difference between in person and online is that you get out what you put in in terms of social interaction.

Stony Brook actually seems reasonable for theoretical CS and is in commuting distance which is why it's still currently my goal for a Masters.Just in case, do you know if OMSCS as a Masters might carry more weight than a lesser known program? I mostly want to do the Masters for myself and I assume any reasonable CS Masters probably carries *enough* weight for job market purposes. Juts not sure if maybe OMSCS might actually be the safer route job-wise (I'll probably still just go to Stony Brook but wanted to collect the info).",Tecoloteller,2025-08-03 03:57:17,1,cscareerquestions,t1_n6mv81f,True,

A lot of people go through the program and talk about how difficult it is, so graduating is generally seen as an accomplishment. We have a slack channel at work, and right now there's a few other people going through the program.The only caveat I'd give, is that OMSCS is course based, not thesis based, so if you're looking for the masters to qualify you to do some specific type of dev work, like distributed systems or databases, it might be harder since you won't have a lot of project based experience on that one specific thing.As for just a general qualification, it's definitely good enough for industry roles like FE, BE, full stack, infrastructure/platfor, product.

n7n486w,"First, stop worrying about wasting time. Time invested up-front trying to figure out what you like will unlock a lifetime of enjoyment. Second, feel lost but don’t stay lost. I don’t know a single person who made it anywhere worthwhile who hasn’t felt absolutely and hopelessly lost at some point in their life. But if you sit in your own mess you’ll get nowhere so don’t underestimate the power of starting small to try and figure stuff out.Third, who cares? And I don’t mean this in a condescending way. But more like, so there’s other students who do better, so there’s people ahead of you, so there are millions of calculator apps or whatever, but frankly who cares? Unless you’re trying to become a billionaire with your first app (which is a wild delusion for most folks at some point) your thought process is wrong on this. You need to crawl, then walk, then run. Which means build the things others have made, at least you have guides. Build off of those if you want, I promise you some guy on stack overflow 9 years ago has answers for what you’re stuck on. Personal projects are about learning what you enjoy doing. To that effect who cares what others have done, if you enjoy doing it go for it. I promise doing what you enjoy will push you that 10-20% above based on motivation alone.Fourth, just start. Whatever it is, just start. Internships, coffee chats, mock interviews, career counseling through your college. Just start. Analysis paralysis is very real. The only way past it is to make some decision even if it end up being suboptimal. You need to break the tie.Fifth, discipline. I hate it, most people hate it. But the phrase “hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard” still rings true. Whatever you choose to do, stick through it. If you’re an international student I’m sure that alone comes with a fair amount of discipline. Being thousands of miles away and still doing what you’re supposed to do everyday. It doesn’t matter if you join leadership or be an IC. You need consistency and discipline to see results.Lastly, I’ll say is, while learning to keep going is important, learning when to pivot is even more important. Note I didn’t say quit. Pivoting is just redirecting your energy to what makes more sense for you and your interests. You have limited time and limited energy, you can’t do everything heck even Superman can’t. So you need to learn to prioritize and pivot.For right now, rest assured that 2 years is a drop in the ocean for a potential pivot to a rewarding 40-45 year career. You’re not a lost cause, you’re just young. I promise you everyone is as confused as you are. Just start something small even if everyone has done it and stay out of your head so you can keep marching forwards with whatever pivot you choose in your life.",styada,2025-08-08 18:03:12,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1ml0zcj,False,

My current role offers a set number of shares at ""today's"" market price when you sign the offer. I have previously had compensation that was a set dollar amount per vesting schedule, regardless of how the stock had moved. All depends on the company.

n6j3cfr,"Will slightly differ by company, but in general your grant amount is converted to shares at some point early on (usually about a month in based on the average price). an example: Initial Grant: $100,000/4 years Average Price in Month 1: $50 Shares Granted: 2,000/4 years Amount of shares vested after 1 year: 2,000*25% = 500 your 'profitable' scenario is any price above what your grant amount to shares conversion was ($50 in above example). That being said you'll also drop another % on vesting due to taxes, so depending on where you are the amount of shares you receive in the example above could drop to 300 (with auto selling of 40% or 200 shares for taxes)",likwitsnake,2025-08-02 14:15:57,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1mfq7w3,False,
