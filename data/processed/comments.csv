However, the investments from the dbtLabs folks will almost certainly slow down or stop. Which means dbt may be staleware in a few years.2. **Necessity is the mother of invention.** The acquisition alone is reason to inspire others to build higher-level abstractions that don't inherit dbt's innate weaknesses. *(Does anyone really think dbt+Jinja was the ideal solution?)* The next generation of transformation solutions should accomplish more with less code, and with semantic metadata baked in.I've built three dbt clones in my career, two of which were *before* dbt itself launched, and one of which was successfully [patented](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10846284B1/en) during my time at Amazon AWS. I am eternally thankful to dbt because it was the first CI/CD-friendly transformation tool to reach critical market share. The dbt team proved to the world that ""transformations as code"" is viable and that data pipelines are not incompatible with SDLC best practices.The future has been changed for the better because dbt exists, but dbt is neither the only solution nor the best solution for the problems data engineers face today and tomorrow.There will be more and better solutions on the horizon. :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:",burnfearless,2025-10-14 00:55:55,15,dataengineering,t3_1o5q0ll,False,

Photon, catalyst, etc. won’t do it for you. There is an enormous amount of electricity and money burning out there in unoptimized Spark jobs, where a traditionals RDBMS SQL shop was convinced they can unlock 20% performance by just migrating to Databricks, whereas with a little investment they could achive 10x+ faster and more efficient jobs.

You'll learn by shipping stuff.1b - Yes learn DBT1c - Don't think about it just ship.2a - Get a solid, easy to expand ETL/ELT service going. Adding more data to your DW should be *easy*. When non-data people come to you with ""oh I wanted to see X data that's not on the DW"", you should be like ""oh I'll get it there for you"" and within a few bizdays it's there. Have an ELT/ETL layer that's simple and easy to expand, and this sort of interaction will happen.2b - You should be chilling in your spare time, you'll learn all you need by working on building the stuff that's just beyond what you can comfortably deliver right now. Progressive overload. Don't settle, but don't try to reach for the moon right away. Build yourself a ladder first.2c - Just build stuff, and when the subject come up you say you're learning data engineering on the fly, out of necessity.If you're doing any sort of data-related study in your spare time, I recommend the more theoretical, foundational stuff.

njr2uou,"You have an incredible opportunity ahead of you.1. if you have devops make friends RIGHT AWAY. If you don't consider how you want to manage Infrastructure in this new world you get to great my advice would be look at a reference architecture for a lake house on AWS. Ask your company to send you to re:Invent in December take hands onlabs for building data lakes (avoid any sales sessions just do hands on labs) you will come out with a better idea of what to do. Also take a BASIC terraform course. It will make everything better. It will be confusing at first but ChatGPT/Claude will get you most of the way there. AWS + Python gives you A LOT of options. IMO DBT is kinda shitty. SQL ETL's are ass, because you cannot really unit test these things effectively. Focus more on python (it will get you 90% of what you need for most use cases) look at serverless event driven architectures, less work less thinking long term but you need to monitor that shit and make sure the SPICE FLOWS! Postgres is fine. Your use cases determine your data persistence. If you don't have a lot of data don't over complicate shit use and RDBMS + Python, geter done.2. look back at 1. I personally don't think much of DEs that focused on DBT or Databricks they usually don't know much....sorry to say that but it's the truth. I want coders. I want people who understand distributed systems. I don't care if people know Redshift of Snowflake as long as they understand what those systems are...MPPs. That's abstracted from most DEs. It means Sr folks have to learn ya some shit about an MPP like redshift and snowflake both great infra but they cost and abstract aspects of what's going on under the hood. They are not a golden hammer. Look at the use cases. Postgres on aurora can bang out A LOT of DE use cases. Don't buy a destroyer class ship to manage bass fishing :Db. pyspark is a good thing to pick up. Understand when you want a python script v a pyspark script to run a job. Understand shit like Airflow and how you split compute from your orchestration layer. Airflow is not an ETL it's orchestration. ELT work and computer is done on other infra like an AWS lambda. As you go further focus on microservices, apis, event driven architectures stuff like that. c. AWS tools are legit DE tools you just gotta look at the right shit. Get a cursory understanding these AWS servies (timebox yourself to a few hours total here) EventBridge, Kinesis, Manage Ariflow, managed kafka, lambdas, glue, redshift. aurora(postgresql). Athena. You can solve pretty much all problems with these with out really managing much infra. I can count on one hand the number of times my serverless systems have died in production....AWS went down each time :D.....that was a long one DM me I am an old hand.

When making code changes, run the sample source data through your pipeline and verify that the output table still matches the contents of your csv of expected results.

In CH you can't refer to parts outside the subquery, but you can achieve the same result by re-ordering the logic slightly without a full table scan & aggregation: WITH base AS ( SELECT li1.l_orderkey AS ""o_key"", sup.s_name AS ""s_name"", COUNT(1) AS ""line_count"" FROM supplier AS sup JOIN lineitem AS li1 ON li1.l_suppkey = sup.s_suppkey JOIN orders AS odr ON odr.o_orderkey = li1.l_orderkey JOIN nation AS nat ON nat.n_nationkey = sup.s_nationkey ANY JOIN lineitem AS li2 -- Other suppliers were present ON li2.l_orderkey = li1.l_orderkey AND li2.l_suppkey != li1.l_suppkey WHERE odr.o_orderstatus = 'F' AND li1.l_receiptdate > li1.l_commitdate -- The supplier delivered late AND nat.n_name = 'SAUDI ARABIA' -- Specified by benchmark GROUP BY li1.l_orderkey, sup.s_name ) , sole AS ( SELECT o_key FROM base GROUP BY o_key HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT s_name) = 1 ) SELECT base.s_name, SUM(base.line_count) AS ""numwait"" -- Appears to be what the original benchmark is after FROM base JOIN sole ON sole.o_key = base.o_key -- Assert only this supplier caused delays GROUP BY base.s_name ORDER BY SUM(base.line_count) DESC, sup.s_nameIn general, explore the range of different joins such as [any join](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-fully-supports-joins-part1#left--right--inner-any-join) and [anti join](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-fully-supports-joins-part1#left--right-anti-join) which Clickhouse has and be careful translating exists / not exists from the benchmark spec.

njq7mit,"Athena and Redshift are quite different tools. Redshift (2012) is a full data warehouse living on a cluster, you have to provision a cluster to store the table's data. It has an SQL query engine (optionally serverless) based on a proprietary, massively parallel processing columnar database engine and an old fork of PostgreSQL 8. It has its own specific table storage optimizations such as distribution styles and sort keys. It is designed for data warehousing and BI.Athena is newer (2016), and solely a query engine (based on open-source Trino by default, or Spark), so you need to manage the data storage in another tool, such as S3. It's designed for interactive querying on data lakes, while Glue is designed for ETL. Although it doesn't mean you can't use Athena for transformations, I just would not bet that it will be cheaper than Glue (serverless Spark) for production ETLs. The design of interactive query tools is usually made to be faster in exchange for more resources consumption, which may not be the best trade-off for production ETLs.Running Spark on EMR may be a cheaper way to run distributed SQL transformations on AWS, but then you have to deal with EMR cluster management.",sib_n,2025-10-16 02:00:32,5,dataengineering,t3_1o7kzhx,False,

We even competed head-to-head with Cloudera who used the open-source PLUS model like everyone else and we had to win support contract business every single year by providing stellar support and also made money on consulting and education.

You can take a look at ready-made platforms or open-source tools to ingest data from all these different sources you need. * At this stage, the data would land in a place you control in a certain layout and structure at least.* In terms of formats, the answer would depend very heavily on the types of formats: * If you have machine-readable formats like JSON, CSV, Excel files, Parquet files, and whatnot, this just becomes an orchestration problem, throw a data pipeline tool on it and you are golden. * I presume that's not the only thing, since you give the PDF example. Parsing PDFs with varying schemas over time is a hell I don't wish my worst enemies to go through, so that's not easy. * I have recently played around with Mistral's OCR model to extract a bunch of invoice data and it worked flawlessly, tackled \~95% of our incoming invoices. * This would still require you to build a data pipeline solution around this, where the underlying work would be done by an AI model that would extract the structured data. * Once you have the structured data out, you would store this data in a data warehouse or a data lake with a clear schema and structure.From this point onwards, you would have a:* Central lake where you store the raw files* A data warehouse / data lake where you store the extracted and structured dataThis would theoretically get you to a better place.

The special thing about a system call is that it allows *user* code (running with low privileges) to call *kernel* code (running with high privileges) in a controlled way.The kernel can ""receive"" syscalls from user code, but within the kernel itself, plain old function calls are used. If you read the source code for Linux, which is written in C, you'll mostly just see a lot of functions calling other functions.In terms of what those function calls within the kernel actually *do*: sometimes they just manipulate data, like any other function you might write yourself. For instance, the ""list of running processes"" is a kernel data structure, so when you start a new process running with the `fork` and `exec` syscalls, you're just calling kernel code that adds a new entry to that list.Similarly, when you use a syscall like `write` to ""print"" text from your program, normally what you're really doing is writing characters to a queue (a.k.a. a pipe or FIFO). Some other part of the system (e.g. a terminal emulator) is going to read those characters and figure out how to display them on the screen. The queue itself belongs to the kernel, so programs use syscalls to ask the kernel to read and write it.On the other hand, some of the kernel code has to manipulate hardware. It usually does this by accessing special memory addresses ([memory-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O_and_port-mapped_I/O)) which read or write the corresponding registers in a hardware device. The kernel's higher privilege level allows it to do this directly.

Rarely can you get all three at once.Object-oriented programming and functional programming are approaches for managing system complexity. With OOP, you're defining components as ""objects"" with specific functionalities so that you have a system-wide vocabulary for what things do. Furthermore, by making things modular, you limit how much you have to fit in your head at any one time in order to change the system.With functional programming, you're trying to isolate state to as few places as possible and keep all your functions throughout your system simple and deterministic, so when you're writing a function you have a finite number of ways that function can behave and it's simple to create, write, and test.I have met very few engineers who understand why OOP and FP are desirable. They just follow them dogmatically because they were taught them in college and don't know how to do things another way. Furthermore, they often do them wrong. They think simply using functions is FP or just defining boilerplate objects is OOP without actually writing coherent modules to reduce system complexity.If you'd like a more robust discussion on this, my favorite book on the topic is ""A Philosophy of Software Design"" by John Ousterhout.

Someone can design a class and give it a very simple public interface. They can then trust that junior engineers can safely call the public interface and it will work correctly.Similarly, it can enable someone to extend an existing well-written class and customize its behavior while ensuring the core functionality still works.Without OOP, it'd be much easier for lots of people all working on the same project to do something wrong or break something.Sometimes the goal is to enforce rules for yourself!

nj6g1ar,">Why is OOP such a crazy thing to try to define in your own words, with it making sense?Because it's a very nebulous term that over the course of its history has been used to mean different things by different people. Like, people are still arguing over what this term means to this day, and they refuse to agree on a concrete definition.Typically though, OOP is, unsurprisingly centered around the idea of ""objects""; encapsulated bundles of data, and methods that can interact with a given instance of said data. Under an OOP framework, a program is simply various interactions between different component objects.In a Tamagotchi, you have a 'pet', that gets fed 'food' that you buy from the 'store', and keep in your 'inventory' until needed. The 'pet' can have different 'states' that effect its behaviour - states like ""hungry"", ""happy"" or ""dead"". All of these are displayed to the user of the game by a 'game window', and specific information can be managed by a 'settings manager'. You get the gist.Many people argue that OOP has proverbial 'pillars'; ""encapsulation"" (keeping related fields and methods bundled together in classes), ""inheritance"" (objects can inherit behaviour of other objects), and ""polymorphism"" (use an interface, dummy), but that's another question, and whether some of them matter enough is again, in contention.",DTux5249,2025-10-12 22:28:17,25,learnprogramming,t3_1o52b64,False,

An object ""dog"" based on ""pet"" would add on siblings (list), photo (BLOB), and maybe functions bark(), dotrick() and so on. But you can also create object ""cat"" based on ""pet"", add color notes, color pattern, photo (BLOB), siblings (list), preferred toy, etc.What are some things only cat would do?

nj7h2y8,OOP has become a nebulous term over time such that it can mean everything and nothing. I have to prefix what I think it is with “it’s just my opinion man” as opposed to saying this is the agreed on definition:I believe that OOP boils down to the idea that solutions to problems can be modeled as “objects” which are a collection of methods and data those methods manipulate.Going a step further - encapsulation in this specific form means that users of the objects only need to understand its interface (that is the methods it exposes) should not need to understand the underlying object. An example of this would be creating an instance of a class called HTTPServer and using it will cause it to start an http server without exposing you to the underlying sockets or network protocols to make it work - you don’t need to know all of the variables used by HTTPServer.,Antsolog,2025-10-13 02:17:30,3,learnprogramming,t3_1o52b64,False,

Sign up for courses that both teach you something fundamental and make you implement things. Operating systems is a perfect example. You will learn a lot about how computers work from a low level and it will include writing and reading code. Other examples could be networks, distributed systems, embedded systems, or computer graphics. Basically any class where your homework is largely writing code. Many classes could fall into this category or not depending on how they're taught. For example, some compilers courses will have you write a compiler and others will just teach the theory and test you in it. Check the course before signing up to make sure it is not too theory heavy.This is how you learn programming fundamentals, by learning how other people solved hard problems and then reimplementing the solutions yourself. For example, instead of learning about software design in an abstract sense, just learn about operating systems. You'll learn all the OOP principles. Separation of concerns, modularization, polymorphism. And what's even cooler is you'll learn it all in a language that isn't even OOP and then you will have an aha moment when you realize OOP is not the foundation.If you have extra time to study, spend it doing the optional challenge exercises or questions on your homeworks/labs or join a team building a project.

I'd avoid any book with the word ""cookbook"" in the title for the same reason.What you want when you're learning a big topic is a big, comprehensive source that was built to teach that larger topic from soup to nuts, so you take a well-planned path through all the material you need and get a single, coherent perspective.

Computers are not capable of storing anything but integer values, which is why we devise so many various encoding schemes for things that aren't integers.And the answer it is more useful not to when treating them as string/character values, and not really all that useful when parsing a string into a numeric type. First, the idea only properly works for integers. Second, it only really works in a useful way for single digits. You need a minimum of 4 bits to count to 9 (`b1001`) and then quite a bit more for letters and punctuation. Even if we eliminate all of the control characters and limit ourselves to printable characters included in ASCII encoding, you still need at least 7 bits to cover those 95 characters with values from 0 (`b0000000`) to 94 (`b1011110`). We haven't even saved a single bit eliminating those (generally) unnecessary codes, but there aren't a lot of machines using 7-bit addressing these days, so let's assume the smallest numeric type you could use for encoding is probably 8 bits anyway. So to store the value 255 you would need 3 bytes. What's the super easy conversion to go from `b00000010-b00000101-b00000101` to `b11111111`? There isn't one really.

njkqvzh,"First, think about who will use the app and where. If it's just you on one computer, the easiest way is Python with Flask. Flask lets you make a simple website to view and edit data, and SQLite can store everything in a single file. You will need a backup plan for the database, but it's simple and doesn't require a server.If multiple people need access at the same time, you will need a server and a proper database. Node.js lets you run JavaScript on the server to handle multiple users. A NoSQL database like MongoDB is easier than SQL for beginners because you don't have to plan tables and relationships in advance. You can just add new fields as you go (Useful if they later need to add random stuff they forgot to mention). An online database just means the database lives on a server everyone can access, but it requires hosting, security, and backups. There are generous free tiers but it adds complexity.For now, start small with Flask and SQLite on your own computer as a demo. Focus on the key features, tracking animals, medications, and volunteer logs. Once it works, you can think about scaling it with Node.js and MongoDB if more people need access or using something like Pymongo to keep using your Flask app instead of redoing it in Node.js.What you are building is a basic CRUD app with a form to add new animals and a table to view them. It's simple enough that an AI could probably build it for you. If you want to learn, use AI as a tutor or guide so you don't get lost. Keep it simple.

nj9e95e,"It depends on where in the world you are, because the job markets and expected qualifications differ greatly. A country suffices. From a central EU and USA perspective: A degree is not 100% necessary, but makes the entire process of finding and keeping (good) jobs a lot easier. If you want to go this route, taking all general STEM classes you can get before will help. A computer science degree will generally give you good basics, but you will be expected to ""self learn"" programming along the way. You will probably get taught the basics for programming as well, but everything beyond that is incidental. Programming is to computer science as masonry to an architect. This is the slowest route, but you will be the most well rounded, and able to go into basically any field (inside of IT) you want to specialize in. A software engineering degree locks you out of very few things: Theoretical CS research is the only thing that comes to mind, but I am sure there is a little more. It mostly has the same basics as a general computer science degree, but you specialize in how software works, is made and programming a lot more. Theoretical CS and other possible specializations, like Bio/medicine and programming, physics or IT-security will be ignored more. If you know that you want to be a programmer, this is always solid. In some countries you also have vocational training as a programmer, you can treat this like a Software Engineering degree, but shorter and with less prestige. Then you can go the self taught route. Here it's even more about a good portfolio, to prove oyu are able to work, and good networking. You need connections to get anywhere, because you need to give people a reason to even consider you an option. Normally the degree does that for you (to an extend, networking is also important if you have one) Certificates are motly completely useless in my experience. This will vary greatly throughout different regions and specific fields, but when we did technical evaluations of new candidates, we just ignored any certificates. The only thing we looked at was education and prior experience, like a portfolio or earlier jobs they've had. I know now, that in some countries they hold quite a bit more value, and that's why it's important to say where (approximately) you will be looking for work, once your education is done.

One of the best ways to keep motivation in my opinion is building something that solves a problem you have, because the drive to solve a problem is what makes programming so insanely addictive and fun. Solving a problem you have is the most rewarding and motivational thing I've ever experienced programming. So, try it out, don't wait for motivation just think of something that annoys you and build a solution. For example, I didn't like having to go to so many different sites to compress and convert different file formats so I made my own website that converts and compresses audios, videos and images in one simple place and that is one of my favorite projects because it really showed me that motivation doesn't come from waiting around or watching courses, but from solving problems, coming up with something to make and making it.Stay consistent by practicing and by making mistakes, keep yourself in that loop of frustrated about why your code isn't running but then you figure it out and you're really happy, that loop of dopamine will make learning fun and addictive for you.

This technology isn't used much nowadays, but it's relatively easy to understand.If you're writing a custom webapp backend, then you can use any server-side templating engine that you want.

Since you want C++ with game-focused projects, I’d recommend a mix of bite-sized lessons and small, incremental projects. Something that worked for me was picking tiny games, like guess-the-number, a simple text RPG, or a basic snake game, and building them step by step while learning the relevant C++ concepts as I went. That way, the code actually does something visible, which keeps it engaging. For resources, Codecademy’s C++ track has short, interactive lessons and mini projects, not free, but the interactive style is easy to follow. YouTube also has tons of free mini-game tutorials where you can follow along and build small projects. CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science isn’t C++ only, but its problem sets include games and are very project-based, plus it’s hands-on and video-driven. Building your own small projects every week or two also helps you learn syntax, loops, conditionals, OOP, and more in a way that text-heavy tutorials never do.

njnyog8,"Under the hood, the compiler generates a virtual table. Vtables are not explicitly required by the C++ spec, but it's how all the compilers do it. This is a static table of function pointers - each abstract class and derived class has it's own table. Your instance points to its table.So then, if you have a `B` instance, but through type erasure you only have an `A` pointer, then calling a method will undergo a lookup so the correct implementation is called.Maybe.The vtable only contains entries for `virtual` methods. In your example, the only entry in the vtable of both `A` and `B` will be for `print`. You didn't make `~A` virtual, so when you `delete a`, the compiler doesn't know `a` is pointing to a `B`. The compiler only knows the non-virtual interface presented to it through the `A` type.---If you google OOP in C, you can find tutorials for building objects in C, including modeling inheritance, and polymorphism. The object code generated by this exercise typically matches the C++ equivalent exactly. The first C++ compiler - CFront, was originally a transpiler to C.So why not just use C? Because the two languages have different type systems. C++ grants you much more type safety - and type safety is more than just catching errors; compilers are theorem provers, and they use type information in order to optimize more aggressively. C and C++ are both high level abstract languages, they're not high level assembly languages.

If you know that you will never extend the class or you know that it will never be destroyed via a base class pointer, then maybe not. There is a cost to making that first function virtual and you might not want to pay it.

I'm also using MacOS adn relying on CI jobs running on Linux, even for cross-platform stuff. As for versioning, I've gone from CVS, to SVN, to Perforce, to Git, trying Hg along the way. Again, it's was the company uses that matters. Dual monitors, again: the company will provide the setup. I'm using a single 32"" at home, it works great for me. But dual/triple screen is neat when working on consoles. Triple 27"" could be nice.For monitors, size is one thing, resolution and frequency another. 4K, 120Hz is very nice on the eyes for me.To sum it up: YMMV. Better get comfortable with many tools to allow switching.",Comprehensive_Mud803,2025-10-16 00:53:27,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o7qmjt,False,
njpkrbb,"If you are on Windows, the easiest way for you to proceed is to install *Visual Studio Community Edition*. You won't need anything else. Make sure to choose ""C++ development"" in the installer.",light_switchy,2025-10-15 23:44:46,1,learnprogramming,t3_1o7qmjt,False,
njplpzm,"Yes, it is overwhelming. C++ is more complex for multiple reasons:* It's relatively old as far as programming languages go, it dates back to the 1990s. It predates all modern build tools and package managers.* One of the primary reasons people pick C++ is to build platform-specific code. Not the only reason! But it means that a standard cross-platform solution for writing C++ just doesn't make a lot of sense for many people is because the whole reason C++ is being used is to build code that's tightly tied to a particular operating system a lot of the time.* There are multiple widely used C++ compilers: GCC/G++, LLVM/Clang++, and MSVC are all extremely widely used and relevant. They're quite compatible but not perfectly compatible. Some important projects can't be compiled with all of them. They don't support the same set of platforms.* Due to the lack of strong cross-platform IDEs, many C++ projects support command-line builds as their primary solution. IDEs can still be used, but they're not primary.As far as advice: first, I'm assuming that you want to learn C++ as a pure language and that none of the stuff you want to learn is platform-specific. In other words, I'm assuming that your goal is NOT to, e.g. write a Windows GUI application. If so, then you need to specify what types of platform-specific code you want to write, because the advice might be different.So if you just want to learn C++ as a pure language, you've got a lot of options. Which one you prefer is really a matter of personal preference.If you use Windows as your primary system now and you want to keep doing that, Microsoft's Visual Studio (e.g. Community edition) is an excellent choice. It's full-featured and ""batteries included"". Not the same as VS Code, which is a totally different product.Another good option on Windows is to install WSL2 and use a fully open-source toolchain: use your text editor of choice, install gcc, cmake, and a bunch of command-line tools used on Linux.Of course, if you're interested in Linux, that's a great choice too. I don't think it really matters which distro you pick. On Linux, every developer tool you could possibly imagine can be installed with one or two clicks or a single command. You can go from a fresh install to a working developer environment in literally minutes, compared to hours on Windows.The downside of Linux is that you might be much less familiar with the GUI, and it might not support all of the games, apps, and hardware that Windows does.If you have a Mac, macOS is fantastic - it gives you nearly all of the developer tools you'll find on Linux, plus all of the other sorts of apps you need for everything else in your life like on Windows (and unlike Linux). As a foundation you can use gcc or clang, plus cmake, and then optionally use various code editors combined with command-line for building and running. Yet another option is Xcode, Apple's IDE. While Xcode is primarily used for Apple's languages and to build apps for Apple platforms, it does have C++ support.One option is VS Code, which works on all of those platforms. However, I wouldn't recommend it as a good starting point for C++. VS Code is NOT a ""batteries included"" solution, it's a blank slate and you have to install plug-ins and configure everything to support any language you want. Some languages are easy. C++ is not, if you're new to it. You basically need to already have a compiler and build system installed and working, AND you need to understand how to configure and troubleshoot it, to get it working with VS Code.Hope that helps.",dmazzoni,2025-10-15 23:50:09,1,learnprogramming,t3_1o7qmjt,False,
njr9m33,"It sounds like you are on Windows.Visual Studio is indeed a very big download, but if you want to use the Microsoft C++ compiler then you will need to download and install that IDE.Another option would be using something like MinGW. That is the port of the GNU C++ to Windows, and it is a great option for learning C++ on Windows, as it is a modern C++ compiler and it is miniscule when compared to that massive Visual Studio download. When learning, you can get by without needing to use an IDE, since you only need a compiler, linker and your favorite text editor.",ScholarNo5983,2025-10-16 07:04:00,1,learnprogramming,t3_1o7qmjt,False,

njvmxzs,"The best thing is to go with whatever is most common and platform native. I presume you're on Windows. In that case, I recommend Visual Studio - NOT Visual Studio: Code. The former is the IDE that comes bundled with the build system, the compiler, the linker, the debugger, the editor, the latter is VERY POORLY named and is just an editor with a plugin interface, something more appropriate for intermediate and advanced developers who want more control over their tools and configuration. You still need a compiler, linker, debugger, build system, and standard libraries, AND you'd have to configure them...So in VS, you'd use the wizard to configure a new, blank Win32 Console Application. In the Solution Explorer window, you'd right-click and add a source file, and you're off to the races...If you're on Linux, that'll likely be some `dev-tools` package - and it's PROBABLY NAMED `dev-tools`, and then that'll get you `GCC` and `make` and all the basics you need. Then you can pick whatever editor you want. I agree it's a little bit too much freedom to begin with. I like Vim + You Complete Me, but you would probably find that modal terminal editor to be archaic with a near vertical learning curve, but it's often preferred by advanced developers. Your editor is NOT C++, so don't get bogged down in it. Learn some programming first, and then at some point, once you work through your programming book, then you might consider working on your workflow, which means experimenting with tools. Vim is scriptable, and that includes the host command shell directly - so you can extend your local editing to span not just the local system, but the whole of the internet and all it has to offer you, if it made sense to do so.",mredding,2025-10-16 23:00:08,1,learnprogramming,t3_1o7qmjt,False,

A 90 minute take home, a virtual technical, and a virtual behavioral. Only their final rounds are in-person.That said, I definitely expected this. Just like companies work arrangements are mostly going back to how they were pre-covid with hybrid being the most common, followed by 100% onsite, followed by remote being the most rare. Interviews are the same way. In-person worked. Not only is it a way to prevent cheating, but it's significantly easier to read body language, and to get a better vibe of a person (in *both* directions, this benefits the candidate to judge the interviewers) when you're in-person.It's also not that expensive for the company. The final round can be expensive-ish to fly people in, like Google's doing here. But pre-covid something that was common before the final rounds was to have candidates early in the process drive out to a proctored test site to do their ""interview"" there. There's thousands upon thousands of test centers *globally*, you just drive out ot one near you. I've done it before, it was pretty easy. Local proctored testing is very cheap.I think this was inevitable. The rise of AI just sped things along a bit.And to those who haven't done in-person interviews before, it's ***way*** easier to whiteboard out a problem in pseudocode and another person in the room, versus doing it in a real IDE via typing where all your syntax needs to be right with people staring at you on camera.",SouredRamen,2025-10-15 19:25:39,63,cscareerquestions,t3_1o7k7n6,False,

I have found I often had ideas that really enhanced an already planned feature because of being able to synthesize technical knowledge with domain knowledge as opposed to just being handed a checklist from business side.Balancing tradeoffs of delivering value and creating impact with best practices and engineering excellence.

First of all, make sure to keep in touch with your network, especially the people you did great work with in the past. Not all stretches of your career will have you working with people you click with and on projects that succeed, but the stretches that do are where your real network comes from.Second, make sure to study system design interviews. They've become performance theater at this point like LeetCode and you're expected to ""know the moves"" at some places. Most staff+ interviews also had a project presentation and Q&A part which paradoxically is the opposite where you're cooked if you never had the scope and scars but you don't need to study for. Also expect newer companies to ask more non-memorizable-from-internet coding and system design questions, which IMO is a great thing because that'll probably trickle to the rest of the industry eventually.The above is for ICs who are still hands on.

Pretty sure every SWE I personally know that has dipped their toes in the management-waters has reverted back to being a SWE because they hated it.The SWE's that don't fit into the stereotype of rigid, socially awkward nerds lacking critical thinking skills have an extremely easy path into management over here in the West.

You're also basically on the weeds immediately of figuring out things like cross-functional communication and collaboration, prioritization of value generation vs maintainability based on expected impact and necessity, autonomy and ownership etc...Hence, why its the ""senior junior"" situation. You speed run learning some senior skills while potentially missing out on some of the more mid-level things like adhering to team styling, some knowledge gaps that come from needing to ship and not having the time or team for learning more about developing in a mature project, learning about choosing when to apply design patterns etc...Those things tend to come about from a bit slower of a pace where engineers can be deeper on engineering rather than making sure market fit has been established, runway is secured, and good enough is more important than scaling and maintaining due to the rapid nature of changing demands.But, as I said, that isn't for everyone which is okay.

nisww3y,"I used to feel this way for like the first 5 years ofmy career and then I came to accept a basic fact of the world:The world is not a “strict” meritocracy. Raw technical skill is like maybe 50% of it. At the end of the day in business a huge portion of success is being able to convince people that your opinions are correct and being able to drive new projects, architecture changes, etc. You can be the best programmer in the world but if you suck at communicating your leverage is basically limited to what you can produce with your own 2 hands. When you can communicate goals and influence the direction of projects / the company your leverage is much higher. The people who are great at communicating and getting their voices heard are often not the same people with the best technical skills. This means that success is a noisy process wheresometimes really talented people are limited because they can’t leverage they talent, and sometimes people succeed with faulty ideas based on a lack of technical knowledge and talent. Don’t forget that luck and personal connections also play a major role. What this means for engineers practically:The attitude that a lot of engineers adopt that “PMs and managers are all just overpaid idiots who don’t deserve their paychecks” is cute and cathartic and everything. But it’s ultimately self defeating. At the end of the day, you’re going to trade a significant portion of the hours of your life for money to succeed. I have things outside of work (family, etc.) that I care about, so if I’m going to trade my time for money that equation better damn well be stacked in my favor. If that means that I have to play stupid corporate games sometimes, then fine. Spinning myself over the unfairness of it all is just a waste of my time and energy.

You can also see how THOSE community members behave towards it, I think it is superior to what I see here.1) Jobs all have a lot in common. Job PROBLEMS have a lot in common. To quote a movie, ""We're not so different you and I.""2) Junior new employee problems and concerns have even MORE overlap.3) Other discipline subreddits probably (my guess) have a HIGHER experience level overall that /r/cscareerquestions. I am a FIRM believer that senior more experienced people just... do everything better... than junior people. This isn't a mentality that I necessarily see prevalent in this community. Everyone seems to agree that ""Senior people have it easy..."" but I rarely see anyone stop and ask WHY senior people have it easy. What about their actions and experience makes it so.

The company I worked for the longest time had three employees and does not exist anymore (this was *fun* to explain to Japanese immigration for my work visa), and the largest company I ever worked for had 8000 employees worldwide. I have never had a problem getting interviews.2. Not all recognizable brands are good. Accenture's reputation is that they select for conformity, not skill.3. AI will have a massive shift soon. Pretty much everyone noticed by now that there have been several trillion dollars invested into AI by now, so there will now have to be a few trillion dollars in revenue, soon, or investors will pull the plug. It won't be entirely dead, but completely different.4. Employment laws and expectations in Japan and Europe are different. My expectation is that when the bottom drops out from the current AI boom, Accenture will focus on retraining you, and you may end up doing something completely different, but you will still have a job, while a mid-sized company may lay off people more quickly, but on the upside, you then already have a visa.So basically, if your plan is to leave Japan, and your main skillset is AI related, the ""leave now"" option is likely better.

I think in most cases management does not even know what ""quality code"" looks like and just relies on SWEs to do their job. Now SWE ""talent"" comes in to play and most companies are not hiring big tech company level SWEs since they cannot compete with total compensation.I've worked on safety critical medical devices at private non-tech companies in non-tech cities, think dialysis machines, for my 15+ year career. These companies have mature processes as they have been around for 30+ years. The devices we created were safe and had FDA approval, but the codebase was real spaghetti in many areas.Most of the time it came down to SWEs just working within the existing code base. They don't really care about pushing for refactors unless it was absolutely necessary. SWEs were not intentionally sabotaging the project. They did the best they could with the skills they had. Management doesn't complain about code quality so there is no issue from these SWEs perspective.The SWEs at the majority of companies are not grinding DS&A or design patterns trying to get in to top tech companies. They can code up features that do what they need to do and that's about it. These companies are not trying to compete with big tech companies as they cannot come close to matching total compensation.They try to sell themselves to SWEs in different ways, but it just attracts SWEs that: (off the top of my head)* don't know the value of their talent* meet the companies bar, but would not be talented enough to get in to big tech companies for big pay* late in their career where they are financially secure to coast in a jobSo this is a long way of saying, yes it's pretty common in the industry to have production ready code that is poorly designed. I would even wager that is the expectation and not the expectation when you look at the industry at large and not a small slice like only big tech companies. I'd bet even if you went to look at some codebase at google there would be SWEs that say this is poorly designed we need to refactor.

If you keep discouraging yourself like this then you will end up like one of those adults who only talk about their glory days back in hs. Those people saying better opportunities happen are correct. It can happen and far more frequently. Getting married to an old and obviously shit ideology will never help. Keep your head high and senses alert to find your opportunities. Although anecdotal, I always thought working at Google would be my dream job and the last place I work before retiring. But that went out the window for various factors. Instead I found a new opportunity that is far better in every aspect quite literally and I just stumbled on it by accident. It is one of the harder industries to break into and I found the easy way in by luck.

This confidence comes from several sources depending on your environment and your team/org structure:1. Knowing who knows what. At large companies with lots of knowledge silos, this is probably the most important bit. Most likely, the unfamiliar bits of the codebase is also owned by them, so if you need to make changes there, you'd have to get their buy-in anyways2. Knowing how to find what you're looking for - both in terms of the codebase tooling (e.g. if you guys have a bespoke code search or repo management layer) as well as a high-level idea of how things are generally organized (and this usually goes back to #1) and how to trace through the difference packages, as well as relevant documents or memos that have documented relevant design discussions and decisions3. Having the (un)earned confidence that things will go well - I actually think this is the most important aspect.

nissz3o,"There's a wide range in consulting companies. Some have great software practices and mentoring, and you will be doing the same work as any other developer. Others have everyone fending for themselves. You need to try to figure out which one the company you're talking to is. Another problem is if they're a smaller company, they might have fewer clients. Find out how many clients they have and the nature of their contracts. I worked at a contracting company that tried to present themselves as a consulting company. They had two clients when I interviewed, but then lost one between when I accepted the offer and started. They eventually lost their last client and had some layoffs along with a bunch of people leaving to join the company that took over the contract. Another challenge, like with any company, is how much the interviewers actually lie to you or not. For example, I was told during my interviews the contract was for three years.

You may see people post LinkedIn premium stats where X% of people applying to an entry level role have a masters... but that doesn't mean they're *getting the role*.When a company is hiring for a regular SWE position that requires no specialized knowledge outside of a bachelors, if they see someone with a masters applying, all they see is a flight risk. They're not stupid. They know someone with a masters degree is just going to use that ""normal"" position as a stepping stone, and leave the moment they have a job lined up that has work utilizing their degree, and more importantly, pay reflecting the advanced degree.You can claim that this is the job you want, and you're in it for the long term all you want.... but no sane company is going to believe you.None of this is a problem if you're getting a masters/PhD in order to chase jobs that require a masters/PhD. It becomes a problem when you're using those degrees just to delay your entry into the market.Stick it out with applying. Getting an internship sophomore year is pretty difficult.

njcy029,"I started out as a FE dev and became a BE dev. Now I don't even want to touch anything FE, although I'm technically full-stack I'd only write BE on my resume. Backend code is always much cleaner, simpler, and easier to debug - but it requires knowledge of certain things you don't often think about as a FE dev.Here are my 2-cents of everything you need to know to be a GOOD BE dev.First of all, you need a general understanding of the internet itself. How it works, and why it is the way it is. You need to know what HTTP requests are and how they work. A BE dev is not a network engineer, but you still want to know what ports are, what UDP and TCP is. All BE development establishes connections to someone or something (most often databases, but depending on the product it could be establishing connections peer to peer or in any other way)After that, you need to understand that backend code is not like FE code. The same design and architectural patterns don't make sense. It helps to think of BE code as a series of completely isolated scripts that a computer will be processing. It doesn't run on a client, it's not available to a client, users have no idea what that code is and they will never see it or directly interact with it. In the simplest context, think of a simple user registration form. The frontend has some inputs it captures, and then it sends it to the backend for processing. The backend then does all of the work to make that registration actually happen with those inputs - which is most often inserting rows to the database.You need to understand and be able to work with databases, you need to be able to read and write SQL. I can't think of any BE position where the code is not interacting with a database. In many instances, that's ALL the code is doing - interacting with a database.You need to understand and be able to manage remote servers and web servers. Familiarity with unix.Security is a concern in BE development for sure, but generally common sense will go a long way and people often think some kind of over-engineering is required to have something secure. Have a properly secured server, with correctly set-up file permissions, whitelists, and firewalls. Don't set anything public that shouldn't be public. Don't store files or sensitive data in weird places. Don't store sensitive data like passwords in plain text. Don't install random packages and libraries that you're not 100% confident in and have a genuine use-case for. Don't work out of a system or computer that's potentially compromised. All validation must be properly handled in the backend, what the FE does is irrelevant in terms of security. Don't have any method someone could exploit to fire off code or SQL on your system. Use services like Cloudflare to help with spam reduction and bot detection. Keep all software/packages regularly updated (including the OS the server is on), and finally keep logs of everything including errors, accesses, requests, etc. Regardless of the scale of a product or application, if all of the above are met, the product will be completely secure from a BE perspective.Overall, I'd say there is a lot more power with backend development than there is with FE. There are more job opportunities for it, and there are just more things you can do in general. The code you write is not just something to be used exclusively for a client's UI - it can be used for quite literally anything, from the world's most complex sorting and filtering algorithms to data analytics to machine learning to whatever else. Lastly, I'd say the beauty of backend code is once it's written, it's made to last forever as long as the computer running it is still on. It's not subject to the change of forever-changing things like clients, npm packages, and designs. In other words, if someone wrote the backend script for a user registration form in 1990, it would be just as valid code as one made today.",dskfjhdfsalks,2025-10-13 23:24:09,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1o5iuhd,False,

njaf1x4,"As someone who started fullstack and moved BE I had the same concerns but some problems in software engineering are just universal. BE engineering is just moving data around, and making sure it moves around either fast enough or cheap enough, and that only people who are allowed to see the data can see the data (which is also a FE problem). I joke to my coworkers that we’re all just data plumbers.Have you done system design interviews? That will honestly cover 80% of what you need to know for BE stuff, and every cloud host has their own version of the sys design components that you’ll study.

nj2wxo0,"What you've described are all basic fundamental things that frontend developers are expected to do. If you want to specialize in the creative side of things you'll need to work on developing more advanced technical skills such as graphics/shader programming, webGPU/webGL, Three.js, and etc. to distinguish yourself. I believe the general industry title for such roles is ""creative developer"" - basically a developer with a focus on the areas I mentioned alongside all the existing requirements of a frontend developer. Demand for this skill set is infrequent - most projects that involve this kind of work are usually advertising/marketing related and are typically contracted to web design agencies or freelancers in the field. On rare occasions larger companies may selectively recruit a few of these roles but career-wise I don't think it's very viable long term unless you have the right connections and can distinguish yourself with a strong portfolio.I personally think working as a regular frontend developer is a much more preferable position to be in in terms of career progression and compensation. That being said however if you're passionate about this then you should continue to pursue it inside and outside of work whenever you can - often times in your career you'll stumble upon opportune moments, so having the right skill set at the right time can definitely lead you down a desirable path!",aeroheim,2025-10-12 10:10:38,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1o4dwhs,False,

Most front end devs are making client apps with enterprise applications where the UX insights to be mindful of are about making it intuitive to sort through complicated workflows with lots of data. If you know how to target those more creative roles, great, but I have had to use far less of my graphic design skills even while working on e commerce and retail platforms.
