mvr9bzt,"I need to headline acknowledge that this is complex and generalisations are always going to struggle on a topic like this. And I'm likely to get downvoted for a practical non-theory answer, I know.BUT...Data engineering and software engineering are two different disciplines, so you can only draw parallels so far. And within data engineering, there's a huge difference between (1) a pipeline that supports a piece of software used by millions, or on which lives (any number, small or large) might depend, and (2) a pipeline that just ensures Sally from accounts payable can see the latest invoices in her report, which she only looks at once a month anyway, and occasionally forgets to look without anything bad happening.The same difference exists within software engineering, between that million-user piece of software and a script running on a server in a medium sized business to do something useful but not business critical, and that hasn't had a code change in 4 years. Those two things won't (or at least shouldn't) have the same amount of testing effort even if the same software engineer did both. Ditto for the two data pipelines. Ultimately, testing of any sort takes time that could be spent on other things, so for a business, it needs to provide more value than it costs, or you shouldn't do it. I see people forgetting this sometimes. Nobody should do testing purely dogmatically, except perhaps for FOSS projects, and any kind of libraries, which are a very different story. Another angle is that user-facing software typically has lots of code branches, conditionally-executed code, and complex object interactions. Data software _might_ have that too (in which case it has the same potential for testing), but it might be very simple and linear. If running a pipeline executes every line of code in the project - isn't running it an adequate test for a reasonable swathe of test conditions?",sjcuthbertson,2025-06-03 12:14:38,33,dataengineering,t3_1l26xgo,False,

You need to design the workflow, test it, deploy it, expose the data and of course maintain it. This is more or less what a typical DE does. Now, depending on the business, the volume of data, the stack etc data engineering might be from code less till fully open source. During the early days, a business will usually go for a managed service to set up the data platform. If the volume increases they usually switch to open source solutions(spark on emr, airflow, hive metastore, etc) for cost cutting reasons. As you understand there are cases where data engineering might involve more than data related tasks such us managing infra, setting up permissions/vpc/etc, modeling, database administration, unit testing, scripting etc. Do these tasks fall under the DE's responsibilities? Big discussion so not sure. Is it common for DE's to do these? Yes (I'd like to say it is something common but not sure either). There have been cases where I did some swe tasks like api in js.The tasks themselves tend to be ""boring"" compared to swe since they are less ""creative"" and more ""engineering"".

mw3cx6t,My experience with foundry has been incredible. While it has certain drawbacks it makes us think more like a software developer rather than a traditional Data Engineer with SQL scripts. I really love their branch based development where you can tested your code with production datasets as input (fall back option) to your current dataset under development. I personally am a huge fan of their data lineage tool. Unlike other data platforms creating a pipeline or a DAG can be done in a few mins. They have thought through all these concepts way ahead and in my opinion their platform is way ahead of other solutions. Foundry had this concept of table format way before Iceberg or delta got popular. One take away I have is if your organization needs a data platform that needs traditional data warehousing alot Foundry sucks in that area. This is a great solution for Extraction and Transformation but if your organization depends on datasets mostly for creating charts and dashboards with strict SLAs. Foundry can only be used as compute layer and then load this data back into snowflake or other data warehouses.,Ok-Refrigerator521,2025-06-05 06:42:47,4,dataengineering,t3_1l3kx85,False,

mvy96hh,I am going offer a different perspective one that is centered around permissions. Lets say you put your ETL logic inside your orchestrator for 2 use cases1. Extracting data from an RDS instance2. Extracting data from an external API endpoint You have to give permissions to the orchestrator (most likely ECS task) to access the RDS instance and also secrets such as API key and RDS password. But let us say the ETL logic lives outside (separate ECS tasks) then the orchestrator essentially only needs permissions to kickoff those tasks. The individual tasks get separate permissions to access their specific instances. This is in line with the least privilege principle often recommended for defining permissions.Giving the orchestrator too much permissions is exposing you to a lot of risk. There are some newer approaches like the ETL logic is defined in the orchestrator but the flow/task itself runs in a specific pre-defined compute which seems like a better balance. So if you do want to put it all in the orchestrator make sure you leverage such an approach.,anatomy_of_an_eraser,2025-06-04 13:49:02,8,dataengineering,t3_1l327w2,False,

If the data that all these requests are for is general purpose data then I’d recommend just creating a role for general purpose and granting giving that. An alternative to this is creating a role specifically for timed access and then create a snowflake scheduled task to remove users from that role after they’ve had it for x amount of time. Another way to potentially manage access changes is with GitHub. GitHub feels a little hacky and more work than either of the two above. Another way is to connect access requests with a jira (or something similar) ticket and the ticket parameters map to specific snowflake roles.

mwhkdlw,"Great question, thanks for asking and giving me a chance to explain a bit more :)Just to clarify up front: Heimdall isn’t trying to replace Airflow (or Dagster). It’s meant to complement those tools, especially in big data environments. We actually use both -- Airflow and Heimdall -- and each plays a different role in our system.In our setup:* Airflow handles scheduling -- the ""when"" something should run (""run this job daily, but only after X completes"").* Heimdall handles orchestration -- the ""what"", ""where"", and ""how"" something runs (""run this Spark job with version X on cluster Y, with these configs"").So why build Heimdall for orchestration instead of just using Airflow for everything?A few reasons:**1. Consistency:** We want a single, unified interface between all tools and data systems (Spark, Trino, Clickhouse, etc.). Heimdall abstracts away infra details -- our users just submit workloads the same way every time (from user's p-o-v, the way they submit SparkSQL and Trino query and get results is exactly the same). We can manage things like version upgrades, logging, error tracking, etc., in one place. Similar to what Netflix’s Genie does -- it creates a clean boundary between clients (humans and systems) and infrastructure.**2. Security:** Engineers can run and test jobs locally -- even against prod data -- without needing shared credentials (we integrate with many systems, zero creds for those on laptops). They just use their own identity, and Heimdall enforces everything (RBAC, logging, etc.) in one place. Airflow submits jobs *through* Heimdall, so we get a centralized entry point to everything.**3. Simplification:** By offloading orchestration to Heimdall, our Airflow operators got *really* simple -- each is maybe 10-20 lines of code, no matter how complex the job is. This helps us avoid the usual “infra logic leaking into pipeline code” problem. Heimdall gives us reusable building blocks that keep our DAGs clean.There are other reasons too, but those are the big ones. Happy to go deeper into any of them if it’s useful.And just to be clear -- we still really like Airflow. :) It’s become much more lightweight for us now that it only handles scheduling. We’re even looking at turning Heimdall-based operators into lightweight sensors, so we can run thousands of DAGs on a small Airflow box.",Pale-Fan2905,2025-06-07 13:36:19,3,dataengineering,t1_mwglt0m,True,

mvwa4wv,"In Databricks specifically you can create [workflows](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-engineering/workflows) that specify what to run and what the dependencies are, and what to do on failures. That's obviously a bit different since you specify it separately, so I suppose the lineage is 'manual' in that case.The workflow tooling has some advantages. You can specify which clusters to use for which steps, so you can keep a cluster live throughout the process for faster job startups, or switch clusters if some steps need specialised settings or need to be larger.Obviously you don't have that with just Spark, but essentially any orchestrating job runner could work.You can mix DBT in with python functions for python models. Those can specify their model dependencies within the function, and other sql models can reference the python module. I believe there are some more hoops to jump through in specifying the model in yaml and needing to set up your spark session to be passed in, so it might take some work to figure that out.Then things like Airflow, Dagster, or more classic things like Ctrl-M can be set up to orchestrate things, or in Azure ADF can do it if it isn't too large. I believe they all have a similar limitation that you can't just ask for ""things leading to this"" or ""things following this"" or both, you just have a set pipeline to run.You can also do a very basic one yourself. If you have a function that runs some data process you can create decorators to specify dependencies, then as long as you `import` the module with those decorated functions you'll have a full dependency tree and can automatically execute what you need. You could find all dependencies leading into some data process function, so they are all refreshed, or run a data process function and update everything that follows from it.

mw9t5bi,"I'm not sure if this runs into being your first option, but can you make a table where you slice the `starts_at` and `ends_at` based on any change on any 'associated' dimension, and then also incorporate the relevant `starts_at` as a separate column for each table?That way when doing joins later you can do direct equality joins on the relevant date fields, but if you want to pick out a value at an arbitrary time -- end of each day, end of each week, end of each month, etc -- you can do so based on the `starts_at` and `ends_at` values.You wouldn't need to create this by explicitly joining each table based on ranges, you'd take all the `starts_at` and `ends_at` values from every table first, and use that to slice the start and end for the new table. You'd need to do the overlap joins then, but you'd only need to pull in the `starts_at` for each table where there's an overlap.If you have dbt macros, or can use jinja templates to help build the sql for you, or you're using a dataframe library, you should be able to make something adaptable to multiple tables being included.The benefit is you'll still get the full grain of every change across all tables, and you won't have to create dummy entries for periods where nothing changes, and you still get to use equijoins out to the original dims when using the table.

mwgy8qy,"I’ve been doing the first option for a few years and it works. I do it in three steps, using CTEs. 1. Union the valid_from and valid_to from all of the source scd tables to create a “spine” of every state change timestamp and person ID. The reason you have to stack the valid_froms and valid_tos vertically is to handle gaps in the source scds’ time ranges for cases where dims were deleted. 2. Join each scd table to that spine on person id and where the state change timestamp is within the scd time range, e.g. scd.valid_from <= spine.timestamp < coalesce(scd.valid_to, ‘9999-01-01’). 3. The spine timestamp becomes the new valid_from, and use a lead() window function to add a valid_to. To make it incremental, you’ll need to add a surrogate key built from person id and valid_from in step 3. And use that as the “id” in the incremental config to prevent duplicates. The incremental clause should filter each scd table to only include rows where the scd.valid_from is greater or equal to the max valid_to for each person in {{ this }}.I could dig up an example query if that would help.",chestnutcough,2025-06-07 10:54:26,2,dataengineering,t3_1l4ksvs,False,

First, it sounds like you have good/smart people even if they aren’t familiar with modern platforms and technologies (public cloud, etc.). Someone mentioned “data mesh” and that came to mind to me as well. Specifically, the principles around ”data as a product” and “self-service” as these are largely about organizational empowerment and alignment more so than technology choices.It sounds like the teams need some guidance on how to organize and get work done. I recommend looking into the following.. the teams and company may be doing some of this already but it’s hard to tell from a short narrative. Each of the topics below embody principles of modern data teams.1. Agile2. DataOps (the modern data value chain and how to build data capabilities and the operations around them)3. Data as a product - creating things that matter and generate value for the business. The tech is not the point.If you want to go deeper on organizational design ideas for technology teams, I recommend the book “Team Topologies.” What you read in the book is helpful and insightful but it’s not a blueprint - in my opinion - to simply go and follow. Instead, take what the book teaches, overlay it with your company, teams, and culture, and determine what your own organizational next steps should be.Hope this helps give you some ideas on where to start.",trajik210,2025-06-07 21:41:21,1,dataengineering,t3_1l4zcne,False,

The DBA team ground to a halt so that the lead DBA could spend all their time and attention nannying the change.

mvusjg9,The author would advise you to only enrich with these fields in the silver layer if those attributes provide a reusable and commonly understood entity for the whole enterprise. Do not enrich with fields specific to one domain or subprocess because now you add the overhead of having to know which fields have to be filtered out for downstream consumption. If for example your sign up date is an attribute that is relevant to the whole enterprise it would be a good candidate for a customer field. If it describes a specific sign up for a newsletter that is relevant to marketing it might be better suited to keep those sign ups separate. Maybe create a signup table that references the customer id so it can be reused across different business processes and is easily understood.In the end it is more about the approach itself. A few fields here or there wont break your architecture but once you have super wide tables because people keep adding columns to defined tables the madness starts. Thats where normalization comes in handy.,SchwulibertSchnoesel,2025-06-03 22:53:38,5,dataengineering,t3_1l2pg9g,False,
mvxhh4a,"I kind of agree with the article writer.When it comes to dimensions, the issue is that as you expand it, it starts to have data that is relevant to different domains with namings that are conflicting and/or have different meanings to different people.For example, the column ""region"" on your customers table could mean the financial region (let's say for taxes purposes), or marketing region (so more based on similar cultural aspects, like language. Think of the french speaking region of Belgium being in the same marketing region of France while being in a different financial region).Besides that you also have ownership issues. Who controls this dimension and is responsible for its data? What if they decide to change the region of a customer, will that break dependencies from other areas of business?So I agree with her. Keep only things that are relevant and have unified meaning across the business on the silver layer. I would go as far as create multiple dim_customer on the gold layer, one for each department (so, dim_customer_finance, dim_customer_marketing etc) so that, ownership, meaning and purpose of usage becomes clear for everyone who sees the table name itself.",slevemcdiachel,2025-06-04 10:54:14,1,dataengineering,t3_1l2pg9g,False,

This is what column store is and the fact that her stack is Databricks parquet/delta it’s nonsense to say this is additional I/O.

For example we will have master reference data as a tier 1 being normalized but then a tier 2 wide silver table that uses those tier 1 attributes, but not aggregated yet which would happen in the gold layer for the specific dataset. I think what a lot of articles fail to mention is that bronze/silver/gold will have sub layers to them S well.A good example of this in my platform we have a raw and curated in bronze.

So, the first option is to manually define the node mapping with the full path, second and probably best option, use tags for grouping with the bracketed notation config. This is still something that I want to try out.2. This is a continuous process but should be similar for batching processes. You would monitor the same process tags at the end of the day. You can add additional tags to the data to add batch specific info - maybe using a processor plugin like starlark or even a Python plugin in InfluxDB. 3.

mwhf59x,"There are a lot of things here that are hard to answer from an outsiders perspective. Sounds like your upload speed may be pretty slow as an organization if you're thinking about compressing before moving to the S3. Questions I would have:- How much time are you actually saving between uploading raw files vs time compressing and then uploading? Are you really saving time between running a compression, uploading then having spark load compressed files?- Are these daily files appended into your target tables or are you doing upserts? - What's the likelihood of needing to reload your tables from scratch? - Is the data easily partitioned outside of the daily extract? Generally, I recommend trying to keep the files as I receive them but there are reasons to do slight modifications. Reason being storage is cheap, compute is not. That first time you have to reload from your raw storage, even after just a couple of weeks of daily storage, you're probably ahead of the game in terms of cost running spark against gzip files. Again assuming you're using some kind of pay as you go system.Personally, for something like this I'd probably split the difference and convert the csv to parquet with snappy compression. That should give you a sizeable storage savings while still giving you performant reads if you need them down the line. Again a lot of this depends on what you have available to you, converting to parquet, depending on the data, will likely be more time consuming than just gziping the data but your reads should improve. Honestly, I'd benchmark all 3 and then evaluate them against what changes you expect in that source system for an extracts and how quick it will happen.",Pillowtalkingcandle,2025-06-07 13:03:11,1,dataengineering,t3_1l5iv1q,False,

mwi47sm,"Gzip is a good compression algorithm for minimising output size, but a slow one to decompress. You can look at snappy or lz4 if you don’t mind taking a CPU hit in favour of higher throughput.Additionally, are you tied to the idea of compressed CSV for staging to your raw layer? (also are you sure you want a row oriented file type over columnar) IMO you should look at sinking Parquet or even ORC as binary formats (especially columnar formats) will leads to better compression and faster query performance (remember that SEEK is literally one of the most expensive operations to perform both in terms of memory but also in runtime)",Surge_attack,2025-06-07 15:26:43,1,dataengineering,t3_1l5iv1q,False,
mwkx0ro,"> it's taking longer than I *feel* it should takeGZip compression isn't inherently ""splittable"" (mentioned already by another), because it doesn't provide a way to 'jump ahead' in the data and know where you are to start decompressing. This means you can't get the decompressed data any faster than a single node decompressing it.If you're doing dynamic schema it also has to do two passes over some portion of the data. So it will read a certain amount to figure the schema, then start back over again once it has the schema it has come up with.> (Option) Add a step to decompress the files before we read themThis is probably pointless, spark is doing this for you on-the-fly. The only reason to do so would be because you are reading the source multiple times. Even then, the extra file size and resulting network transfers will offset some of the gain, and you'd have to pay the 'cost' of fully processing the data at least once just to get to that point. If you did anything like this, you would have spark just take the original CSV data and save it to compressed parquet, so that later stages can work off of that for faster re-runs or recovery from a node failure.---There are some other things you can do, but anything effective will involve having the source do something different, because they're the ones producing the files.Uploading uncompressed will be faster for you to process it, since spark can split the read across all of its executors. If you have a lot of cores in your cluster this could be a significant speedup. The tradeoff is that storage costs will be ~3x higher, and it will take ~3x longer for the provider to upload the data.A potentially easy change for the provider is to upload multiple gzipped files. Since it is a CSV, if they don't have newline characters inside the data (it really should be replaced with an escape sequence), then they can split the file by line count and then gzip each file. You still get the compression, and when running the ingestion job you can give spark a glob (or list) to read multiple files as a single dataframe. That will let you split up the decompression work. Note that this is not about splitting *after* the compression, as that will cut off csv lines in the middle -- you want to split the raw CSV by line count *then* gzip each of those files.Another *possibly* easy change is to swap the compression algorithm to bz2. Iirc this one includes the ability to jump to blocks automatically, so spark can properly split the decompression.The best way might be to see if they can grab the [DuckDB CLI](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/overview.html) -- it is a single standalone executable, so you wouldn't need any special installation scripts or anything, and as a CLI they just need to run a duckdb command instead of gzip. You can send [commands as arguments](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/arguments.html#passing-a-sequence-of-arguments) for the CLI, so you could make a command that will read the original CSV file then write it to parquet (with compression applied by default). The command would look like `duckdb -s ""COPY (SELECT * FROM read_csv('your_input_file.csv')) TO 'your_output_file.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);""`. If you read into the DuckDB docs you can also see how to specify the CSV schema so all the typing can be done correctly at the outset, which is handy for you because parquet will have actual types for its columns, which in addition to being compressed and splittable, will make the ingestion job faster.",azirale,2025-06-08 00:49:23,1,dataengineering,t3_1l5iv1q,False,

mw9621n,"I'll provide a contrasting point of view since most people are trying to convince you there's nothing special about C++. I believe C++ is very problematic for newer programmers because a huge list of reasons. The general dismissive advice is to just program in the ""safe"" areas of C++, but there is no way for a beginner to know where that is.There are basic problems right off the bat for a beginner.1. No real package management system. If you want to use libraries in C++, you'll often need to download someone's .hpp and .cpp file and figure out how to compile that into your program and use it. That directly leads into2. Compilation. No other modern language has a system as complicated as C++, you are going to struggle with your program finding your headers, things are going to compile and not link the right libraries, these words don't even make sense to beginner programmers in other languages. But of course C++ programmers have tried to solve this and that causes problem number3. Build systems, C++ has 3 popular build systems, and they don't necessarily work well with each other. You got make, cmake, autoconf and just regular writing the compiler arguments yourself. These systems are extremely complex, introduce a whole new language to learn, and are often impossible to debug. People will tell you that a newbie doesn't need to know about any of this, well they do if they want to be doing anything substantial using existing code instead of implementing every single thing themselves.So all of that is before you get a program running, so once we've figure out how to compile code, what happens when we write code and try to learn stuff from online?4. C++ is extremely fragmented. C++ has gone through multiple incarnations, from C with Classes to C++11 to more recent versions. The way you write C++ code differs dramatically between pre and post C++11. By default the majority of the code you write based on basic examples will be considered incorrect. For example, you'd think you can generate random numbers using `rand()`. You'd be dead wrong, C++ developers do NOT suggest using `rand()` to generate random numbers, it's not guaranteed to generate a uniform distribution or numbers that are sufficiently random. People will even tell you off if you use iostream, the basic recommended way to handle input/output in every tutorial, because C++ code is supposed to be fast, and iostreams are considered slow. Basically C++ does something wrong in some initial implementation, and has to maintain that for backwards compatibility forever, so they implement a whole new different correct way to do it, but a newbie has no way to tell if they are looking at outdated and bad code or new code.5. Standards vs Compilers. Suppose you are super keen and keep up to date with new language features. You see that C++23 has some cool new feature you want to try in your own code. Well too bad, it probably hasn't been implemented yet. The standards committee are independent from the people that write the compilers. So the committee declares that the new version of the language has this new feature, and it's someone else's job to actually implement that feature into the compiler so it can actually be used in code. This is done bit by bit, so your compiler will support some C++23 features and not others. Hell, some features are in the spec and NEVER get supported. So if you're a keen beginner and see people present cool new features and code patterns you want to try, bad luck, try again in 5 years and pray that compilers have caught up.6. C++ data structures are heavily memory focused. This isn't the memory management that people usually talk about. These are the standard vector and collection types that manage the memory for you like in other languages. Except in almost every case, you interact with these objects via iterators, which dips down a level of abstraction and makes you think about memory anyway. So where in another language you might run `sort(s)`, in C++ you run `std::sort(s.begin(), s.end());`. That seems ok, until you start using references and pointers, and `sort` shifts the values in memory and you end up not pointing to what you thought you were pointing to. That's just a rookie mistake, but most algorithms do things in-place in memory and it's an easy mistake to make. On top of that you get pointer invalidation, where sometimes the automatic memory management just takes your data somewhere else and all your previously declared pointers are now pointing at nothing. The simplest way to accidentally do this is when you are using `push_back()`, when the allocated vector fills up it'll relocate somewhere else.I could go on. But the overall point is that1. Compilation and library management in C++ introduces significant complications to beginners that simply do not exist in other highly used languages.2. C++ has many conflicting ways of doing something, and there does not exist a single agreed upon set of teaching material for beginners to learn best practices.3. C++ has MANY hidden pitfalls that will cause beginners to write broken programs. Almost by default any code you write intuitively will be considered wrong in some way. The simple `for (int i = 0; i++; i < s.size()) { s[i]; }` should be written as `for (const auto& v : s) { v; }`, note the additional syntax and operators that might be unclear to beginners. Also you were meant to use `size_t` instead of `int` for the first loop, but that's almost never presented in basic teaching material.C++ has more complicated language constructs than other languages, worse developer support, has no single high-quality resource for learning, and online resources are litered with bad practice that beginners have no ability to distinguish.",TonySu,2025-06-06 03:14:19,4,learnprogramming,t3_1l4d5gi,False,
mw9seo1,">I understand that you need a ton of understanding and experience to write performant C++ code. And that even decent Python code will outperform bad/mediocre C++ code.Wait, what? This isn't even true. The only situation where this might be a thing is where you're copying around data needlessly, but using references in C++(just like Python does by default) is an idiomatic language feature. Barring those cases, C++ code can be like 100 times faster than Python, unless you use Numpy arrays or something(which is written in C, so hardly counts as Python code).>I also understand that there's a huge responsibility in managing memory safely. Yeah, except if you use smart pointers, C++ even has automatic memory management. People who say memory management in it is this super hard and difficult thing probably never heard about C++11. The language's complexity is greatly overblown, of course, but there is some merit to it. For example, template metaprogramming is functional programming, while your normal code tends to be object-oriented / imperative, so you need to learn two programming paradigms to properly program, which indeed is a lot. But most of people's problems with the language aren't really a problem if they use the right solution.

C++ is also unmanaged, not running in basically a VM like C# and Java, so it's a little more efficient in that regard.

mw5se8d,"For clarity : My answer is based on my own experience in this field, but I have formatted the response with AI for clear reading, AI will never generate knowledge like this.Hey, wishing you a bright future—read to the end! No way is programming dead, trust me. The idea that AI will wipe out coders is a myth. Tools like GitHub Copilot are like having a brainy assistant—they make you faster, not replace you. Coders who skip AI might lag since it cuts problem-solving from weeks to hours. You’ll learn quicker, debug faster, and tackle big stuff, but AI needs your creativity to work. Coding’s been around forever (before you were born!) and isn’t going anywhere—it just evolves. Use AI to level up, and you’re golden. It’s totally worth jumping into in 2025. The industry needs solid coders who solve real problems. Stay curious, keep learning, and you’ll stand out, no matter how many others code.Learning paths depend on you. Self-taught is awesome but tough—you need discipline to avoid scams or getting lost. A mentor, even paid, can save you tons of time by guiding you right. Tons of top devs are self-taught, so it’s doable with grit. Bootcamps are great for fast, practical skills—3-6 months and you’re job-ready if you pick one with mentorship and job help. Check Course Report for legit ones to dodge duds. A CS degree gives deep theory for stuff like AI or systems coding and looks great to employers, but it’s pricey and takes years. You don’t always need it for jobs like web dev But remember that if you don't learn the deep theoretical stuff like systems design, algorithms, data structures, computer architectures and operating systems, and only the final technology like web development, you will reach a stage where you will not develop, and you will not move up the career ladder until you have comprehensive knowledge and experience in all aspects, not just simple technological skills like html, css, etc. Whatever path, you’ll need to self-learn, so try Coursera’s “Learn How to Learn” to master studying. Tech’s got endless free resources—use them! I’d start self-taught to test the waters, then maybe a bootcamp or degree if you’re hooked. Just know bootcamps focus on jobs and might skimp on theory like algorithms, which you’ll need.Please do not be tempted by crash courses, all of them aim to teach you how to use the programming language only or just a basic understanding, and do not teach you deep programming concepts, the least professional course may take more than 50 hours of learning, and time is not a condition on the professionalism of the course, but for example, you will not find an in-depth algorithms course of 10 hours ...First, see if coding’s your thing with Harvard’s CS50 on edX—it’s free and a fun intro to programming with bits of C, Python, and JavaScript. It’s not a full course but a taste of what coding’s about. You’ll know if it clicks and get a sense of next steps. After CS50, don’t jump straight to a track like web dev—focus on building core programming skills, like algorithms, data structures and solve a lot of problems on websites like hackerrank,leetcode,codeforces, and so on... . These are the foundation of coding and crucial for any field. You can learn them while exploring a track (like web or AI) or before picking one—it’s up to you. Python’s a great first language—easy, versatile for web, AI, or data, and super in-demand. But it’s not about the language; it’s about getting loops, functions, and logic, which apply everywhere. Think of coding like swinging a hammer: easy to learn, hard to master. Start with computational thinking to grasp how computers work before diving into languages. To gain a solid foundation in your level, I suggest reading books that will develop your way of thinking. It can be read while you are studying CS50. There is a great book called Computational Thinking: A Beginner's Guide to Problem Solving and Programming by Karl Beecher. I really like it and still read it from time to time, even though I am experienced but it's really a great book.Expect bumps—coding’s all about solving problems. Don’t quit when you’re stuck; take a break, hit Google or Stack Overflow, or use AI to explain (but don’t let it solve coding challenges—that’s cheating and you learn nothing). Everyone learns differently—some pay for courses to stay motivated, others grind free stuff. Stay consistent, even 2 hours a day. You’ve got this! Finish CS50, then focus on algorithms, data structures, databases , operating systems, programming with C++ and OOP, and any programming fundamentals that didn't covered in CS50(because 8 weeks not enough to know what you should learn ) (try free resources like FreeCodeCamp or books like “grokking algorithms”). Hit us up for next steps.What you did was the right move, you took the initiative to ask, keep doing that when you have questions, always ask the experts and don't rely on the answers of laymen or non-specialists, not even AI, AI can help you along the way if you know what you're doing, but it may not be appropriate at all times.And not all paid courses are good and not all free courses are bad, I can give you advices for hours, but unfortunately that is not the way you will develop, you have a path that you must discover for yourself, what I discovered is what you will discover, but you will discover it in your own way and with your own understanding, so I said it directly to you ... You may not always be convinced, so I'm not going to give you all the advice as much as I'm going to give you what works for you at your current stage.And remember that not everything is clear at the beginning, meaning that I cannot give you everything from the beginning until you are an expert in the field, but this depends on you and your research, reading books and learning, I only guide you to the beginning of the road. Good luck!update : CS50 (also called CS50x which is the most popular course of the CS50 series) may be difficult for some students, but in some countries computer principles are taught in schools, if you don't have knowledge about it, you can watch the content of the CS50T course first and learn more about computer principles and how to use Windows and what is hardware and software.",MohabCodeX,2025-06-05 16:32:00,53,learnprogramming,t3_1l42sn3,False,

The CS grad isn't necessarily a better programmer (often they're not), but four years of study exposes them to a wide range of ideas, so that *they know what they don't know.*>So how does one bridge the gap from being a programmer who can only create a terminal CRUD to becoming a programmer that understands how to build something like a compiler?Find out what someone needs to know to build a compiler: do a web search, or ask an AI chatbot. Then *learn those things*. The list will not be short: it will include things like lexical and semantic analysis, formal language theory, automata theory, and computer architecture. When I was in school, the compilers class was senior-level, spread out over two semesters, and probably had the most prerequisites of any class I'd taken.

What that really means is *you’re not standing out yet* — and maybe you’re not putting in enough work. If this is enough to discourage you, then maybe you don’t actually love or care about this enough to go all in.Think about actors — look at what age most of them got their big break versus how long they had been grinding. If you're ready to give up now, then yeah, quit — because the pressure this industry will put on you will be way worse than this.Your first dev job won’t be easy. It won’t be smooth sailing. You still have to learn how to communicate well, adapt quickly, and solve real-world problems. I used to volunteer, I used to code for free just to get experience and feedback from senior devs — some who worked at Amazon, Google, and Netflix.I’ve led teams while volunteering, participated in hackathons, and mentored people — taught them how to lead and grow. On my *days off* from working a warehouse job, I would go into coding Discord servers and help people debug their issues.I tried college — it didn’t work out because of life circumstances. Everything I know is self-taught. I couldn’t afford bootcamps, so I found free ones. I hunted down Udemy courses on sale or found ways to get them free.There are **plenty** of ways to make money coding. Go find one. I used to be homeless, and I was still learning, still listening to lectures and podcasts, still grinding.My first contract? Made me $300 and $7/month. My second? I built software for a company, but the staff all quit before it got deployed. I still got paid. Now? I’ve got a pending contract with a startup and I'm building a demo for someone else.I’ve been doing this for about five years now. I’ve worked with people in Canada, Africa — folks who don’t even have consistent electricity or stable internet, and they still made it work.So I’m saying this: If you *really* want it, then you have to *work* for it. You have to grind. Not for weeks. Not for months. **For years.**Are you willing to do that? Shiii I was diong this homeless.

You must ""opt in"" to make a function virtual. In almost all other languages (including Python), methods (that is, functions placed onto a class) are always virtual. And because they are always virtual, you might not even yet know what the difference is between a function being ""virtual"" or ""non-virtual"", for example. But you will learn this when you learn C++.C++ also has function overloading, which Python does not have.C++ has templates (generic functions), which Python does not have.Python also has some stuff that C++ does not have, or which is hard to do in C++. For example, ""generators"" in Python are pretty useful. Maybe you can do something similar in C++ but it will not be so convenient. Python and most dynamic languages have an ""eval"" facility which lets you evaluate code ""on the fly"" but this kind of thing does not exist in C++.

Moreover, if you try to switch from a high-level (abstraction-oriented) language such as Python to a low-level (system-oriented) language such as Rust or C++, you will have to learn a lot of additional theoretical material such as memory management and data mutation safety rules.

Use a framework that gives some guidance on you into how you should organize your classes, and try to think more inline with MVC rather than OOP.When it comes to more abstract things that need more custom implementation (think a highly complex interface layer that's meant to manage multiple other systems / services), things get more situational.

Ai in 5 years most likely will not be able to replace a person at determining the correctness of some code. The best path forward is to keep an eye on the tools. Learn on your own but also try the tools since that may be expected at your first job. Also good to identify where ai makes mistakes. The best way to not worry is to observe that for yourself. If you ai doesn't make mistakes then you are a god among vibe coders and your future is safe either way.I would recommend windsurf. The best option might change over time, but currently for windsurf you can purchase their lowest tier subscription and get unlimited use from their base model. If any kind of expense is a problem, then use a normal code editor and ask a free ai service for code, like perplexity or Google or Bing. I used windsurf to build a reddit scrubbing tool and it struggled a lot with building the rate limiting code. Without my knowledge, if that was a project someone built for a customer, it would be fine for a few seconds until it burst past the call limit per second and got the tool rate limited or blocked. It needed 3 or 4 attempts to implement an ok solution - and that is with heavy guidance in a single, small function.",TomWithTime,2025-06-04 14:02:25,6,learnprogramming,t3_1l3454l,False,

mvzge59,"You really need more of a ~20 year outlook. At 15, you're not even close to starting your career, let alone getting the ball rolling enough to rely on your experience / tenure to help you settle down.First thing to mention (even outside of AI) is that this entire field goes through ups and down. Software development is not immune to economic downswings unless you luck out (there are some jobs out there that are more ""essential"", but not most), and we're in one right now. The current job market, plus all the AI advancements in the news, has everyone worrying about AI, but it's a scapegoat to larger issues over-hiring from Covid, interest rates, and tax laws (Section 174 being a big one).And in regards to AI, if software development gets to a point where a non-technical person can use AI like a ""cheap high-quality on-demand agency"", nearly every job is getting replaced. Put ""will doctors"" into Google search, the first result is likely ""will doctors be replaced by AI"".Being concerned about AI ***right now*** is pretty ridiculous. I've not seen any major instances of ""AI replacing developers"". There have been some decent showcases of AI reducing workloads (AirBnB did some interesting work in regards to testing migration), but even those are pretty limited. In general, it helped cut out some of the mundanity with repetitive boilerplate code, and helped people who have never written code to get things started, but that's about it.Being concerned about AI in 20 years is perfectly reasonable though. We've seen major advancements over just the last two years, but we still are not completely sure if there's a ""ceiling"" that might cap what AI can do, or if those advancements will continue to accelerate.Overall, if you're passionate about something, especially at such a young age, it's worth investing some time into that passion. No one knows what the world is going to look like in 5 years, let alone 20. People who are really passionate about what they do, and put in the time and effort to make smart decisions, tend to make things work.Edit: grammar",SpookyLoop,2025-06-04 17:15:07,1,learnprogramming,t3_1l3454l,False,

That role is absolutely critical, since AI can't take over management, and someone needs to be responsible for ensuring the technology get built and solves the problem you think it does.So how has AI changed out life? I write code faster (for some things), I get better search results, and I can have in-depth conversations about parts of my life I wouldn't otherwise talk about, with an agent that is willing to walk through very specific scenarios for hours and hours.As for other people, my job is to basically use LLMs to save costs.

When you dominate the syntax you start to develop a skill to write the code without thinking in the semantics but in what can be possible output. It’s a process that takes time because we in normal days solving a problem we use the real logic but in programming you have the abstraction to representing real situations in a programming language. If you think in closing a door, you imagine the door fiscally and the knob, but in an algorithm you could think in the coordinate of the knob or if the door is open or close or even if there is a door, so after you have this clear in you mind so you translate each action in code. This is a process to take time to become automatic, similar to drive a manual transmission, the first times you really think a lot when changing the velocity, but after you don’t think on that at all. Furthermore, if you don’t know something exists (a solution) how can you know about it. I mean, my point is I am very ignorant about some music if I never listen before, but the first time you hear it you can know if you like. Solving problems is like that, you don’t know the solution and even where to start, but with practice and learning how others approach the problem you will develop this sense of recognising patterns. A way to deal with this more in practice is learning how to debug and learning debugging tools, so you can see the step by step of the code and the output.

This kicked my ass thoroughly, but I managed to join a closed source project for an old MMO game emulator. There was another one that was the competitor around 2003 that was open source. We had decided to merge but they made an interesting choice during the merger. This strange language called C#. This was a very early version of it. But I couldn't believe how cool and approachable it made things. I personally loved it. Others hated it and said nothing serious could ever be built with it. But me being new to this, I loved the idea of removing so much complexity behind things like memory management, it was like magic. You could get so much done by doing less. This decision fractured the team. The C++ diehards refused to work with it and eventually left to continue the C++ version, I stayed on the C# version. Fast forward some years, the C# version was pumping out more and more features while the C++ version couldn't keep up. Eventually the C++ version of this project died out, but the C# project is still alive today (sort of, it's gone stagnant since about 2018 or so). But it's incredible to see how far C# has come over the years. It's what I use in my current job (the little bit of coding an architect does anyway). I think it's important to know how languages like C/C++ work as they provide a better understanding of what's going on under the hood. But I also think it's better for someone new to start with something more approachable like Java & C#. That's good you decided to delve into it after learning Java.

mw79167,"I don't know what kind of ""math"" you enjoy, but here's an approach you could maybe take. You seem to imply that either you find something boring or too complex, meaning, the ones you find interesting are unfortunately too complex or out of scope for you to do.Maybe make a list of the interesting but ""too complex"" projects you find, and see if you can either find a common theme to inspire you, or if there are some of them you can simplify and start out with on a smaller scale.For example, let's say you find the thought of building a game interesting, but, games are too big and complex. Well, you can start small, I would assume that tictactoe is too simple for you as well, what about something in between, like Pacman? You can add a lot of interesting depth to that game. Some part of it is visual, which usually helps make it a little more interesting and captivating. But there's also stuff like Ghost behavior, which can be solved in a lot of ways. You can do it with more traditional search algorithms, you can make deterministic tabled graphs to use for look up. They both need to flee and pursue Pacman, the 4 ghosts all act differently, so figuring out how to add that nuance in, once you find the solution you want to use could be an interesting little thing to tweak around with.",PhilNEvo,2025-06-05 20:39:02,3,learnprogramming,t3_1l458cs,False,

That’s a real sign you’ve found something you’re genuinely passionate about. A lot of great devs started the same way - just getting lost in code.Since you're learning C#, that’s a strong start. It’s used in tons of real-world applications - especially in enterprise software, game dev with Unity, and even backend web stuff (with .NET). So don’t think it’s a “just-for-school"" language - it’s got legs in the industry.If you're eyeing cybersecurity and want to branch out smartly, here's a quick breakdown of useful languages based on where you might go:For Cybersecurity:Python – absolute must. It's everywhere in cybersec (automation, scripting, tooling, etc.), super beginner-friendly, and has a massive library ecosystem.Bash/Shell Scripting – essential if you're going to be dealing with Linux servers or writing security automation scripts.C/C++ – if you ever want to understand exploits, memory management, or reverse engineering.For General Dev / Building Stuff:JavaScript + HTML/CSS – if you ever want to touch frontend or build tools with a GUI.Go – gaining traction in cloud & network tooling, really nice for fast and secure backend systems.Since you're enjoying it already, I'd say:Stick with C# and get comfy building small projects.Start Python next - you’ll love how fast you can get stuff working.Maybe check out TryHackMe or Hack The Box once you’re comfortable with the basics - great intro to hands-on cybersec.Also, shameless plug, but I’ve been using this app called BootSelf lately. It gives you an AI mentor that helps explain code and quiz you with flashcards. Pretty helpful if you're learning solo and want to stay on track.

I look for what seems exciting or relevant to the kind of software I might want to build.For example, I wanted a personal website, which led me to Eleventy. I tried to dive in, read some docs, and attempt small things, until I realized that I was really struggling to get what I wanted. I then looked for a tutorial that builds a complete project, so I could get a notion for what it could look like. When doing tutorials, I try to actively change minor things, add small features, or try to integrate it with something else.

I was hired into a team and at a time where all the others in my cohort had masters degrees and seemed so much more experienced than I was. And it's possible that they were, I didn't realize that it didn't actually matter that much. I was showing up, passionate about doing a good job, and learning every day.I have a distinct memory of talking to a mentor about it. A meeting had just ended and I asked him to hang back in the conference room with me. I mentioned those feelings, that I wasn't as good as the other junior developers. I'd hoped my mentor would have some sage advice for me, recommendations on learning materials to catch up, or even just a pep talk. Instead, he told me to never let anyone hear me say that again. Because people will believe it if they hear it. And it sort of crushed me, because **I believed it.**Later on, that same mentor was let go from the company. In my final chat with him he shared that he'd had a lot of personal things going on in his life. The reality is that he was struggling too, all that time. And his way of handling it had been to put up that front. That's why I thought he was the person who would be able to help me. Because he presented like he had it figured out. When really, he was falling behind just like the rest of us. He felt lost. His mental state was impacting his work, etc. And worst of all, he didn't have a healthy mindset of how to address it.Years later, I was one of the most senior people working on a product. I had a manager who was new in role and together we built out a team of mostly college hires to stand up and then operate a new set of services. Every one of those developers we hired were brilliant. I always felt like they were so far ahead of where I was when I started and found each of them to be so impressive. But sure enough, in the months and then years that followed our building that team out... those new junior developers would each take me aside on their own to express how they were struggling with feelings in inadequacy. Literally, every single one.Ironically, it was those junior developers who helped me to overcome my imposters syndrome. Not the experienced mentor like I'd imagined. It was when I realized how **we all feel behind,** that I managed to wrangle my own feelings. What you're feeling now is completely normal. Its okay to be vulnerable.

mwazsv0,"I’m a senior developer with around 15 years of professional experience. I too learned OOP and the MVC pattern (which was touted as the prime example of SOLID) at my university. Well, those patterns never really resonated with me and using Java helped solidify to me that OOP cannot be the simplest way to organize things in a maintainable way.In my career I’ve seen a lot of patterns, and the one that really clicked for me was pure functional programming. Working with a language that doesn’t have mutable objects, null values, or even a semblance of classes was such a revelation: nearly all the problems the golden rules try to mitigate come from mutability and complex hierarchical state. Pure functions always return the same result, given the same arguments, which makes testing them incredibly easy and fun. And if the language has nothing but pure functions, then all applications built with it are incredibly easy and fun to test.My point is, it’s okay if some aspects of programming don’t click. Maybe they will later on, when you’ve seen how following it avoided issues or cutting corners lead to issues. Maybe you’ll come across another way of looking at things (like FP for me) that finally makes sense and helps put everything else in a new perspective.Just build things you want to build, that’s the only way programming is going to start making sense. Try following the rules and try breaking them. Come up with your own solutions and once done, analyze if what you did actually followed a common pattern, just in a roundabout way.

I can't speak to how it compares to other codebases but for someone who has only worked on small projects for classes, it's pretty daunting. Plus, while I have basic familiarity with Java, I don't know C# at all.I looked at a bunch of other mods for the game and decompiled the source code to get some starting points, but it wasn't long before I ran into roadblocks that no amount of Googling would have ever resolved. Normally, I'd probably have just given up. Being able to make tangible progress has been hugely helpful in keeping motivation up and frustration down, and I feel like I've learned a ton about C#, Unity games and even certain OOP concepts I wasn't super familiar with.Being able to say, ""Okay, here's how this other mod did Y, can you give me some ideas on how to implement similar idea X?""

Like, a specific weird issue I was having with this mod the AI suggested a very ""brute force"" solution that probably would have worked, but I was 99% sure was not the correct or ""ideal"" way to do it. So I would say, ""No I'm pretty sure you're wrong. I can see a bunch of methods in this source file that may be applicable to our situation, maybe we can find an alternate path?"" And then we found a better solution together. The AI didn't solve the problem for me, it just saved me the frustration of having to parse thousands of lines of unfamiliar code in the hope that I was on the right track.It definitely leads me astray sometimes, it hallucinates methods pretty regularly but *conceptually* it's implementation plans are usually pointed in the right direction.

mw4jrwl,"Avoid AI for most of your project. I’m in a similar boat to you going back to college and ya AI is a great tool to help get through it but your not actually learning that much by tweaking the code after it spits it out. There’s a lot more to learn in how to take an idea and how to start making it. One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned so far is in planning and design. Sitting down and actually breaking down each element, what do I want, what do I need, who will be doing x and who does y? What “date” should I be using and why?Learning how to define the success factors and set realistic goals is vital in coding. As I’m going through it I’ll jot down possible approaches and methods I might need going forward. I don’t need to fully code them now but I need to make sure I have everything tight for when things get complicated later. You won’t be designing every system you work on from the ground up but you will need to be able to read and identify what the other coders were doing, what were they thinking when they made this method or class and where does it go? You won’t be able to feed full applications into an AI to read them out to you when you’re on a team. I also put a lot of work in before I started college and got advanced entry into Y2. At Christmas I was miles ahead of most in the class and took the foot of the gas looking at other languages instead. Come April I realised I’d slipped too much and had work my balls off to catch up. Yes I had a basic understanding of what we did but I couldn’t use it effectively. The best example was SQL. I could read SQL, I knew where the query was going how things joined but I struggled trying to fix it together myself. I used AI while making my database connections and had to constantly look back to do them from scratch myself. Eventually I just stopped using the AI designed methods as this is something I need to be able to do. We had interviews presenting our final projects at the end of the year and they asked “You have well designed methods for database queries in the first 4-5 frames but you don’t use them later in the project. Why?” I explained that while I would be using those methods from the helper files in real world conditions, I wasn’t happy with my understanding of them. I couldn’t do them from memory and kept making errors, so I decided to drill them in by typing them out each time. They loved that answer. It showed I was able to use helper files and methods to keep code clear and concise making the project easy to read, but I also knew how to make and adjust the process to perform custom tasks. They asked me to isolate certain conditions and how I would pick out individual combinations and I was able to do it on the spot because I knew the system and understood how it worked. Some of the others struggled with that as AI had done all the thinking for them. When it came to exams I flew through the test because I A) understood how I would do it. B) was able to identify what they were looking for and how to trace back to it. And C) I made the mistakes and worked my way through them so when they happened there I knew what I was looking at. TLDR:Don’t use AI to design everything. Yes it’ll spit out loads of lovely code that works for this window of the project but it won’t improve your skills or work when you only have this small section on larger projects.

(ammortization is the same in the long term- but getting the full break that year is the difference between 20% cost reduction and 4%. If not for the previous years of instant ""refunds"", they'd have stacked 4 years of ammortizations and have the same effect right now.)**The loss of the tax advantage for R&D and the hike in interest rates would have suppressed wages, but not diminished the demand for employees.** What we're seeing is collusion between major tech employers to time their layoffs with the DOGE cuts to create a glut of desperate, highly senior, non-pay motivated talent in the market. The longer they can perpetuate it, the more desperate those people will get, and it creates a hermit crab conga line of companies firing their less senior staff hired when times were good to bring in more senior staff who've finally gotten desperate enough to accept lower pay.There is an argument to be made that because other companies are laying off tech staff and the abundance of tech graduates is creating an environment where wages are so severely depressed that it becomes in the interest of companies to also layoff their staff to rehire cheaper replacements *without direct collusion*, but **when that sort of behavior occurs in the banking sector or stock market, there are regulations in place to prevent the situation from becoming a feedback loop that tanks the institutions.** **This cycle of mass layoffs will repeat every time companies think they can get lower wages, more experience or both from a new hire over their current staff until the US gets serious about passing labor protection laws.**",Kalekuda,2025-06-07 14:24:51,77,cscareerquestions,t3_1l5kbzs,False,

All of these employees need jobs and are competing with each other. In order to get employed again, some of these employees will take big pay cuts.

Software development is like that sometimes - a project that takes 5 people a year usually still takes 10 people a year.Second, saving $20k on a hire doesn't automatically put $20k at the bottom line. If I know I want 5 engineers and I want them to do X, Y, and Z, then I don't care how cheap the ones are that can only do X or Y.

mvx6tt8,They do and they are. Wages haven’t kept up with inflation in many industries in the US since the 1970s. Every year people are being paid less. It’s a slow process because if they don’t pay good employees enough they jump ship to a competing company which is why today in a lot of white collar roles in the US it’s common to work 24 months at a company then switch. Larger companies like FAANG have attempted to address this through vesting. You don’t get fully paid unless you’re there for 4 years. On year 4 you’re getting paid for your first year of work. Leaving is like losing 4 years of half of your pay. In Europe wages are lower in part because people are far less likely to jump ship due to pay so they can just low ball everyone from the get go. Within the next 20 years it wouldn’t surprise me if in the US pay is closer to what Europeans are making but without the benefits.,proverbialbunny,2025-06-04 09:18:54,18,cscareerquestions,t3_1l30ir3,False,

In practice, it means that the law says an employer has to post a job ad for a role that had already been filled and ramped up a year+ earlier.The undertone of these kinds of exposes seem to be that some cohorts are more ""deserving of the opportunity conferred by the law"", but arguably the immigration lawyers involved are actually going by the spirit of the law (even if it may technically be malicious compliance) when they ask the H-1B worker to provide job descriptions with excruciatingly high level of detail to construct these job posts. It is already hard enough to get candidates to match nice-to-haves in a regular job post, so who else can check every checkmark in a huge and highly specific list other than the person that is already doing the function, and with zero ramp up time, to boot?

Then by the time you solved the bug, you now only have 10-20 minutes left to work on question 2. There is no time left to work on q2, especially when both qs are leetcode hard. Not sure if that's very reflective of the industry, at least in the internship I did, it wasn't like ""you must solve this in X minutes, otherwise we are all doomed"".The other thing I don't like about leetcode questions being used for assessments is that we can't use debugging tools.

This is also what happens in the industry but I can't use them. And so I am left staring into the screen trying to understand what I am doing wrong, I am trying to guess where I fked up.

mwclx25,"Few things to unpack:First is understanding why there's a sense of urgency, and whether it is warranted. If something isn't literally on fire, you probably don't need to drop everything else to do it today. Normally you agree on milestones and delivery deadlines upfront, or at least in advance.Second is deconstructing delivery timelines based on whether it's due to technical complexity or due to scheduling. The former presumably means you've done some due diligence before estimating, and you should be able to articulate what the time consuming parts are with some degree of granularity, and their respective estimates. The latter is about what prior commitments you already have, and you have to decide how negotiable it is to make changes. Maybe you can deliver things faster by dropping/negotiating other things that have lower priorities or charging premium to work overtime or hiring a subcontractor, maybe not. If you can't, then be transparent about having other commitments. In other words, urgency is a feature, and you can charge money for it.If it's a question of perception, you could try to explain via analogies, e.g. in law movies everything happens very quickly, often within the same day, whereas in reality, they drag on for months/years because in the real world things just take time.

So your response to these questions should be a date you'll have that feature complete. Once you give a deadline, you'll get many fewer of these questions and if you do, just refer them to the aforementioned date.The other part of this is just that non-technical people just don't know how hard things are. They've been taught, through drag-and-drop website builders and, sadly, AI-marketing, that things are easy. A new form should take an hour to add, right?? It can also be helpful to explain, as part of the communication providing them with the estimated timeline, what goes into the feature you're building. If they ask for a button to send a report to their email, for example, you can explain that part of your work means preventing security issues, handling permissions, formatting the report, testing it, making sure the email doesn't go to spam, etc etc.As for the full-time job part, if they knew you had a full time job when they contracted with you, you can remind them of that, but I honestly think that's unnecessary to include.

How are they staying within the country?Some of them end up leaving. There are ways to stay, but for a lot of those people they need a legitimate job that pays legitimate money, and if they can't get that, then they end up having to leave because of not only immigration status but also finances.>Also, could this hiring freeze combined with the layoffs be intentional to make the foreigners leave the country without overstaying illegally on an expired visa? Basically slowing down hiring for 90 days until the foreigners on visa have to self deport?Hiring freezes and layoffs are company-driven decisions. Those companies have no incentive to drive foreign workers out of the country - that would just make the cost of labor for them go up. Most companies want foreign workers to be available.So this makes no sense. Companies are doing layoffs because layoffs = higher profits, and that has always been true.>If people on those visas do an unpaid internship, for example, can they stay in the country until they find a real paying job, even if it takes more than 90 days to find the job since they're not unemployed technically while doing an unpaid internship?Yes. As long as it's a valid unpaid internship - i.e., an internship that is consistent with their field of study/profession. Like, on OPT you can't go get an unpaid job as a janitor and have it count. But you can, for example, work as an unpaid researcher for your former grad program (I've seen this done several times).Again, the problem with that strategy is that you need to then have the finances to float you until you do find a job, which isn't something everyone can do.

Companies aren't DQ'ing me because I have no experience in their stack. They know I can learn on the job, and my resume paints that picture.

mwi6kmz,"There are 2 things at play here - there is an overwhelming amount of information *and* you are overwhelming yourself. Be comfortable with saying ""okay, I don't know how that works properly... for now"". For now, just take a deep breath, every senior you respect has been where you are today. Here are some tips to make your life easier:1. Keep your world small. The route you already did with your mentor is the GOLD right now. You have 2 possible small ways you can expand your world. A) implement the rest of the routes for the project that you are working on right now, B) implement the same route across other projects. - It is probably easier to implement the other routes. 2. When working on this type of thing, you will be slow initially, it might take you 2 weeks to get through 2 routes initially, but by the last week of the summer you might complete a route per day. In order to move quickly, you are going to have to move slowly and intentionally. Things like Gradle / DI / those other internal tools and random config files on first blush don't sound super relevant to the task at hand, only learn how to use it if it is going to progress your goal. If you are going to *not* learn it on purpose, write it down and square it away for later. 3. Ask for feedback often, your mentor may be able to tell you what route would be the next simplest to tackle. 4. Don't be afraid to look at pull requests where any specific route was implemented. Often times, complete feature pull requests give you a really good idea of just how ""Small"" your world can be when you want it to, if you find some good ones. 5. If you are stuck on a particular thing for more than an hour, ask - just ask, ask your mentor or something else, ""Hey , do you have 5 minutes to explain something to me? I am trying to understand why when I remove the mock here this other test unexpectedly breaks - I Think you mentioned this during our call , but I think I just need a quick refresher - would super appreciate it!"" Just take it a day at a time, recognise that feeling like you don't know stuff is normal, panicking will not help you and it will detract from your ability to learn. You are also wrong about one thing, the ability to ""remember"" context is not key for success at larger companies, the actual key is realising what context does and does not matter. No one on your team knows everything, they're just capable of figuring out what bits are important enough to learn *today* to progress them towards whatever goal they're working on. Late July is a also a fairly reasonable goal for the task you were given, without knowing the specifics of the codebase.

Make a new database with the UI and do CRUD operations. Can get up to speed in 1 day. Oracle isn't nearly as common as it used to be and MySQL is the cheapskate version of Oracle. MSSQL is good though.* **Learn one of AWS, Azure, GCP**. I used to think no one used GCP but I saw one company switch to it because it's cheaper. Recruiters were always cool with me only knowing 1 of the 3 since the others are easy to learn at that point. Using on the job goes a long way, else get an entry level cert that you see listed in a few job applications. The only cert that not a scam for this reason but it is crazy expensive. Thus your employer pays. Probably need a book or course and the exam has extra cheating detection.* **Learn one of Docker or Kubernetes**. You can learn both but there's some overlap. Pick what you see more in job descriptions. I guess Kubernetes and that's what I've seen more as well.* Microservices, yeah this is on the job experience. You can't teach yourself, or you can, but it won't matter to a recruiter.* Less important: Compliment Java with another language. Could be Python, Kotlin, Go aka Golang or TypeScript/JavaScript with your choice of React or Angular. Actually is important but if not used on the job, it ranks here.* Less important: Use Jetty with Spring Boot, preferably now on the job for local testing.

Your Spring Boot background gives you microservices understanding, your Java skills mean you can pick up any backend technology quickly, and your database experience shows you understand data persistence regardless of the specific system.

Or did you assume it'd be OK to wait until 8am?Obviously an expectation of after-hours responses isn't healthy, it creates a bad WLB. Your time outside of working hours belong to you. But that doesn't change the fact that if it's an expectation, then from your employer's perspective you're not meeting expectations.Another side of this in addition to employer expectations is your own professional boundaries. Did you clearly communicate your working hours? When contacted after hours did you make it clear that it was *after hours* for you and that you'd get back to them first thing in the morning?Especially in a distributed world where people may be in different timezones, and where a lot of people are setting their own hours, some people just don't realize if it's after hours for someone else. That may be insensitive to not consider that before firing off messages... but it's not uncommon.Even on teams with a good WLB though, after hours messages happe from time to time, for various reasons. Sometimes it's urgent issues, sometimes someone just fired off a message without realizing it was after hours, sometimes someone was just sending a message before they forgot and aren't expecting a response until the nxt day.

This is a tomorrow thing - I just wanted to get that in front of you because I won't have time to chat about it tomorrow"".But i've had VPs that would have expected an answer that moment.

But in 2025, that probably won’t lead to a pathway into a more technical role, since most data science and ML roles are looking for either loads of experience or advanced education. So yeah, I think an advanced degree would 100% be beneficial to your candidacy at companies. In person and hybrid more so than online, since you’ll be able to network better. What’s the offer from the school, how expensive are we talking? Because there’s lots of price points in 2025 to get educated at.

mw3i43j,"Short answer: While I want to say ""YES, it will open doors for you!"" the reality is more akin to avoiding a penalty than actually helping you. Most people in the field have a degree, and it puts you on a level playing field.Not having the degree is going to close doors -- there's no way around it. That doesn't mean that there are no open doors for you, but it's going to limit you. Particularly if you ever think you might want to work in another country, your visa may hinge entirely on having a CS degree.When changing careers to software engineering, I went and did exactly what you are considering and got a Masters in CS. I have never even once had regrets, and many of the opportunities I've had wouldn't have been possible without it. If you have the time, and can afford the expense (I received a partial scholarship), I cannot recommend it enough.Additionally, considering the current job market, it is so competitive for new grads right now that I don't think companies are taking risks on giving someone their first CS job with no work history and no degree. At this particular moment in time, I think it would be incredibly difficult to get your first job in the industry unless you already have personal connections to do so (getting the first job without a degree and proving yourself is the biggest hurdle) or are prepared to work for absolutely abysmal pay or conditions (which may have lifelong career repercussions -- people will probably know exactly how your previous employer paid you and treated you, and it can be a struggle for your wages to catch up even as you move to better and better companies). Getting the degree also gives time for the current job market to possibly improve, though I don't know I'd put money on it getting better so that's neither here nor there.",wouldprefernot,2025-06-05 07:32:28,12,cscareerquestions,t3_1l3rnlk,False,

I'll have to shift focus away from X in order to do that though, so X won't get done"".I have 40 hours in a week.

They don't get to tell me ""Everything's gotta get done"", that's just a sign of poor management if they try. Luckily for management though, a lot of SWE's are scared to establish professional boundaries, so they just decide to quietly do everything and inflate their hours beyond 40, which is not sustainable.When unknowns pop up in tickets that I've estimated, I very clearly communicate those things as early as possible.

Some of what you're describing sounds like requirements might be inaccurate, which adds to these issues popping up. There could also be an increased culture of testing.

It may give people more appreciation of what they are committing (realistically, there are some people who will never care). But if you go with a per-sprint role, maybe that can be a pointed ticket/story to cover that work. Sounds like your manager might not like those ideas because they just want to push features, but it's worth at least having the discussion.

mwqsw4v,"Hi I’m the friend! I agree that to make real contributions to the field I’ll need a CS PhD. I’m pretty hard set on doing at least the masters in philosophy. Do you think,given the competitive nature of top cs PhDs that I could get in with just a masters in philosophy, my tech background, and learning ML and doing research on the side? Or should I take the longer route of probably 3 years to get both a CS and philosophy masters to be a competitive applicant? I really believe in the cross disciplinary approach to tackling ai problems so I’m willing to dedicate the time to get it all done!

mwr9kvy,That’s a very compelling argument! I have self studied philosophy the past few years and have pretty deep understanding. I would like to do the masters for the opportunity to engage with other students and especially professors because I think discussions are usually eye opening. Also I have a paper based on a proof that’s at the intersection of AI and philosophy that I’ve talked to different phds in both philosophy and cs that they say is good enough to be published and is a novel idea. So I really want to have the support to develop it to its best ability. But yes the masters in ML is very practical and without experience in the field any philosophical I have won’t be taken as serious. I’m trying to find a balance,Various-Solid-1879,2025-06-09 01:32:12,1,cscareerquestions,t1_mwr2jrl,False,
mwutiey,"PhD programs in the US don't usually have masters degrees are a prerequisite, and certainly CS PhD programs won't care about a masters in philosophy. They'll be looking at your academic background, research projects, letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, fit with the program, GRE (if required), and stuff like that. I took a look at your philosophy of mind writing. It's... not good. You'll need to stop using chatGPT to help you write stuff. Even if you think it's your own voice and ideas, having an LLM rewrite your stuff will invariably introduce semantic shift as well as ideas that aren't your own. Using an LLM to help you write like this at all will instantly torpedo any academic aspirations you have. You're going to need to learn how to express your thoughts on your own. Chatting with LLMs can make you feel like you're learning a lot and that you're making deep insights, but that's the sycophantic nature of chatbots. But it's actually very shallow because it doesn't understand anything. It's just good at generating sentences and paragraphs that looks good on the surface. It might seem deep to someone who's deep in the Dunning-Kreuger well, but it's mostly just superficial repetition to an expert. You didn't engage any other thinkers at all, didn't connect anything you're saying to any published work, and there's just zero rigor. Be careful ""self-studying"" philosophy in this way. It's not preparing you for an academic program in philosophy. This is the equivalent of someone self-studying about CSS and learning how to change colors and themes on a webpage, and thinking that they've made some insightful leaps in the theory of computer science. So just be careful with that. If you want to learn how to do philosophy, you need to deeply engage with a large catalogue of serious literature. LLMs, pop writing on Buddhism, and Sam Harris won't cut it past a 100 level undergrad philosophy class.",ilovemacandcheese,2025-06-09 16:28:41,2,cscareerquestions,t1_mwqsw4v,False,
mwuwhyb,"Thank you so much! That’s very valid criticism! I do agree that I should use LLMs less, I wrote the mini essays and then had it fix formatting and grammar stuff. It wasn’t meant to be anything academic but just a way for my friends from different backgrounds to visualize meditation, mindfulness, etc. i really enjoy casual writing for my friends which is the purpose of my blog. I do engage with big writers in the field and want to do more formal writing(without LLMs assistance) so that’s why I want to go back to school. I think being in an academic setting and engaging with real professors and classmates would allow me to step past the stage I’m at currently which I agree is not very good. I do believe in my capability of growing to write more academically as I have a strong argument against simulation theory that I have talked to both cs professors and philosophers professors about and got good feedback. I bought all the relevant existing literature(Dennet, Bolstram, Chalmers) so I can reference and engage with literature. But in short, I definitely agree with you and need to completely change my writing style and approach to succeed in any academic sense. If you have any other advice on what I’d need to succeed let me know! Really appreciate you’re criticism",Various-Solid-1879,2025-06-09 16:42:35,1,cscareerquestions,t1_mwutiey,False,
mwofjpq,"My general opinion having done the MSCS from GT is that if your employer pays for it or you get a GRA then a Masters is worth it.But at the end of the day MSCS is largely not directly related to anything you will actually do in a real job. My employer paid 100% of the tuition and I had time, so it made sense. Idk if its as relevant for cybersecurity though, that field has some more well established certifications like CISSP that would probably be more recognized then a masters in something generic like CS.

The reality is that in today's job market, especially in Europe where compliance and formal qualifications carry more weight, having those pieces of paper can open doors that your experience alone might not. It's frustrating and somewhat backwards, but playing the game strategically by getting certified in technologies you already know well is a smart move that demonstrates both your existing skills and your commitment to formal validation.I'm actually part of the team behind [interview assistant](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically to help people navigate these kinds of tricky interview situations where you need to articulate the value of your experience alongside formal credentials.",akornato,2025-06-07 06:22:34,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1l4ogw2,False,

mwlnl5z,"It’s going to be so case by case that it’s hard to answer definitively. I am currently at a ~2,000 person company that is slow, has too much process, and imbalanced staffing for their goals. We plan way too much (in halfs,) don’t stick to it, then thrash. Very compartmentalized as if whole sections of the company are external vendors. The best thing they have going for them is a supposed blameless culture, but this often manifests as a lack of ownership/responsibility for actions. In the past I was at a company that grew from 50 to over 1,000 and they were basically the opposite. Fast, not much process, pragmatic staffing. We planned more flexibly, often week by week, and later monthly as we grew. Culture was very open and encouraged cross functional behavior and leadership. The only thing I didn’t like here (besides stress that built over years) was the subtle blame games that happened behind your back. So like I said, complete opposites.
