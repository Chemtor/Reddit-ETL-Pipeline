You'll never be able to truly answer how many unique customers, suppliers, or products you have. That uniqueness is required for the denominator of your KPIs at an enterprise level. Yea I'm sure it's not needed at an operational level but that's not the level that your execs and ultimately your board is looking for.If you acquire your competitor and say you both share the same supplier but have different supply terms which are more favorable to the company you acquired then you would be smart to use that contract going forward. You will get to that answer sooner with MDM.MDM helps us get in front of these types of data challenges. Yes the tooling is bloated, expensive, and hard to implement and maintain. Regardless, the need will always be there. Another easy example, what if your customers are subsidiaries of other companies. How does Finance calculate the consolidate line of credit if it doesn't know or manage those relationships in the systems.

If that master data is wrong it could put the whole migration and implementation in jeopardy causing millions in damages.

In larger orgs it's also a great way to enforce standardisation of calculations like KPIs: without a semantic layer Sue from finance might have a retention rate calculation different from Bob from HR's version, and when the C-suite see two different numbers for the ""same"" thing they either pick on based on whether Bob or Sue has the better reputation, or distrust them both entirely. If Bob and Sue are dragging and dropping a measure from the same model that doesn't happen. And if Bob and Sue both think their one is best, then there can be a process for working out which one becomes the single source of truth instead of them going off into their silo and doing their own thing.Organisationally it sits at a good place too, in that it can be a product of a central data team to enable business unit-adjacent analysts and BI teams to get straight into their value-add (engineers do the engineering, business users do the questioning, presenting and interpretation) .

Data products mean anything that the end users need. One of the biggest challenges any data warehouse has is keeping the data between data products aligned. You always create your data products from the core layer for this very reason. As a general rule of thumb, your core layer doesn't specifically address any business need (actually it has to address all of them). You may be asking, why not just query the core? Data products are created to align with the business needs. What finance needs is not necessarily what sales needs. When you create something like a star schema, you are layering on business requirements, processes and definitions that may not be the same across the entire enterprise. Just that one data product.

nkc469e,"I did this at my last job, reluctantly. I was forced to do it as part of an initiative to surface metrics and data transformations back to end-users, and one of the engineers refused to use production data to test the dashboards; it HAD to be a fully separate env, hooked up exactly to the app's staging env. The rest of the company already had a full pipeline but tied to prod.I thought it was a waste of time and money when I was forced to do it because the environment was fully read-only. And after I finally completed the project I thought the same thing. The only good purpose of the separate envs was that it made it a little easier to test security, but it wasn't like that was particularly difficult. It would have been probably just as much work to set up a way to mock production data in localhost, and overall way more useful for the company.So, we got it working ultimately (separate Airflow deployments and separate Snowflake accounts), but it was a pain in the ass. I had a somewhat informal way of managing Snowflake account level changes as migrations / IaC, and setting it up perfectly still took a while. (This also corresponded with a company wide push to formalize migrations of all db's into a new software.) Then the Airflow instance, oh boy. You don't realize just how many assumptions you make about envs until you have to formalize the ability to make an arbitrary multiple number of them. I thought I knew, but I didn't. Oh, also, your staging and prod data will be different in painful ways. Like imagine a JSON field stored as a varchar, but the staging env has some bullshit that's not a JSON. Yep, that's one of many things that happens when you try to run your prod data pipelines on the app's staging environment.Overall, not worth it. The setup I had originally is very simple: there's local and there's prod on a single Snowflake account. When you run commands locally, you hit a separate database for writes and transforms that are handled by the env vars. All reads are exactly from the prod data. All developers have full permissions in the local or dev or whatever you want to call them environments. There were also simple utils to help clone prod into dev for easy development.Moving to the multi env setup was not only months of my life neither me nor the company is getting back, but due to how MWAA works, it significantly increased the costs of the data platform.Shortly after I left, the engineer who wanted this colossal waste of time and money also left. Or maybe he was forced out. Cool.Honestly, at the point you're doing this sort of thing to support multi tenancy across genuine staging/prod envs, my advice is to scrap Airflow and Snowflake entirely. Go to something like Clickhouse and use materialized views to manage your pipelines so it's orchestration free.I also want to note another thing. Not a single internal data end user cared about this. This came from a single frontend app developer and was supported by upper mgmt because it sounds good on paper if you're a conventional SWE. Even though it's completely divorced from how internal data consumers use and contribute to data pipelines. What data scientists do is they train models and do analysis on prod data. They don't care about the developers' staging data because it doesn't represent or cover real usage. As you note in your post, this seems to be what they want to do, right? Except now you're finessing with data shares instead of just some simple IAM and permissions.Lastly, the place I left to, I setup their entire data infrastructure. I'm still on exactly ""local"" and ""prod"" in one Snowflake account, and I have no desire to ever change this. Actually, we do have a ""staging"" env for testing full CRUD being run against our OLAP db in the app's actual staging env. What it is, is: a clone of the prod db, cloned weekly, so that state is preserved within testing sessions but it also up to date with prod. Also, we do have a way to mock user sessions in our app's staging env. That works well enough! I will literally write javascript dashboards myself, or migrate to an entirely separate DB and delete our Airflow pipelines and switch to materialized views, before I spin up multiple envs to assist someone who won't put up with a minor inconvenience for them at the expense of multiple months of my own time.",riv3rtrip,2025-10-19 17:08:46,7,dataengineering,t3_1oajs0h,False,

We've been working on improving JSON in ClickHouse as well.We released our native type last year, and just recently did a big update (https://clickhouse.com/blog/json-data-type-gets-even-better). We originally designed it so that you could pick (or let CH pick) about 1000 paths to store as native columns, and then pack the rest into a shared part file. It worked really well, but as more people used it, we found that a lot of people have A LOT of JSON paths. Either huge objects, or just huge variance between objects, which results in tens of thousands of paths. At which point you have many thousands of paths being bundled into the shared parts, and losing much of the efficiency (i.e. trying to aggregate a field that is packed into shared parts was slower and used a lot of memory compared to a real col).We redesigned it so that we can essentially do hierarchical indexing of buckets of shared parts - the post above explains how it works in detail. We managed to get some pretty impressive gains - about 58x faster when querying paths in shared parts, and using 3300x less memory, when you have over 10k unique paths.It's a pretty interesting area to work on as not many OLAP DBS handle JSON very elegantly, typically you just flatten it which is pretty annoying and brittle.",sdairs_ch,2025-10-25 08:00:48,13,dataengineering,t3_1of1xxl,False,

nksyivu,"Having a clean ETL process that updates non-prod environments with appropriately tokenized/masked copies of production data on a recurring basis should be considered just as critical a piece of infrastructure as having proper CI/CD pipelines and automated test frameworks.It starts with identifying sensitive fields in production data. They should all already be identified and catalogued someplace, as part of a data security framework. If they're not, that's a problem in and of itself. You need to know where the PII actually exists, and ideally section it off into separate, higher-security datastores. Less sensitive datastores should only store identifiers to the records in the secure datastores that contain the actual PII. This step alone can dramatically simplify the process of keeping things secure, and can make it safer to allow production access for developers to debug issues. It's rare that a bug involves needing to know actual PII, even in production.Once you know which datastores/fields contain PII, you can set up automated ETL pipelines to mask or tokenize them during the process of being copied into non-prod environments.A good practice is to have (at least) two non-prod environments: development and QA/staging.

nkxk6br,"I've tried and seen a couple of approaches, usually starting with using open-source [Cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos) to orchestrate dbt Core projects so you can see each dbt model/seed/test as an Airflow task in the DAG for additional visibility and to see the dbt docs in the Airflow UI (side note: this feature will be back for Airflow 3.1 with Cosmos 1.11 that should come out next month).The next ""level"" is to use Asset (in Airflow 3.x) / Dataset (in Airflow 2.x) scheduling for cross-DAG dependencies. That way the Asset graph (exists in 2.x and 3.x but imho is much easier to navigate in 3.x) serves as a proxy-lineage graph. Side note tip if you need both, runs based on time and upstream DAG dependencies, there is a combined [AssetOrTimeSchedule](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-datasets#combined-asset-and-time-based-scheduling).From there, yes, some people implement custom solutions, often based on dependency information gathered from the Airflow API or use the OSS OpenLineage integration to get ""true"" lineage and then visualize it with Marquez. How well this works highly depends on the operators and hooks you use, if they already support lineage extraction (there is a [list of supported classes](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-openlineage/stable/supported_classes.html)) or if you need to add extractors to your own custom operators. Inlets and outlets (so Assets again) are also evaluated by this integration.If you want an out-of-the-box solution there are paid products like [Astro Observe](https://www.astronomer.io/product/observe) which is based on OpenLineage and reads in that information to create a lineage graph with additional fancy features like SLA definition, alerts, cross-deployment lineage etc. There is also a list of potential up and downstream impacts in case of failures. The upside is minimal setup needed and managed service support.Disclaimer: I work at Astronomer :) and a lot of the above was inspired by [this blog post](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/the-road-to-reliability-implementing-pipeline-observability) (and the webinar linked at the bottom of it) from our internal data team.

nkf5ltf,"My ideas on demos have changed over the years. Keep in mind that Agile and the demo they talk about was not designed for data engineering, so you need to adapt. Showing how a pipeline now runs 20% faster, or how you’ve improved data accuracy by 30% is dry as hell and demos terribly. What demos well is actual apps (or web apps) and clicking through them showing shiny features and pictures.In my latest project my team is creating a data pipeline and suite of reports for a new product. Our stakeholders are regulators, so we don’t get to talk to them. We have internal product people that interface with them. One thing we have done is create a crude diagram of each of the models we are building in the DAG. If it was created in the past sprint I color them one way so they stand out. I don’t go into depth on what they do, the point here is for upper management, product, and others to see “oh there’s more green boxes than 2 weeks ago”. Pictures demo better than words, and this shows progress. Obviously this works for greenfield work and wouldn’t work as well for other work.A challenge we have had is that we get different personas joining our demos. Sometimes they are upper management who think they are still technical and they want to get into details. Other times they are product people who are curious about how we interpreted a particular requirement. Other times it’s upstream teams asking things about a particular interaction. Honestly, any interaction is good interaction. However, I have been absolutely terrible at predicting which part of the demo will get the most traction. This is probably a function of how demos operate though. We roll with the punches and answer what we can.I usually have 1 or 2 people demo something we delivered. Usually it’s a particular table/model, but I push for something that is novel. People love novelty. If the report is “select everything from this table and aggregate” then it’s not a good candidate. We recently had a report that had the goal of showing the transaction record that crossed a certain cumulative sum threshold. That’s novel, and so that is what I pushed the team to demo. There ended up being a lot of conversation around that approach and the validity of the requirements. Good, we want conversation and interaction.I try to rotate different people demoing work they have done so everyone gets their time to shine. I make it clear that the goal is to a degree sales. Sell your work. Brag. Explain what you thought was interesting or challenging or whatever. People will engage with that.I also bring up specific challenges. This last sprint we spun out on a particularly ambiguous requirement. Attempting to nail down that requirement resulted in not delivering one of the items in the sprint goal. I made sure to relate those 2 things and called it out. It’s not just about painting a rose colored story, it’s also about showing we do more than just sling data left to right.Numbers also tend to register with people. An old manager of mine used to have a slide for git metrics. “this sprint we added 2311 lines of code and removed 5541”. It seemed a little corny to me at the time, but in reality it adds to the perception of “oh this team Got Stuff Done”On the topic of numbers, mentioning them can also make you sound like you know what you are doing. This can be more useful in non-greenfield areas. For example: “this table has 110 million records in it and grows at the rate of 5 million per month. Each daily run varies from 150k to 175k and runs for 20 minutes” if the goal of your project is to reduce cost then you tie it to that “…and with our new special sauce, we save $20k/yr”. If it is to run things faster you could say “and now we have partitioned it in a way that we have 10 parallel jobs that complete in 2 minutes”. Tie what you are doing to the goals of the sprint or project.Sorry if these ideas are a bit unorganized, hopefully these help you.",raginjason,2025-10-20 03:05:41,7,dataengineering,t3_1ob6d1n,False,

nkeugps,"Medallion architecture is an introduction to layering data, but you may find you have more 'layers' than the basic three it introduces.You can help keep data secure by making use of those layers to provide different kinds of access as you move from 'less well defined classification' to 'more well defined classification'.Your initial as-is landing area and bronze can be set up to be not-queryable by end users. Here you can have unclassified data, and potentially have it unmasked. The only access to these areas is either the automated system, or users with elevated privileges who are accessing it for the specific purpose of classifying data and setting up automation for ingestion and transform to later layers.You should track the classification for each column to determine what kind of data it has. Is it personal data? Is it PII? Is it generic contact style PII (name, email, phone) or sensitive identity-theft-enabling PII like external identifiers or private information (license number, tax number, birth details, passport, etc). Those classifications help you to understand the security policy you place on the column.With a lakehouse you have the option to also separate the data in the storage layer. You can have separate buckets for pii or sensitive data, so that you can specifically track and audit access to the buckets, and a leak of any kind on the general data bucket does not leak sensitive data.You will need some kind of query portal that enforces column-level security for you. Something like SageMaker, for example. You will need to set up rules for automatically hiding/masking tables/columns that people cannot access. You need to make sure people don't have an alternative for accessing the data.There are tools you could point at your bronze data to scan for sensitive data. They won't be perfect but they're a good start. I believe AWS comprehend can do it, but there's a variety of 3rd party tools you can run.---The main point is your early areas are kept inaccessible to users, so that you can hold the data in an unclassified manner that allows you to do ingestion and classification work on it. Users can only access data through a system that enforces security and access controls on queries, and you only add data that has gone through that classificatio process.",azirale,2025-10-20 01:52:34,2,dataengineering,t3_1oagoef,False,

Deliver the final product all at once. So in this method, building in certain features first might be more efficient to get to the final deadline. Agile is faster, more flexible, and some variation of it is the new modern standard. Waterfall is good for building something with core features that are extremely well defined. Of course, there's the other option that they are just building what they want to build whether it is needed or not. With data scientists, you can't rule that out.

To them, Agile is following a poor practice of finding something 80% correct with the end goal of getting something better in the next round. Plus, if they are building a gradient boosting regression with specific variables now, the 90% correct version may require completely different variables with a Random Forest Regression. In other words, a complete rebuild. Data engineers can add features much more organically. I'm not saying that the Data Scientists are right. There is a very good reason while Agile has dominated tech, and there is a reason Data Science projects never get anywhere. Understand where they are coming from, but ultimately, you're more likely than them to be following best practice.",BoringGuy0108,2025-10-24 00:25:33,5,dataengineering,t3_1oeh29i,False,

nl8km9l,"I guess it depends on what you mean by features. If you mean selecting what variables go I to a model, yeah, you figure that out first. Typically data scientists work in a sandbox environment when they model. If you’re talking delivery, then I assume you are building data pipelines? They need to figure out what model works before they can tell you what data they need and how they need it. It’s a lot of exploratory work. When I worked on an agile data science team, we just wanted access to copies of raw prod data from different sources while we figured out approximately what worked. (Honestly, even if it would work.) Training can involve significant amounts of data. If it was something large and complex, like a simulation, this might take weeks. At review we usually had draft models to talk through with business and often changed or added data as a result. We didn’t get involved with engineering until we had a good idea of what data we needed and how we needed it first (and where we were putting it). If business needed something faster for a particular reason, we’d just refreshed our working draft. (They usually had access.) “Productionizing” something like that as we worked would have been wildly expensive and time consuming. We had conflict with one of the engineering teams at one point because they thought it was inappropriate to give us access to data until we could tell them exactly what we need. Then they would decide how to model it, spend time modeling for us, and it wouldn’t be modeled in a way that worked, the back and forth arguments took forever. (No, six months of data isn’t enough. No, the most recent value replacing the old value doesn’t suffice. Actually, we needed those variables you deleted, etc.) It was a nightmare. They considered us “non-technical” as just told us we didn’t understand best practices. No idea if this applies to you. Hopefully not. But you might ask them their reasoning. Data science is not a software dev discipline and follows a different life cycle than the standard SDLC. I have seen multiple issues with tech people over my career who could not wrap their heads around this.

Again, this comforts the auditors.Code quality tools such as SonarQube, Sonarlint are useful. In JetBrains PyCharm there us a ""Problems"" tab that provides code improvement suggestions.

(Wouldn't be right for me to go into too much detail.) We worked with many of the leading Pharma. The goal was to help the companies collect regular data feeds and ELT them into a data warehouse, usually Snowflake or Redshift. We used our own PaaS orch platform based on K8s. the main observability tool then was New Relic -- an OTel adopter. (What we did when I was there was basic. DataKitchen now sell an observability tool of their own -- haven't used it but it looks cool). We used NR to monitor data file arrival, data loading job execution, and platform and/or K8s errors coming out of our airflow-like orch tool -- including sql errors. NR captured user who created the job, what the job was for, how much data the job moved, and did every step in the process complete in \~expected time, history of the job over time. We also used NR for basic log aggregation and had alerts for specific conditions observed in log output. We didn't use traces. We wanted that for the steps in the jobs, but didn't have time to implement while I was there. The DevOps team used more sysOps sampling metrics to know how the pods were performing and the health of the underlying nodes and storage.Kind of similarly, I'm currently leading a project to build a data file feed ingestion tool called CsvPath Framework. We support Otel and OpenLineage for observability. the framework doesn't do any sysOps metrics. and it doesn't natively ship its own logs -- you would have to do that, same as for any system you're hosting. What it does is fire data processing events for arriving files registered, validation scripts loaded, runs started/ended, steps within runs started/ended, and validation errors. I.e. we're just focused on the data. CsvPath is kind of like [Soda.io](http://Soda.io) for databases, but totally focused on preboarding flat-file feeds with a lot more opinionatedness about how to do it right. if we didn't have Otel (and OpenLineage) we'd have to roll our own way of doing monitoring and alerting. that would not have been practical.Hope that helps. if it's not off-target happy to say more.",ProfessionalDirt3154,2025-10-21 19:30:56,1,dataengineering,t1_nkm2nzp,False,

You should be using sth like dbt/bruin for that so that you have a maintainable framework to build these SQL pipelines. * If you need to ""activate"" this data by pushing the data into some other systems/reports, you then build that part of the ETL in Python or any other language you are familiar with. * If you need to orchestrate these, you use something like airflow/dagster/prefect/bruin to make sure the steps run at the right time in the right order.A significant chunk of the work here is exploration, as you can tell.

Put tenantid first in ORDER BY and partition by month (toYYYYMM(ts)) for fast pruning and easy drop/backfill per tenant-month. For custom fields, store a Map for long tail, but promote high-usage keys into real columns; add bloom filter indexes on common filters and a soft\_delete flag with TTL DELETE to keep storage sane.

nlbnniw,"Thank you! Looking briefly at this post, it does seem to touch on what I’m asking. The post calls it a “monster query”, which is accurate. A composite metric fact table is just that - rather than a period snapshot, or transactional fact (or other) it’s literally taking data (facts) from many adjacent places and smashing them together - in my case to create “supply vs. demand” - adjacent facts include production actuals, production schedules, inventory (on hand, consignment, with vendor, in transient, etc), stock received from 3rd parties, projected sales, actual sales, goods issued, etc. There is like >17 datasets that comprise the formula for “supply vs. demand”, and each data set is multiple ETL jobs / facts broken out by different companies / regions of the world (in a large multinational). Hence, you can see my concern about potential challenges about different points of time due to unexpected failed or delayed ETL jobs, and ensuring to write an artifact to the fact for data quality purposes. I don’t need to expose this to my end uses (who are restricted to views on top of my table) but I would put in in the physical table for quality/explainability. Also, I’m only concerned with the explainability part now (best practice design). Obviously, the more important part is the proactive portion of who you programmatically ensure all combined data is from the same point of time. For example, you can break the metric up into regions of the world (NA, EMEA, APAC) to ensure it’s computed relevant to their time zones, you can adjust your “subqueries” to enforce timeboxes, or time travel / time restrictions to ensure they are all consistent, or you might do some sort of staging tables that can be “frozen” (for example frequent loading upstream but frozen into daily buckets, etc.). I’m sure there are a few good options.Again, I’m starting with “hey they this is very complicated since ETL doesn’t always work as intended and error free” so how do I assure quality given the many challenges. Thanks again - it’s is a great link, very helpful and exactly what i was asking for.Edit: the blog post called out something I forgot to mention that’s pretty critical. The subsets of data are all aggregated, so what’s included/missing from the aggregation is very important. For example, if we are calculating MetricValue = Inventory on hand [region | material | day] - goods issue [region | material | day ] + projected sales [ region | material | calendar day] —> and each of these are very volatile. The different businesses in different regions of the world will change their sales forecasts through out the day (especially as we near quarter/year end, or other business target dates), inventory changes drastically, and goods issue (reduction of inventory) is very dynamic. So, if I’m after a daily level, as in what’s my EMEA inventory for material 111 on 10/23/25, this value could be very different if my subquery executes at 1am vs. 4am vs. 7am. Where as in a transactional fact table, i would simply be adding rows (ie: additional sales invoices to a sales fact table) and the differences are easily understood - I’m summarizing inventory per day, so the differences in values due to timing are a mystery. I like that the blog post is pointing this out as a challenge in the “monster query” which aggregates results into a “common grain” (which is exactly what I’m doing here).",rotr0102,2025-10-25 15:27:12,2,dataengineering,t1_nl9swgv,True,

Also worth noting, all the way back then, the game was very simple and didn’t have that much content, it wouldn’t have been that hard to rewrite. It was still in beta, with the really old terrain generation and even basic features like sprinting and the hunger bar hadn’t been added yet.

FWIW, iPhone (1) didn't come out until 2007. And probably the earliest recognizable Android phone, the Motorola Droid, didn't release until 2009. Notch launched Minecraft Java Edition in 2009 but it didn't gain traction until 2010. By then, J2ME was almost a decade old, designed for FAR MORE PRIMITIVE CPUs, and no understanding of GPUs.

But one of the reasons is due to all the different ports to different platforms, the codebase became fragmented. There's a Pocket Edition, there's a Windows 10 Edition, and there are the various console editions. Maintainence and bug tracking was eating up a ton of time. And Java... is a big long in the tooth. And having to pay Oracle (which bought out Sun Micro, and thus, own Java) for a license is probably not in Microsoft's long-term plans.

One part of that C++ code has a method that needs to be called in a thread-safe way at certain times in the runtime lifecycle.

I would really, really strongly recommend reading through a Spring tutorial before even attempting to debug any Java code that uses it. That would answer all of the questions you have here.> I can't find a CallAction constructor call anywhere, so I don't know where MyServiceClient is coming from.By the way, one of the really important concepts here is: you shouldn't care. The `@Autowired` annotation on something means that dependency is being injected by the framework, and it could come from anywhere. All you know is that you're getting an object that implements the `MyServiceClient` interface. It could have been made by half a dozen different implementations of that interface, or it could even be a mock object created in a unit test. You treat all of them the same way and don't care where they were constructed.If you think there's something wrong with the way the object is being constructed, looking in the code that is having it injected is the wrong way to inspect it.

If it was that good, every other language would be copying the patterns. Instead, what we see is Java trying to copy other languages while maintaining backwards compatibility, which naturally makes the language harder than needed. See the ""wonders"" of how string interpolation is stuck with a kind of nasty format, because all the more reasonable ones were used in other libraries first, and they didn't want to break backwards compatibility. See the streaming api, less comfortable than the equivalent in every language with monadic collection operations. The Option class that has no nullability guarantees, so it's not reliable, And since 95% of all Java for services is written in Spring, the annotation salad is what we've got.So yeah, your best bet is to cope via heavy IDEs that do all the work and will track usages, including knowing the autowiring logic.",hibikir_40k,2025-10-24 14:31:27,26,learnprogramming,t3_1oey2jw,False,

nl5ibtn,"I think that code readability has a lot to do with one's experience with the particular paradigm being used, as well as one's understanding of the abstractions and the underlying platform.Sorry for the essay - hope it makes sense for someone out there :)I teach intro-level Java-Programming as well as Spring programming, and it is interesting to see how different students grow into the different paradigms at wildly different paces.Understanding **imperative code is easy for everyone**, first line does something, then second line does something else, then the third line does another thing. The hardest part is learning that when you write `int weeks = days / 7;` on line 14, and then change the number of `days` on line 20, the value of `weeks` doesn't change along with it. But you get used to it, and learn to read code.Then comes **procedural** code, with loops and functions/methods (we ignore the objects at first), and it gets a bit harder to understand that the loop does the same thing over and over, but with the values changing - so now changing a value on line 20 **DOES** impact the calculation on line 14, if they are inside the same loop. Or a function behaves differently from time to time, because it depends on a global variable, whose value might have changed since the last call ...Then you move into **object oriented** code, where objects ask each other to do stuff - but it still mostly reads like procedural code, where a single thread of execution goes through methods living in different objects - you get used to having to jump around in different files, but most of the time you can still follow along. The hardest part is knowing when the objects are instantiated, and who ""owns"" the reference to them - but other than that you begin to abstract away the actual program flow, unless you really need it.But you begin using frameworks, and suddenly you don't see all the code - you have objects that extend existing objects, who then call methods in your object. You don't know exactly when or why your own methods are called, you just get CVS-receipt-length style stack-dumps when something fails, and you sit ""outside"" the code, looking in, trying to understand what might be happening around your own code - mostly you are guessing or using information from other people also guessing.It becomes very hard to follow, even for experienced programmersAnd then you move to Spring, which is **aspect oriented** programming, where you don't even write, nor see all the code, but only add annotations and interfaces, and then some magic entity behind the curtain reads your code, and changes it! Sometimes before compiling, sometimes after! And you have no idea how your code is being used, who uses it, what for, or when. You just hand code to the monster, and it does something - now it is literally impossible to follow what is going on, and you need to know what the platform does, what the framework does, how it uses your classes and methods, and why it uses them in the way it does ... And you either have to read through 35 years of accumulated specifications, or watch days of indian youtubers explain it, still somewhat on the surface-level ...So to answer your question, **yes**! Modern Java is actually very hard to read - and Spring is outright impossible to understand if you don't know a whole lot about it beforehand!",peterlinddk,2025-10-24 15:34:10,5,learnprogramming,t3_1oey2jw,False,

You're probably ahead of me in skill and prospects. **Work on skills related to finding a job:**Set a block of time, every day after work, for applying and upskilling. No exceptions, even if it's as little as 30min for one and 30min for the other. Every time you feel like you're not skilled enough (which may be true), remember that people less skilled than us ARE getting jobs.Figure out why. Are they applying in novel ways? Do they have really good interviewing skills? Are they personable? Did they do x, y, and z? Improve yourself based on your findings. There are A LOT of unique ways to get hired while being less skilled. At the very least, you can improve your interviewing skills by failing at them and learning what to learn. Don't be afraid to look for more technical, but still retail-adjacent/low-level roles as a start. Don't allow yourself to settle for this either - keep searching and improving your process. I'd also try doing Neetcode 150 as well. Spend 15-30minutes failing on one question, watch the solution to the video, and then learn why the solution works (you can use AI as a mentor, not a solution solver). Rinse-repeat. Don't worry about ""not knowing the answers."" Even experienced developers struggle on optimizing Easy's.So, 30 minutes of self-study, 30min of applying (even ""knowing"" you'll fail), and a bit of LC-style learning when you're bored. .**Work on your technical skills:**There are just as many paths forward in this as there is on the above. My advice as a beginner? Figure out what domains you liked during your studies, research what it takes to get into them, and then follow an online roadmap learning those resources. Don't have a preferred domain?Then either read some books related to learning how to program, ones that are heavy on coding along and building things, follow a bootcamp, or go straight into ""github project-based learning"" repo and start building with your preferred languages. Focus on your preferred languages and up your skills.I recommend that path the most.At the end of the day, school primed us to be very good at intaking new information and thinking like a computer, so now you have to learn how to be a craftsmen, building new projects and applying your theory. Too overwhelming? The Odin Project is a free online boot camp that will essentially take you from 0 to the very minimum skills of a junior full-stack developer. You'll learn how to research, use version control, and build projects. This will solidify your programming foundation, especially if you go a layer or two deep when using the additional resources/reading books.Don't forget to keep applying. When you're done with Foundations, you're not going to be ""cracked out junior"" level, but you'll be ""meh, *maybe* I can teach him the rest"" level. If you haven't been applying due to being an imposter, you want a job or what? At least start at this point. The more you improve at learning to program, the workflow for it, the rigor it takes, etc, the better you can pivot to other domains of programming. This is just one method of trying to open that door.You are free to learn whatever else (project-based building in your preferred domain, reading books about programming, following tutorials on building a game, etc) as long as you complete that block of time for applications (or learning novel ways of getting a job) and dedicated self-study (this example being The Odin Project).It's important to have fun during it all and not try to speed run yourself into burnout.

It sounds flashy on paper with hacking and 0-days, but in practice it's about managing risks, audits, and doing lots of trainings for Rachel from accounting and writing stern memos for Herbert down in the archives to not write passwords on a postit. I've come into that via formal certifications we had to do to get projects in certain industries and I'm in contact with the legal department of a client for risk management there.- AI is buzz. There's money there, but you have to be able to suppress any remnant of morality to get that money by promising the sky and unicorns. The actual tech is cool and fascinating but can do a lot less than what sales people promise and unless you can get into one of the big players, you'll be eternally chasing their work. We do get project requests related to that and at least half of them ask for applied magic.- Databases is steady and boring and a bit frustrating. 99% of what people need from databases can be taught in a simple SQL course, the rest comes up if you either need to scale a high performance setup for 100000 users or when the new manager Timmey suggests we move all our data into a MongoDB on his notebook because he can scale with kubernetes or something like that. As I said, my formal background, and the MongoDB example is only half exaggerated.- Avoid Web. It's been the lowest common denominator in coding for decades.

Pretty much all machinery out there runs software somewhere, but it's not talked about a lot.- graphics programming is also surprisingly large. Medical imaging, HUDs and sensors for vehicles, big data visualisation etc are all non-trivial, and the algorithmic side overlaps with the nitty gritty details of running AI.- robotics is cool, but not a lot of jobs in my city.- signal processing is an absolute rabbit hole.

Similarly, other cybersecurity categories will likely include theory, encryption, encryption algorithms, and more, but there's a good chance they won't include what everyone expects—hacking or active intrusion prevention. Web can also encompass anything, perhaps focusing more on network administration or web application development (more or less latest technologies, languages).

Of course, it's also important what you're interested in, what you've done, and what you felt good about.

Same for OS design and for parsers/compilers (the purple dragon book is still likely going to be the book you read for compilers and that was written 40 years ago).What you want to do at your stage is to continue passing your math and engineering classes because those are extremely important if you want to do anything with CS that doesn't involve basic software engineering.

Go through your course catalog and look at the electives for your major. THOSE are going to lead to high-level, interesting stuff that *does* require a college education. For example, machine learning as a college junior or senior is severely more intensive than what you're going to experience through online tutorials aimed at people who don't have a CS background.The important thing is that a lot of interesting stuff that you can learn as a CS major *isn't necessarily CS.* If you want to learn about simulation, you might end up looking at stuff for civil engineers (and realize that you need to take more physics).

Unless it is part of a documentation then stop using tutorials. Learn to read documentation. You should learn how and where to find an information from. And how to verify that it is true. Do not aim for the speed but aim for an understanding and quality of your code/project. Trial and error is acceptable. But learn from your errors to avoid making similar mistakes later on. It all will contribute into your learning journey.Come up with project ideas that have no tutorial for. For example ""Create a system where you are using WIFI signal to detect when somebody is in your home."" How? Which devices? Which approach? I leave it for you to figure it out. Such difficult projects make you look for alternative ways for solving your problems. May it be breaking down the project into smaller parts and implementing these smaller parts one by one. May it be reading different documentation and scientific research papers. Or something else.Stop trying to memorize your code. Try to understand the business logic of your code. Where which part does what? Imagine having to explain your project to your grandmother. She won't know what is an encapsulation, what is a compilation error, what is a nullpointer exception, what is a dependency injection, etc. But she might be able to understand when you are telling that ""This part here turns this photo into a text"", ""This part here sends out an email."" and stuff like this. Photo, text, email - these are words that a normal non-IT person can also understand. Start watching podcasts and other tech talks. There different software developers and system architects and such are discussing topics. Can be that the topic is way over your head but you will still hear about new concepts that you can later on look up in the Internet.Learn to teach and guide others.

I could list a bunch of stuff I believe are important to know, but more than likely, miss quite a few in the process.A more broad answer is that the fact that you are aware of gaps in your knowledge is a great place to start! If you find yourself unaware of why an implementation is done the way it is - investigate it! Many of the frameworks you're using are likely Open Source, and likely developed in the open, with open issues, RFCs, etc. that describe exactly the sort of information you're missing.Now I don't know your skill level, so I don't know if you are well adept in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP, etc. But I would add that you should know what the frameworks you're using are doing for you. If it is a frontend UI framework - your first question should be ""Why am I using this?"", ""What problem is this framework solving for me?"" If your answer is ""because this guide tells me to"", then that's an issue.Understanding basic design patterns is also something I consider to be quite important. Sadly I think many traditional methods of showcasing these patterns are quite poor in terms of teaching the way one can internalize the patterns and use them - even if programming in a different language than the one being used to show examples in, and even if the implementation details differ to the way the patterns are shown.So, to summarize, my take is that the fact you're asking questions is half the way to progressing, now you just need to look for the answers. Mastering all of this is a craft, and it is ever evolving. But if you want to look past the frameworks as ""the stuff you learn"" and get to ""I use them to solve specific problems"", you need to be painfully aware of exactly what those problems are. This is also the only way you will ever gain a proper understanding of when to switch to a different framework. Remember this industry moves fast, most of the frameworks in use now either didn't exist or were quite new 10 years ago, and going back 10 more year will yield the same result.

But you should be committing and pushing often, and you don't want to push something incomplete into master.A minor change having a dozen pushes is perfectly fine. But if you always plush to master, and you've done work since you realized that feature you added broke something, removing it without removing the in between work is a pain. It's also harder to go back and figure it out.We branch from master when we start on a new major update. These usually are usually a very big deal - features being added. We don't merge a major into master until we end support - master holds the oldest version we support.When we patch, we branch off the major branch into a patch branch. So most of the time there will be master, major, and patch. There can be two major branches, though it's not common. When we release a patch we merge it into the major, so that doesn't get cluttered.When a developer starts working in something, they branch from, usually, the patch branch. When they're happy they submit a pull request so someone else can review it, then merge once approved.This makes it very easy to keep things organized. If you need to pause work on one incomplete task, you can just swich branches, do what you need to, switch back and, if needed, rebase to bring in the thing you stopped to work on.And commit often.

nkub29h,"I mean the first little while is just a lot of nailing down requirements.

nkufb3l,"Not building Apps, but PC programs and Web-apps. Mostly small scale and/or personal projects right now, but I have experience with medium sized project (50 devs, over 1k active users, < tens of millions of datapoints)There is not one perfect order. This is the first decision you will have to make: Where do you start, and what project style do you go with.Since I am currently building a one man project, I can give you the order of operations as I did it:1. Rough outline: What is my project? Why would people care? What problem does it solve? What solutions are already available? Who are the potential users?2. Feature list: Itemized list of all features it should have. For each Feature I wrote down for whom it is useful, and what I need to to technically to get it to work. (Networking, database, things like that)3. Feature details: I then added something similar to user stories to my features: Basically, short descriptions of how a user would interact with it, and what they would expect to happen/see. On my whiteboard, I then drew a lot of boxes, denoting my features, and connected them with arrows: ""Feature A needs Feature B"", or ""Feature C leads to Feature D""4. I took everything I've built up to this point, and made UI mockups. First ""wireframes"" with a pen and paper, to roughly block out what could go where. then I made a single page in detail, to decide on a style for my UI. With those two in hand I went to some potential users, and used them to ""test"" my idea. I put the papers in front of them and asked them to perform a task (and I ended each test session by letting them choose a few tasks themselves) This resulted in me changing quite a few of my designs and intended workflows. It is good to catch errors as early and cheaply as possible. Changing the blockout version of a site costs a few hours in drawing, changing a coded version would take days or weeks.5. Then I sat down with my new UI and double checked, that all planned features are present, and that all parts of the UI are part of a planned feature. If not, I adjusted either side until I was happy. Then I used my feature List to plan my tech stack (yes, I did it this late in the game) Now I knew everything I wanted my (web)app to do and what it needed to do. So I chose rust(leptos) frontend, rust(axum) backend and postgresQL as my database. (shocker)6. With my new tech stack in hand, I made some rough diagrams of the architecture of the front and backend, something like a UML diagram, but much less formal. (because I am alone, as long as I can guarantee that I understand it, it's fine, and I have been using the same ""almost-UML"" since year 2 of university) I also mapped out the DB, but in excruciating detail, every nullable field, every relationship. Then I double checked again, that every feature, both in the UI and my docs, is present in my database.7. Then I started implementing a vertical slice: Meaning a single feature, from the DB to the UI, ""fully"" functional. I took this to even more testers, got feedback and did a final round of adjustments to my UI style plan.8. This is where I am now: I am currently implementing version 1 of my app, in it's entirety. This will be interrupted by testing with real users from time to time, but I am hoping that no major issues will come up, and I am confident that my architecture is strong enough to support refactoring most features.This is not ""the best"" way. But I was bitten by agile too often in the past, so for my free time, I wanted something a little more waterfally. I am certainly not moving as fast as I could, and if I was dependent on external funding, this might not be a path I could afford; but since it's only my spare time, I chose to take the time and try to get it right the first time. If I get it 75% right, I will be more than happy.EDIT: I forgot Step 0: I actually built a prototype. The UI was shit, and I only had 10% of my final featureset, but I wanted to see if the ""demand"" was there. It is. The UI was built sloppily over a few weeks with no plan, and was very unmaintainable.

nkxmvz8,"> I realized I should have built some of these other areas first because now I was back-tracking and making corrections to code I've already written when I wouldn't have to do that if I had just built everything in the right stacking order.Maybe. Maybe not. You should expect to have to rewrite parts of your code as you discover errors in previous assumptions, find better ways to do things, find that your requirements change, or whatever else comes along. That's why you try to have strong separation of concerns and loose coupling between well defined functions (and architectural layers) that can be swapped out at a later dateI would generally advise writing an end-to-end solution as early as possible, including installing your app on an iPhone/iPad to prove that it works in the wild.A good starting point for an architecture is to separate your app into 3 separate layers: data, business logic, and presentation logic. The data and business logic would be in the 'M' (model) of an MVC architecture, while the presentation logic would be in the 'V' (view).Try to think about how easy it would be to swap the components within one of those layers for other components with minimal impact on the rest of the app. The fewer changes you have to make to interfaces between layers, the more decoupled they are.> Can someone please breakdown their typical workflow, do you start with back-end? ground level framework stuff, and then work your way up to re-usable shared features that can nest into full components later?If you imagine your architectural layers as being stacked one on top of the other, with the data layer at the bottom and the presentation at the top, then my approach is to design the architecture from the top down, then again from the bottom up, then finally once more from the top down.I start from the top because that's where the user lives, and it's the user experience that will drive the app. There's always a bit of tension between the the best implementation for the UI and the best implementation for the data, and that tension has to be resolved somewhere in the middle (e.g. at the API); so once you've established your data models from the perspective of the user, it helps to look at the system again from the perspective of the models, make sure you've established the best way store and query those models, then see how your UI will interact with those models. With your new understanding of how the data will be modelled, you might find a better design for the UI, or at least refine how your UI interacts with the models.",marrsd,2025-10-23 10:37:25,1,learnprogramming,t3_1odj3hg,False,

If you're already at a school, shouldn't you just do what your teachers recommend? Specific tech stacks don't matter at all, you're getting a degree to learn how to think, not how to use languages.Data structures and algorithms are often taught in pseudocode because the principle mattes, not the implementation. Sometimes metaphors are used like lightbulbs or searching a phonebook, etc. Nevertheless, the C language is often used for more practical examples because it is barebones. There's not much high-level fluff and it feels closer to the actual memory implementation, which sometimes makes it feel more relevant to learn about sorting algorithms when working directly with raw arrays. A language like Python works just the same, but the ecosystem around it will throw high-level standard libs in your face, which already take care of all data structure and algorithms for you, so it feels more pointless than a lower level language.I've never heard that C++ or Java would be preferred for learning DSA, why would they? C++ is like C, just with classes and more high-level features, which aren't applicable when learning about the fundamentals. Java is a memory-managed high-level language similar to C#, therefore still in the root vein of C, but with many more features, all which are irrelevant for DSA.Use whatever your teachers/mentors know best to reduce the friction of setting up any environments or getting stuck on syntax features.

It’s also useful to get comfortable with Git/GitHub early; version control is super important even for small projects. Once you’re comfortable, branch out.

There are a lot of alternatives, and you probably should use many of them at least for one project, until you feel you've found something you like.

I say in your area because it does drastically change depending on when you live! JavaScript is often miserable for employment, especially if you are BE only.\- If your goal is to learn some stuff, I would stay with JS/Express. You are already familiar with JS, so you can learn the server-side concepts more easily without having to relearn the language. But learning comes in any shape, so it would also be perfectly fine to switch to a different language if you want to.\- If your goal is to become a full-stack dev with a decent developer experience, definitely stay in the JS ecosystem. This way you will be able to leverage both the fe and the be to a very high degree while writing the same code, reusing types, etc. With time, you will probably move to Next or some other full stack framework instead of express.Notice that I answered your question regarding JavaScript in general.

nkqqlvu,"It’s always a good idea to include some documentation with your personal projects. I usually have 2 or 3 .txt to track everything. For me it starts with my planning and it follows through what I’m doing as I work, so if I get pulled away to something else or pick up a project again after a while I have detailed note on what I was doing and (maybe more importantly) what I want to do. notes.txt: this file is just for my revision and work, I don’t share it with anyone. 1) Concept. I start by explaining the idea of what I want to do and what I might need to make it. Brief 4-5 lines as an intro to the project2) Aims and Objectives. Here I detail exactly what I want and what it needs to be a success. This help keep things on track and prevent scope creep as I can always focus on what I really need and the real objectives in the background. 3) Plan. First through rundown of how I think I’ll build it. You don’t need to be exact on every detail but figure out what you’re going to need. Login section, landing page, diff options, processing input for ‘x’ or ‘y’ and how it’s done/what the out put should be. 4) Components. List out the big bits you need to do. Parts that need to be put together with key functions and features. It’s to track that plan you did earlier and figure out what needs to be done at a glance. 5) Variables Functions libraries and Header files. List out all the variable you’re using and why you use them, do the same for function. Very basic ones can just be named with type, you don’t need an explanation but if you won’t know at first glance what it does write it out. What are we importing from this library. Why did we make that header file and what’s in it/how does it work. Keep updating as you move along6) Working journal. This one might branch into a different file depending on the size of the project. Start the project, write out what you need to do first and what you’re planning to work on. I usually put the date in but that’s just for me to be able to look back over it. Every day I start by bringing unfinished tasks forward and writing out the next set of tasks I need to finish. Copy across what you’re doing and what’s not working and the final version when it is. Anything important or interesting I need to note for later goes in here. “Had to scrap an entire section and restart it”, throw that in here and explain why. At the end of the session I list out what I did today and what I need to do on the next session (cuts back 10-15 min of figuring out where to start when you sit down next time). 7) Closing Brief. I usually move this up after the objective section once I’m finished. How did the project go? Did you achieve your goals? What was difficult how did you get around it? What would you like to improve further? And finally are you happy with the finished product? 8) Lessons learned, at the end of the file, where did you go wrong and what do you know now about doing “x”, “y” or “z” for next time. .Read Me file:After the project I’ll make the read me file. 1) Update the Concept, Aims, Components and Brief so I have a concise document that anyone I share the project with will be able to understand what’s going on and why it’s built this way. 2) Features:Detail what the project takes in and what the intended out puts should be. If it’s an API detail the call and expected output if it’s a web app follow a trace of how the user progresses through the app. Think of it as a guide on how someone else should use the application. 3) Components:List out the key functions and methods, how they work and how you’ve used them. No need for major details just let people know why it’s important and what you were thinking with it. 4) Closing Statement:Detail what you achieved in making this application. What needs more work and whether you intend to come back and work on anything else. .It’s a good habit to start tracking your projects as you go along even just for your own notes. When you look back at this in 6 months or 2 years are you going to know what you were thinking on April 3rd when you need to fix/plan around a similar issue in the future. The notes.txt file is just for me and I usually put it in the gitignore. It’s helped out in interviews when I was asked to walk through some of my work I’ll pull up my notes file and can quickly find key details on what I was doing and how I did it. I’ve shared my screen to show some of the details or pulled up A specific part of my journal where I figured out a problem. Really helps to have actual example of what you did and how you processed the problem before finding the solution. You can also then say “Well I know about this library now that fixes this for me but I could build it myself again if I needed to”. Very small concept projects or feature test I don’t do this out. It’s only for projects I might show people or a 10 min glance wouldn’t explain what’s going on.

Make the repo(s) public (watch for secrets and personal data etc.).If you have a website too I might visit it, but 95% chance I won't. 1% chance I look at any of the code in the repos. We just don't have time for that, generally. I'll just look at the repo README to see what it is, then move on. With this in mind, it's a good idea to spend a bit of time on the README, telling me the details I need to know ""above the fold"" (without having to scroll down) like what the project is/does, where it runs, key technologies used etc. In a few formatted sentences or bullet points. I will never ever ever pull+build+run your projects. Again, I've got tens more candidates to screen, so anything you can do to dial back the bullshit, not add to it, is great. (E.g. I once passed on a candidate that had an obnoxious loading message on his website whilst his unnecessarily large front end bundle loaded and hydrated taking seconds to do all these fancy JS things. The exact opposite of impressive.)You don't need to deploy things, but if there's a convenient link in the README I will probably click it just to see what you built. I won't run through the features or anything unless it's a button push.Saved on your computer is only useful if you're screen sharing for a demo or something, like in an interview. Maybe have a local copy checked out and built in case you get the opportunity to demo or something. I would look positively on a candidate offering to show me a project we are discussing actually running, even if I didn't take them up on it.Doesn't matter for recruiters. Most of them are even less likely than us to look at projects in detail, they just pass these things along to client firms. Occasionally you get a recruiter that will click around but their feedback probably isn't very valuable in all honesty. They'll focus more on your CV itself and experience etc.In general don't worry too much. If we want to see you code we'll set a test (live, take-home etc.) as repo code could have come from anywhere and doesn't tell us much.

nknw7tp,"I think what you're being confused by is a special feature of unions in C++. When you declare a union starting with a simply typed field like an integer (or an enum, which is just integer values you that have certain names), or multiple such fields at the start of a union, C++ treats then as the ""Common Initial Sequence"" of the union. What that means is that the compiler assumes that all the struct union member types that follow, such as, say, SDL\_WindowEvent, SDL\_KeyboardEvent, and others -- that all of those structs themselves start with those fields/types. If your SDL\_Event event union is in a variable e, it lets you write e.type as a shorthand. What that actually means is ""no matter which member type (SDL\_WindowEvent, SDL\_KeyboardEvent, etc.) I'm currently interpreting my union variable as, I know it starts with an enum SDL\_EventType value (because I've arranged it so all the union struct types start with that field), so just interpret the first four bytes of this variable as the type.""I think (?) when you say 'shouldn't it be e.SDL\_EventType == SDL\_QUIT', what you mean is, 'when I access things from a union, I always have to specify which sub-type I'm thinking about the union as at that moment, so I expect to see e.SDL\_EventType or something like that, just like I would write e.SDL\_WindowEvent.whatever, and I shouldn't be able to access any field directly as e.type"". But you can because of this Common Initial Sequence convenience C++ gives you.On the other hand, if your question really is just about how enums work: An enum is just a way of telling the compiler that certain symbols stand for certain integer values. So when SDL defines the SDL\_EventType, one of the values in there is SDL\_QUIT, which is assigned some particular value (like 5 or whatever) by the enum. Your intuition is right that it's kind of more ""proper"" to refer to that value as something like SDL\_EventType.SDL\_QUIT (i.e., the SDL\_QUIT value as defined by the SDL\_EventType enum. But C/C++ let you just say SDL\_QUIT and it knows that by that you mean 5. It doesn't make sense to say e.SDL\_EventType because that's trying to refer to a field of e using a enum \*type\*.

That is, in the example above this union is actually only one of a `E`, `int`, or `char`. And you are responsible for accessing it through the field that represents its actual type.Accessing it through a member which doesn't correspond to its actual type is undefined behavior. **Except**, there is a special carve out in the rules that allows access through the wrong member if what you are accessing has a ""common initial sequence"" with the actual type.SDL uses this exception. The first member of the `SDL_Event` union is `UInt32 type;`, followed by a bunch of members of various struct types.Each of those structs must also begin with a `UInt32` so that they share the common initial sequence. This means that you can look at that first member, named `type`, to find out what the real type is so that the rest of the time you are accessing it through the proper member.",alanwj,2025-10-21 22:13:37,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ocmu53,False,

So when you write \`e.type == SDL\_QUIT\` you are checking the integer \`type\` field against one of the \`SDL\_EventType\` constants.

I'd imagine that you'd get somewhat angry, tellin them that isn't what drawing is about, that is just learning some basic shapes and strokes, and repeating them over and over again, following a pattern like a robot! No, if they want to learn drawing, they should start by watching the world around them, note how light and shadows move, make sketches, thousands of sketches, practice, imagine, dream and practice over and over, not trying to copy those ""hack artists!""Because that is what leetcode and the rest is - it isn't about programming, it is about knowing and memorizing patterns for solutions to specific problems.

And the only way of knowing, it to have been exposed to a large number of algorithms, and remembering (or being good at looking them up). Something an AI like ChatGPT is extremely good at - but still, it isn't really programming, just like drawing a ""remembered shape"" isn't really drawing.

nl30abu,"This is not a forever problem; this is the inevitable outcome of a field that was in a hiring bubble during the past decade & during covid and which is in the continued process of a correction. People are really starting to grasp the reality that CS is different now, and this realization will only get more apparent as time goes on. Since most high school students who enrolled in CS during the last several years did so for the money, it's pretty obvious that most incoming high school students who possibly would have done so before are now going to pick something else by and large. Hence, we will likely begin to see enrollment decrease year by year, not least because of the upcoming enrollment cliff. Of course, there will still be high achievers, along with low achievers who are too naive to understand that CS has fundamentally changed. But I think that the middle achievers will be largely hollowed out such that in the end, it will become crystal clear who is worth hiring and who isn't worth hiring; and thus, the problem of resumes looking identical will go away, because now the quality distribution for new grads will be more bimodal and less uniform.Also, even though I agree with you that offshoring is a real thing, the way you have characterized offshoring is kind of strange and seems to contradict your views on new grads. Talent didn't just suddenly 'grow' abroad; apart from recently incoming juniors with potential, any people who were talented would have been talented before and it's not like they magically became talented during Covid. On top of that, it's not like talent grows on trees, as you can't just train anyone at all to become talented since there are certain untrainable innate characteristics which make people talented such as high IQ, innovative creativity, visuo-spatial capabilities and so forth. If that weren't the case, then surely all of the new grads could be ""grown"" by domestic companies hiring in-house, just like offshore employees are being ""grown"" by satellite offices. But like you said yourself, the median talent of new grads has deteriorated significantly and by now, they can't even do easy-medium leetcode problems and are essentially unfit for this field, as you also said. So this goes against your other idea that people can be made fit for this field. And as an aside, let's not pretend that talent doesn't vary by location.

I like building things, but I really love learning things. The other perspective, is that the stuff you deride, KPIs, performance reviews, corporate culture, insanity of enterprise from the ground level, it's all worthy of gripes, but it goes a lot easier if you embrace your role and focus exclusively on what you can control.Idk, I'm sorry to hear you are realizing all of this at once.

You can't do that if you have trauma or depression or emotional dysregulation or are addicted to substances. Ironically, these are all things to which smart nerds who like sitting on a laptop all day are *very prone*.My career was more or less stagnant for the first ten years because I didn't understand or value myself well enough.

I would take the time to really understand what was needed and made sure to think of all the issues. Other SWEs would just implement what they were told to do and often there would be corner cases that were missed.I was and ""A player"" at these companies, but I know I am a slow coder at the end of the day.

I'm never going to wow anybody in an interview setting.Saying all that I assume I would be a B or even C player at a real tech company.

Surprisingly, Sr level interviews felt easy, but I would often get to the final round but never the offer.I could have given up but I was already 15 yrs in. I knew I was good at what I did, I still enjoy it, I just needed to refine my skills. I realized that I actually had a lot of gaps to fill (self-taught). Those gaps spanned anywhere from DSA to not having a command of what i was coding. So I slowly filled those gaps, eventually I gave a solid interview and was made an offer.My thing is, if I wasn't made an offer - maybe the other candidate did just a lil better. Maybe I shouldn't have hesitated on this answer, maybe I shoulda known that thing I shoulda known. I'm able to navigate through these interviews - but its just another candidate with theoretically a similar skillset, that gets to the offer. It's ME that needs to be better.

Don't let them flounder and meander if they obviously don't know, just move the conversation on. You only have a set amount of time to figure this person out.2. Let them show you what they do know and let them go into depth about it. If they have a project or past work experience this is a good place to start, ask them what they did, what decisions they made and if they might change those decisions in hindsight. 3. Have prepared questions. This doesn't mean a script but you need to be able to move the conversation on if it gets stuck. Hopefully your company has good enough practices the topics for your interview are defined, but if they aren't you should know what skills/tech/aptitudes are important for your job since ideally you have them.4. You aren't trying to trick them, too many interviewers do this where they will ask a misleading question to see if the candidate just takes the bait. The problem is candidates are nervous and will always be hesitant to disagree with the interviewer. Keep questions straightforward and open ended. 5. My most important advice especially if you are an early round interview, you aren't trying to find the number 1 candidate. You are trying to avoid the bottom 90 candidates.

It’s hard to explain but my advice, whatever it’s worth, is to keep your job and work your way up the economic ladder. Even if you went in as an officer, you’re losing 85-90% of your paycheck. If I were you, I would stay and keep working because the money you can and will make will provide the travel and fun experiences you desire. Sure they won’t be exactly the same as creating some relationships, however, not all relationships in the military are good. You will have corrupt seniors harm your promotions if you don’t play by their rules, you’ll go places and do jobs you absolutely hate doing. That’s why I say it’s better to be financially independent and choose what experiences you want rather than maybe experience them by chance. I never got the chance to go to Russia or Australia and those countries were the stuff of legends. But you can go there now where you’re already at. I feel like I keep saying the same thing differently, but I guess that’s my point. You don’t need to join the military to have experiences someone else got to have when you can make those experiences with the money and freedom you possess right now.

At other companies still, a Staff SWE serves as an architect role and is working across several dev teams providing technical leadership.

The big defense primes (Lockheed, RTX, NG) are actually huge proponents of agile and have teams dedicated to teaching others agile as well as pushing for certification for product owners and scrum masters (it depends on the org. These companies are huge with around 100k employees so it’s impossible to have widespread cultural changes quickly). Baked into the agile process is the decoupling from requirements driving code and moving towards user stories. By the book agile means that every user story has an acceptance criteria which resembles a unit test. This means teams (again, not everywhere but it is slowly propagating as a culture) perform test driven development where they inherently do red-green-refactor. Built in the development process, devs usually are presented a failing TDD/BDD style acceptance criteria to get started (red), they write just enough code to pass the test (green), and they (refactor) the code with the safety of the tests performing safe operations from Fowler’s refactoring book that may use GoF patterns. Some teams have a senior engineer or software architect that write user stories or tests that explicitly force software into a particular architecture or forces a design pattern in order to be implementable. So yes, we do refactor but it’s baked into the process. Code doesn’t break because it is common to have projects have a strict requirement for 80-100% test coverage. Unit testing is just one level. We have integration, system, and end-to-end tests with real hardware in a lab.

nkm50cz,">just so you can have easier life with maintainingYou're dismissing the value of refactoring... it's not so I can have an ""easier life"", although that can be a side effect. The goal of refactoring is to make the system easier to extend, update, and understand.When you have a brittle system, actual feature changes are significantly more likely to break production.When you have a difficult to extend system, seemingly simple feature changes can take months (or years!) to complete, costing the company tons of money and time.When you have a difficult to understand system, your employees because a single point of failure. When one person leaves the company, now you have to find their replacement or else the project timeline gets delayed by several more months. But when the system itself is cryptic and difficult to understand/modify, it takes significantly more time to onboard a new employee, easily resulting in a year+ of lost productivity. That high onboard cost can often get teams into a situation where *all* their developers leave, and now you have a fresh team of people that don't understand the codebase. This is how ""black boxes"" get created, by not refactoring combined with turnover.All this kinda plays into retention, which exacerbates everything. A complex, brittle, difficult to work with, system is *not* pleasant to work on. If management has no interest in letting the SWE's improve that system, then those SWE's won't be staying at that company for very long. High turnover introduces new developers, who are significantly more likely to break prod, while also having a very long and expensive onboarding process.So yeah, in critical areas, you *need* to refactor. The costs of not doing it aren't always immediate, but it's significantly more dangerous than not refactoring at all. Any halfway competent engineering manager will be going to bat for their SWE's to refactor against product and upper management. This is the balance of a healthy SWE team. Product is pushing for features, upper management is pushing for results/money, engineering management is pushing for a stable/maintainable/extendable codebase. If either of those 3 prongs get an inordinate say, you're on a toxic team.That said, there are very well defined approaches to refactoring a legacy codebase. Writing a massive PR with +10000/-12000 isn't the way to do it. That's a high risk PR whether it's a refactor or a new feature.

Focus on using the framework and libraries that the industry commonly uses first, you want those names on your resume and cover letter. >but I feel like machine learning is too competitive now I am not really a top programmer material The entire industry is competitive as hell, ML, like all CS, has roles for top talent hat make the **REALLY** big money, and roles for regular developers who are still learning or just want a stable job. When you look on social media, or listen to others, you're only hearing about the top developers, you don't hear about Jim who spends his days doing the grunt work that allows the top developers to have the time to do what they do. You don't need to be genius to be a great developer, you just need to build and listen/learn from your colleagues every step of the way. And maybe in 10-15 years you'll be a top developer, or maybe you'll prefer work life balance and just be a regular developer like the vast majority of us are. >What are some directions I should chase? https://roadmap.sh/machine-learningLearn from those who came before and follow their path, or make your own path, but you'll have to learn the same basic things so following other people's paths is generally more efficient.Also, as someone else mentioned, you will almost certainly need to learn leetcode questions. Don't panic they're easier than most people think. The easy level questions shoudln't be too hard, go through 20-30 of them to see what sorts of questions you'll be asked. But before moving to medium or hard, first learn DS/A. Data Structures and Algorithms is what Leetcode is there to test (not entirely, but basically). Most jobs will almost never need it, but really complex problems solved at scale (think Google Map's directions handling hundreds of millions of requests a minute) do, so Google started using these questions to test their recruits and the rest of the industry couldn't be bothered to make their own interviews, so now we all have to answer them. This youtube channel has some great lessons on how DSA/Leetcode all works:https://www.youtube.com/@mycodeschoolThey don't cover every element of DSA but do cover the most common. Either watch a video, then go to neetcode.io and practice the questions related to that video, or get a question on neetcode.io, look at the answers, then go find the videos that cover the answers and watch the video and then learn how and why the answers work. Sorry if that's unclear, my point is don't sit and try to ""learn"" how to answer leetcode questiosn on your own, lots of them are not ""intuitive"" and you will only get annoyed. It's much simpler to understand the question, then find the answer soemone else already fine tuned and learn that. If you want to fix a car, you don't just go smashing on things and see what happens, you get the manual. For leetcode, DSA and neetcode.io togehter, are your manual. And no, you don't need to pay for neetcode.io for it to be incredibly useful, you get better organization if you pay, but it's all still very usable for free. Though I will say, its' a pretty useful site, so I did end up paying, but I actually got the lifetime membership after I got my job and had some money coming it. More of a ""thank you"" than anything else, plus I'll have it for my next job hunt, though hopefully leetcode questions will be fully gone by then, they're definitely starting to disappear which is nice.",floopsyDoodle,2025-10-25 15:49:27,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1oft8e8,False,

Maybe you're talking at too technical a level for non-technical folks, or vice-versa? Maybe a million other things.I'm sure your boss meant something besides the stutter.If after having that conversation with your boss, they literally say ""just stop stuttering lol"".... that'd be shocking.

Nobody would touch me without a degree. I went and got a degree circa 2017 and I can say unequivocally that college is not an educational institution, it's a licensing gauntlet. You're bouncing from ego to ego of the full time teaching staff that have never been in the private sector, but are charged in preparing you for it. I wrote essays on the ""Browser Wars,"" traced some algorithms, tried out some new programming languages, but NOTHING from college prepared me better for my fulltime career. I actually did a bootcamp for the time that I had my degree, yoe and still couldn't get interviews because my history was in legacy systems (COBOL + Mainframe). So everyone reading those COBOL developers are drowning in offers, just know that's a very hurtful clickbait lol. But the bootcamp gave me a full stack experience that tripled anything of value from college, since we used a template of Flask. That bootcamp gave me 90% of my modern view of development work. I started working personal projects until I got hired to do API work. There's nothing of any value from my undergrad degree. I answer these because I'm a contrast for some of your worldview. I experienced it in the weird oddball way that OP highlighted. I broke into the career, then got my degree, then continued my career. Calc 2 and 3 didn't make me a better developer, it made me better at test taking and studying. Data Structures and Algorithms were already known, but I didn't know what was available in modern and other languages from COBOL. I was working in procedural languages, so I got an OOP lesson, which was neat, and I probably had the best OOP professor who added in how he uses it practically which is what many of my classes taught by academics were missing. My electives were taught by academics and did not help me apply much of my core studies. A bioninformatics class had given me hope, but the teacher just read from the book and power points and we had a 3-4 week intro to what bioinformatics is and the tools used before getting our hands on anything. My DevOps class opened where the professor asked us ""What is DevOps,"" and started taking notes and building that syllabus on the first day. We didn't touch git until our software engineering final group project and most of the class couldn't figure it out. I solemnly promise that I did not need to get a bachelor's degree and am now Senior level in my shop. The classes were full of old material taught identically for over a decade. The math just simply didn't coincide with computer science lessons, like I've heard some have. It was hard, It was messy.

My team recently laid off a new mom after her maternity leave for ""performance"" (the company was not performing well and pushed everyone to work longer hours which she did not do) and it felt very scummy.I feel like you have 3 routes you can go. The first is to find a job at a company that has a relaxed WLB. That's hard to do on command, at any company, in any role. Historically the best option has been government work, which right now is more volatile than it has been in the past. When I've seen this work out for people in the private sector, the situation is usually that they got hired into a ""boring"" company that doesn't pay particularly well, and they stayed long enough that they're performing well and worth more in the market vs. their current job so therefore they have the leverage to push for a great WLB. This isn't your situation. So if you can find a company like this, great! But I wouldn't bet the house on it.Option two is to accept that you're going to end up working longer hours than you want to for a while. I don't think it actually matters whether you stay in software or pivot to sales, PM, solutions engineering, or recruiting (which are the most common pivot options). Those may be more people oriented and may be a better fit if that's what you want in a job, but you aren't necessarily more likely to stay employed, or have an easier time finding work.

nl3aos6,"It's a matter of picking your battles. In my experience ""clean code"" is very much in the eye of the beholder and is more a matter of whether the author and the reader are on the same page rather than any objective superiority of any particular method of coding. Just like any other sort of writing. There are of course some general principles that tend to make things better, and it is certainly possible to make *horribly unclear* code, but past a certain point a lot of it really is a matter of taste.So essentially a person who has strong opinions about specific details of how code should be written is similar to a person who thinks their preferred genre of music is superior to others, or otherwise thinks their taste is superior -- they are wrong, but it's going to be very difficult to convince them of that, and the more persuasive you are the more they will probably dig in and get pissed at you.So you'll need to decide which things *you* care about and which things you don't. If you don't actually care about something, just go along with what they want and smile and nod anytime they try to justify it, content that they're trying to justify it to themselves as much as to you.If you do care, really think again about whether you actually do care. Lots of people don't actually care about things they fight for but rather let ego get tied up in it and are instead fighting over ego. Try to avoid that if possible. So really think about whether you genuinely do care.And if you genuinely do, try to act in good faith. Explain what you think, then invite them to explain what they think and walk you through their thought process and be genuinely open to it. They might actually have good reasons, and so *you* should be open to changing *your* mind. But inviting them to explain will both make them feel like they are valued (which is important to them if they have strong opinions about how the code should be written) and also let them talk themselves out of ideas that are bad (like, if you explain a good idea and ask them to explain theirs, they will have a hard time denying yours is better if they actually have to explain it, and because it is them talking it through and deciding they will be more likely to compromise than if you order them to).Inviting them to explain also gets both of you on the same side -- rather than arguing you are instead both looking at the same problem and talking about it as a thing separate from yourselves. And that change in perspective is helpful -- it makes them feel less like *they* are being devalued if their ideas aren't used.In my experience, most workers do ultimately want to get along and do good stuff, and if you can diffuse their defense mechanisms and avoid getting defensive yourself you can usually find a common ground.But if a person truly is an asshole and can't be reasoned with and truly is my way or the high way, and you really do care about the thing they're digging in on, your best bet is probably to try to go around them. Build support for others / get others to validate your view. After all, if the person is an asshole to you then they have probably been an asshole to others as well, and so you probably will find support.

For example, I'm a big fan of step builder pattern in the main language I use ( Rust ). Why? It's pretty ergonomic and it makes it so invalidly using the API is a compiler error rather than a runtime error.

Nothing about design patterns makes you're code A) correct or B) performant, and most the time you end up taking what was a really simple problem and making it wayyyyy over engineered and over abstracted. The worst is when people go to build out something and they start with a design pattern in mind that they want to use and the first implementation is driven by that pattern, rather than the actual problem that needs to get solved. Outside of stuff prescribed by a frameworks, starting with a pattern is a terrible idea, you have no idea what functioning code will look like and even worse, you have no idea if a pattern is even necessary for what you are trying to accomplish. Depending on what patterns you are even using, you may actually be affecting the compilers ability to optimize the instruction set because it can't reason about the amount of misdirection you have introduced into the code.I'm not saying there is never a use case for design patterns, but more often than not, if you just keep it simple and straight forward, your life will be easier.
