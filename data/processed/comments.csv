However, the investments from the dbtLabs folks will almost certainly slow down or stop. Which means dbt may be staleware in a few years.2. **Necessity is the mother of invention.** The acquisition alone is reason to inspire others to build higher-level abstractions that don't inherit dbt's innate weaknesses. *(Does anyone really think dbt+Jinja was the ideal solution?)* The next generation of transformation solutions should accomplish more with less code, and with semantic metadata baked in.I've built three dbt clones in my career, two of which were *before* dbt itself launched, and one of which was successfully [patented](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10846284B1/en) during my time at Amazon AWS. I am eternally thankful to dbt because it was the first CI/CD-friendly transformation tool to reach critical market share. The dbt team proved to the world that ""transformations as code"" is viable and that data pipelines are not incompatible with SDLC best practices.The future has been changed for the better because dbt exists, but dbt is neither the only solution nor the best solution for the problems data engineers face today and tomorrow.There will be more and better solutions on the horizon. :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:",burnfearless,2025-10-14 00:55:55,16,dataengineering,t3_1o5q0ll,False,

Photon, catalyst, etc. won’t do it for you. There is an enormous amount of electricity and money burning out there in unoptimized Spark jobs, where a traditionals RDBMS SQL shop was convinced they can unlock 20% performance by just migrating to Databricks, whereas with a little investment they could achive 10x+ faster and more efficient jobs.

Get those DBT models out the door, learn how to build APIs with docker and fastAPI. Build an automated conciliation service! The world is your oyster.1a - Ship stuff, just ship stuff. You'll learn by shipping stuff.1b - Yes learn DBT1c - Don't think about it just ship.2a - Get a solid, easy to expand ETL/ELT service going. Adding more data to your DW should be *easy*. When non-data people come to you with ""oh I wanted to see X data that's not on the DW"", you should be like ""oh I'll get it there for you"" and within a few bizdays it's there. Have an ELT/ETL layer that's simple and easy to expand, and this sort of interaction will happen.2b - You should be chilling in your spare time, you'll learn all you need by working on building the stuff that's just beyond what you can comfortably deliver right now. Progressive overload. Don't settle, but don't try to reach for the moon right away. Build yourself a ladder first.2c - Just build stuff, and when the subject come up you say you're learning data engineering on the fly, out of necessity.If you're doing any sort of data-related study in your spare time, I recommend the more theoretical, foundational stuff. Kimball's data modelling, Klepmann's Data Intensive Applications, SICP.

njr2uou,"You have an incredible opportunity ahead of you.1. if you have devops make friends RIGHT AWAY. If you don't consider how you want to manage Infrastructure in this new world you get to great my advice would be look at a reference architecture for a lake house on AWS. Ask your company to send you to re:Invent in December take hands onlabs for building data lakes (avoid any sales sessions just do hands on labs) you will come out with a better idea of what to do. Also take a BASIC terraform course. It will make everything better. It will be confusing at first but ChatGPT/Claude will get you most of the way there. AWS + Python gives you A LOT of options. IMO DBT is kinda shitty. SQL ETL's are ass, because you cannot really unit test these things effectively. Focus more on python (it will get you 90% of what you need for most use cases) look at serverless event driven architectures, less work less thinking long term but you need to monitor that shit and make sure the SPICE FLOWS! Postgres is fine. Your use cases determine your data persistence. If you don't have a lot of data don't over complicate shit use and RDBMS + Python, geter done.2. look back at 1. I personally don't think much of DEs that focused on DBT or Databricks they usually don't know much....sorry to say that but it's the truth. I want coders. I want people who understand distributed systems. I don't care if people know Redshift of Snowflake as long as they understand what those systems are...MPPs. That's abstracted from most DEs. It means Sr folks have to learn ya some shit about an MPP like redshift and snowflake both great infra but they cost and abstract aspects of what's going on under the hood. They are not a golden hammer. Look at the use cases. Postgres on aurora can bang out A LOT of DE use cases. Don't buy a destroyer class ship to manage bass fishing :Db. pyspark is a good thing to pick up. Understand when you want a python script v a pyspark script to run a job. Understand shit like Airflow and how you split compute from your orchestration layer. Airflow is not an ETL it's orchestration. ELT work and computer is done on other infra like an AWS lambda. As you go further focus on microservices, apis, event driven architectures stuff like that. c. AWS tools are legit DE tools you just gotta look at the right shit. Get a cursory understanding these AWS servies (timebox yourself to a few hours total here) EventBridge, Kinesis, Manage Ariflow, managed kafka, lambdas, glue, redshift. aurora(postgresql). Athena. You can solve pretty much all problems with these with out really managing much infra. I can count on one hand the number of times my serverless systems have died in production....AWS went down each time :D.....that was a long one DM me I am an old hand.

From your BI tool's perspective this'll be as if there are denormalized tables, but when the tool queries these tables the view will be executed. * This works if your data is small, but it gets harder to maintain, debug, and scale for larger datasets.* The more maintainable alternative here is to build a ""data pipeline"": * The pipeline would get the raw data from the production systems, as well as any other external systems you need data from. * Builds data models using SQL and Python and persists them into the database. * Your BI tools then connects to the modeled tables instead. * This allows the queries to be more efficient and faster, since the data is pre-calculated. * This also makes analyzing this data easier in BI usecases. * The added benefit of this is that if you want to use a different BI tool tomorrow, or if you need to use this data in some other way than a BI tool, such as jupyter notebooks and python scripts, then the data is also usable for that.There are a bazillion different tools that allow you to build data pipelines.

Finding yourself reusing the same default arguments put it in a variable and import across dags. If you find you need to change common elements in that variable put the definition in a function with parameters. Same thing with open telemetry or open lineage, define your structure for making the call and do it once. A big advantage of this is structure, everything looks the same data is captured in a uniform way and simplifies your life a ton. Depending on your size this can start as simple parameters but may evolve into some kind of log class that you pass as a parameter. Word of warning stay away from template files. I've worked with too many teams that start doing templates to try and enable non engineers to just drop in SQL or something and it makes life miserable. Speeds up initial work but it will cause a lot of headaches down the road with unmaintained, unoptimized code and leaves you with a swampy mess of data.Keep a good folder structure. Don't put your orchestration code in the same folder as your data quality code. Favor nested folders.

Keep orchestration code separate from data-quality checks and business transforms; organize by domain/source under a shared “lib” folder. Use pydantic settings and env vars for per-env behavior instead of template files. Add pre-commit with ruff/mypy and a couple of golden-path tests so changes don’t break DAGs.With Airflow for orchestration and dbt for transforms, DreamFactory gave us ready APIs over Snowflake and Postgres metadata so dashboards and ops scripts could query lineage and DQ stats without custom services.Package the boring stuff once, version it, and keep every project thin.",Key-Boat-7519,2025-10-17 16:52:13,2,dataengineering,t1_njyt4rr,False,

In Temporal, run per-document workflows with chunking/embedding as children; batch Qdrant upserts and use idempotency keys like hash(docid|chunkidx|embedversion). Keep S3 versioning and a manifest so you can replay safely. In Qdrant, index payload fields (docid, version), and retire old vectors by version when a doc changes.

nk2gmz0,"1. In the modern data world partitioning should be approached with the following mindset: read patterns (increasing read performance by partition pruning), data distribution i.e. your partitioning should make sense in terms of how you organize the data in files AND partitions (avoiding small files and data skew, but also creating enough optimal sized files so you can parallelize reading), and considering your deployment/compute sizing so you can actually take advantage of the things you can do in parallel and scale accordingly (again has to do with how you organize your data in files). Although partitioning is a tool you can also use to “group” and “label” your data, like you mentioned, - e.g. being able to reprocess a subset of your data based on a label (processing time) - I would discourage you from using it like this. You have other tools for this purpose that will not hurt performance in the long run. Use partitioning as intended: a tool to distribute your data to ensure performant reads and scalability.2. If you don’t need an immutable bronze data use a lakehouse format straight away like Iceberg and do updates/merge. Optimize for copy-on-write or merge-on-read based on the volume of your late or dupe data. Do proper table maintenance for healthy filesizes and valuable snapshots. (This equals to SCD type 1 btw)If you need the raw data, you can do CDC in an extra column or in a side table. Just like in a regular DWH. You trade downstream performance for history granularity. (This is SCD type 2+)Note: Iceberg/Delta/Hudi are gold because they bring SQL and data warehousing back to big data.3. Look at 1.For idempotency you can also implement watermarking or something with the snapshoting/tagging/branching features of your lakehouse format. This “metadata” can carry the same information that you want to implement with the “processing time” partitioning. These are all small things that can help you, but ultimately idempotency and deterministic behavior should be achieved on the data pipeline level with whatever tools you have.

I inherited a Synapse environment, struggled with all the weirdness of it for a couple of years, and then found Microsoft changing directions (again) on their home grown data stack, to Fabric, without any real clear guidance or easy way of migrating.So I didn't. I just setup my own stack using Azure's base resources(basic storage accounts, containerized and function apps, Azure SQL, data factory for orchestration) that were less likely to be discontinued every few years and then let the business choose what BI solution they wanted to move to.It ended up cutting our costs to like 1/4th of what I had projected it to be at if we would have migrated to Fabric. At the time, there was no migration plan for users of older Synapse to Fabric and it was going to be a re-implementation for us anyways.While I wish Microsoft the best with Fabric, if it's anything like the product model they had for Synapse, it will be dead in like 5 years too. Synapse utilized many of Azure's base resources all linked together, but their development was forked and specialized to Synapse - so they're not 1:1 migrations. To further add problems to this, based on feature requests we made and escalated support tickets to engineering, the development of those forks were done by a small overseas team that basically had no bandwidth but bug fixes.

If you read the source code for Linux, which is written in C, you'll mostly just see a lot of functions calling other functions.In terms of what those function calls within the kernel actually *do*: sometimes they just manipulate data, like any other function you might write yourself. For instance, the ""list of running processes"" is a kernel data structure, so when you start a new process running with the `fork` and `exec` syscalls, you're just calling kernel code that adds a new entry to that list.Similarly, when you use a syscall like `write` to ""print"" text from your program, normally what you're really doing is writing characters to a queue (a.k.a. a pipe or FIFO). Some other part of the system (e.g. a terminal emulator) is going to read those characters and figure out how to display them on the screen. The queue itself belongs to the kernel, so programs use syscalls to ask the kernel to read and write it.On the other hand, some of the kernel code has to manipulate hardware. It usually does this by accessing special memory addresses ([memory-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O_and_port-mapped_I/O)) which read or write the corresponding registers in a hardware device.

Rarely can you get all three at once.Object-oriented programming and functional programming are approaches for managing system complexity. With OOP, you're defining components as ""objects"" with specific functionalities so that you have a system-wide vocabulary for what things do. Furthermore, by making things modular, you limit how much you have to fit in your head at any one time in order to change the system.With functional programming, you're trying to isolate state to as few places as possible and keep all your functions throughout your system simple and deterministic, so when you're writing a function you have a finite number of ways that function can behave and it's simple to create, write, and test.I have met very few engineers who understand why OOP and FP are desirable. They just follow them dogmatically because they were taught them in college and don't know how to do things another way. Furthermore, they often do them wrong. They think simply using functions is FP or just defining boilerplate objects is OOP without actually writing coherent modules to reduce system complexity.If you'd like a more robust discussion on this, my favorite book on the topic is ""A Philosophy of Software Design"" by John Ousterhout.

Someone can design a class and give it a very simple public interface. They can then trust that junior engineers can safely call the public interface and it will work correctly.Similarly, it can enable someone to extend an existing well-written class and customize its behavior while ensuring the core functionality still works.Without OOP, it'd be much easier for lots of people all working on the same project to do something wrong or break something.Sometimes the goal is to enforce rules for yourself!

Like, people are still arguing over what this term means to this day, and they refuse to agree on a concrete definition.Typically though, OOP is, unsurprisingly centered around the idea of ""objects""; encapsulated bundles of data, and methods that can interact with a given instance of said data. Under an OOP framework, a program is simply various interactions between different component objects.In a Tamagotchi, you have a 'pet', that gets fed 'food' that you buy from the 'store', and keep in your 'inventory' until needed. The 'pet' can have different 'states' that effect its behaviour - states like ""hungry"", ""happy"" or ""dead"". All of these are displayed to the user of the game by a 'game window', and specific information can be managed by a 'settings manager'. You get the gist.Many people argue that OOP has proverbial 'pillars'; ""encapsulation"" (keeping related fields and methods bundled together in classes), ""inheritance"" (objects can inherit behaviour of other objects), and ""polymorphism"" (use an interface, dummy), but that's another question, and whether some of them matter enough is again, in contention.",DTux5249,2025-10-12 22:28:17,25,learnprogramming,t3_1o52b64,False,
nj6fri6,"To put it simply, OOP is more of a ""system"" packaging data with its related functions. An object ""pet"" would have birthdate, name, breed, color, father, mother, gender, medical notes, temperament notes, etc. That's just data. An object ""dog"" based on ""pet"" would add on siblings (list), photo (BLOB), and maybe functions bark(), dotrick() and so on. But you can also create object ""cat"" based on ""pet"", add color notes, color pattern, photo (BLOB), siblings (list), preferred toy, etc.What are some things only cat would do? Those would be the cat (only) functions like bark() would be for object dog.",kschang,2025-10-12 22:26:40,5,learnprogramming,t3_1o52b64,False,
nj7h2y8,OOP has become a nebulous term over time such that it can mean everything and nothing. I have to prefix what I think it is with “it’s just my opinion man” as opposed to saying this is the agreed on definition:I believe that OOP boils down to the idea that solutions to problems can be modeled as “objects” which are a collection of methods and data those methods manipulate.Going a step further - encapsulation in this specific form means that users of the objects only need to understand its interface (that is the methods it exposes) should not need to understand the underlying object. An example of this would be creating an instance of a class called HTTPServer and using it will cause it to start an http server without exposing you to the underlying sockets or network protocols to make it work - you don’t need to know all of the variables used by HTTPServer.,Antsolog,2025-10-13 02:17:30,3,learnprogramming,t3_1o52b64,False,

You will learn a lot about how computers work from a low level and it will include writing and reading code. Other examples could be networks, distributed systems, embedded systems, or computer graphics. Basically any class where your homework is largely writing code. Many classes could fall into this category or not depending on how they're taught. For example, some compilers courses will have you write a compiler and others will just teach the theory and test you in it. Check the course before signing up to make sure it is not too theory heavy.This is how you learn programming fundamentals, by learning how other people solved hard problems and then reimplementing the solutions yourself. For example, instead of learning about software design in an abstract sense, just learn about operating systems. You'll learn all the OOP principles. Separation of concerns, modularization, polymorphism. And what's even cooler is you'll learn it all in a language that isn't even OOP and then you will have an aha moment when you realize OOP is not the foundation.If you have extra time to study, spend it doing the optional challenge exercises or questions on your homeworks/labs or join a team building a project.

njv8t84,"You could look at the assembly and see what the compiler is doing. In practice, the compiler will enter `main` and move the stack pointer some offset; this space behind the stack pointer will go back to the end of the stack frame - the stack frame contains the information of where to go when `main` returns. This is the space allocated for the local variables. For you, that'd be about 4 bytes on a typical dev machine. So when `value_giver` returns, the memory for the return value is already allocated, and the compiler will generate machine instructions to write it into this stack space.If you're curious, you could pick up a book on writing compilers, and function call conventions, virtual registers, register allocation via graph coloring, caching and swapping, virtual address spaces, and all sorts of fun theory put into practice.Typically compilers will generate machine code that all the local variables are allocated all at once, so this code: void fn() { int x; // Stuff... int y; // Stuff...The stack memory will look like: [fn frame][x][y][stack pointer]So even though `y` comes into scope later in the function code, all locals were allocated at once; it's just less work to do it this way, and the memory for `y` is inaccessible until the machine code that uses it comes into scope. Compilers don't have to do it this way, and the C standard says effectively nothing about machine code generation. C is a high level language that targets an abstract machine. The compiler projects that abstraction to the actual machine.As far as C is concerned, `a = 25` because that's the code you wrote. How it's realized depends on the compiler and the target architecture that is going to execute those instructions.To blow your mind - Charles Babbage designed the Analytical Engine - a purely mechanical clockwork digital computer. He never did get the funding to build it; some private investor spent millions of dollars and commissioned his earlier Difference Engine to be built, and it was completed and put on display in a London Museum for 2 years, before being brought into his private collection. All the Difference Engine does is compute logarithms.But the Analytical Engine was digitized and simulated - and it fucking worked. Earlier analysis of the design has shown IT IS Turing Complete, and it was indeed designed to be a general purpose computer. So being Turing Complete means it is exactly equivalent to your computer you're using right now - just mechanical and slower. This means YOU CAN write a C compiler for the Analytical Engine and compile this program for it, and it would run.

njxik0i,"Generally, the value is returned by the function and since a function call has ended, all the values that were put on the stack by the function (i.e. the stack frame with local variables, parameters and other data) can be deleted except for the return value. The return value is then on the stack and can be copied. In reality this is optimised, but in a very simple stack based system you just return the execution to where the function was called and then the assignment copies the value on the stack. The return type defines the width (how many bits/bytes) are on the stack. After that the next function call will write to the stack, overwriting that value.The stack, CPU registers, and pointers that control program execution and function calls make it all work. There's a pointer that tells the CPU which instruction to execute next. That's the ""Instruction Pointer"" (IP). It can ""jump"" to where a function and and then ""jump"" back when the function returns. The pointers can just be on the stack because stacking those addresses makes it easy. Since it uses a stack\*, it must know where on the stack the function has to work with local variables. The ""Stack Pointer"" (SP) simply points to the top of the stack (new stack frames go on ""top"" (usually a higher address). \* You could compile C code for a computer that doesn't use a stack but then the compiler would just generate code that creates a stack at runtime using the memory.

Consequently money was flowing in an unnaturally free and cheap way across the economy since.Since then, interest rates have gone up, money has become tighter and more scarce, and the ""party"" is coming to an end so to speak.When money is tighter, consumers spend less, businesses hire less, people invest less, people are more risk averse, etc. The economy as a whole starts to slow down.So startups that were once being flooded with money by investors throwing everything they could at anything resembling ""tech"" suddenly see their investments dry up. Mid-sized businesses can't get loans. Companies aren't willing to spend as much money on advertisements, so sites like google, instagram, Facebook, etc. see their revenue go down. Consumers buy less products on Amazon.So everyone stops hiring, and then they start doing layoffs, which means people have even less money to spend on stuff, and the cycle continues to plummet downward into a recession.And that is what we're going through now.Are there some jobs being made obsolete by AI? Yeah, probably. But that is a secondary factor.

It took me the introductory course (with an extra course I took, because I was struggling) and a practical course with a group project in my 2. semester. After that course, I felt like I can built stuff that's really helpful for me. And that's what I did. Been programming for 13 years now. It's definitely not about being smart. Programming is really one of the easier concepts in a CS curriculum. And Python is especially easy. I was taught Java at first (which I'm glad about). But I think you also need to either be wired to think like a programmer or you need to learn it. You will learn to think more analytically and you will learn how to solve problems. Or you will find out that that kind of thinking is just not for you.My advice is: Just stick with it. If you can find any joy or interest in programming, then stick with it. It will click some day. If the whole experience is just a drag to you, even after trying for months, that might mean that it's not for you. Also: Don't do it for the money. If you don't enjoy it, you'll be miserable.BTW: I barely passed my introductory programming course. But once I finished the practical course in the second semester, I was an A-B student when I came to practical programming courses.

That way, you won't feel discouraged for doing extra research or taking longer than others to figure things out...or you could just ignore that and stress out 24/7 :smirking_face:With that said, a lot of programmers are obsessed with the idea that learning it must be really difficult; if you can't do x thing in y way, then ""you're not cut out for it.""I find *that* ridiculous, just like I find the method to teach you for loops a little odd. Don't be afraid to take a few steps back and look up introductory courses to x concept and asking for a lot of guidance if you're stuck on something. If you wind up going further down this path, remember this - building usable programs is really important, even if they're very basic to start.My curriculum failed to even suggest that. We've never even built a basic calculator like you are now. This led to my growth in programming being at a near plateau for 2 years. I learned theory, syntax, and basic concepts but never actually trained the most important aspect of a programmer - solving problems. A programmer is a problem-solver who uses tools (languages, functions, etc) to solve them. That's why many people emphasize solving the problem with writing out diagrams, pictures, words, etc, then turning that into psuedocode you can easily follow. Here's a simple way breaking the problem down would look like:- If I receive 2 numbers, let's say 6 and 2, what would the end result be? 12? - How would I get from my base numbers to get to 12 while only adding? Adding by 2, 6 times?- How do I make my program loop by 6 times?- How do I make sure I correctly add 2 each time in that loop? - How do I see if my end result is 12?- How do I replace my numbers 6 and 2 with variables? - Would I get the same result assigning 6 and 2 to those variables before the loop?- How do I get user input to achieve the same result?So on and so forth. Maybe add some psuedocode to give a basic idea of how it would flow in code. Building a bigger program would follow a similar process. Whenever you break down a problem but get stuck on breaking it down further for x, y, z reasons, that might be a good indicator of searching up a little more about x, y, and z.Hope that helps!

Find a beginner friendly book or course about basic consepts of programming and go through it. Know what? If you are aiming to master C++, your initial learning doesn’t even need to be in C++. Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, didn’t start out with C++, of course. He also says in interviews that every programmer would benefit from learning a handful of languages. Find some pods with Bjarne Stroustrup!Mister C++ himself perhaps wouldn’t agree with this, but much of the best books on programming basics use Lisps as a vehicle. This way, they can focus on the programming itself, rather than forcing complex syntax on the reader.One good example is “The Little Schemer” by Friedman & Felleisen. If you choose that one, I’ll spoil one thing: The “rules” and ”commandments” presented in the book are just rules within the book, meant to be applied when solving the exercises; they are generally not rules of the Scheme lang. This could be a bit confusing, if you haven’t understood it. Another thing: if you don’t solve a problem now, you maybe solve it next time.

njkqvzh,"First, think about who will use the app and where. If it's just you on one computer, the easiest way is Python with Flask. Flask lets you make a simple website to view and edit data, and SQLite can store everything in a single file. You will need a backup plan for the database, but it's simple and doesn't require a server.If multiple people need access at the same time, you will need a server and a proper database. Node.js lets you run JavaScript on the server to handle multiple users. A NoSQL database like MongoDB is easier than SQL for beginners because you don't have to plan tables and relationships in advance. You can just add new fields as you go (Useful if they later need to add random stuff they forgot to mention). An online database just means the database lives on a server everyone can access, but it requires hosting, security, and backups.

nj9e95e,"It depends on where in the world you are, because the job markets and expected qualifications differ greatly. A country suffices. From a central EU and USA perspective: A degree is not 100% necessary, but makes the entire process of finding and keeping (good) jobs a lot easier. If you want to go this route, taking all general STEM classes you can get before will help. A computer science degree will generally give you good basics, but you will be expected to ""self learn"" programming along the way. You will probably get taught the basics for programming as well, but everything beyond that is incidental. Programming is to computer science as masonry to an architect. This is the slowest route, but you will be the most well rounded, and able to go into basically any field (inside of IT) you want to specialize in. A software engineering degree locks you out of very few things: Theoretical CS research is the only thing that comes to mind, but I am sure there is a little more. It mostly has the same basics as a general computer science degree, but you specialize in how software works, is made and programming a lot more. Theoretical CS and other possible specializations, like Bio/medicine and programming, physics or IT-security will be ignored more. If you know that you want to be a programmer, this is always solid. In some countries you also have vocational training as a programmer, you can treat this like a Software Engineering degree, but shorter and with less prestige. Then you can go the self taught route. Here it's even more about a good portfolio, to prove oyu are able to work, and good networking. You need connections to get anywhere, because you need to give people a reason to even consider you an option. Normally the degree does that for you (to an extend, networking is also important if you have one) Certificates are motly completely useless in my experience. This will vary greatly throughout different regions and specific fields, but when we did technical evaluations of new candidates, we just ignored any certificates. The only thing we looked at was education and prior experience, like a portfolio or earlier jobs they've had. I know now, that in some countries they hold quite a bit more value, and that's why it's important to say where (approximately) you will be looking for work, once your education is done.

So, try it out, don't wait for motivation just think of something that annoys you and build a solution.

It's also what SSGs use.I'm not personally familiar with react so I can't give an exact answer for your situation, but one common type of templating is [jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), where you can have a template like `hello {{name}}` (which you should be familiar with from basic string interpolation), and logic like `{% for name in names %}hello {{name}}{% endfor %}`.Static site generators essentially use templates to produce static HTML that you can serve to people through stuff like github pager, a simple Apache webserver, etc. Usually it involves some setup in terms of theming and what you want headers, footers, etc to be, and then you can do stuff like add blog posts written in Markdown with minimal effort.You can find static site generators in pretty much any language. Some commonly used ones include* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (Ruby)* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (Go)* [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) (Rust, but more special-purpose)Some of the ones I've used include* [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) (node.js)* [hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) (Haskell)You can find [a list of SSGs on jamstack](https://jamstack.org/generators/).

Store event data in a DB/CMS with fields like title, date, backgroundColor, theme, and a blocks array (e.g., hero, speakers, schedule). Your EventPage maps blocks to components, so “unique flair” is just data. For SEO, compute meta tags from the fetched event. Prefetch the event on card hover or intersection to keep it snappy.If you want SSG, Next.js works well: pages/events/\[slug\] with getStaticPaths to build popular events, and revalidate to keep them fresh.

njnyog8,"Under the hood, the compiler generates a virtual table. Vtables are not explicitly required by the C++ spec, but it's how all the compilers do it. This is a static table of function pointers - each abstract class and derived class has it's own table. Your instance points to its table.So then, if you have a `B` instance, but through type erasure you only have an `A` pointer, then calling a method will undergo a lookup so the correct implementation is called.Maybe.The vtable only contains entries for `virtual` methods. In your example, the only entry in the vtable of both `A` and `B` will be for `print`. You didn't make `~A` virtual, so when you `delete a`, the compiler doesn't know `a` is pointing to a `B`. The compiler only knows the non-virtual interface presented to it through the `A` type.---If you google OOP in C, you can find tutorials for building objects in C, including modeling inheritance, and polymorphism. The object code generated by this exercise typically matches the C++ equivalent exactly. The first C++ compiler - CFront, was originally a transpiler to C.So why not just use C? Because the two languages have different type systems. C++ grants you much more type safety - and type safety is more than just catching errors; compilers are theorem provers, and they use type information in order to optimize more aggressively. C and C++ are both high level abstract languages, they're not high level assembly languages.

If you know that you will never extend the class or you know that it will never be destroyed via a base class pointer, then maybe not.

njvjnly,"Write an HTTP server.HTTP is a text based protocol, and you can get away with just implementing GET and POST - and you don't even need the whole thing - you can just ignore authentication, for example. You generate an HTTP response IN TEXT. It's all text. That's the point of this exercise.Seriously, don't overthink it - it's not hard. You're not writing a complete web server, you just need to read text from a stream, figure out what message type you got, and service it.You can write main in terms of `std::cin` and `std::cout`. What makes standard IO so special is that you can use the `netcat` command to open a listening socket on port 8080, and launch an instance of your program - `netcat` will establish the TCP stream for you, and redirect all IO to your program's standard IO. So here you're coding against `std::cin` and `std::cout`, and in reality, it's coming from a TCP socket over a pipe across the network.Now you can just hit the localhost loopback device with a web browser on port 8080, and your program just reads `std::cin` to process the GET request, and you write back a payload with the most barebones HTML that says ""Hello World!"" in it. Or maybe some JSON, or XML, since both those are transport protocols - you can just write it raw, you don't need a template engine that processes JSON or anything like that.But you could... If you get ambitious...You can also use `telnet` or `curl` to interact with your little server and see a more raw view, or the developer tools built into the browser - whatever those do...As for your code, OOP is message passing to objects, so you can implement a couple message types: class GET {}; class POST {}; using request = std::variant; std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, request &);The stream operator will start to parse out the HTTP request, determine the request type, and then create the corresponding variant type. This makes this stream operator here a factory method. Once you get as far as knowing the message type, you could defer to the message type instance to populate itself from the stream: class GET { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, GET &); }; class POST { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, POST &); };You'll probably want a response message: class response { friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &, const response &); };To make an object, you make it streamable: class http_server: public std::streambuf {};If you want to parse text, you overload a couple things: class http_server: public std::streambuf { int_type underflow() override, overflow(int_type) override; };And you can plug that into a stream: http_server svr; std::iostream ios{&svr};You can make a number of these, for being different kinds of processors and handlers and stages that all perform steps. Messages move content, objects do work. This is OOP in C++. This is why Bjarne invented C++, because he wanted more control over message passing, and he wanted greater type safety than either Smalltalk or C. Streams are the interface - and frankly you can bypass the stream implementations almost completely if you're messaging internally in your application - you don't have to serialize to text all the damn time. There's a lot you can do with OOP if you think in terms of objects and messages.I demonstrate these principles in past posts of mine, I spend most of my Reddit time answering C++ questions on Reddit, so look up a couple of my past examples.But if you can implement objects and message passing as OOP intended, I think you'll show your professor something he's almost certainly never seen in his life. MOST people can't even tell you what OOP IS, because they've never seen it themselves, before. Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism? These principles are NOT OOP, they just come OUT of OOP. These principles exist in other paradigms, too. You've got polymorphism in everything from imperative programming to functional programming, for example. Most C++ code is C with Classes because people don't know what they're doing - garbage in, garbage out. I've spoken to other developers who understand OOP, but in 30 years I've never actually met one in real life, never worked with one. I've worked with a Windows 95/DirectX/COM co-author, I've worked with the former maintainer of the Intel Fortran compiler (and that's a big fucking deal, since it's used on all the worlds supercomputers), and I've shown them this stuff, how Bjarne writes code, and they've never seen anything like it before.",mredding,2025-10-16 22:40:33,4,learnprogramming,t3_1o8hxas,False,

So you end up with fewer openings and way too many applicants, and let’s not even talk about how low the salaries companies are offering these days. It’s not just tech either, people are getting degrees in fields like anthropology or psychology, and unless they go all the way to a PhD, they’re stuck in an endless loop of not having enough experience. The good thing is your degree is still super relevant to today’s needs.I think you should get your resume in front of as many people as possible. Find companies in your area where you’d actually like to work and reach out to people in the departments you’re interested in. Tell them your situation, ask if they know of any openings, and see if they’re willing to help or give some guidance. It’s not a guaranteed solution, but it really does increase your chances.

Not all stretches of your career will have you working with people you click with and on projects that succeed, but the stretches that do are where your real network comes from.Second, make sure to study system design interviews. They've become performance theater at this point like LeetCode and you're expected to ""know the moves"" at some places. Most staff+ interviews also had a project presentation and Q&A part which paradoxically is the opposite where you're cooked if you never had the scope and scars but you don't need to study for. Also expect newer companies to ask more non-memorizable-from-internet coding and system design questions, which IMO is a great thing because that'll probably trickle to the rest of the industry eventually.The above is for ICs who are still hands on.

You're also basically on the weeds immediately of figuring out things like cross-functional communication and collaboration, prioritization of value generation vs maintainability based on expected impact and necessity, autonomy and ownership etc...Hence, why its the ""senior junior"" situation. You speed run learning some senior skills while potentially missing out on some of the more mid-level things like adhering to team styling, some knowledge gaps that come from needing to ship and not having the time or team for learning more about developing in a mature project, learning about choosing when to apply design patterns etc...Those things tend to come about from a bit slower of a pace where engineers can be deeper on engineering rather than making sure market fit has been established, runway is secured, and good enough is more important than scaling and maintaining due to the rapid nature of changing demands.But, as I said, that isn't for everyone which is okay.

Owners want to maximize their own profit, so it is in the owner's best interest to pay the worker as little as possible, and to work the worker as long as possible. This is made worse by the fact that profit under capitalism actually tends to fall over time, since capitalism is quite good at making things more efficient it tends to overproduce things in the long run, devaluing the products it produces, meaning often the only way to squeeze out more profit is by squeezing the workers.The workers in IT fields are well paid (still much less than the actual value they provide to the company), but work long hours, frequently more than full time, in order to meet arbitrary deadlines and push profits to an extreme. This work is highly mentally taxing contributing to burnout. Additionally globalization, outsourcing, and complacency due to high salaries makes demands for better working environments difficult.edit: To make things worse, since the 2010s tech companies have been relying on an extremely loan heavy monetary strategy due to low interest rates which actually requires profits to grow exponentially in order to pay their loans back, but this strategy is beginning to falter due to problems like ""running out of people on the planet to sell to"", and ""2% higher interest rates to combat hyper inflation caused by tech company speculative circle jerking"", and ""loans coming due"".

I have never had a problem getting interviews.2. Not all recognizable brands are good. Accenture's reputation is that they select for conformity, not skill.3. AI will have a massive shift soon.

My expectation is that when the bottom drops out from the current AI boom, Accenture will focus on retraining you, and you may end up doing something completely different, but you will still have a job, while a mid-sized company may lay off people more quickly, but on the upside, you then already have a visa.So basically, if your plan is to leave Japan, and your main skillset is AI related, the ""leave now"" option is likely better.

Now SWE ""talent"" comes in to play and most companies are not hiring big tech company level SWEs since they cannot compete with total compensation.I've worked on safety critical medical devices at private non-tech companies in non-tech cities, think dialysis machines, for my 15+ year career. These companies have mature processes as they have been around for 30+ years. The devices we created were safe and had FDA approval, but the codebase was real spaghetti in many areas.Most of the time it came down to SWEs just working within the existing code base. They don't really care about pushing for refactors unless it was absolutely necessary. SWEs were not intentionally sabotaging the project. They did the best they could with the skills they had. Management doesn't complain about code quality so there is no issue from these SWEs perspective.The SWEs at the majority of companies are not grinding DS&A or design patterns trying to get in to top tech companies. They can code up features that do what they need to do and that's about it. These companies are not trying to compete with big tech companies as they cannot come close to matching total compensation.They try to sell themselves to SWEs in different ways, but it just attracts SWEs that: (off the top of my head)* don't know the value of their talent* meet the companies bar, but would not be talented enough to get in to big tech companies for big pay* late in their career where they are financially secure to coast in a jobSo this is a long way of saying, yes it's pretty common in the industry to have production ready code that is poorly designed. I would even wager that is the expectation and not the expectation when you look at the industry at large and not a small slice like only big tech companies. I'd bet even if you went to look at some codebase at google there would be SWEs that say this is poorly designed we need to refactor. Most of the time the refactor is now worth it and as a SWE you take it as a lesson learned for the next time you do the same or similar thing.",diablo1128,2025-10-12 14:54:18,7,cscareerquestions,t3_1o4pn7k,False,

This confidence comes from several sources depending on your environment and your team/org structure:1. Knowing who knows what. At large companies with lots of knowledge silos, this is probably the most important bit. Most likely, the unfamiliar bits of the codebase is also owned by them, so if you need to make changes there, you'd have to get their buy-in anyways2.

I could've just quickly box-checked the task and closed the ticket but instead I dug about to understand the whole CICD pipeline and why the dependency even existed. I concluded it was way too complicated for what it did because it relied upon a convoluted ECS implementation to serve the frontend for no discernible reason (SPA , no server side rendering, never will need it given it's internal tooling with no need for major performance focus). I implemented a much simpler / cheaper way of hosting it as static content in S3 and ran it in parallel in dev as proof of concept.I spoke with our engineering manager who agreed it was a preferable approach and now we're integrating it to reduce architectural / build complexity.My point being, don't just take tickets to solve the immediate problem. See if you can solve the upstream problem too. My initial ticket was some version bump needed of a dependency for security reasons but the underlying problem was that we were managing unnecessarily complex infrastructure to serve up a basic SPA frontend.

You may see people post LinkedIn premium stats where X% of people applying to an entry level role have a masters... but that doesn't mean they're *getting the role*.When a company is hiring for a regular SWE position that requires no specialized knowledge outside of a bachelors, if they see someone with a masters applying, all they see is a flight risk. They're not stupid. They know someone with a masters degree is just going to use that ""normal"" position as a stepping stone, and leave the moment they have a job lined up that has work utilizing their degree, and more importantly, pay reflecting the advanced degree.You can claim that this is the job you want, and you're in it for the long term all you want.... but no sane company is going to believe you.None of this is a problem if you're getting a masters/PhD in order to chase jobs that require a masters/PhD. It becomes a problem when you're using those degrees just to delay your entry into the market.Stick it out with applying. Getting an internship sophomore year is pretty difficult. You'll likely have better luck after your Junior year. And even if you don't.... in my opinion your time is better spent in the market, applying until you get something lined up.

First off, it’s completely valid to feel drained and frustrated; you’re juggling a lot, and taking care of your mental health is just as important as academics.From my experience, a degree DOES help open doors, especially early in tech, but it’s not the only path. Many people build careers through certifications, strong portfolios, internships, and practical experience. What matters most is demonstrating that you can solve problems, learn quickly, and contribute.If you enjoy programming, it’s worth thinking about ways to keep doing it without burning out. That could mean continuing your degree at a slower pace, taking a break, or focusing on building projects and internships that align with your goals. Leadership and managerial roles come later, and they often care more about results and experience than the exact degree.Honestly, there’s no perfect answer.

When i tested it, it wasnt working and i realized that at no point did the AI ever make sure that all the cases were covered because there was one case that would never hit because we never set that variable.\- Ask questions and try to befriend older engineers.

Dont twiddle your thumbs, if you are stuck ask anybody. In stand up say, I am stuck. It goes a long way when you can say that openly.\- when you complete something, show proof of it.

It honestly sounds like the main thing holding you back is your own preoccupation with making a mistake, but I think you could make that argument about any job, and everyone has to start somewhere.Something that helped me worry less was understanding blast radius for the changes I was making. Think “if I deploy this code, what’s the worst thing that can happen?” If the answer is “take down prod” then it’s time to go back and add more safeguards, but if it’s “some data gets a bit stale that nobody needs,” then it’s good to go.",JustJustinInTime,2025-10-13 15:23:02,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1o5iuhd,False,
njcy029,"I started out as a FE dev and became a BE dev. Now I don't even want to touch anything FE, although I'm technically full-stack I'd only write BE on my resume. Backend code is always much cleaner, simpler, and easier to debug - but it requires knowledge of certain things you don't often think about as a FE dev.Here are my 2-cents of everything you need to know to be a GOOD BE dev.First of all, you need a general understanding of the internet itself. How it works, and why it is the way it is. You need to know what HTTP requests are and how they work. A BE dev is not a network engineer, but you still want to know what ports are, what UDP and TCP is. All BE development establishes connections to someone or something (most often databases, but depending on the product it could be establishing connections peer to peer or in any other way)After that, you need to understand that backend code is not like FE code. The same design and architectural patterns don't make sense. It helps to think of BE code as a series of completely isolated scripts that a computer will be processing. It doesn't run on a client, it's not available to a client, users have no idea what that code is and they will never see it or directly interact with it. In the simplest context, think of a simple user registration form. The frontend has some inputs it captures, and then it sends it to the backend for processing. The backend then does all of the work to make that registration actually happen with those inputs - which is most often inserting rows to the database.You need to understand and be able to work with databases, you need to be able to read and write SQL. I can't think of any BE position where the code is not interacting with a database. In many instances, that's ALL the code is doing - interacting with a database.You need to understand and be able to manage remote servers and web servers. Familiarity with unix.Security is a concern in BE development for sure, but generally common sense will go a long way and people often think some kind of over-engineering is required to have something secure. Have a properly secured server, with correctly set-up file permissions, whitelists, and firewalls. Don't set anything public that shouldn't be public. Don't store files or sensitive data in weird places. Don't store sensitive data like passwords in plain text. Don't install random packages and libraries that you're not 100% confident in and have a genuine use-case for. Don't work out of a system or computer that's potentially compromised. All validation must be properly handled in the backend, what the FE does is irrelevant in terms of security. Don't have any method someone could exploit to fire off code or SQL on your system. Use services like Cloudflare to help with spam reduction and bot detection. Keep all software/packages regularly updated (including the OS the server is on), and finally keep logs of everything including errors, accesses, requests, etc. Regardless of the scale of a product or application, if all of the above are met, the product will be completely secure from a BE perspective.Overall, I'd say there is a lot more power with backend development than there is with FE. There are more job opportunities for it, and there are just more things you can do in general. The code you write is not just something to be used exclusively for a client's UI - it can be used for quite literally anything, from the world's most complex sorting and filtering algorithms to data analytics to machine learning to whatever else. Lastly, I'd say the beauty of backend code is once it's written, it's made to last forever as long as the computer running it is still on. It's not subject to the change of forever-changing things like clients, npm packages, and designs. In other words, if someone wrote the backend script for a user registration form in 1990, it would be just as valid code as one made today.",dskfjhdfsalks,2025-10-13 23:24:09,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1o5iuhd,False,

I joke to my coworkers that we’re all just data plumbers.Have you done system design interviews?

nj2wxo0,"What you've described are all basic fundamental things that frontend developers are expected to do. If you want to specialize in the creative side of things you'll need to work on developing more advanced technical skills such as graphics/shader programming, webGPU/webGL, Three.js, and etc. to distinguish yourself. I believe the general industry title for such roles is ""creative developer"" - basically a developer with a focus on the areas I mentioned alongside all the existing requirements of a frontend developer. Demand for this skill set is infrequent - most projects that involve this kind of work are usually advertising/marketing related and are typically contracted to web design agencies or freelancers in the field. On rare occasions larger companies may selectively recruit a few of these roles but career-wise I don't think it's very viable long term unless you have the right connections and can distinguish yourself with a strong portfolio.I personally think working as a regular frontend developer is a much more preferable position to be in in terms of career progression and compensation. That being said however if you're passionate about this then you should continue to pursue it inside and outside of work whenever you can - often times in your career you'll stumble upon opportune moments, so having the right skill set at the right time can definitely lead you down a desirable path!",aeroheim,2025-10-12 10:10:38,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1o4dwhs,False,

Most front end devs are making client apps with enterprise applications where the UX insights to be mindful of are about making it intuitive to sort through complicated workflows with lots of data.

I don't even know if it's accurate to say that this domain in the US has upskilled, so much as computing generally has blown up to a become a much broader field, and so the semiconductor domain has passively/relatively become more specialized over time.I don't even think it's necessarily accurate to say that these jobs are hard to get. They're more specialized, and they mostly default to recruiting from a few universities with relevant EE/CE/EECS programs because those are the few programs that reliably prepare new grads for the jobs.Now, the reality is that most American CS graduates have looked at an increasingly global semiconductor market, the difficulty of having to learn an enormous amount of theory and practical skills, increasing competition from technical graduates from universities in India/China/Korea/Southeast Asia, and the risks of over-specializing in a software domain, and by and large chosen to go into full stack/web development instead.I would need more information to give individual advice on this topic, and I would strongly caution against going into this field for the money. Semiconductor/embedded work can still be unbelievably lucrative, even as an employee and not as a founder or early hire, but in most cases the dividends come when people are long into their career and can author patents and papers or manage large projects.",repmop,2025-10-17 20:53:02,1,cscareerquestions,t1_nk0gi3q,False,
njzficz,"A masters would definitely help but I’m far from an expert. Not sure where you’re located but it might make sense to reach out to your Alumnus and discuss pursuing a masters in electrical engineering with a focus in semiconductor or VLSI/ASIC concentration, if they have some sort of Continuing Educatjon program Might be worth checking out the hardware sub here as well",BigShotBosh,2025-10-17 15:08:11,2,cscareerquestions,t1_njze7jb,False,
