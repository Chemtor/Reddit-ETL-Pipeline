mucbctv,"1. Start estimating higher! If you get pushback, point out that your team is always delivering late, so clearly everyone is \*under\*-estimating and you are trying to be realistic. 2. If you are not influential on your team, discuss with someone who is and work a plan. Come with some ideas for solutions rather than just complaints and figure out how to present them. e.g. switch to a Kanban-style workflow; keep the backlog groomed and in prioritized order; for tickets with firm deadlines find a way to indicate the deadline so it gets prioritized correctly. Each person works on only one active story at a time until it is in a review stage where they are waiting on approval to merge. Only then do they pick up the next story on the backlog assigned to them.This gives a clarity to bottlenecks, and focus to what is in progress as it is limited at any given time. It forces clear prioritization of the work each person needs to do next: if a new urgent task comes in, it's set appropriately at or near the top of the backlog. Other items naturally shift down.It does require constant grooming & prioritization, and attention to velocity to ensure the lack of sprint deadline does not cause people to slack off. In addition to that, you can start the week off with everyone stating their goal(s) for the week based on what they know right then. ( in a shared document) \- As the week progresses, each person jots a quick note here or there on anything that prevent completion, whether changing priorities, lack of information needed from others, blocking issues, etc. Or you check off the stuff you have completed in some way. \- At end of week, status is left as it is; the next week a new section is created for that week, and you don't go back and clean up the previous week's notes or ticket status.Over time you can read back and see the patterns of *why* work is typically underestimated.",Fun_Independent_7529,2025-05-26 13:49:59,37,dataengineering,t3_1kvtz7d,False,

muj0rr3,"I'm brand new to DE. I wanted to type up a pretty detailed summary of what I've learned about all of these tools and formats recently, when looking at what stack to use for my app's pipeline but, unfortunately, my hands are fucked... arthritis is definitely coming for me.My super short summary, then, is that traditional databases use a proprietary file format to store data ""inside"" of the database (meaning it's not a file you can find in your file explorer and open); modern tools like DuckDB provide a query engine and enable SQL queries to be run on open-source file formats like parquet. Importantly, for my understanding, you can run DuckDB queries over many parquet files as if they were a single table.For me, this has shifted the way I view what a ""database"" really is. I used to think of it as the thing that stored data and let me query it. Now, I view the query engine and the stored data as two separate things, with ""database"" still referring to the engine. Then, tools like Iceberg exist to define how multiple parquet files are organised together into a table, as well as dealing with things like snapshots, partitions, schema evolution, and metadata files... at the moment I view Iceberg like a notepad I would keep on my desk that says ""to query sales, read files A, B, and C into DuckDB"" or ""Added Row X, Deleted Row Y"" so it can track how the table evolves over time without taking entire copies of the table (it actually creates a new file called a ""delete file"", to my knowledge, that works kind of like a subtraction X - Y). That means there are now three parts: data storage, the query engine, and metadata management.My understanding of the blogpost is that DuckLake replicates the kind of functionality that Iceberg provides but does so in a format that is compatible with any SQL database. This gives the management of datalakes database-like transactional guarantees, allows easier cross-table transactions, better concurrency, better snapshotting by referencing parts of files, and allows for things like views (which I guess Iceberg and other tools didn't?)Moreover, metadata is currently managed through file writing, and when performing many small updates or changes, this can be slow, and prone to conflict errors. Tools like BigQuery can be even worse, as they re-write entire blocks that have been affected by operations. DuckLake claims to solve for this by storing the metadata in a database, because they're typically good at handling high concurrency and sorting out conflicts. Correct me if I'm wrong there - that's definitely the limit of my technical knowledge.... if I ever get to work with these tools, I'm sure it'll be good knowledge to have!",ColdStorage256,2025-05-27 15:13:22,28,dataengineering,t3_1kwnx2o,False,

Instead of having to think through how to handle things like incremental loads, materialization, and workflow, you can just focus on the model definition. It shifts the focus to creating and maintaining the business logic instead of the mechanics of getting data from a to b. You write your model to show you the output you want, and it takes care of the rest. We use dbt in our databricks pipelines currently, and it makes management of 100s of models MUCH easier. Also, you can create tests using dbt to verify that the results you want match certain criteria - things like uniqueness, completeness, etc. it also has pretty good methods for tracking lineage and adding documentation, and you can create reusable macros across projects. Ultimately, dbt is a great framework for maintaining all the business logic that goes into semantic models.

The requirement to authenticate in the VS Code extension, along with its acceptable use policy, seems aimed at identifying medium- and large-sized organizations using the free tools and pushing them toward buying a cloud license.This isn’t just about drawing a line between core and cloud — it looks like an intentional effort to murder core without causing too much backlash.

The only restrictions are around building competitive managed services or circumventing the license keys. If you use dbt core at your org for your data pipelines today, you can use the dbt Fusion engine for that same work in the future.

If you really need every ounce of performance, write the giant query, but you can generally make pipelines much easier to read and maintain while getting acceptable performance.My bigger issue with dbt is the invocation / scheduling overhead that can be difficult to see and extremely impactful on performance. My team uses Airflow and k8s, and we've had to refine guidelines on building DAGs a lot. Originally, we just used DbtTaskGroup() from [astronomer-cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos), but this approach introduces a lot of overhead for large pipelines with many small models. Essentially, it executes 1 dbt invocation per model. When you have dozens or hundreds of models, and you're waiting both for Airflow to schedule tasks and then for the tasks themselves to spin up k8s jobs, this can propagate delays through your pipeline. We ended up consolidating models into a small handful of tasks, which reduced runtime by 25%.",onestupidquestion,2025-05-28 11:47:25,31,dataengineering,t3_1kxb3ip,False,

I don’t entirely disagree with you, but I do disagree with you in many cases that exist. I believe this is why complex ETL tooling does transformations in an application layer versus how ELT focuses on the database layer. Having managed and dealt with fully driven sql ETL solutions, one can see the performance benefits and the performance pain points. Separating those concerns between db and app helps to determine what type of tool you need. I’m generally dealing with a significant volume of transformation and mapping logic, to consume a hundred different pictures of sources routing to the same final destinations. This part has never done well in sql server, and we won’t even get in to the concerns on flexibility, scalability, and bloat, to use sql server for this particular piece of the paradigm, if it is a concern you are even battling. If not, I’d argue in favor of something basic, and full sql can be totally fine in this regard.

It's rare for them to need data within 10 seconds, but 5-30 minutes is common - so that they aren't waiting around for data they just updated to be reflected. * How quickly do the engineers need it to run in? Keep in mind that if a production process fails on the last step, and if you can't restart from the last step then an 8-hour process might now take 16 hours. What if it then fails *again*? And what if this is going on during a holiday, or the middle of the night when it's hard to get expertise to help?

For example just automatically converting tables to pandas dataframes and processing that way could cause some big inefficiencies, especially if you could just perform the operation in SQL to start.A good place to start might be to look at your existing pipelines and process and figure out where the rubbing points are and seeing if that's a place Python could help with.",full_arc,2025-05-30 15:27:46,8,dataengineering,t3_1kz6t8f,False,

muz2t4a,"I've been using dbt at two different companies over 3 years now. Here's the unfiltered take:Day-to-day: It standardized how we write SQL and track dependencies, which was huge. Before it was spaghetti SQL files with no clear dependencies. Most useful features: ref(), tests, and documentation are actually worth it. Sources and macros are heavily used. Exposures were nice in theory but nobody maintained them. Snapshots were a mess - ended up just building those in our warehouse directly.Orchestration: Airflow + dbt is still clunky. We have our dbt DAG inside Airflow but then need to manually sync when dependencies change. If I started today, I'd use Dagster since it has first-class dbt integration.For non-technical folks: The lineage graphs in dbt Cloud are nice but rarely used by stakeholders in my experience. They still just message the data team.Challenges: The learning curve for non-SQL people is steep, especially with macros and Jinja. Performance became a bottleneck with 500+ models. dbt Cloud's git workflow is rigid compared to local dev.Would I adopt again? Yes, but with caveats. I'd set much stricter conventions up front and would consider something like preswald for the Python+SQL parts since our ML engineers hate the dbt workflow.

The most impactful changes I've seen are around collaboration and code quality - `ref()` functions eliminated our hard coded table names, builtin testing catches data quality issues early, and version control became natural. The documentation generation and lineage tracking have improved our communication, though the semantic layer features are still maturing and often feel overhyped.The real challenges I've encountered emerge around orchestration and performance at scale. While dbt handles transformation DAGs elegantly, integrating with Airflow required planning to avoid duplicate logic and scheduling conflicts. For managing data from multiple sources, I've found that solutions like Windsor.ai simplify the upstream, consolidating data from various APIs and platforms.Given your junior team's situation, I'd recommend starting with dbt Cloud despite the cost, the GUI, builtin scheduler, and easier onboarding reduce the learning curve compared to Core's CLI-heavy workflow.

The teams that realize the best outcomes change more than the tech. They add things like CI/CD, implementing tools like SQLFluff, dbt-checkpoint, etc. They rethink the whole process not just adding dbt. You also need to worry about improving how data is modeled, because that will have a big impact as well.Many people do use Airflow with dbt including people on dbt Cloud. Why? because the dbt Cloud scheduler is pretty limited. Airflow is the market leader hands down.I have seen large teams work with dbt well and I have seen small teams work with it poorly. Sometimes this is due to their philosophical differences. e.g. not letting dbt manage the dependencies but trying to manually recreate them in Airflow. As for dbt Cloud pricing, it can be an issue as teams grow. Their teams level is limited to one project and up to 8 users, so that becomes an issue when teams pass those limits because prices jump quite high.Google ""dbt alternatives"" or ""dbt cloud vs dbt Core"", lots of resources out there. This week there has been a lot of chatter about dbt Fusion, but if is not feature complete yet IMO and very Snowflake centric.

mubqq79,"I dunno about DE or Apache but what I’ve observed in big companies is…Some management dickhead gets given the cloud keys. Then they implement “governance” which means that nobody gets access. Everything has to go through multiple levels of manual approvals and every change can take days or weeks or months of haggling to get actioned. Nobody is monitoring uptime or performance because that’s the vendor’s job - and they aren’t doing it either. Meanwhile it’s expensive for terrible performance and management are constantly staring at it as a cost and trying to get everyone to plan and justify their usage and keep justifying it; which kills both development and later experimentation and just sucks your will to live. Compare to on-premises. Fast. Probably over provisioned and under utilised. But it’s already paid for so you can develop straight away without having to estimate what it’s all going to cost, experiment and have it go wrong without getting a sudden million dollar bill, it’s so much easier to get access or even a couple VMs spun up with admin access, and you can get what you need done.

I’m not saying this is all companies, but it was my experience early on and have since enjoyed working in cloud settings.What you are describing sounds more like poorly architected cloud platforms versus an issue with cloud computing. The same could be said for an on-prem company where there isn’t a reliable IT team for managing the servers. I never experienced it but you hear about the meme posts of “unpatched servers” so I doubt those are “reliable and performant”Both on-prem and cloud are susceptible to poor architecture, lack of resources with unrealistic demand for budget, lack of in house knowledge, etc. At the end of the day, the tools themselves matter far less and instead require in-depth understanding of trade offs to know what is the right architecture for different use cases.Lastly, on-prem and cloud both have a place in building Data Platforms.

There is also the cloud service market saturation too.Don’t know much about Apache NiFi infrastructure needs but I don’t think that going public cloud or on-prem has anything to do with a certain technology/framework, there is so much more at stake here, business-wise.

Not only do they not have the budget allocated to hire full time permanent IT staff, they usually don't have managers skilled in building or maintaining technology infrastructure teams. They also usually don't have the culture required to do site reliability properly. Imagine at Bank XYZ you ask for a new server. You have to call the IT team, they have to call their manager, get approval, the guy who buys server racks is on parental leave, sorry you'll have to wait for 3 more months. Not to mention, the manager of that team decides to de-prioritize your request because guess what, when Bob Servers came back from leave he got a better offer from Google and left. Or in hardware companies you often have tons of people who can CAD, but a handful who can code. You're only thinking from the perspective of the TECHNOLOGY. It's not about the TECH.

They can't recruit developers, they can't retain developers, they can't manage developers, they don't have code quality standards, the limited devs they have are swamped with managing legacy infrastructure that sucks because it was built on top of technical debt and needs to be refreshed.Now, if AWS or Google or Azure come along and say, ""hey you can store 300Gb in object storage for $30/month and we handle patching/security etc."" do you think anyone in these companies would say no? If you're the only data engineer in company ABC that makes widgets for robots, do you think you'd say ""actually let me configure an on premise data center all by myself, configure all the users, and install Ni-Fi and also let me patch it and renew certs and everything else all by myself, and when my boss yells at me to take shortcuts to please people that don't understand software I'll tell them no"" Do you really think that will fly?

Are you talking about like adding columns or adding new fact and dimension tables? Any data warehouse will require maintenance, add new features, etc. but if you are doing a regular major rework, that is either a business issue or you may need to consider evaluating a skill gap on your team around data modeling.Lastly, this would be a poor KPI. Like some other folks of said, it would be similar to counting lines of code. If you are looking for some good KPIs, general ones that I’m a fan of are:1. Data Quality time to resolution. How long does it take from when a data quality bug is reported to it being fixed.2. How many Data Quality issues get through to end users. If you do not have a good data quality test suite in place, you will end up with a lot of bad data getting presented to end users which loses trust and can potentially be costly to the business.3. Data Platform uptime. The percentage of time the data platform is available and appropriately supplying data. An example would be is if you have a pipeline fail and new reports can’t be generated, that would be counted as downtime.Hope this helps.

This will let ClickHouse run your queries in literally milliseconds.e.g. suppose you have logs that have the columns: id (unique), timestamp, app, machine, country, message. Where each app runs on many machines and each machine is in a country.Here you want to set the ORDER BY such that the lowest cardinality items come first. Since you have few distinct countries, more distinct machines, many distinct apps and very many distinct timestamps it should be:ORDER BY (country, machine, app, timestamp)This will store the data sorted on disk in a way that will make GROUP BYs very efficient. You can expect queries of under 1 second on an 8 core machine.However also note that ClickHouse is very fast. Even if you don’t set the group by optimally it will likely still execute your queries in under 1min.Whilst it’s hard to give exact numbers I’ve given ballparks for what you can expect for illustration to help you decide whether you want to do it or not.Edit: another thing to note is that ClickHouse will compress your data to speed it up and use less disk.

The way our program is structured is around 6 months for the learning plan (since they are undergrad students we don’t expect/require previous experience or extensive knowledge) and the remaining internship period (this can change from intern to intern based on their needs/progress) is spent allocated on project (usually the same one).We don’t have any official rewards system, but as a team our approach it to give the interns opportunities to explore according to their development and interests.

musg0bs,definitely in BigQuery my approach would be to process the raw event data delivered by Google and save the events and columns (event params) you really need in another table (still in BigQuery) - to reduce cost partition that table by event\_date and cluster by event\_name - in all future queries if you filter by one of these columns you can further reduce cost also you should look into which billing model (logical vs. physical) is better for youafter that you have two options a) transfer this processed table (this can be a incremental daily load) to Redshift and do further transformations/analytics there b) do transformations in BigQuery and save results in tables and then transfer these tables to Redshiftyou probably want to choose a) because AWS is your primary ecosystem and you want to use dbt there,Kobosil,2025-05-28 23:22:26,4,dataengineering,t1_mus9vwe,False,

mutzeq1,"Gotcha! Thank you for the clarity. This is actually a project I've completed recently - moving processes from legacy to Fabric PaaS. Yes! A lakehouse definitely can be the origin for a dataset and be the only 'source' for this data. The important aspects to consider before choosing to use the lakehouse as the origin location for the data will involve your governance and auditing practices, how robust your lakehouse setup is, how reliable your processes are to ensure proper testing / auditing. Etc. Its the same concern you'd have keeping a data set in any location. In reality, depending on your use case and how your data sources store the data once its extracted, once your lakehouse ingests the data from the external sources, the external source may not always maintain a copy of that data, leaving it only in the lake of the lakehouse. Same sort of idea as using the lake & lakehouse as the data origin for a 'new' dataset that isn't derived from a raw external data set. If you're performing transformations on the raw 'bronze' or even 'silver' data, you are creating new datasets likely being held ONLY in the lake or lakehouse, unless you then moved those datasets into a different warehouse or system.These new transformed datasets may be derived from the raw external data, but they are new datasets in tables in the lakehouse. I think you'll find lakehouses to be powerful and friendly for rule-based processing. If the lakehouse is ONLY being used as a glorified ETL platform, it's kind of a silly misuse of the power. (If you have a strong data governance program requiring you to maintain storage / system of record elsewhere, then obviously the lakehouse is not the long term storage place. But this has not been the case in my experience, outside of heavily regulated industries... which generally have so many redundancies in place the data ends up living in multiple places )For clarity in how this is possible: constraints being business setting the rules and editing the data set.im not sure exactly what platform you're working with or what type of lakehouse you have, but an example way to do this for microsoft fabric: 1. Create a rules table that lives in the Fabric Lakehouse (Delta format).2. Let business users edit those rules (via Power BI, powerapps, excel ).3. Build a processing logic (in Notebook or Dataflow) that applies the rules to a dataset. 4. Trigger the Fabric pipeline when rules change or on a schedule.5. Store the final result back in the Fabric Lakehouse. Because the users can change the rules themselves, be mindful to keep a table with every recorded change if you're concerned about data loss or potentially having a need to review the intermediary changes that occurred on the datasets.[Big ND energy over here - hope the details help]",nomdeplume2,2025-05-29 05:07:34,2,dataengineering,t3_1kxzcuu,False,

If you let business users run SQL you are significantly increasing the risk.If you are determined to go down this route then I would ensure that the data model presented to users is as simple as possible with limited opportunities for users to make things up for themselves - so this probably means creating views that pre-join your tables and where all calculations are pre-defined, and then only giving users to these views, not the underlying data.I would still limit them to running simple SELECT...

However, with dltHub, looks like it streamlines this quite a bit.And because dltHub is just Python, it fits well into Airflow.I like Dagster because when I was evaluating the local developer experience between it and Airflow, Dagster was better. Also, since I regularly use dbt in projects, Dagster has native support for dbt versus with Airflow, where you need to use Cosmos via Astronomer to do the same (otherwise you dbt models are just a single node). Lastly I conceptually liked its approach to being asset-centric versus workflow-centric. Airflow has recently addressed this in 3.0 but I was doing this evaluation 2 years ago so that wasn't a thing then.That being said, I've never spent much time with Airflow so I don't have strong opinions against Airflow. Airflow is definitely the industry standard and with their 3.0 release, they shored one of their weakness by adding the concept of assets.Lastly, I am by no means saying you should migrate from Airflow -> Dagster. You have Airflow up and running and Dagster is not going to solve your current problems and in fact, migrating would more than likely just create new problems.I think dltHub would be worth looking into.

So that you can do the solution in a naive way and still get a passing, because is what I actually care about as a dev. You are able to understand and solve the issue, not that you can do in the most efficient way, that you only need to do it as a refractoring after it has been assessed that we need performance for that specific task.Classic example is to be able to do what they ask for string 10\^12 carachter long in less than 200ms.And that's bad for two reasons:1. A requirement like that in a professional setting would have probably been stopped at the source: why do you have a string this long, and do we really need a string this long ?2. A lot of times, the DP solution is worse than the native solution for smaller sets. Something simply because it's harder to understand and as a general rule of thumb you want to make your code easy to understand, and also because sometimes is just less efficient for small sets because it requires some overhead work that the naive solutiomn won't need and while the naive solution is 0(n\^2) instead of O(log(n)) for strings less than 200 carachter the naive solution can be faster.",LordAmras,2025-05-27 06:00:30,3,learnprogramming,t3_1kwbj94,False,

Compared to PHP or Node, where you pull in tons of packages just to start writing any code, it's a really nice experience. Creating a new project is literally just creating a `.go` file and writing code.On top of that, the language surface is small and can be learned very fast, there is depth to it and gotchas you'll eventually, sooner or later, come across, but at that point you're already writing useful code.It also builds into a single binary which is easy to distribute, it has a far smaller memory footprint than Node and significantly faster start times. The builds are also very fast, making the development cycle very fast, almost like PHP or Node (in watch mode).Also, Go is often praised for its concurrency model.The syntax and paradigm of Go doesn't fit everyone, the language is definitely less expressive than TypeScript, and its type system is more rigid, at times it leads to lengthy code, but it tends to be easy to follow and understand, even if wordier than others.Go is just pretty good.

It's got just enough features to be powerful, but few that lead to bad design patterns. This also means that whole teams can learn it quickly. I have presided over a team learning Go and getting them ramped up, it was fun and straightforward.2. It has a static, strong typing system, which both eliminates a whole category of errors found with languages with dynamic type systems, and frees up computational resources that dynamic languages use to reason about data types. If you like data correctness and unambiguity, you'll like Go.3. While garbage collected, automatic garbage collection is great in 99% of cases and you're likely never going to run up against it in your day-to-day. Also, and sorry for burying the headline, but **Golang is almost as fast as any other compiled language like C** but monumentally safer and free of a vast majority of memory pointer errors (the biggest source of critical errors in compiled software).4. It produces all-in-one binaries that run. *And a cross-compiler is included.* Want to compile for Linux on ARM64? Windows on x86-64? NetBSD running on a PowerPC for some reason? Go's got you covered.5. Along with 4, the included tooling is fantastic - one download and unzip, a slight modification to your shell's rc script, and you're cruising. You have a compiler, a robust stdlib, a linter, etc.There are a couple of pitfalls though:1. It can hard to be understand at first how files, directories and packages are related to each other. 2. When you tread the usual, safe paths Go is absolutely phenomenal.

I don't mean runtime error, this isn't like exceptions that propagate. I mean **no error**. The call seems successful, except you get nulls as a result. Nulls which you can't easily check for: see above.At this point I should note here that for a string value, null == """", for a number, null == 0, etc. Fun!So, what's this simple idiomatic and ugly way to check for error from the last call i hear you ask??You... you compare its second return value with a null........ go figure.Go is basically what you get when you take C, add garbage collection, and prohibit pointer arithmetics. That's the good side of go. The bad side, you're essentially in a stripped down C.They try to be ""clean"", yet keeping all the C weirdness. Like \* in arguments meaning the thing is a pointer, but \* everywhere else meaning the thing is no longer a pointer. But some things are pointers even without the \*, and you need to remember which ones those are, because that dictates how can you check those for null values.For some strange reason you can't do nested struct literals. Also, you need to call some built-in initialization things to properly initialize a hashmap. Good thing is, we now have generics. Bad thing is, they're weird, don't work on methods, and they overload the interface syntax for type definitions.I actually like their OO in theory, because having methods separate from the structs allows for multimethods. Except go doesn't have multimethods.Instead, they use ""interfaces"" who's main feature is that they convert null pointers into semi-null pointers, which don't equal to null when you compare them with null, but then fail on null pointer reference anyway.Despite this, it's not actually that bad, if you embrace all the discouraged practices, which the standard library devs use everywhere anyway.It's pretty neat for small and performant production level projects. Just don't use it for anything big. It doesn't have the abstractions necessary.And if you can't make big projects, this makes their insistence on having a fast compiler pretty strange. I guess they need it to be fast to churn through all the copy pasted code.It's worth learning I'd say, it has its use and does have some redeeming qualities.But the community of apologetics is so high, you'd think that this whole thing is just a front for a large copium smuggling cartel.",paperic,2025-05-30 10:52:38,20,learnprogramming,t3_1kyxbmi,False,

Don't believe the promises startup will make and if you're either bored or tired of a low pay then jump ship to a bigger company, this time ""the bigger the better"" you want this second company to be crazy big, avoid big companies whose main focus isn't technology, i.e. prefer Uber instead of Lenovo, streaming at Disney rather than IT at Boeing. There you'll learn about big scale and other engineering practices, this is where you go from midlevel engineer to senior, but to enter these companies sell yourself as a senior. Again be proactive, don't limit yourself to be a developer, you should also do the deployments, monitoring, become a generalist that goes deep. At least 3 years in a company like this will do. Don't fall in to the politics governing these big companies, you're there to learn, let them play their little games.After that the world is your oyster, you should be looking for companies that are surfing a generational wave, for example nowadays looking at Anthropic or OpenAI would be good, every ~10 years or so there's a big trend you should follow, personally I've found my sweetspot is remote companies of around 100 people, maybe 50 engineers, not everything depends on you but you still have impact on the future direction, no politics and no drama. Aim to at least double the pay every-time you switch companies, and during interviews never reveal what did you get paid at the previous job, at some point it would be almost impossible but if you're good you might get lucky.Good luck!...or enroll in a bootcamp.",zzantares,2025-05-29 20:29:11,3,learnprogramming,t3_1ky8gni,False,

Breaking down a task and putting it into code is still not easy for me. It really just takes time for the specific use case, it'll take a few iterations of design, or a completely new design in the end. It'll never be perfect, there is no perfect, but there's good enough, and good enough works until there's another good enough to compare it to. This is especially true when writing a one-off program, you don't know how much time invested into each component is worth, so those programming design patterns are now weighed with your desire to get something to work.

Start with FCC and do the html/css/JS content until you finish it, get painfully bored, or feel like you're spinning your wheels. When you're ready to apply the js skills from FCC, start odin project for web development -- it'll show you how to use all of the syntax you've learned to build real things. Odin is particularly good because it's project-based and doesn't hold your hand, but for these reasons, it's good to have some syntax knowledge before getting too deep into it, IMO. It also teaches you common non-code skills that are necessary for building software in web context: version control (git/github), IDE/code editor setup, linux env setup (esp important if you're not on mac), basic terminal usage etc.That's the path I took, and I don't think I'd be where I am today if I hadn't had FCC and Odin. I stayed 100% focused on js, and if you're going for web, I'd suggest you do the same -- it will speed things up if you focus on one language. And with node, you can write backend in js as well. The earlier you get used to typescript, as well, the better.By the time I got semi-competent w/ React through Odin, I actually did a bootcamp.

Private tool servers, private agents, refactoring and tightening up RBAC on APIs to accommodate more dynamic access patterns... those are things that there won't be one vendor for. Those are the things that take you from chat app party trick to wildly better UI and capabilities for business systems.Also I'll note that just like the pre AI tech scene, the vast vast amount of positions will be not in innovation and R&D but in application development. Every shop will be building AI apps and especially extending and refactoring their existing systems to leverage AI, and the primary skill set will be building, not working at the bleeding edge of technology, but developing applications for it. UX is about to go through a bigger revolution than the smart phone. This change is going to make backends be designed differently. And platforms. There's about to be a ton of dev work, even with our shiny new tools that let us build feature X much faster than we could build it 5 years ago. We'll find ways to leverage lower experienced contributors, it just won't be endless frontend feature factories; demand for said features will go down with AI powered UX (not bolted on chat bot bs), and where they are needed, AI slop can handle that.

Same for index\_of, also O(n) time.So, completely disregarding the correctness, you have three calls to O(n) functions in your simpler approach, making the overall runtime far worse for large inputs. (EDIT for clarity: The inside of the loop changes from O(1) to O(n), so the entire algorithm changes from O(n) to O(n²), because of the outer loop)If you want to see it for yourself, choose a large integer (like 10\_000\_000) as your target, and only fill the array with random integers of less than half it's size.

muv5xrk,"searching for a given key inside a hash map is roughly an O(1) operation (depends on the implementation of the hashing function, but lets say it's O(1)). however, searching for an element inside an array (in this case, a python list) is an O(n) operation (with n being the number of elements inside the array), which means you are going to scan the array linearly looking for your element. if you do this linear scan for every element on your array, the time completixy of your full algorithm will be O(n\^2). there isn't a problem with it per se, but if for every n array elements you're doing n\^2 operations, your algorithm becomes very inefficient for dealing with arrays that have a really big number of elements.in contrast, your algorithm that uses a hash map (in this case, a python dictionary) has a total time complexity of O(n \* 1) (which is just O(n)), which means it scales linearly with the number of elements inside the array.it's also important to point out that there is a memory trade off in this case, because you're using additional memory to store the key-value pairs of the dictionary (in order to do faster lookups for the complement you're searching for).",rodrigowb4ey,2025-05-29 11:31:41,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ky7n2p,False,
muvpr4r,"So, as a baseline for Two Sum, I have some old times of like 50ms in Python 3.

To be more specific, you have to completely iterate through the array in the time it takes the hashing to complete. That said, I've played around with a problem that fit this scenario, and the performance difference was negligible on an array with a max size of 20 elements in Rust. Unless you're aiming for sub-ms optimizations, and have a problem that is uniquely suited, hashmaps are pretty much always going to be faster.",iamnull,2025-05-29 13:32:07,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ky7n2p,False,

I work in web dev.If I was starting out again, I’d do the bare minimum to understand how to debug on my own and learning how to Google and find things on Stack overflow.After becoming barely proficient enough to generally get through difficult tasks that approach, when needed, then I’d stop utilizing that approach for learning. I’d then open up several AI models with free chat samples of their higher-end models (usually in the form of free credits that reset daily), and then I’d start building tons of projects.The AI assistance I’d use to help me understand things and identify unknown unknowns. You can’t just use it to build everything for you. Then you’re not a programmer, just a prompter. The goal is to use it faster than you’d have used Stack Overflow or Google to learn the same things.After building tons of projects, I’d get the experience taking a few live, such as web hosting, figuring out DNS, live database, live authentication, etc.After doing this, I’d research best security practices and go back through projects implementing them, and also trying to break them, to get a real-world understanding of how many insecure things you just built with AI’s help. AI isn’t thinking of security. You need to be. I’d download Burp suite, and learn the basics of using it. This is great for learning how to compromise your system and find vulnerabilities. You will find vulnerabilities. If you don’t, it’s not because you don’t have any. It’s because you can’t find them.I myself am still getting better at the security aspect of things, so I can’t give you much more advice there, but that’s a starting point!The thing is, I’m providing the value that many coworkers pre-AI were providing with much more years of experience than me. You need to use it to your advantage and speed up your learning to catch up and overtake many of them.You also need to acknowledge that you are in a competitive field, and you are competing with many smart people. You need to acknowledge that if you want to grow faster than others, you need to do what 99% won’t. For me, that was working longer hours for experience. It was jumping into hard tasks for experience. It was pushing for more work and opportunity and legacy code work and bigger features and more bugs.

I think there are a few who it scares, because of how fast I caught up to them.The thing is, they’re working 9-5. I was willing to work 9-5, or 9-9, or 9-5 then midnight to 4, or over the weekend. It isn’t about the money. It’s about the experience. I don’t get paid more as a salaried individual. You need to acknowledge that it’s about the short-term suffering for the long-term investment.Finally, place yourself in positions where you’re not the smartest in the room, or the highest on the totem pole. If you’re the top of the food chain in an area, leave. It’s a waste of your time unless you’re building up experience by sharing to those with less experience. You need a bit of both. Sharing to others, and learning from others. Look for engineering meet-ups in your area. I was lucky to go to one with all staff and principal engineers, as the sole junior. Just being around them causes you to learn immensely. If you go to a meet up, and it’s primarily people in your own skill level, then leave.In code, don’t get caught up in the little picture. Remember the big picture. Sometimes, things should really be left a little less perfect, or maybe not as clean, if they’re very leaf-node-like. Focus deeper on the root areas of the code base, that affect many things.In the end, it also depends on your goals. My goal was (and is) to move up as quickly as possible, to make as much money as I can, as quickly as possible. My goal is to get higher quicker so that I can r/FIRE when I want to, where I want to, if I want to. I’m already in a position to coast FIRE. I am doing this for my freedom, and as a passion to program. You need to know why you’re doing this. Find your why. Remember your why.

HTML + CSS, the default option for simple sites 4. JavaScript for interactivity 5. Python/PHP (or other languages) for server implementationsThe ""correct"" choice really depends on what you plan to make and what you plan to use it for.The long answer: HTML is technically not a full-fledged programming language, but more a tool to build the skeleton of the website. Basics you can mostly learn in a day/week. CSS is for everything style (fonts, colors, layouts, ...) and works as addition to HTML. For real-time interactivity, you need JavaScript. There are variations, but JS is the only language supported by basically all browser, which is why it is the go-to programming language for this.If you want your page to have the ability to save/access data, through a database or multi-user interactivity or such.. Then you generally need to have a programming language on the web server. PHP was most common for a long time, but nowadays you see a lot of people use Python instead. You can generally use any programming language you want on the server, it will effectively read data coming in from web pages, and produce web pages as output. It also deals with a file systems or databases.Unlike HTML and CSS, any programming language will take a lot of effort to master.

I think learning ""the hard way"" like this is quite good but autocomplete/suggestions make getting the syntax right a lot easier.A few tips/useful sites:* [MDM ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)\- this should be the first place you look things up, its THE reference and is well written, easy to understand and has good examples * [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/guides/) \- I've linked to the guides section, whilst there's some advanced stuff here their guides/cheat sheets for flexbox and, lengths and media queries are always useful* [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/elements) \- Firefox has similar, use the one you like.

On free code camp when doing the test projects you can click the button at the top right to open the preview in a new window, this will mean the dev tools for that window don't show the code editors which can be confusing.* [BEM](https://getbem.com/naming/) \- At some point you'll start building more complex things and have a convention for how to give things names consistently helps keep your CSS readable and reusable. There are other conventions but I like this one.* [CSS Variables/Why frameworks are good](https://coreframework.com/) \- Free code camp introduces variables super late which can build bad habits. As a general rule you never want hard coded values in any code, anywhere. It makes code hard to read and hard to modify in the future. Defining things like font sizes, colour palettes, spacing and border radiuses upfront makes everything a lot easier down the line.

mu5ufnh,"Well, no, but also yes.CSS isn't confusing at all, it is, especially with changes made the last three-five years, a very well structured language to express how you'd like the design and layout of your HTML-document to look.However, most programmers suck at visual design, at understanding what looks good, what the rules are, what things are called, and how to plan or even talk about the design of a document. They often prefer some pre-baked incantations that they can just throw at the page, so it will look like every other page out there. Which is probably why Bootstrap became so popular in the first place, and why Tailwind is so popular now.CSS is very, very, very different from HTML and JavaScript - HTML is a structure, it is easy to see if one element is before, after, inside or outside another. And JavaScript mostly is a list of lines, all being executed one after another, so that's also pretty easy to understand. But in CSS there isn't really any structure, just a bunch of rules that more or less all apply at the same time.Some parts of CSS has to do the the individual elements, how they look, how much space they take up, or where they are in relation to other elements. Other parts of CSS has to do with the layout, how an element layouts other elements inside of it. Yet other parts of CSS has to do with how an element is layouted by the parent. And you don't really write the rules, you just set some values on some properties that is used by some algorithms. So it is a bit like programming where you can only change the values of variables - difficult.I think that this recent video from Kevin Powell: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-95kJ0eyzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-95kJ0eyzQ) gives a good introduction to understanding how to understand CSS :)",peterlinddk,2025-05-25 12:36:11,2,learnprogramming,t3_1kuyfqt,False,

Python or NodeJS, or some other language. That basically opens a port and accepts HTTP connections. The usual data transfer format is JSON. Your API is basically the gateway and processing in front of the database. You send requests in some format, say the expressions the user enters, and the API takes your requests and writes them to the database.When your page loads, or some user-initated mechanism like a button, your web app will make a request to load the history from the database.Then you will need some function to manage the history, i.e. delete it.This of course is quite involved at your stage. A good thing about programming is that you can build simulations of what you need. Make an interface (a set of functions) for managing history in your web app. Then implement it as modifying some array in memory.

For instance, if you want to support the operation ""return 10 most recent calculations"", you might decide that will be done by making a GET request to `/api/recent`, and the response will be a JSON object with a particular structure.Then you write code in your backend server that handles requests to that URL by making the appropriate query to your MongoDB server (using the MongoDB client API) and returns a response formatted however you want it. Your frontend can then make requests to the `/api/recent` URL using the browser's Fetch API (or any number of wrapper libraries around it).Writing an HTTP server in nothing but Node is doable but you have to deal with a bunch of low-level details yourself (e.g. URL parsing and routing).

muvxdru,"""Documentation"" is a pretty general term and typically falls into a number of sub-categories with different use cases:* API documentation: what classes/methods/functions exist, what arguments they take and what they return. This is useful a reference for people who *already know* how to use the library in question and need a reminder. Also a nice way, once you know how to use the library generally, to fully explore all the things it can do. e.g. what methods exist on \`class Router\`* Guides: Explore a single topic in *depth* ""How to route incoming requests in Framework X"". Good for seeing how classes/methods/functions can be used to solve real world problems in a single focused domain. E.g. [https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html)* Tutorials: Explore a set of related topics in a library (perhaps in combination with other libraries that commonly go together) in *breadth* to accomplish some real world task. This is what most blog articles and video how-tos are going to be. E.g. [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjItgYqIzJ9WGy9WMf-44DXHB\_7aWwJMc](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjItgYqIzJ9WGy9WMf-44DXHB_7aWwJMc)* Books: Explore a set of related topics in a library (perhaps in combination with other libraries that commonly go together) in *breadth and depth* to accomplish some real world tasks.

Learning, and indeed authoring, code is considerably more than answering a question or completing a task. As you read API docs for one method, you stumble upon another that might better solve your problem. When researching ""how do I route with an optional parameter"" you also learn a bit about how the library processes routes in order; a month later a ""weird routing bug"" has an obvious and simple solution to you (""this route just needs to be higher precedence"").To write new code you need to read existing code, sometimes code right where you're working, sometimes code many hops away in a callstack. The more you read, the more you slowly build up valuable context about the code in totality, the better your future code comes.The acceptance criteria for AI tools in their current form is the same as an incredibly eager intern or early career professional: ""Well, *it works"".* A large application that is an accumulation of tasks completed to a ""well, it works"" level becomes increasingly difficult to understand and change.

There is always a constant set of concepts that underlies a lot of programming paradigms. Have a good grasp over those. Other things are a matter of comfort, and you can always re-learn and remember once you start working back in a language, framework etc.To specifically answer you:1. It is definitely okay to go with web dev and frontend path now. 2. Use LLM as a resource to learn. Write code to do simple things and make projects. And show that code to LLMs to ask for improvements and suggest conceptual lackings that are present in that code. 3. Titles are unimportant imo. Learn as much, and be ready to learn when you have a job. What matter is the ability to learn. 4. If your parents are asking for you to get a job, prioritize good learning environment.

This is called a foreign function interface. You see it most often with C because C is so old and has a well defined, unchanging way that functions are compiled.And the third way is the one you know- send bytes to another program in a defined format like json or xml and deserialize it on the other side.

The goal is not to memorize how to do everything, but to just do a lot of simple things until it's conceptually super easy, then you can try something one step harder.For instance, if you told me to make a chat app right now, i could easily break it down into, ok, some kind of client with a UI, prompt for user input, then we have to send the input to the server, then, ok, the server has to be python or node or whatever, then we have to store all the chat sessions that come in, and propagate messages to the receiving end, then that client needs to process it and display it in the UI, and maybe cache some stuff or whatever. Then I could just go implement one little thing at a time and make sure it works as expected, and see if other little surprises crop up.But I can only do this because I spent so much time at one point just making trivial client and server, or just making a trivial web UI that does nothing, or just really basic data structure stuff, etc.You also need to have a reasonable environment where you can run your code very often comfortably, and be ready to print things or use a debugger to inspect what's going on.

The medium wheels are a bit more case-by-case but generally you shouldn't re-invent these wheels, either, without a good reason.

muqkz8j,"I think it's important to have a diversified interview prep.Leetcode is a *part* of it, but you also need to be prepared for more general questions. Honestly leetcode is only maybe 20% of the prep I do when I decide to job hop. Most of my time goes towards behavioral prep and STAR scenarios, but a decent chunk of time goes towards very general technical prep. Language-specific terms/concepts, differences between versions if it's relevant (Java 6 vs Java 8 for example), re-reviewing data structures, SOLID, the 4 fundamental OOP concepts, design patterns, etc.Basically a review of all the fundamentals that are things we don't consciously think of during our day to day, but we're doing subconsciously. The exact kinda stuff pop-quiz style interviews tend to poke at.For example, if I asked you what the L stands for in SOLID, and explain it, could you do that right now? I know I couldn't. But when I'm looking for a job, you bet your ass I could rattle off any of those letters from memory and explain them. I *have* absolutely been asked about SOLID/OOP before. I remember one interviewer off-handedly asked me ""What's your favorite design pattern?"". I'm not a theory guy really, so I'm not really thinking about the textbook names and definitions of design patterns day to day.... but I had prepped on design patterns, so I was able to give a great answer that cultivated a good discussion. My answer wasn't ""Builder... because it's the only one I remember"". I got that job.There's a lot of stuff in between a pure leetcode interview and a 2 hour pop-quiz session, most interviews may settle at a natural blend of the 2 types of questions.

I totally get it, no beef here.For you this means: if you see a role where your skills line up, GOOD RESUMES STAND OUT, so invest time in your resume and then invest more time in it.2. Instant resume killersYour resume doesn't tell me what you've been doing the last few years! I know it sounds silly but I've seen some resumes that talk really in detail about tools and languages, and don't talk about... what projects you worked on and how they mattered in the big picture, who used your work, who you collaborated with to make things happen, what defects you saw and what you improved and how you did that.If all you talk about is having taken tickets and turn them to code with lots of languages and tools, I can only assume you're best suited for a role that needs someone to specialise in taking tickets and turning them into code.What I'm looking for is, someone who's interested in joining a team, who wants to learn and help others learn, who wants to improve things, and to build stuff that works which they're proud of. So.... Write your resumes to show me these: make each bullet show some mix of how you've worked with lots of types of people, learned from and mentored them, made small improvements, worked on projects, all while you did the bigger items you want to highlight.Illustrating these will impress me more than a contextless ""Shipped project megazorb in java 21, made a billion""3. Interview stuffI'm always rooting for the candidate. I am also always thinking of my team and thinking, ""how will this person improve us"".

Beyond that, biggest pointers I'd give are\- I pass plenty of people who struggle in technical qualifiersIf you're struggling, don't panic, but don't try to hide it either. The aim of the interview is: get to know what we'll both be like to work with. If you feel like a question or task is about to sink you, this is now a chance to show me how you deal with what seems like a really big problem. We'll have plenty in the role, I'm certain you've seen plenty before, so show me what you can do.\- Never criticise past employers/colleagues. Just don't go there. Even if you've heard that rule and still think ""well this is close to criticism but I'm phrasing it objectively so its ok"", still don't. I don't know why, but people do it a lot. I don't know you or those people and I have know way of knowing if what you're saying is fair or not. Just flip everything to ""I'm looking for $goodthing"" and don't say ""past employer had $badthing"". We can lament bad jobs when you're hired\- Don't lie. I'm not always going to catch it, but when I do, it's just a straight decline. If you don't have a great example of ""tell me a time X happened"", don't make one up, just say: ""I've never had to deal with that exactly, as stated, but I have had to do Y or Z"". These questions are almost always about, how did you learn from bad thing, how did you get around obstacle. If you just make something up there's nothing real and human there and it does show through.

muj8j9p,">I'll do junior stuff and take low end salariesAnd companies won't believe you.One of the most important parts of recruiting is retention. If a company doesn't think they can retain you, they're not going to hire you.Lots of things can make a company think they can't retain you. For example, if you blurt out your salary expectation are $200k, but the company is only able to offer $80k, they're not going to even bother extending the offer. Even if you say ""Oh, actually, I'm totally willing to accept $80k!"", they're not going to bother. You already showed your hand. They know you want $200k, and they know even though you'll accept their offer of $80k, because $200k was your expectation you're going to continue job searching and leave them the moment you get an offer that's more aligned with your expectations.Another example, if you've gotten a PhD and are highly specialized in a niche area of the industry, and the company you're talking to is just hiring for a basic CRUD role... they know you'll be impossible to retain. You got a PhD, you're highly specialized. Even if you say to the company ""I'll be totally happy in your role"", they know it's BS. They know you'll be out the door the second you get an offer that's relevant to your PhD.That same idea applies to you. You have 10 YOE. You can claim you'll be happy with junior roles, and low end salaries, but companies know that's total BS and you'll quit the moment you get a Senior role with a Senior salary lined up. Even if it's the truth, from the company's perspective, they're not going to believe it for a second, and you'll fall into the ""impossible to retain"" category. No company will hire someone they don't think they can retain.All of that said, you can absolutely be a 10+ YOE dev and be part of the team, and code regularly. Most of us do. A Senior SWE is still an IC. A Staff SWE, and a Principal SWE, are still IC's. They still code every day, they're still an active contributing member of the engineering team, their responsibilities just get zoomed out a bit. Instead of looking at things at the single-Jira-ticket level, they might be thinking at the epic-level, or the quarterly-deliverables-level, or the company-wide-architecture-level. You're still extremely technical, you're not a manager. Plenty of people stay an IC their entire career, and you can too.But your problem is you're trying to stay on the IC-route, but aren't actually evolving beyond a junior/mid-level in terms of skills/contribution. So that makes you a very, very, very expensive developer that doesn't deliver on their price tag. And because of the aforementioned issue, companies aren't just going to continue paying you junior level salaries when you're carrying with you 10+ YOE.You need to dive into the deep end, and apply for Senior+ level roles. If you can convince a company you're ready for that role, even if you don't feel like you are, that's how you'll set yourself up for the next 20 years of your career. If you don't do that, you'll find yourself struggling a lot, and you'll claim ""age-ism"", but it's very much about your career path, not about your age.",SouredRamen,2025-05-27 15:49:26,68,cscareerquestions,t3_1kwq4ml,False,

murbal1,"The answer is easy. AI 2027 is a load of crap that is literally coming off house rules table top guessing games. It was written by a lot of people who have vested interest in AI hype staying as high as possible. This paper just happens to come out when we are seeing chatgpt fail to release 5.0 and revising what it's supposed to accomplish down harder than the old 5g definitions. It is becoming more apparent that AI is being used as a marketing tactic to do layoffs and still raise stock prices. AI hype is almost single handedly floating the stock market. The AI 2027 paper was also spread ad nauseam by other people who have even More vested interest in the hype train staying rolling than the authors themselves. Not that I really care what Bill Gates says in a press release. It's not like he is transparently sharing insight or anything, it is also PR and marketing.I'm sure I'll catch plenty of downvotes over it, but you asked where we saw this going ourselves. Personally, I'm of the mind that AI is already showing fundamental issues that more compute won't solve, and there will be a breaking point that VC money stops fueling AI research companies. The public gets compute time on a supercomputer for a Google search summary now. That is not a reasonable business plan, they make no money doing that for you. Why do it? Stock. Google can't be the only giant left behind. Once investment money isn't forcing the business plan to work it'd probably enshitify. Think about how good and revolutionary Uber/DoorDash/AirBnB were when they first came out, and how those disruptor business evolved over time into nickel and dime hell holes. For all of those, we went from the old inconvenient model that had full time employees, to now the gig economy with no benefits and lower wages. We disrupted those markets so good. I'm well aware that I would be considered an AI pessimist, but it boggles my mind at how uncritically everyone is accepting a home brew board game research paper saying we hit singularity in 18 months.

They can afford to be. A few years ago, the bar dropped quite a bit. There's also some argument for practical experience.

muf3c4u,"tl:dr: I'm a full stack dev who is about to get laid off. I've worked at one company for 7 years, and that's the extent of my industry experience. Assuming work is going to be scarce, what other options are out there that i could look into with minimal or no need for additional training? Does that even exist? Trying to be realistic and proactive. Summary: I work on a team of developers for an enterprise company with a suite of proprietary web apps. All .NET/angular & nosql cloud architecture. I was promoted out of QA into development, but have not been given opportunity to progress, or mentorship, so I've had to learn everything on my own through hard won experience and the help of online coding communities. I only recently started using AI tools since I felt early on that it would limit my learning rather than improve it (honestly they only became strong enough to really help significantly in the last two years, anyway. I don't tend to work on stuff that an AI agent from 2022 could reproduce without errors or structural issues). I believe I may be about to be laid off, so I'm looking for advice on how to continue pursuing a career as a developer (aide from just trying to apply everywhere i can, obviously) - or, what adjacent options i could pivot into given I only have an Associates degree.The whole bloody story: I've been a junior web developer for 3 years. Before that I did two years as a QA Analyst and one year of help desk before that. All at this same company. The first year I spent as a developer, I spent a lot of time online doing courses like Pluralsite, MS Learn, OSSU, etc, so I was learning, but in my day-to-day I wasn't being allowed to work on modern infrastructure the rest of the team was working on. Instead, I was made responsible for maintaining a 20 year old piece of software primarily operating on old mvc and web forms. This was mainly to free up the other developers (who are all seniors) to work on the ""important"" projects. So I was spending 8 hours a day on bad examples and barely-functional software, while on my own time trying to learn javascript, .net, c#, angular, react, my sql, rxjs, etc. I have pretty severe ADHD that I'm on medication for... that didn't go well. They knew. I made a lot of mistakes, because it was difficult to apply what I was learning to what I was working on at work. When asked to create a proof of concept in modern architecture or refactor some complex logic, I would constantly be getting confused by outdated coding patterns and structural flaws vs newer stuff like onion and so on. I brought up multiple times that this was a problem and that it was impossible for me to learn anything this way with my disability, and was ignored. It was truly a ""sink or swim"" mentality. Eventually, I was taken off of development because they weren't seeing the improvement they wanted, and given qa tasks. For an entire year, I was not allowed to work on code and was entirely support. My title did not change. They moved me back into dev in 2024 as a ""last chance."" At first this went really well. People were shocked to see how much progress I'd made, because I WAS NOT IDLE during the intervening time. I'd still been studying and coding in my spare time while I was working on QA. I work for a company that has a suite of proprietary web apps used to track their assets, and most development is done in-house. I just helped them release a modern replacement for that 20 y/o flagship product, and being that it was just released, it has a lot of user stories coming in. As you might expect. Several other devs recently left, and all of their defects and user stories were reassigned to me. Because I'm taking the heat for all of these story points, and my performance is being called into question, I've been told-without-words that if I don't improve I'm going to be terminated. The company is young and scrappy, and they ""aren't interested in being a school"". I'm completely overloaded, sometimes literally working 80hrs a week just to keep up with the pace of seniors who have 20+ years of experience, and to be honest it's really starting to affect my health. Based on the way my coworkers are talking about and around me, I feel like it's going to happen soon (possibly this week).This company is hugely toxic (its one of those ""corporate family"" environments), and during this entire process I have never received a significant raise, so my compensation is still on par with a tester. I need to leave. I've needed to leave. But the job market is in the toilet due to the seemingly endless layoffs in our sector over the last years. With recent news from Microsoft, that doesn't seem likely to change. For what is worth: i do really enjoy the work. And my coworkers. But I'm absolutely killing myself over it. I routinely have anxiety attacks. The area i live in is expensive, and I'm not making it to payday as it is. In this economy, I'm looking for any advice on either how to continue pursuing a career in development... or how to pivot into something adjacent. I'm happy to move literally anywhere as we don't particularly like the northeast anyway. To be clear: I'm quite proud of where I'm at now, as far as my capability compared to where I started. I routinely work on tasks that would be out of question for a green junior and these days my code is much more structured and predictable. I have done a huge amount of skill acquisition in the last 3 years and I'm very confident in my abilities (with or without AI). My biggest detractor is my education status which stopped at Associates degree due to health and family issues. Thanks for reading. Any advice is appreciated.

When I first joined I was super confused and a lot of my coworkers were extremely smart and had this inner motivation to go above and beyond at their job that I lacked. I’m not a lazy or dumb person either — I have lots of hobbies outside of work and I do my work well enough. I even enjoy it sometimes. But I still often felt like I was a “bad employee” or “not cut out for this industry” because I didn’t care to think much about my job after working hours. I’ve had brief feelings of this again as I’ve been looking to change companies. All the job descriptions and requirements are loaded with expectations about who you ought to be and what you ought to value (e.g. “must be PASSIONATE about building highly scalable, available tech,” “must be HUNGRY to learn about unfamiliar tech and to challenge the status quo”, etc). Like.. I enjoy coding and solving problems well enough, but ultimately I’m looking for a job to pay my bills and to save money for retirement. It’s logical to expect certain skills, but why these intangible personality requirements? Why isn’t it enough to know Java/AWS and to have experience building scalable systems? Why am I expected to *feel* a certain way about these things? Am I really an inferior candidate because I don’t wake up every morning maniacally excited to build a feature? I don’t have a lot of advice persay. But what I will say is that as time has gone on, Ive come to a place where I don’t care about meeting these expectations lmao. Like there’s so much more to life. I have good friends, a good partner, things I love to do, and valuable qualities beyond how obsessively I think about building software. I’m thankful for my job and the learning and resources it’s provided me. But I don’t care as much as these companies tell me I should and that’s okay. I’ll fake it when I need to but I won’t betray myself just to feel adequate or whatever. That’s all to say.. I think what I’ve realized at this point is that there isn’t anything wrong with me. I’m just a normal person trying to live a decently happy, balanced life. It sounds like the same is true for you. If anything, there’s something deeply wrong with this culture we’ve created where we not only expect people to work a lot, we expect people to center their entire identity and passion around making money and being productive/innovative for a corporations benefit. It’s extremely disingenuous and it coerces us into devaluing ourselves and our own happiness.Anyways, that was longer than I expected. But hopefully gives some useful perspective! Good luck!

muebgrm,"Same advice for anyone else who hasn't been able to find a job post-graduation. Apply to jobs, be open to the kinds of companies you are applying to. Don't think you should only work for pure tech companies. All sorts of companies hire developers. You have a gap since your graduation. It may make sense to take your graduation date off your resume. It's your call. Besides applying, studying a mix of LeetCode and practical skills. What do I mean by practical skills? Things you'd be doing on the job.* Do you understand how databases work? How familiar are you with SQL?* NoSQL?* Any cloud experience?* How good are your front-end vs back-end skills? Do you only know a language like PHP, or do you know languages that are more widely in use in corporate settings like Java, Python, JavaScript, React? * Can you build a basic CRUD app that uses REST API endpoints?* Are you familiar with Git? CI/CD pipelines?Those are a few things to get you started. I worked as a contractor at a large financial institution for a while. They were trying to fill some roles with people who graduated from a boot camp. 5/6 candidates could not answer extremely basic questions. I know everyone needs to live, but one guy said he had been driving Uber for a few months, and he seemed to have forgotten everything. The one person who was stronger ended up getting another offer elsewhere. While LeetCode has gotten more popular, there are still companies that don't use it. A challenge is finding a balance of what to study, etc. Some recruiters will tell you what their interview process is like, and others will not. A lot of people on this sub think that applying with what is effectively the same resume over and over will yield different results. Some people get lucky, but you should be trying to improve while you're looking. Otherwise, you're just someone who graduated and couldn't find a job. There are people with plenty of work experience who still don't know anything about cloud or NoSQL for example. There are tools and resources out there to become a stronger developer. It's been years since I graduated, but there's a lot of stuff that school doesn't teach you. One other thing, take any comments from the internet with a grain of salt. Looking through these comments, there's almost nothing of value in there. Remember the joke about most of this sub being unemployed students.

But the same risk exists for ""stable"" startups, and large companies too. What if you take this stable job for the state, and then 3 weeks into your job there's a massive budget cut and your whole department no longer exists? Now you're out on the street again.

mv5m555,"Joining the right early stage startup with leadership that knows what they are doing and putting in the work to excel in it is a cheat code for your career. You will quickly get used to getting things done quickly and effectively and learning how to manage priorities and getting confidence to innovate. You would also likely build a much stronger network and bond with the startup team than the run of the mill mature larger company with a lot more established processes. Most likely you will also quickly outpace the average FAANG engineer in terms of upskilling and improving by far. But this is all assuming you can pull your weight in the startup and not get let go for underperforming in the first month and also assuming the startup itself is a good environment (good leadership/mentors/culture, etc). The answer to this is how risk averse you are and how willing you are to put in work and what your priorities are. The smaller the startup, the more brutal it will be in terms of workload and expectations and “hire fast, fire faster” is the norm but there are benefits to it that I mentioned above. The larger the company is, you will have more stability but the work in general tends to be more boring with less agency, you don’t learn as much as quickly as at a startup, and the amount of process and red tape required to do things get more and more overwhelming. This leads to a lot of incompetent people that are just coasting and coworkers that are dead weight in larger companies whereas in a startup they would be canned in a week.To me, your situation is not about the difference in pay at all. It is not relevant. The startup will have you work many more hours than the government job so if you account for hours worked, the government job would technically be higher pay.",dMyst,2025-05-30 23:10:14,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1kzenit,False,

mug35yf,"English is my first language, but I learned Spanish well enough to present at tech conferences in Spanish, so I do have language learning experience.Regarding A1-A2 active vocabulary: you’ve gotta move a lot of stuff from passive to active vocabulary. Writing may be a good stepping stone to practice output without the time pressure of speaking. r/WriteStreakEN will give you daily corrections. You could even note in your posts that you want corrections that elevate your vocabulary.Also, if you have flash cards, work them in the “I need to produce English” direction. If you don’t have flash cards, maybe get started with some. I had 5000 words in my Spanish study list back when I was studying.Also: read. A LOT. Reading is huge for increasing a person’s vocabulary. Since English pronunciation and orthography are only loosely related, and we’re talking about learning new words, reading along to an audiobook may be wise to ensure you pick up the correct pronunciations.For specifically-tech stuff, watching conference talks might not be a bad idea; you can learn a lot of domain-specific vocabulary that way, and there are a ton on YouTube.Regarding filler words: spend at least one hour a week with a tutor doing conversation practice. If you can do an hour twice a week, even better. This is to get you practicing with the time pressure. As your vocabulary and production under time pressure improve, you’ll spend less time searching for words and trying to hide it with filler words. But also: are you using English filler words/sounds/phrases or ones from your first language? If first language, switch to English fillers. “That’s a really interesting question because well, you know, the thing is, when you consider all aspects of that topic…” is a nice long string of words that give you time to actually think of your answer without it just being “uhhhhh” or worse, a non-English filler like “eeehmmmmmm.”Regarding pronunciation: record yourself repeating after something you’ve just heard. Maybe you watch a technical video and pause and repeat back a sentence. Then play back the original and yourself and compare. You can do a fair bit of accent training this way. You can also hire tutors who specifically do accent coaching. If your native language has far fewer vowels than English (for example, Spanish has 5, and Italian has 7), then you will want to learn some new ones. The two Italian has that Spanish doesn’t (open o and open e) are common in English, but English also has an open i, where the tongue is placed midway between Spanish’s i and e, and the sound in “put” which is midway between o and u.",macoafi,2025-05-27 02:04:30,10,cscareerquestions,t3_1kwbg1q,False,

I was looking at one of my kids homework assignments the other day as she could not figure it out. I started with LLMs but they could not do C allocation and deallocation. Only because the assignment used an int\*\*\*\*\*\* for an array of ints, instead o int\*. It was off by one on every function, because it does not understand anything and is just predicting the next token which breaks down when something goofy is asked for like in the assignment. I only find AI useful for small well defined pieces of code. What would have taken an hour to find on the web and then tweak for my use case, can now be done in a few minutes.

Sure, if we get a higher salary the recruiter gets a slightly bigger cut, but the recruiter would rather lowball you and get you placed fast. The higher the salary you demand, the harder you are for them to place. They'll do anything they can to get you placed *anywhere*. A cut of a lowball $60k offer is better than a cut of $0. They don't care if the company is toxic, boring, and a bait & switch, they get paid either way the minute you accept the offer.I'm not a fan of 3rd party recruiters.
