Probably the most crucial part of any data warehouse pipeline. It is really not that hard to implement these days (most modern pipelines and warehouses have multiple ways to enforce it). Prevents 95%+ of data inconsistency issues in production.* Backwards/forwards compatible transfer protocol. My current favorite is Protobuf (or proto-adjacent forks) for its 'data-contract'-iness behavior, but Avro + schema registry works too (though I personally hate having to manage yet one more cog in the flow)* Monorepo your schemas. Slightly controversial take, but this helps definitions/migrations fail at *compilation time*, which in my experience reduces runtime problems by orders of magnitude.* Pick a database that can be locally initialized via a container, and keep an append-only log of all migrations in git. This makes testing so much more reproducible, and makes it quite rare to have unexpected issues in production you didn't find at the test phase.In my experience following most/all of these makes everything else follow naturally in place.",InsertNickname,2025-09-27 06:52:20,54,dataengineering,t3_1nrnvv3,False,

Create one unified **events** table with polymorphic rows: `event_name`, `event_timestamp`, `user_id`, `device_id`, `session_id`, `trace_id`, and a `payload` (JSON/VARIANT) per event. Let the schema evolve by versioning (`event_version`) instead of spawning new tables.* Columnar stores/lakes are built for this. Partition by date/hour; cluster/z-order by `event_name`, `user_id` (and optionally `session_id`). Only break out separate tables for dimensional models or specific serving use-cases (e.g., a narrow “page\_views” mart), not for raw ingestion.* Identity & causality: require source-side IDs. Minimum viable set: `event_id` (UUID), `user_id` (or `user_pseudo_id`), `device_id`, `session_id`, and a `trace_id`/`parent_event_id` for linking (think W3C Trace Context / OpenTelemetry). If long-lived cookies aren’t allowed, do deterministic or probabilistic sessionization early in the pipeline (sliding time windows, inactivity thresholds). Also emit join keys for common patterns (e.g., `impression_id` on view + `click` carries that id).* At your scale (hundreds of millions/day): append-only raw, dedupe on `(event_id)`; compact small files; enforce a schema registry; backfill via streaming + incremental merge; materialize derived marts for sessions, funnels, and attribution.

nh0t2ij,"> Any scalable patterns people swear by?I mean pattern is maybe a bit too much, but I _did_ give a talk at Scala Days this year about why and how we use Scala for a similarly shaped use case (you can find the slides here: https://chollinger.com/talks/, the recording should be on YouTube on the Scala Days channel some time in the future). Our event system has 70+ different shapes, sometimes wrapped in envelopes, sometimes as straight events on Kafka as binary protobufs and I consume them via Flink in 3 distinct jobs. We do some redaction and add metadata.Ignoring the Scala part of it since that wasn't the question, the key points (I did this when I was a team of one) are essentially:- `protobuf`/any version controlled schema that supports evolution- A source of truth for permutations (e.g. an ADT/enum/proto) that stays up-to-date- Code gen: Avro schemas from protobufs (`avro4s` and `scalapb` for us) + potentially metadata injection- Generic, re-usable code (e.g., we have a `Pipeline[A <: GeneratedMessage : Redacted]`, rather than a `EventAPipeline`. All all composed services are generic, too)- Tests tests tests (including generic ones that iterate possible permutations)- CI to enforce said tests (e.g., somebody changes the protobuf and introduces an incompatible type, fail their build and have them talk to you)- Naturally, a scalable database to back this - Iceberg has been treating us well, but I'm also a big fan of Clickhouse, which can do some of the aggregation for youThis is a bit outdated but also has some details on what I did: https://ngrok.com/blog-post/how-we-built-ngroks-data-platform#scaling-apache-flink-scala-and-protobuf-to-650-gbday We don't do any pre-aggregation on purpose, but I suppose you could do that if you wanted to.fwiw you might want to solve #2 first and might even consider a vendor product for it.",otter-in-a-suit,2025-09-30 15:27:36,2,dataengineering,t3_1ntp9ry,False,

I get why Company A feels safe—it’s stable, has nice people, and you’d be in a predictable environment—but if your goal is long-term career growth and building skills that transfer globally, B is where it’s at.Here’s why:1. **Modern, cloud-native stack:** Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift + Spark + Python/Scala + real-time streaming is what the market is moving toward. Hadoop/Spark/Hive experience is still okay, but it’s much more “legacy enterprise” skillset. If you want options in NA or EU in a few years, cloud-native experience will open way more doors.2. **Customer-facing product experience:** Working on something that thousands of companies actually use is huge. It shows you can handle scale, real-time systems, and impact—stuff recruiters notice. Internal ETL for business ops at a big company looks nice on a resume but doesn’t scream “can build product-grade systems.”3. **Fast-paced, growth environment:** Yes, it’s stressful and work-life balance might suck a bit, but that’s exactly where you learn the most. You’ll get exposure to data validation, lineage tracking, fraud detection pipelines—these are highly in-demand skills.4. **International opportunities:** The tech stack + product experience will make moving abroad far easier than internal enterprise ops work. People hiring in NA or EU will instantly recognize those skills.If you want a chill ride and don’t care about moving internationally or building the “modern data engineer” skillset, A is fine.

In hive if you want to create a SCD2 you have to do it in more steps and always with the mindset that you have to move data to another temp or staging table in order to do a final insert with the data you want to 'update'. In iceberg you can just MERGE/UPSERT.2.

The app can still pass the client ID to the API and government governance can still be insured through whatever tool you’re using on the back end, the AI doesn’t need to know anything about your schema and you don’t have to change your ingest or schema at all.All you have to do is teach your AI about your API, use strict templating to constraint output for pre-rolled reports, and, use a more general template and allow the users to request any report their little hearts desire.

So take your time to model *everything*, create proper relationships between entities, build a proper request throttling mechanism for each entity (maybe by using queues) along with a retry mechanism (just check for http error 429 and do exponential backoff for example), write some tests and go with that.A dumb example where let's say the entities are ""product\_summarized"", ""product"", ""region"", ""category"":1. Take note of the rate limits of each entity to configure the request throttling for your script.2. Query the categories & regions once a day to cache their values. 3. Fetch a list of product\_summarized using all the combinations of region and category.4. Fetch one product for each product\_summarized using it's id property.5. Stich up everything together in a main function and run it.Steps 3 & 4 are to be executed under a request throttling mechanism so you don't get rate limited.

Example uses AWS, but this also works on other cloud providers or on-prem.* **Write side (commands)**: Treat *every unit of work* as a message. One SQS queue for list pages, another for detail fetches. A planner Lambda just enqueues “fetch page X with params Y” messages. Each worker Lambda consumes, respects rate limits via a token bucket in DynamoDB, and writes raw JSON to S3. Everything is idempotent (hash of params/page) so retries don’t hurt.* **Dependencies**: If endpoint B depends on A, you gate it with Step Functions or EventBridge rules. Basically, B’s planner only runs once A’s sync run has emitted a “complete” event. No spaghetti.* **Read side (queries)**: Raw dumps go into S3 (bronze), then batch jobs (Glue/EMR) turn that into Delta/Iceberg tables (silver). From there, Athena/Redshift is your query layer. You never couple ingestion logic with analytics logic.* **Watermarks**: A DynamoDB table stores “last successful sync cursor/updated\_since” per param set. The planner reads it to only fetch new/changed data.This split means your ingestion system only cares about *moving data in under the rules of the API* (rate limits, pagination, retries, dependencies).

In silver, UNNEST to a long table of params: eventid, eventname, key, typed value columns. Then pivot only your core, stable keys into typed wide tables per event for analytics. You can materialize a “top-params” view/table and leave the long table for ad hoc or discovery.In dbt, generate the pivot list from a contract file, and run a nightly job that diffs distinct param keys against that contract to flag drift and open a PR. Add tests that fail on uncontracted keys. Avoid storing hot-path params as JSON; use JSON only for edge cases. Cluster the long table by event\_name, key to cut scans.We’ve paired Segment Protocols for contracts and dbt for models, and used DreamFactory to quickly expose cleaned lookup dims as REST APIs for product teams without building services from scratch.Keep raw nested, model a long table, and selectively pivot only what matters.",Dry-Data-2570,2025-10-01 10:11:11,1,dataengineering,t1_nh3nfdl,False,
nguha5k,"I’d be cautious about materializing every parameter as a column. Event data is usually pretty fragile. Developers sometimes change types, rename keys, or send unexpected values. If you’ve locked things into fixed columns, you’ll eventually have to deal with schema drift and painful backfills.That’s why I prefer keeping the materialized layer in JSON. It’s still stored columnar in BigQuery, so you don’t lose efficiency, but you gain flexibility for evolving event structures. Then, if you need “wide” representations for certain use cases, you can always build views on top of the JSON (and even automate those views from your parameters table if you want).One other thing: I’d avoid using a dedicated “parameters table” as the system of record for what keys exist. That approach tends to push business logic into data tables instead of code, and since tables aren’t version-controlled like your dbt models, it makes changes harder to track or roll back.So in short: \- JSON gives you resilience against schema changes and type mismatches. \- Views let you expose wide tables when needed, without locking into a brittle schema. \- Keeping the logic in dbt models (instead of a parameters table) makes it easier to track history and review changes.This way you’re balancing efficiency with long-term maintainability.",PolicyDecent,2025-09-29 15:52:38,1,dataengineering,t1_ngubq04,False,

Bottom line you own it and and run it. This system offers the pub/sub for tables model for ETL.

ngtmb3k,"Dataflow doesn’t auto-magically handle schema drift, you have to design for it. Additive changes are easiest: BigQuery accepts new columns if you enable schema updates, and in Beam you can represent rows as maps or generic `Row` objects instead of hard typed classes. If a column disappears, guard against nulls and missing fields in your transforms. Renames or type changes are trickier, treat them as add + drop and keep a mapping or schema registry to track versions.For API ingestion a simple GCP pattern is: Cloud Scheduler or Cloud Functions to fetch data, push raw payloads into Pub/Sub, run Dataflow for parsing and transforms, and land in BigQuery or GCS. That decouples ingestion from processing and gives you autoscaling and retries.Dataproc is worth using only if you already have Spark/Hadoop jobs or need complex iterative workloads. For most ingestion + transform pipelines, Dataflow is simpler.Schema drift across sources follows the same patterns. For APIs, expect variable JSON and parse dynamically. For files, prefer schema-aware formats like Avro or Parquet, or read CSV headers dynamically. For RDBMS, use CDC tools like Datastream and evolve schemas downstream when columns change.How often do you expect schema changes, and do you need real-time ingestion or is batch good enough? That helps decide how strict to be on schema validation. I work at Estuary, and we handle schema evolution in pipelines without the extra glue code if you want a cleaner option.",dani_estuary,2025-09-29 13:12:19,2,dataengineering,t3_1nsn2hm,False,
ngup5y0,"Decide based on how often schemas drift and whether you need near real-time or batch; that choice drives everything else. If drift is occasional and daily batch is fine: run Dataflow batch, use Beam Row/generic records, enable BigQuery schema updates for additions, treat renames as add+drop and surface a compatibility view, and do type changes via new column + backfill. Always land raw payloads in GCS (Avro/Parquet) for replay. If drift is frequent and you need low latency: use CDC (Datastream or Debezium) to Pub/Sub, a streaming Dataflow job with a mapping table/versioned schema, dead-letter unknowns, and alerts. For APIs: Cloud Run/Workflows pulls -> Pub/Sub -> Dataflow -> BigQuery with idempotent MERGE and throttling. Dataproc only if you already have Spark jobs or need libraries Beam can’t handle well. I’ve used Fivetran and Datastream for CDC, and DreamFactory helped when we needed quick REST APIs over legacy DBs without custom glue.

ngtmqb5,"Kedro can be an interesting choice if you want structure and reproducibility, but it’s not a drop-in replacement for something like Airbyte. It gives you a clean way to organize pipelines (nodes + catalog + config), great for teams that want testable, modular data workflows. The data catalog abstraction is nice since it supports a bunch of backends, and tools like Kedro-Viz make it easier to reason about your DAGs.The tradeoff is you don’t get connectors or managed ingestion out of the box. You’ll be writing Python to pull from sources, handle schema drift, and deal with APIs or CDC. It’s more of a framework than a platform. For batch work it’s nice, but for streaming or dynamic schemas you’ll end up adding boilerplate. You also need something external like Airflow, Argo, or Prefect for scheduling and monitoring.So it’s great if your team is comfortable with Python and wants long-term maintainability, but not ideal if you’re hoping for plug-and-play ingestion. Do you want more control in code, or are you looking for a managed connector-style setup? That’s the real fork in the road.I work at Estuary, and we’ve focused on the managed ingestion side with schema evolution baked in, so if the Airbyte pain keeps getting worse that could be an easier alternative.",dani_estuary,2025-09-29 13:14:47,3,dataengineering,t3_1nsgmm5,False,

If you can get one, do, if it's not possible, you can still make it, but it will be harder. Everything after is just my opinion, I am self taught, but joined in a much nicer job market, but what worked for me and what all my interviewers talked about was:A) My Github was clean, I followed the basic rules, you don't need green square every day but 3-6 days a week shows you're learning your ass off. Every repo has only one project. Every repo has a README.md that explains what it is, why you built it, how you built it, is it done, where can they see it, and anything else you want. The only repo that breaks these rules is one called ""Practice"" where all your code goes when doing small tutorials, practicing stuff, or just playing around. This folder has a readme that says ""Please Ignore this Repo"" or something so interviewers who check know not to bother. You should also be using proper git branching techniques, create feature branches with good names and good commit messages. Show whoever looks that you know how to work on a team and already know the basics, if you don't know them, learn them. B) My portfolio was nice. I didn't make the standard layer cake design, I also made sure to make it really easy to use, I used very clearly labeled sliding drawers to put all the data they could want on one splash page. I got lots of compliments about it. C) My project was a Recipe app that also included a shopping list and meal planner. Most of the functionality was there, that which wasn't was clearly shown in the readme, the design was terrible as I'm not a designer, but almost every interview talked about it in depth about why I built it, what tech I used, and why. Unfortunately now you also need to get past the AI gatekeepers, this is mostly a ""Stuffing your resume with keywords"" game. If it's in the job ad and you can honestly say you've used it, it should be in your resume and cover letter (if used) somewhere. Don't lie about what you can do, but if your roles have all been Angular, but the ad wants React and you work with React at home sometimes, maybe one of your roles was React...The last thing I'll say that helped me a lot is ""Make a story"". Why are you doing this now instead of earlier. Look at your work history and, true or not, make a story about why you've finally realized Coding is your dream passion, because that's what you need interviewers to believe. You were amazing and doing great but ""lost"", then one day something happened that helped put you on this path to your true dream of becoming a coder. Make a story and build everything around it, your portfolio, your projects, whatever you can, the more the better. Practice answers to the obvious interview questions that explore and explain the story. Humans LOVE stories, especially coherent ones with growth where someone is finally achieving their dream. You need someone to take a chance on you, so you have to appear not to just be the best choice, but to be such an amazing choice that the lack of degree doesn't matter as your code is clean, your github is impeccable, your project shows the knowledge needed, and coding is your dream that you're finally realizing.Sorry for length, you **can** do it, but it will be hard.

E.g.: I am implementing some logic where the variable “car_speed” should ONLY change when the operation “accelerate()” is executed. If I had them exposed then an ill advised user (coworker extending my code) might change car_speed directly and break my logic. OOP lets me abstract and encapsulate the logic and values. You have a class. It’s very explicit the values that it is concerned with and it exposes only the things others should be concerned. Then you have inheritance and polymorphism, those have to do with how blocks of logic usually repeat.

Theory of code is great. It’s nice to understand concepts. But truly understanding code comes from writing it. Seeing the same error and then eventually clicking “oh it’s because I put this here, or oh, I see how to refactor this into less spaghetti”Additionally, while C is a backbone language it is considered low level, and you might benefit from taking what you know and applying it to another language. Some are much easier to learn than others. For example, writing a webpage with basic functions (like say writing a blog post) is significantly easier in my opinion than the majority of things you could build in C. Not only is the syntax easier to understand and master, but you get immediate gratification in seeing what you’re doing as you work and change things. E.g. changing the size of text or a container can be immediately seen when you reload the page or even faster if you use a plugin like Live Server.

You just have to enough tutorials to cover: * How to select the correct pancake mix * Shipping it to your home. * How to mix batter * Errors that arise from licking the wisk * How to pour * How to use a spatula without flicking wet batter everywhere. * How to adjust heat on flame or electric stoves.* Once you have all the pieces learned you are leaving tutorial hell. The problem is that when you are in one tutorial, e.g. our spatula example, you aren't even aware of all the other steps that are being ""glossed over"" to teach you just that one aspect. * So you might learn spatula, and then heat, and think Why can't I make pancakes on my own yet! Not realizing there are like 20 more basic tutorial type deals you have to get through just to do that task.* In short I think tutorial hell is a by product of not having a good road map. If you are taking MIT's (Free) Open course-ware. You can look and see how many other courses you have to take to ""Get to the end"" the end being a certain level of education. * But even 4-year degree-ed under grads don't feel like they can step in and do everything. Because they can't. But hopefully they have the tools to lay out and study on their own and create a new plan to teach themselves what they need to accomplish some tasks. * But most of the time they are paired with a ""mentor"" at work that has struggled through the same things.

You could have a sequence of products: std::vector inventory;And then to find your product, you have to search each element until you find it: for(int i = 0; i < inventory.size(); ++i) { if(inventory[i].ID == query.id) { use(inventory[i]); break; } }This search is O\(N\), you have to search up to as many elements as you have to find it. The more elements you have, the longer you search.What if instead we had a tree? struct node { product p; node *left, *right; }; node *root;Imagine if we built this tree of products, where the `root` contained the middle ID product, and `left` contained all values LESS THAN the ID, and the `right` contained all values GREATER THAN the ID. And repeat this rule for every branch of the tree...Well then, for any given ID, starting from the `root`, you've either A) found the product, B) went down the `left` branch, or C) went down the `right` branch. Now as we established, we start with the middle ID, and we divide the inventory in HALF by both sides of the tree.What this means is you immediately determine which half the ID must be contained in, and you have thus cut your search space IN HALF. We don't have to check N elements, we instead check only O\(log N\) elements. The more elements you have, the more efficient the search. Each iteration cuts the remaining search field by half, every time.Of course, you get this in: std::map inventory; //... use(inventory[id]);You can go faster still with a hash table.---Most of the job is searching, sorting, and transforming data. How you store the data and the algorithms you write to access that storage are intertwined. In C++, we get a few standard data structures, a few standard algorithms that are common, typical. Using a vector, or a map, or a hash table... It's easy to forget that these are both data structures AND algorithms hidden behind some convenient syntax; but a `map` implements a binary tree, and binary search!

So the declarations `int x;` and `float y;` will both allocate 4 bytes of memory.But the *interpretation* of those bits/bytes is different depending on the type. So the compiler generates different code to work with them.For instance, the 32- bit pattern `00111110000000000000000000000000` represents the numeric value 0.125 when interpreted as a float, or the integer value 1040187392 when interpreted as an int. And if you want to do something like add the bit patterns representing two numbers, the logic for doing that will be totally different depending on whether they're ints or floats.So if you write the statement `x += 1;`, the compiler generates code to load the value of `x`, perform an *integer* addition, and store the value back into `x`. But if you do `y += 1;`, a *floating-point* addition is performed instead. (And the compiler is smart enough to automatically convert the integer constant `1` into the floating-point constant `1.0` so that the types are compatible.)So in general, the purpose of data types is to help the programmer (and the compiler) keep track of how any given chunk of memory is ""supposed"" to be interpreted.",teraflop,2025-09-28 13:42:37,35,learnprogramming,t3_1nso4uk,False,

Type systems are essentially logical calculi (in fact typed programs are in a very real sense equivalent to logical proofs), and in writing your code (with types) you build up a logical formula that the compiler then can reason about to some extent (which is ultimately what results in it reserving enough space for your data, using the right instructions etc).

Other languages go far further here, allowing you to encode way more intricate properties via types -- which then for example results in dealing with types that don't have \*any\* possible values, or that have values that have no size in memory at all \[and contrary to what you might initally expect these types turn out to be \*very\* useful in practice\]. (An issue with what you wrote is that `int` is not generally guaranteed to be 4 bytes, but that's more of an issue with C and many introductory resources. If you want to be able to say more about the sizes of your data in memory you'll have to use more specific types like `int32_t`)",SV-97,2025-09-28 15:10:43,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nso4uk,False,
ngoac4u,"Depends on the level.At the hardware level you've just got ""bytes"". They're binary values to the hardware, but they're whatever you interpret them to be (numbers, characters, something denoting true/false etc.) in your program.At the compiler level they're the primitive building blocks that language creators wanted to provide to users of their programming language, and they have the interface and semantics they define and build into them (e.g. String in Java appears quite different than char \* in C, despite there being an array of character values somewhere in Java's String implementation).At the language user's level, whatever the language says you have. If it says that int will give you a 4 byte number (for example) then it will.So data types are basically a compiler/interpreter level construct that allows you to represent, store, retrieve, and often mutate, data in your programs. Beyond that it's up to the compiler implementer to define what you write, what you can do with each, what you can't. Often it's not specified how a type is stored underneath, because a programmer may not need to know in certain environments (e.g. browsers).",HashDefTrueFalse,2025-09-28 16:36:24,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nso4uk,False,

I’m currently working remotely in an internship but it’s a challenge, I meet my mentor once or twice a week but it’s only a team’s call here or there. It’s hard to see what’s actually going on and fair it was more frequent towards the end of summer but it’s still not great. Having someone physically beside you where you can see and more freely chat about what’s going on would be a lot better. A lot of the internships advertised around me are hybrid, 2 days in the office and 3 remote. They’re advertised exclusively to college student going to Uni in my city (supporting the local Uni’s). So while there is competition for them it’s a much better chance of securing something. How I got my remote internships:1) I joined the local GDG group (I actually joined the 3 nearest, within a 2 hour drive) and spoke with people nearly any chance I got. Not just about coding but open conversation during intervals or asked what they thought of the talks after. 2) I got lucky and met someone from the same area I’m from, I think it was at a careers event not directly tech focused. He went to school with one of my uncles 20-30 years ago and we had a brief convo about back home. 3) the next time I met him I mentioned it’d be great to just see “What it’s like day to day or the general flow of what devs do? how the online meetings go? What their day is actually like?”. He takes my number and said he’d ask if I could join a meeting with them some time. He’s in management so not directly linked but sat in on some meetings. 4) 2 months mass with no response and out of the blue I get a text asking if I’d like to join an update meeting. 5) from there one of the devs offered to wait on the call and have a chat after. To be honest that’s all I expected to get from it and it was nice just to get that introduction. A week later he offered me some unpaid work just to get a taste of it, I jumped at the opportunity. 6) that was 3 months ago and now they’re on about maybe being able to offer me a paid internship. It wouldn’t be amazing money but roughly equivalent to part time work so I could probably quit my other job and get some real experience. .It’s not easy and I still have another job alongside Uni and the remote work currently. 1) I’m in college 30hr per week. 2) I work 20-30hr per week. 3) and the internship is 16-20hr per weekIt doesn’t give a lot of time off for anything else but ya the experience is invaluable right now. I’d aim for getting directly into a paid hybrid role if at all possible but ya I wouldn’t turn down the Unpaid remote work if it played out that way either.

In Python this looks like this: `if __name__==""__main__"":` In this way your code will only execute if you actually run the file, not if you import it. 3. I like that you commented everything pretty well. Your comments are not very detailed, but they give me a good idea what a codeblock should do very quickly. 3.5. As a tip for comments: Use docstrings [https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) In many IDEs docstrings show up when you hover over a function, do quickly tell you what it does. 4. In line 150, I would suggest using an object, or a dictionary to store the data, since it's closely related to each other. There will never be a case, where you want to keep the vitals of the old patient, but generate a new name for example. This could be done like this: class Patient(): """""" represents Patient data"""""" def __init__(self, name, id, status, vitals, dialogue, is_expected): self.name = name self.id = id [...] [...] type_out(f""Patient Name: {patient.name}"") You already seem to use a smaller version of this as a dictionary in `generate_expected_patient_list()`, so I think unifying both datastructure would be a good idea, especially if you want to develop this game further. 4.5: You also seem to use the exact same line of code `type_out(f""Name: {p['name']}, ID: {p['id']}"")`quite a few times. This could be rolled into the class I suggested above, giving Patient a method to type\_out their name and id. You would then use it in code as `patient.type_out()` for example. All in all your code is structured okay, but for better readability you could thinnk about moving the actions and the new\_day part of your loop into their own functions. This might not look like a benefit in your codebase right now, but if your game logic gets bigger, like a few thousand lines of code bigger, your game loop really should look roughly like this: while True: new_patient = get_new_patient() action = get_player_action() handle_action(action) check_game_over(strikes) check_new_day(expected_patients)Anyways, good job for a beginner :) Keep it up!",Beregolas,2025-09-28 09:35:28,2,learnprogramming,t3_1nsdfoh,False,

Many high-performance ECS systems represent entities as an Integer and map that to the set of components.I’m not sure if this is incidental or an intentional feature, but ECS can have components added and removed on the fly at runtime, and there’s not a huge amount of scenarios where that’s a requirement(plugin systems), and there are at least some where it’s an anti-pattern.

If your hot spots are AI, physics, pathfinding, status effects, or server tick, ECS or a simple struct-of-arrays pass can cut cache misses a lot. Keep components as plain data and systems as stateless functions. Batch adds/removes, avoid per-entity allocation, and use versioned IDs to prevent stale references. Start small: convert projectiles or NPC vision to an ECS-style loop and measure. For engines: archetype ECS (DOTS, Bevy, Flecs) is great for dense queries; sparse-set (EnTT) tolerates high churn. On “render-bound” games: servers and complex sims are often CPU-bound, so ECS helps there.AWS GameLift and Redis handled sessions and state for me, and DreamFactory generated REST APIs over Postgres for ops dashboards and tooling without me hand-rolling controllers.Bottom line: use ECS where data-parallel hotspots justify it, mix simpler patterns everywhere else.",CharacterSpecific81,2025-09-29 16:49:03,1,learnprogramming,t1_ngtnbvv,False,

Abuse prevention is part of the bare minimum requirements.If I go to a website, and a plugin automatically loads some content, and the plugin gives too much ""freedom"" to **some other developer's** code to do what it wants with **my** computer, then the plugin is not fit for purpose.Modern browsers like Chrome and Firefox have put a lot of work into sandboxing HTML/JS code so that it can run *safely* even if the code is untrustworthy. Modern HTML-based webapps give just as much ""freedom"" to developers to make actual content as Flash did -- the existence of [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) is proof of this. But that freedom is kept safely within a high-quality sandbox.The difference is in the implementation, not the overall architecture.

My impression is that Adobe did a friggin amazing job of the rework from AS2 to AS3, but that was another nail in the coffin, because all the old AS2 programs could not be converted. I coded some things to convert from AS2 to AS3 and it was a nightmare.(C# seems to suffer from the problem AS2 had where there was not enough uniformity with web service calls and event handler delegates.)Adobe Flash through AIR did work on the iPad as an app, so it did have its little security sandbox there. It had terrible performance on the iPad 1, but it was totally fixed on the iPad 2.

A heart rate monitor app in a fitness studio with time synced looping video on 16+ iPads displaying the composite heart rates on a 70"" screen all timed with music programs that the owners made on the server.I made about $100,000 from that job.

You need quite a few gates just to add two 1-bit numbers. To add 32-bit numbers, you would need an array of 32 full adders.If you were to simulate this 32-bit adder in software, you would need to iterate over each of those logic gates, fetch its inputs, compute its output, and then pass that output to the next gate(s).

If you just want to model the *desired* behavior of your CPU, you can just write code that emulates what each CPU instruction is *supposed* to do, and that emulation can be much faster.

A few followups if that’s alright; First note: some of my questions may seem irritatingly dumb and I apologize for that as I’ve just begun my journey into learning programming and computer architecture:>It's not really a ""flaw"" in Logisim, it's just that doing a low-level simulation of logic gates is inherently more expensive than a high-level emulation of the same architecture. They're just doing different things.Q1) When speaking of “higher level emulation” vs “low level”, what do these terms imply?>For example: take a look at what a ""full adder"" logic gate circuit looks like. You need quite a few gates just to add two 1-bit numbers. To add 32-bit numbers, you would need an array of 32 full adders.>If you were to simulate this 32-bit adder in software, you would need to iterate over each of those logic gates, Q2)What do you mean by “iterate over each of these logic gates” (I know what iterate means but not exactly sure what it mean to iterate over a single logic gate)?>fetch its inputs, compute its output, and then pass that output to the next gate(s). Your simulation would need hundreds or thousands of CPU instructions to accurately simulate the behavior of the logic circuit.>But if all you care about is the result of the addition, you could get that with a single ADD instruction that's executed directly by your CPU, which would be hundreds or thousands of times faster.Q3)So the emulator he uses is emulating the logism circuit right? So doesn’t that mean the emulator at some level and up moving thru the same amount of logic gates?>In other words, if you're designing a CPU out of logic gates, and you want to make sure that your hardware design will actually behave the way you expect, then you need to use a slow, expensive simulation at the logic gate level.

Q5) And why does the guy’s actual processor itself get to skip over all of those logic gates that logism can’t?Q6) a final conceptual question if it’s OK; when does an emulator no longer get to be considered an emulator if it’s not actually proving your system “works” since it’s skipping tons of steps that actually need to be tested to be able to say your original circuit works? Are some emulators so far removed that we shouldn’t call them emulators? Like this one? Apparently the guy used the emulator to make it 1000x faster!!!

ng8rk9d,"I'm glad it was helpful. Just to clarify, I'm not some kind of genius, this is all pretty standard stuff that would be covered in digital logic and computer architecture courses in a typical CS curriculum.To thoroughly answer your questions I would basically have to teach one of those courses, and I'm not going to try to do that. Instead I'll just try to clarify my previous comment a bit.You have to distinguish between the *simulated* CPU (the custom 16-bit design that the Youtuber you linked came up with) and the *real* CPU that is being used to run the simulation.A real CPU is made out of many millions of physical logic gates. All of those logic gates operate simultaneously. But they work together so that the real CPU executes one ""instruction"" at a time. (This is a massive oversimplification, but it's good enough for this discussion.)Let's say that the simulated CPU needs a few hundred logic gates to make a 32-bit adder. If you write a gate-level software simulation on the real CPU, the simulation will have to process each of those logic gates one at a time. So like I said, it will take many hundreds or thousands of real CPU instructions to *simulate* a single addition operation on the simulated CPU. That's what I meant by ""iterate"". The simulator has to go through each logic gate one at a time to compute its result.If instead, you write an emulator that runs on the real CPU, then when it needs to add two numbers, it can execute a single `ADD` instruction. Now, *physically*, that `ADD` instruction is still implemented within the CPU by many logic gates. But because those gates are real physical things, all operating simultaneously, they don't have to be simulated one at a time. They all happen in parallel. So the execution is much faster. (But the physical arrangement of the CPU's logic gates is fixed in hardware. You can't customize it the way you could customize a gate-level simulation that's performed in software.)I'm just using addition as an example, but the same principle applies to other things too. The 16-bit CPU has lots of other control circuitry that decides *what* instruction to execute at any given time. That control circuitry is made up of many logic gates. But the work that is done by a large number of logic gates can alternatively be implemented by a smaller number of CPU instructions on the real physical CPU, doing the same work directly, without simulating the behavior of all the individual gates.> And why does the guy’s actual processor itself get to skip over all of those logic gates that logism can’t?They're not ""skipped over"". But when you take the logic design that was being simulated in Logisim, and build it out of real physical logic gates, then those gates are all operating in parallel. So you don't have to wait for a software simulation to process them one at a time.----If you want to learn more about this topic, I would suggest going through the free self-guided [Nand2Tetris course.](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)",teraflop,2025-09-26 03:01:54,2,learnprogramming,t1_ng8m6x8,False,

So yeah, Python is a good choice, if you are interested in one of it's applications.Video game modding is heavily dependent on the game. You can probably, technically, mod any game you want in C... but that's beside the point. Most games have a modding API, either officially, or inofficially. Most often, those APIs are meant to be used in the same language as the game was written and/or scripted in. C++ is the most common, as most major enginges are written in C++ under the hood. C# works for Unity modding, iirc, and some smaller game engines use lua or GdScript (Godot specifically).So, in both cases, freelancing and modding:It's not about one language being better than all others. That's just not how it works. That's like saying ""The saw is the best tool ever!"" and then attempting to drive a nail into wood using it.

They are in fact, not. If I (or any developer with only a little experience) want to learn a new language today, it will literally take me a weekend. They all pretty much work the same, and once you understand all key concepts, you can switch langauges as you please. Sure, the tooling will be unfamiliar, and some conventions will be too, and you will take a little longer to get into a groove, and the first few weeks your code quality might suffer a little, but it's really not hard. The reasons most people assume it's hard (I think), is because they think it will be like learning their first programming language(s).

The advice I would give to a beginner would be something more like this:1) Have a specific goal of what you want to accomplish by learning programming2) Make sure that what you're doing is moving you towards that goalSo many people skip (1) when they're asking for advice on what to do, but it's super important. Why *specifically* do you want to learn programing? Is it to make video games? Or is it to automate business processes at your accounting firm? Or is it to hack your smart-fridge? Those are all vastly different skill sets, with different paths you'll need to take in your learning. Knowing what you want to do is so so important to making sure you're learning the right things.Once you've figured out (1) step (2) is a lot easier (still hard though!). Usually, step (2) starts with following one comprehensive course on the relevant programming language / framework / environment. Make sure it's a high quality, modern course on the topic. As you go, make sure you're doing exercises, and writing code independently to test that you're following along. **Once you've finished this course, you should have the ""vernacular""** that you're talking about in your post. At that point, you can start building (small) projects.Oftentimes where people get stuck on (2) is that they jump around between too many different tutorials, they don't learn things on their own, or they don't focus on the learning that will actively help them achieve their goals. But doing a single, high quality course is definitely not ""tutorial hell"".People who suggest doing projects are right that the true, deep learning comes after you've taken the training wheels of a course or tutorial off. There's a lot of important and valuable struggle that comes from putting the pieces together yourself.

But if it's enough for you that let's say once a day your server might be updated with new code assuming there is something new in the repo, the cronjob doesn't fail etc. then cronjob keeps it simple, so why not if some or none of the concerns with the setup really matter to you.

ngz7nk2,"Senior engineer here. I wrote lots of our deployment pipeline. Some thoughts:>a cron job that checks out the repo, say, once a day, and if there's anything new, pull and build.Not a good idea, to be honest. Deployment should be a purposeful, manual action. Automation here should be about making deployments a push-button exercise, not actually automatic. You want merges to a (often protected) master/main branch (or whatever) to kick off builds (of containers), tests, etc, but stop right before touching your actual deployment. If everything is good, you push the button. The cron job idea is a recipe for disaster in real environments.>I just want to `git pull` and `docker compose up --build` when I cut a new release.There's nothing wrong with just doing this manually via ssh. You can script it via ssh too so that it's a one-liner. Or have a GH Actions flow do it when you manually run a flow. Usually you'd have automations (pipelines) build your images and put them in a registry, then deployment automation can pull them from there to get containers.",HashDefTrueFalse,2025-09-30 09:19:49,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ntl1j5,False,

That said, if this is a production project, it will eventually be a good idea to run tests before deploying and proper workflows will scale to that more easily than an ad-hoc script.I would not recommend the cron approach, because it bundles multiple changes together into a single unmonitored deploy. Usually people will either do continuous deployment, where every merged commit is automatically verified and then deployed immediately, or they will do manual deployments where post-release validation can be performed. Opinions differ, but I’m in the camp that says continuous deployment is better if you have the level of automated testing and monitoring needed to make it safe. Deploying one change at a time makes it easier to determine what caused breakage when it occurs.With a cron job deployment you’d get the worst of both worlds. A bunch of changes would bet bundled together, making error tracing harder. You probably won’t be verifying the deployment after it occurs, because it’s on a schedule. And it won’t be immediately clear what changes are deployed or not at any given point in time, which can be very frustrating in practice.",josephjnk,2025-09-29 17:41:50,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ntl1j5,False,

I might have been misreading a lot of articles assuming that artifacts were things like logs or intermediate files, things produced by production instead of the production code itself.But if I should be deploying the images themselves, then Github having its own VM to do that building makes more sense.

That might initially look like taking on more backend tickets as a full stack developer but it could also mean focusing solely as a backend developer if you're on a larger team that segments work that way.If you decide to become a backend engineer, it's unlikely that you'll forget everything you knew about frontend development.

This post is not saying ""all young kids suck"", but rather explaining how so many people completely unable to do any CS work are getting degrees. They aren't slipping through the cracks, admins chiseled out a crack and swept them towards it.By the way, those great students? To a T, all of them were eager and hard working. Not all of them were obvious geniuses - they just worked really hard on a lot of things because of the love of the craft.---College CS professor here.In the last 10 years, we've seen an absurd increase in the amount of pressure put on us to just pass students by admins chasing retention and graduation statistics. I had a student who literally never showed up to either of my two classes he enrolled in a semester, never turned in a single assignment.So I failed him. So he filed a civil rights complaint. I then had to spend a total of roughly 60 hours defending myself from this, having meetings, collecting every email I ever had with the student and their advisors (plural), recalling dates of the two conversations we had, and rebutting outright laughably obvious lies like the student claiming that I locked them in my office and said they weren't allowed to leave until they did their work (the student didn't even know where my office was) - work that was never completed and he couldn't produce.More than a few professors, would I relay these stories, tell me , ""just don't fight these battles, give them what they want"". Which is even more frustrating because it means when those professor students get into my class, they can't write a for loop by themselves in an advanced software design class.Also, (noting I'm teaching faculty and not research faculty), teaching evaluation is almost entirely boiled down to student evaluations and student evaluations are negatively correlated with the difficulty of the final exam. And let me tell you, they put no effort into this analysis. They just look at in a 30 question survey, the average of one question. And my 700 person undergraduate class is treated as apples to apples to a 12-person grad level research team course. They only look at above average or below average, nothing else. So, your incentivized to make the class as easy as possible so the students give you five stars. It is the yelpification of America, and it creates the worst possible incentives. Like, my student evals can average to 4.1 out of 5, But the average for the entire department is 4.3, so therefore I'm a bad teacher. My average being brought down by a very large number of one-star reviews from shock of all shocks people failing the class.So we've created an entire incentive structure where students seek out the easiest classes they can to get the piece of paper that says they're entitled to a job, and faculty are pushed towards making those classes as easy as possible rather than actually teaching, and anyone who bucks that trend will have an admin ride their ass at the end of every semester because their student evaluation score is .02 less than last year, and "" maybe you could try bringing cookies to class"" (serious suggestion made by someone with a six-figure salary)Basically, goodhart's law remains undefeated.",DBSmiley,2025-10-01 12:00:53,138,cscareerquestions,t3_1nv27jt,False,

ngklh6p,"Hi, I work with a bunch of H1bs at a reputable software engineering company. Keep in mind that my answers are going to be based on visas from a company that does follow the spirit and letter of the law. There is not a direct pay gap between H1bs and regular employees who are hired at the same level of experience. However, H1bs have much less _leverage_ to negotiate their position particularly as the years go by. This doesn't necessarily lead to them getting underpaid relative to other employees, but it means that they're more likely to accept worse conditions or volunteer (or be voluntold) for work that they might not have to. This is especially bad for people who have to wait a long time to get a green card.Additionally, if you've worked in tech for a while, you'll know that usually the best way to increase your salary is to job hop, and staying at the same company is not typically rewarded- I will get a 7% payrise this year, but I know that if I could switch to another company I'd likely get a 20-30% payrise. It's harder to switch companies as a H1b, so their wages will grow slower than peers in their industry.Companies are required to go through certain steps in order to sponsor a H1b to prevent harming the local economy that a worker is being hired into, the LCA. The LCA effectively requires paying the potential employee the higher of the prevailing wage for the area for the job of that employee, or what that employer would pay other employees with similar experience. Some H1bs do get paid less (but not where I work) because they are a H1b. There are some companies out there that essentially offer you relocation to the US as a job perk and may not pay you well - WITCH companies, mostly. These companies don't have much interest in fair working conditions and will offer relocation to the US to people who I would consider vulnerable, mostly Indians, and will preferentially hire Indians, especially from similar castes as the hiring manager.And, obviously, when you have more people competing for the same position that nominally drives down wages. However, the companies that abuse this system - WITCH companies, again - never intended to hire an American to do the job. An American job is not being displaced by a WITCH company hiring an Indian (although it _is_ still abuse of the H1b system).Simplistic gut-feeling analyses on ""increasing supply"" affecting wages fall short because they don't take into account a whole bunch of things, not least that a more productive economy with more workers generally leads to more job opportunities in the economy as a whole. As an extremely simplified example, a software shop being set up in a city might prompt a starbucks branch being built nearby to capture the market of higher paid engineers, that might otherwise not exist, which means that the hiring of some engineers (of which some might be H1bs) leads to more tax revenue for the locality as well as more job opportunities, just not _the same_ job opportunities.

ngkn2wp,"I used to have an H1B myself. I was paid fairly, but since getting a Green Card took quite the wait, I couldn't just change jobs as I wished without some danger between the time I got PERM vs the time I became an ""applicant for adjustment of status"" (ie, my priority date was due). It was a long time ago, when there was a huge backlog for all countries, not just India and China. So after my green card arrived, i started being able to climb the ladder towards top companies 1-2 years at a time, getting significant raises every time. I was making double in 4 years.Also note that when you are applying for permanent residency, you get labor certification for a certain job description. Moving that job description upwards is kind of risky, as you would not be doing the task you got the certification for. So it might slow down your growth anyway.None of this would actually be relevant if the path from H1B to permanent residency was remotely reasonable.

ngkqor6,"It depends on the company, but the bigger issue is just a general supply issue.If there are 30k software engineering roles available each year and we have 40k software engineers looking for work. it drives everybody's salaries down.Another factor is that folks who are on an H1B face greater consequences if they lose their job. This isn't a big deal if you're actually an expert with in demand skills because there will likely be other openings. However, if you're just a general software engineer in the current job market, you're going to work more hours or take on extra responsibility to avoid having a 60 day count down to going home.The whole premise of the H1B program is to help with situations where we don't have enough qualified people to fill a certain role. When it's used in those situations, it doesn't hurt anybody because H1B holders have enough career mobility to avoid getting underpaid or overworked and US residents won't get pushed out because visa holders are filling a gap, not competing with US workers. If we grant 2000 H1B visas to MDs who want to work in the US, that's fine because we have a shortage of doctors and those visas will benefit the H1B workers without negatively impacting US workers. If we grant 40000 H1B visas to entry level tech workers, which already face high unemployment rates, that not only goes against the goals of the H1B program, it makes the job market worse for all workers involved. Some H1B holders will earn less, some H1B holders will be forced to work under unfair conditions to keep their visa status, supply will exceed demand causing wages to drop, and US workers will have to either accept the unfair conditions or get replaced by an H1B holder who will.Under paying H1B visa holders happens at some consulting companies, but even at companies that pay them the same wage as US workers, it's a problem when the system is abused.",EssenceOfLlama81,2025-09-28 01:12:13,18,cscareerquestions,t3_1nsahrt,False,

Obviously as a SWE, you deal with all those on a daily basis, but confidently answering 101 + 201 questions are very important in setting the tone for the interview. went through my resume bullet points and wrote down about 2 pages per bullet point going deeper in to depth, answering questions like ""how was this metric you put defined?""

""how do you normally approach a new technology"". Stuff like that -- not to memorize, just to kind of find the rhythm of your own answer.

Maybe you've even been around on enough projects to know that if you invest time upfront, you'll be set up for success later when it's a time crunch, so you might work a little more to keep everything nice and clean and documented. Then, the inevitable comes. Either some requirement changes, or maybe there was a miscommunication - but whatever the case, that nice timeline and architecture you had in your head gets absolutely wrecked. All the time you spent making sure the code was flexible in X, Y, Z directions ends up just being more refactoring, and undoing to get the code into the state it needs to be in to pass unit tests, or meet requirements. Now, it's not about writing good code, you have like X time to do an assignment that should take 2-4x time. You just need to get it done ASAP and ship it. Sometimes you get things cleaned up, but the code looks inflexible, and like it's just duct taped together, which it usually is. Sometimes you don't even get everything cleaned up from what you thought the project was going to be. You do stuff in weird, unintuitive ways, because when you built the framework/foundation, you thought it was going in a different direction, but it's too much effort to rebuild the foundational code from scratch 70% of the way into a project without having to start from scratch.

I did not really practice LC - I did a few problems for fun, but in no way would I consider would I did ""grinding"", nor did I make any attempt to memorize the solutions. The 3 LC interviews that I did get were all mediums where I was able to work out non-optimal but reasonable solutions, and I passed the interviews despite my non-optimal solutions.Probably worth mentioning that the non-LC coding interviews I received by and large still required a strong grasp of CS fundamentals like recursion and proper use of data structures. So if you're not solid with that kind of thing, then practicing LC may still help. I would also not say that the non-LC coding interviews are necessarily easier than LC - just that their difficulty is more about turning complex requirements into code than about figuring out ""this one neat trick"", which I do think is a more fair type of difficulty and more reflective of job skills. Also I did not interview with any FAANG companies, and I think they are more notorious for having LC interviews.The vast majority of my interview prep time was spent on practicing systems design and fleshing out my behavioral interview stories, and personally I thought that was a much better use of my time than grinding LC (as a senior candidate).",Oreamnos_americanus,2025-09-28 03:07:36,20,cscareerquestions,t3_1nsbrus,False,

It basically links videos from author of cracking coding interview who explains DSA with imagery. She actually makes it look very good. Then it linked leetcode study guides that included practice questions to better udnerstand how to code it. Honestly was a great study guide, not sure why they took it out. The videos are still there write in youtube ""hacker rank data structures"". Here is one of them: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njTh\_OwMljA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njTh_OwMljA) In my opinion do not fall into the ""grind leetcode for 200 hours"". You might get a job that way, but i have found many interviewers can tell when you dont understand the problem and are just copying what similar leetcode problems did. Because they dont mind changing up the problem halfway through if they noticed you got there too quickly. They'll change one little thing in the problem and ask you to re-do it and the way you did it wont work. So there is a lot of having to understand DSA to get the job. Learn how to think outloud because that's what most of them expect. They dont care if you get it right, just how you think. Ive gotten jobs and havent gottent their questions right. Also, tackle problems piece by piece. I have found that once i write one line of code, i am less stressed and tackle the problem better. So usually the first thing i do is tackle the base cases. Let's say I have to re-arrange an array. First line i write is ""if(array.empty())"". Then i tackle the next base case and i ahve found that once you go through it the asnwer kind of starts resolving itself as you tackle the base cases.",Broad-Cranberry-9050,2025-09-29 17:00:49,26,cscareerquestions,t3_1ntmvso,False,

It’s nothing like the stories I hear on this sub yet, but I’ve filled out 35-40 applications over the last few weeks. 0 callbacks/interviews so far. It usedTo be at least an interview every 5-10 applications any other time I’ve tried to find new work.In this market, it really feels like you gotta be:1. A perfect skills match. Like… if they are asking for someone who knows PostgreSQL, but your resume just says ‘SQL’ because you’ve used various SQL distributions, good luck…2. Over qualified/willing to work for 30% less than a few years back. I can’t even get a callback from basic analytics roles after 5+ years doing Data Science and advanced analytics. Asking for enough cash to scrape by without roommates? Insta-DQ’d cause that conservative 20% lower than your last two jobs number you put in the requested salary box was too high..Idk, if I had time, maybe I’d get a certification on cloud technologies and DBT + Airflow.

I've gotten close a few times, but didn't get the offer. Now I think the career gap is hurting me more than anything. Granted I was not in a tech hub like Seattle is. Go to some in person events and network a bit before you commit to leaving your company. Build up a small network if you can. And as for burn out, taking time off and relaxing helps some but really therapy has been amazing for me. There are therapists that specialize in whatever types of issues you are having like work stress, adhd, isolation, etc. If you've never done therapy before and want to know more about how to get started on that just message me.

ngvt803,"Decided to apply for jobs. Very different experience from u/[IAmBoredAsHell](https://www.reddit.com/user/IAmBoredAsHell/)Keep in mind I have an Ivy League undergrad degree (Columbia Univ) so that might have helped.Applied for jobs. Heard back from many places. LinkedIn claims I applied 28 places (many of which are the same companies like 6 on Roblox, etc). So 15 different companies for the 28 positions. + outside LinkedIn like DataDog, Coinbase.Out of the 15+2 companies, had recruiter calls from 13 companies. The 4 companies that did not reply were Roblox (sucks cause I got interview there before), Affirm (sucks cause I got interview there before), ~~MongoDB (my experience is completely irrelevant to work there)~~, Pinterest (sucks cause I got interview there before), DataDog (my experience is completely irrelevant to work there).In my inbox, have many dozens of recruiters requesting to do an interview. Many well paying desperate firms like Carta, Decagon, Vanta, Valon, TikTok, Meta, DE Shaw, Stubhub, Lyft, Anduril, DoorDash, Ramp, Amazon, etc. And crap ton of AI grift startups/firms which constantly clog up my inbox daily.I got rejected from OpenAI at phone screen this time but I blame the interviewer. System design question was infra side when I have zero understanding of infra. Sucks because I was able to get an offer almost 2 years ago there but thought non-profit + Scam Altman == shares are worth nothing + don't want to deal with insane work hours. Who knew valuations would explode and non-profits become for-profits so easily. I thought Elon Musk would have done something there.It's honestly very difficult from the start to even apply as senior because most jobs are not going to be on the field I work in.In the fields I work in, I get basically 100% response rate. Since I work in the financial side, so jobs like Uber for Financial team, trading firms (absolutely 0 thoughts), etc all respond quick. Pigeonhole life :/. Honestly not interested in the WLB and have no thoughts moving to NYC when I have made my life here right now (maybe in the future).I'm sure if I spray and prayed full stack, infra, databases, etc. roles then my response rate would be garbage as well. But then again, I'm sure if I applied mid level roles for those I would get calls left and right but then why would I?And no. I don't bother with referrals, connections, etc. Not my thing. Never needed to. I was able to get interviews at Netflix, Google, OpenAI, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Snap, Databricks, Citadel, etc in the past without any problems anyway. Ivy League degree helps.Definitely worse than covid era. During covid era, I essentially had 90% response rate at tech firms and near 100% response rate at non tech firms. But then again, I'm not applying for mid level roles so to be expected. Plus, I am a lazy individual who has no thoughts min-maxing my career so that plays a part as well. I've let my experience rot my skills for job market but I don't care. I value life outside work a lot.>Curious if there are any suggestions or comments on day to day learning and interview prep?Just take life chill. Don't overthink. Life is too short to stress these stuff too much.That said, be good at Leetcode. Try to aim for 95% pass rate on coding interviews.And spend time on studying System Design. That's the most important once you are out of new grad.\-Update: MongoDB just replied to start process. Perfect timing. LOL.

AI models are really mediocre with Salesforce concepts because Salesforce codebases are very rarely public and are not often represented in training data, so AI is not a big job risk either.

Virtually no open source third-party app ecosystem. The official docs are a mess, severely lacking in information. The UI has changed so many times (and is changing again very soon) such that even asking for instructions gets you a mess of responses from past versions. No easy way to log the output of code, no debugger, and a CLI that only works half the time as-is. Some features are entirely undocumented and instructions on using them only exist through paid pro-serv engagements. It frequently confuses the Apex programming language with Java and tries to embed java concepts into the code it generates. When generating Javascript code, it doesn't understand the severe limitations that the platform puts in place on which javascript you're allowed to run and when. Salesforce does not and cannot support microservices, every org is a massive monolith where every change affects 100 unrelated things, and the context requirements bring AI models to their knees. Ironically all of the things that makes Salesforce miserable to work on, are the reason Salesforce can't get AI tools to work with it.Now, I'm not saying that Salesforce is this amazing magical place to be as an engineer.

nh9m479,"The safest move isn’t to bail on Salesforce, it’s to turn your SF work into portable skills: integrations, testing, and DevOps.What helps right now: use LLMs tactically, not as architects. They’re decent at Apex unit test scaffolds, SOQL refactors, validation rule drafts, and explaining governor limit errors if you paste exact code and schema. The big unlock is integrations. Get fluent with Named Credentials, External Services, Platform Events, CDC, OAuth flows, and building small services in Node/.NET that SF can call. Add CI/CD with SFDX, scratch orgs, PMD, and GitHub Actions so you can ship safely and fast. Round it out with LWC, TypeScript, and one general backend. If you want receipts on experience, ship a tiny feature from idea to prod and write a short postmortem.For real-world glue: I’ve used MuleSoft for heavy ETL/API orchestration and Workato for quick business automations, while DreamFactory made exposing a SQL Server schema as REST callable from External Services a 1-day job.Bottom line: keep riding Salesforce for income, but hedge by getting great at integrations, CI/CD, and general web backends so you’re fine even if the platform stumbles.",Key-Boat-7519,2025-10-01 22:22:59,1,cscareerquestions,t1_nh4x4ot,False,

Imma guess you also haven’t done much to branch out of strict IC work into people management.Ideally you should’ve been gradually working towards growth, e.g. react isn’t particularly hard to pick up, and hopefully you can also speak coherently about idempotency or optimistic updates or JWT or db normalization or whatever.

Those were just examples. ""Project Scope"" is the important bit of that section, along with timeline, quotes, project organization, etc.Especially if the company you applied to builds things for customers, and bids on projects, rather than building/running their own product, it seems pretty reasonable that they would be legitimately doing FEED, and the SWE's would be heavily involved since it's a software project they're planning/selling.I have 12 YOE, and I don't recall ever hearing that acronym before... but there's lots of acronyms I haven't heard of. There is a ton of variety in the industry. After looking up what FEED is, I can safely say I've never been involved in such a rigid and thorough project planning stage. I've worked mostly in agile shops where we're fast and loose with timelines, planning, and costs.

ngo0nyk,"It takes as long as it takes. Some folks land another job fairly quickly, others it'll take months.The biggest thing you're up against at the moment is the calendar. Lots of places slow down hiring as the year draws to a close. I was laid off in mid-October last year and told my wife if I didn't land something by Thanksgiving then it likely dry up until mid- to late January. Fortunately I landed something in November.It sucks losing your job, and if I recall from your previous post this is your first time going through this. I experienced being laid off at my first job after graduating, only being there about six months. Felt like an absolute failure, especially to my parents because I was still living at home. They were very understanding and mainly just felt bad for me, but we're happy to let me live with them as long as I was hunting for another job. Lots of folks will be more understanding than you realize, and for the ones who don't or seem to pull away I'd say you'll learn the ""value"" of those relationships.The best advice I can give you would be:1) Realize it's very likely not your fault and simply a business decision. This is not a reflection on you as a person or on your skills as much as you may think it is. You now know that most employers don't really value you or others as much as you may have thought.2) If there are local user groups for your field of study, attend those and network as much as possible. I've been able to keep my recent stints with layoffs fairly short due to the network I've built over the years. Talking with folks and getting their help in applying for open positions is gonna do more for you than online submissions where you're a name among hundreds or thousands of others. I landed my current position by going to a local user group and connecting with a staff engineer of the company hosting it, who was willing to submit my resume directly to HR for an open position.3) In the current market, you may need to be more open to both returning to an office to work and even taking short term contract gigs. Fully in office positions will likely have fewer applicants compared to hybrid, and both will have fewer applicants compared to fully remote. Taking contract work can also be an option, as most times those interview loops are one or two rounds and often not that involved. Part of this is because they can cut you loose at any moment and owe you nothing, because you likely won't have paid time off (you can take time off, just not paid). Benefits, if offered, can usually be stupid expensive depending on your needs, but contract work will almost always pay far better than unemployment, and keeps long gaps off your resume. It may lead to a permanent position, and if not then at least you avoid dipping into your savings for a while. You can absolutely keep interviewing for better gigs in the meantime.4) If needed, take part-time work somewhere or work in something adjacent to your field of study if possible. I floated by on support and sys admin type roles for about three years, from 2009 to 2012, because I was a new grad with minimal experience losing out on jobs to folks who had that experience. I managed to stay close to the industry and make decent money from it while waiting for my time to get back into SWE jobs in full.I get it man, losing a job sucks and is a big hit to your mental. Know that you're not the first to experience this, you won't be the last, and this may not be your last time experiencing it. There's gonna be aspects of paranoia about it happening again going forward and you just gotta learn how to deal with it. The best way to deal with it is to build both a solid amount of savings, along with a solid network of folks you can reach out to if it ever happens again.You'll get through this, and you'll be stronger for it.",ModernTenshi04,2025-09-28 15:50:00,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1nsp8yg,False,

If you’re confident you want data focused roles and want your degree title to reflect that directly, then go with Statistics & Data Science.

If you are the kind of person that is self-motivated then gamedev is great because you can rely on yourself to ship a product. It is good to be aware that even though you have the skills, you might not have the experience, and you might not get the job anyways. With gamedev if you dont get a job you can always make a game.

Some random points: - If they think you may need help after spending too long in a task, maybe you're not communicating enough with the team- You say others aren't asking for help, but do you usually ask? Also, maybe they're just not asking publicly? Maybe they talk with somebody else directly? - Why wouldn't it be sincere? Why are you supposing ""ill intent"" from them?

ng4bp7h,"Well, one thing, how long have you been at the company? And how often are you running into situations where the team thinks you need help? A 12 YOE SWE needing considerable help in their first 6 months is different than a 12 YOE SWE needing considerable help after working at the same company for 2 years.Do you have standups where you give status updates? Or something similar? What kind of status updates are you giving?If someone's *asking* me for my status, whether that be asking me if I'm done yet, or if I need help, or if I'm killing it, or if I'm stuck, or if the deadline is still on target, etc.... that's a failure of communication on my part. People shouldn't need to pull my status out of me.If my task is dragging on for one reason or another, I don't necessarily need help, but that is something I'll communicate to the team so they can react accordingly. Sometimes a delayed ticket can have a ripple affect and threaten bigger deadlines. And if I do need help, I don't hesitate to ask. 12 YOE here as well. I ask from time to time, but when I'm past the 6 month mark at a company, I don't generally need much help, but I'm also not dragging tickets.But if you *need* help, *ask for it*. Just letting tickets blow through important deadlines because you don't think you're ""supposed"" to ask for help isn't a great option.\[And how do you know people aren't asking for help?
