You can define columns without reference to dataframes, so you can make a list of column expressions *before* you work with the dataframes.edit: I shouldn't do this at 2am. ~~Your slice [] of the map column based on a key means spark is creating a column expressions mapping every key:value in mapping, then throwing it all away to pick a single key from the map.~~All of this requires communication between spark and pyspark, which takes time. When you do it 600 times it takes a while.Every time you chain dataframe defining functions pyspark calls out to spark to build a plan. Time spent on the plan increases exponentially as you have more steps as each step takes longer as it builds on the last. 600 dataframe definitions is a lot.Do the `json.loads` once for each mapping, not for each variable for each model. edit: I shouldn't do this at 2am. ~~Don't create a full map column just to select one key out of it, just get the value from the original mappings dict. Don't chain withColumn, generate all the column definitions into a list then do `df.select(""*"",*listofcols)`~~ edit: fixing 2am mistakes...Even though the key you pull from the map is the value in column 'v', you are parsing and defining the same map dtype column multiple times -- 150 times if it is the 10 models and 15 variables looping over the same 4 mappings. Think of the size and complexity of this query as it gets built out, where spark is generating 600 chained 'views' with hundreds of mapping objects, and every mapping gets used so cannot be discarded before processing.In pandas you don't have this because the mapping object is available in the same process directly and doesn't need to be duplicated data per row. It also processes the dataframe in full at each step, so it can discard any previously used map as it goes. Whereas spark can't access your dict directly and has lazy evaluation, so it has to 'remember' every single generation of every map field all at once when it finally runs, and will be duplicating the data into each row in its behind-the-scenes rdd.You want to only parse each model once, and only generate its map once, and reuse that. You also want to make a list of your output columns then use `.select()` on them all at once. To make the reuse explicit you can split it into two selects. df = some_input m = model original_colnames [c for c in df.columns] # parse the mappings once mapping_dicts = [json.loads(mp) for mp in mappings) # generate the mapping cols once mapping_cols = [ F.create_map([F.lit(k_or_v) for kv in mapping_dict.items()]).alias(f""map_{i}"") for i,mapping_dict in enumerate(mapping_dicts) ] # define all variable redirections through the map all together mapped_cols = [ F.col(""map_{i}"")[F.col(f""some_var_{v}"")].alias(f""new_{m}"") # something seems off here for v in variables for i in range(len(mapping_cols)) ] # generate new dataframe new_df = ( # define a dataframe with the mappings in a first step # (so you can easily view this df if you cut the code up) df.select( *original_colnames, *mapping_cols ) # use the defined maps to generate the output columns .select( *original_colnames, *mapped_cols ) ) return dfNote that you don't *have* to do this in two selects if you reuse the actual column objects, but then you can't as easily check the intermediate state with just the mappings available.",azirale,2025-04-28 17:11:34,10,dataengineering,t3_1k9wng3,False,

In terms of performance... it's a mixed bag.I would use it over SQLite with WORM or OLAP data for its more expressive SQL dialect and the duckdb REPL is just a bit nicer... The default of limiting output to a small number of rows also makes it feel fast. The `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` is extremely beautiful. The aesthetics and marketing are best-in-class.

For example, the `format_bytes()` function is very convenient...DuckDB has gotten a lot better in recent years there are still a few sharp edges. For example, one such query that blocked me from moving from SQLite to DuckDB looked like this: SELECT m.id AS id , SUM(CASE WHEN h.done = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS play_count , MIN(h.time_played) AS time_first_played , MAX(h.time_played) AS time_last_played , FIRST_VALUE(h.playhead) OVER (PARTITION BY h.media_id ORDER BY h.time_played DESC) AS playhead -- , * -- SQLite even lets you do this... but I concede that is a bit extreme... FROM media m JOIN history h ON h.media_id = m.id GROUP BY m.id;It would give me this error: Error: column ""playhead"" must appear in the GROUP BY clause or must be part of an aggregate function.

mopcy3u,"They can be, but you need to use them appropriately. In data systems there's often a tradeoff between latency, throughput, and query volume. You can easily get a distributed k:v store to ingest millions of entries per second, and each write can be retrieved essentially immediately for low latency results, but it will generally struggle to handle large analytical queries.Your deltalake tables can ingest enormous volumes of data, and are great for huge analytical queries, but there are limitations on the types of write that you can do in the process. Most importantly here MERGE operations have *a lot* of overhead -- you'll be rewriting entire files for an update to a single row, and every write is going to leave behind another time travel copy of the data it just superseded.You can clean up these time travel copies. You run compaction periodically, then do a VACUUM with a custom short time with the necessary override to let it delete files less than a *week* old. You'll still have a lot of overhead processing the merges, however.What is often better with rapidly updating data when using something like deltalake is to move away from merging every single change, and instead just blind-inserting new values to an append-only log with a timestamp of when that row version becomes active. From there a window function looking for the latest timestamp for a given key lets you filter for the 'current data'.Over time the total amount of data will get pretty large, and that will get inefficient. So you can periodically create a proper merged 'current state' table that *doesn't* need the window-function-for-latest filter. Then when querying for the latest data you start with that fully merged table as your base, you anti-join the keys from the timestamp filtered append log, and union data with the window-function-for-latest filter only on the new append log data.That query will skip all the 'previously merged' data from the append log and keep the window processing to a minimum, but still lets you get the latest state from the append log where it applies.You'll want to do something like a bucketby on both tables on the key, so that they are properly organised to minimise shuffles to achieve the joins and window functions.You can tune the full merge period to whatever suits. It could be hourly, or daily, or any frequency you like. Each time you do a merge you can also compact and vacuum to clear out old data. If you partition your append-log by a time bin you can also drop old partitions to save storage space there too -- and it can help with skipping files that won't be relevant.---These sorts of 'streaming into big analysis' issues seem to come up from time to time.

mpq9a4o,"Well the speed of the query is impacted by the size of the warehouse.It is fairly easy to handle in a DAG. You run a ""data quality test"" of sorts that checks the size of the table. If the size of the table is especially large or the new rows exceeds a threshold (absolute or percentage) then you can run your dbt command with the larger warehouse.If not, then you can run it on the smaller warehouse.How you would do it in orchestra (my company) purely for illustrative purposes; run a [data quality test with Snowflake](https://docs.getorchestra.io/docs/integrations/warehouses-lakehouses/snowflake/data-quality) then use [branching/conditionality ](https://docs.getorchestra.io/docs/core-concepts/branching)then [run dbt](https://docs.getorchestra.io/docs/integrations/transformation/dbt-core%E2%84%A2/run-dbt-command)The other thing you could do is set a timeout on the dbt model in question and if it fails, run a snowflake query to bump up the warehouse. If you have automatic retries enabled on the thing running your dbt model, then you'll retry it after its timed out on the higher warehouse. So lots of options..The chunking may be easier to handle dynamically by parameterising stored procedures in snowflake too :)",engineer_of-sorts,2025-04-29 21:07:32,1,dataengineering,t3_1kadjy6,False,

mp5bnkq,Fuzzy matching and edit distance/levenstein are the most typical ways. For addresses you can pay for address APIs that help.,financialthrowaw2020,2025-04-26 14:03:45,25,dataengineering,t3_1k8dmdp,False,
mp5fv8t,"I was very successful on my project with customer matching, exactly what you are talking about. We wound up buying a tool. Biggest single take away is that it’s not “can you do this” but rather “how accurately can you do this”. There are so many tools/techniques that can do this - but the accuracy levels vary. As you pay more, or get more sophisticated, your match accuracy and speed goes up. For example, on the easy end would be to compare address line 1, city, state, and zip from multiple data sources against each other and make the match. There are so many problems with this, so it’s not very accurate. Examples of higher end algorithms include:- Typo detection with various string compare/character distance algorithms- Phonetic representation (matching on how words are spoken not spelled to account for typos)- Address tokenization (not matching 123 4th ave. To 4 123rd ave, because you parse an address into what it represents (house number and street)- Nickname substitution (Tom matches Thomas)- Abbreviation matching (CIA matches Central Intelligence Agency)- Address validation - comparing an address to the US Postal Service to see if it’s real (don’t try matching fictitious addresses)- Understanding name titles - (Mrs, Miss, Sir, Jr, III, II, etc. John Thomas can match Mr. John Thomas, or John Thomas II is different from John Thomas III)Etc…. You get the point…Ultimately, there are two big things: match accuracy and match speed. Accuracy evaluates two records against each other using all the different rules, scores each one, and then this is where you come in — you set weights on the different rules to “tune” the algorithm. Essentially, you are optimizing either overmatching or undermatching — you will never be perfect. In some cases you want to overmatch (say you are sending direct mail promotions and are fine accidentally grouping father and son as same person). In some cases you prefer to undermatch (say you are grouping medial records/data and don’t want to give a child the medication his father is prescribed because you incorrectly linked the two as the same entity). Second big thing is speed. Ultimately, you are comparing each record against each record - do the math…. It’s too long to actually compute. So, these tools take short cuts - they actually only compare subsets of data against each other (important- this means some rows will never be evaluated for a potential match). For example if record 1 is “123 1st St, NM USA” I don’t actually need to compare this one against any data that isn’t from the state of New Mexico (NM). HOWEVER, what if I’m wrong about the original record being in NM? If I am, then I have no hope of making a match (let’s say it’s actually in MN - typo) so my accuracy is compromised because of my speed algorithm. So, again, this is why you pay more as features go up. Can you have speed and accuracy - sure, but it will cost you.NOTE: As an interesting aside, I was also on a Material Matching project. Materials are very different from customers, it’s actually not a data problem but an image recognition problem. Our first approach was to treat it like customer and look at attributes we stored in data (length, width, etc.) and perform the match. It was terrible. Poor data quality, and you can’t capture enough data - for example, you might have same H,W,D and weight, but you don’t capture “right hand” or “left hand” part (which makes them different). The answer is software that matches visually looking at the CAD drawings in 3d. Very cool, and very expensive. Really isn’t a BI problem at this point, but an Engineering problem since it’s in the CAD world.EDIT: you will need a manual method to override matches, and fix them. In my project our software matched 95% of the data correctly!!!! The business had to use 5 full time head count for 1 year to perform the additional 5% match. So - this should tell you how valuable the software is, and how difficult it is to manually match millions of rows of data. EDIT: I didn’t state this, but the process is to create “groups” of data (entities). So, your target data is [group id or entity id], [record id], [attribute columns: name, address 1, city, state…]. The group id/entity id field is just the master record, record id. This can be set as the first record that forms the group/entity (group id=record id) or you can use logic to ensure this is your “golden record”. You have many matching rules, each rule matches rows using the various match algorithms above (think of it as sub-matching) - we had 3 big ones. Highest weight rule was where all attributes matched between two records (name + address), rule 2: name + zip matched, rule 3 - address only matched. First step of the process was a data quality phase - ensure all records have these fields populated - ie: if zip is blank or wrong, we look up address to populate the zip. EDIT: What exactly is a “entity”? You’ll find really interesting situations in your data. For example, for us an entity was a customer/account. We found situations where a customer has multiple buildings, each on different roads (close to each other on their property) which made the addresses very different, requiring manual matching override. Think of a large corporate campus, university, or government facility (military base). All those buildings are on different roads, with different addresses - but are the same entity. It’s very unlikely the tool will match them, since it matches addresses.. so manual overrides are needed (unless you can work in reference data and additional rules about all the various streets on the campus…)EDIT: you’ll also get matching logical problems where record A matches record B, and record B matches record C, so that means A=C. But it shouldn’t…so you have this huge blob of over matched records you need to manually split up. The incorrect matching is coming from data quality problems. Essentially, you have 1 bad address row causing two entities to be incorrectly linked. This can happen when businesses use central billing locations - like a corporate headquarters, or a state/city office. For example, the city cemetery and the city water treatment, and the city transportation service all get linked because their data comes to you via the cities single administrative building with a single address.EDIT: I really liked this book. Data Matching, by Peter ChristenEDIT: Think about what you are going to do with the data. If it’s data warehousing only, you might want to build a “reference style Master Data Management database”. This essentially is only used for data warehouse/analytics, and consumes data from systems but does not push data to source systems (or claim to own customer). But if you need to create the enterprise definition of the truth, and your job is to “own” the definition of customer for the enterprise — then you need to catch customer data being entered in various source systems, master it quickly, and push it back to those systems. There are different styles of MDM architecture/tools. Same matching principles - but speed and integration becomes a more important requirement.",rotr0102,2025-04-26 14:27:15,21,dataengineering,t3_1k8dmdp,False,

mp6ylpg,"Yes - because you're retaining history at the raw/source layer, you can easily go back and create scd-2 type tables with valid to/from fields later as needed. So for your current use case, sure. I would however advise you to consider that what your stakeholders consider to be current data and what you consider to be current data may not be the same thing. So, for example, if you're doing dimensional modeling and you're choosing to only use current data in your dim tables, you're missing out on what could be critical information for each fact line in the time that it was loaded. For example, if they want to track customer activations and deactivations, you would use a historical dim customer table for that. So as long as you have this in mind and are prepared to shift to historical dim tables when these requests come up, you should be fine. Regardless, because you are retaining that history at the raw source layer, you'll be fine.

Coalesce is built for tech and non-tech users that want to quickly build data transformation, machine learning, and/or Cortex pipelines by means of an intuitive point & click interface. Documentation is automatically generated in Coalesce as you create nodes. There are so many other features about Coalesce that I love. But your question is about version control, so I'll stop rambling about my love for Coalesce. Within Coalesce, each project is assigned a Git repo and branch. Every single change can be committed or rolled back. There is also a nifty AI commit message generator that saves several seconds when checking in changes. The change control window in Coalesce is similar to Git - it has two panels that show your modifications vs the last committed version and the changes are highlighted. As for committing all changes or line item, it really depends on how frequently you commit. In my experience, I typically commit every time I make a considerable change to a node (dimension, stage, fact, etc.).

mp4e1s9,"The short answer is clustering can be beneficial when inserting records if implemented correctly. The long answer:Columnar storage in general (not just BigQuery) is usually stored as read-only files that have built in metadata describing what data is in each column. This allows for more efficient filtering at the file level. It is slightly more complex than this when it comes to a Data Warehouse like BigQuery, but generally when you “merge” a record into columnar storage, you can think about the operation like this:1. Search for the file your data is potentially in based on file metadata2. If the record could be in a file based on the metadata, read the existing data in to memory3. Find the matching rows in each column4. Update them if they exist5. Overwrite the existing file in storage and update the file metadata if a record was insertedClustering improves look up speed in this process by making it more efficient to find the right file to operate on. For instance, let’s say you have a table of product purchases with a reference to the customer who made the purchase. This table has mutable attributes like product delivery date (NULL until it has been delivered) that need to be updated on delivery of the product. An appropriate clustering field for this table might be customer_id, which would logically group all purchases by the associated customer_id when writing to a file. This way, instead of needing to read potentially every file in the table in to memory to try and find a purchase to update, it is able to read in only a select file or two. In order to take advantage of this, you would need to use the customer_id in the merge predicate.",EngiNerd9000,2025-04-26 09:51:59,5,dataengineering,t3_1k82dcn,False,

Another classic one are SQL queries which is what you have.What is your reporting layer and what warehouse do you use?It feels like the obvious thing to do is have a task in your dag that fetches your config and then passes it to your templated SQL queries which could either live in your orchestrator *or* as stored procedures in your warehouseBut without knowing what tooling hard to offer more :) Hope that helps!,engineer_of-sorts,2025-04-29 21:13:14,2,dataengineering,t3_1kawaj4,False,

Our reporting is primarily in Tableau, with ad-hoc stuff in Looker Studio and some GIS stuff in ArcGIS. The architecture of the reporting layer is pretty basic. There's a very wide model which has the core columns common across all of our...operations (being vague, I know). Individual reports pull what they need mostly from this wide table.We use BigQuery and are 99% a GCP shop. Each layer is designated in a GCP project (source, transform, report). We do not really have an orchestrator outside of DBT. The main limitation of DBT here is that it's only connected to our transform GCP project. A python DBT model could read the config values from the warehouse and then run my proposed python library to generate the SQL statements (assuming I deploy the model with a custom Docker image on Dataproc serverless, something I haven't figured out yet). But there's then the question of how to get the queries to run in the report layer. I was thinking to have basic Materialized Views in the report layer that mostly just pulled data from transform and wouldn't have their definitions change very often.

However, reasonably often you need to retrieve data by `external_reference` - and because this isn't involved in the hash partition the query *must* be spread to every distributed partition.If you know that lookups by `external_reference` will return very few documents, you can create *a second data store* that is itself hash partitioned on `external_reference` and sorted on `id`, and the only data it has is that sorting primary `id` it relates to.Then when you want to lookup by `external_reference`, instead of having a distributed scan across all partitions to filter for the value, you do a direct lookup of the dedicated 'secondary index' store that is partitioned and indexed on `external_reference`. Because you are looking up a value in the partition your query is not spread to all partitions, and you get a few `id` values back. You then query the original data store for those specific `id` values to retrieve them.---You can also put all of this in the same store, if you're using document stores and have generic `primary_key` and `sort_key` fields.",azirale,2025-04-28 23:36:31,1,dataengineering,t3_1ka3a7b,False,

I'm not sure if i followed how your example applies as well hahaha.Let me give an example: All documents in the database will have several fields, but two will be used for indexing as partition methods: ID and color. We could define the partitioning method in a key value range, for instance: partition 0 goes from 1 - 1000, partition 1 goes from 1001-2000, etc. In this scenario, the partition would have a primary mapping all of document positions based on index, e.g.: ID 1 -> {ID: 1, name: Joe, gender: male}.The book mentions that a term based partition method (all documents with the same term value are assigned to the same partition, e.g.: all documents with gender = male go to partition 0) can be applied besides the above mentioned method.My question is: if a new document {ID: 2, name: Sarah, gender: female} is created, will it be inserted in partition 0 as well? Based on the Key Range partition **yes,** but based on the term value partitioning the partition 0 contains only documents that have gender = male. Does one have a precedence over the other?

This is mostly for Material Master Data, Procurement Info Records and Business Partners or other Master Data. The tool also includes automated flows to check and update data and ensure compliance.

Languages are tools, concepts translate between them. If you master one, then you'll stand out vs. others who mastered none, and you'll pick up any language required of you on the job in weeks.- DSA classes & Leetcode. Most important part of CS due to how interviews are structured. Do 250 most common LC problems and focus on easy/medium unless targetting FAANG for first job.- Build practical projects. Initially start simple, like that easy react page you created. You learn by doing 10x faster than tutorial hell. You need to learn how to structure your own projects and build something from A to Z, from having an idea to breaking it down in small parts and building it out (without guidance provided in tutorials).- Project structure for bigger applications, everything has its own place and the quicker you start modulating projects the way they do in production the faster you'll grow.- Find a specialization and focus on it. Try simple projects: react frontend page you did, then try building a backend API with CRUD, try building a simple ETL pipeline for data, then try a simple github CI/CD with github actions and dockerize one of the apps. Nothing complex. Cover basics of each, build them in a few days, and then ask yourself: which one seems most interesting to you, which one seems like something you'd like to pursue?Specialization matters heavily. Everyone spreads themselves thin, and if your goal is to achieve what CS grads do in 4 years, you should pick something early on and master one area.

mpj31lm,"I've won hackathons before. Best tip is to practice with an existing team, as a team, and do mock hackathons. If you know react, and what packages to download, you can build something in less than 12 hours. First 4 hours might be planning and reading the docs, 4 hours of sleep, 4 hours to clean up and submit. 12 hours of productive coding. We can break down the 12 hours even further if you want, but assume also each team member knows what they are doing and we can do it in parallel. Initialize the git repo, frontend, backend and database on local host with a decided framework. Database can be hosted on the cloud. Frontend is probably react, or vue, with tailwind css or bootstrap as the UI framework or use another one with copy and paste components. Backend can be flask or django, or if you want, ignore backend completely and just connect frontend to the database directly. (don't do this with real production code). (takes around 1-2 hours) Your team of four starts splitting up work. One or two guys start working on frontend with the UI framework. One guy working on util libraries and business logic as well as api and webhooks. Another guy working on the database. You may have a floater or a guy that finished early to do merges and resolving merge conflicts. (3-6 hours)Working in parallel will require constantly preplanning what tasks are important that have a lot of other tasks dependent on it and which tasks have a lot of dependencies itself. (but at this point you should be polishing up) (3-6 hours) Cloud hosting is quick and easy nowadays, should only take 1-2 hours. It might take a while to figure out the dockerfile and which cloud hosting platform will help the most.If you know what you are doing, and use existing open source frameworks and solutions, you can cut down the time spent writing boilerplate code and just focus on connecting API calls and endpoints. ----# Just a few tips 1. Already find your team of four and practice with them before the competition. Treat it like a war game if you want. Go into what if scenarios and try and build real projects together. 2. Look into the hackathons previous winners and losers from previous hackathons. Try and figure out how the judges pick the winners. Do the judges really care about ML technologies? or do they just care about fancy UI? Some judges care about how many microservices you used and/or how big your techstack us. Do a lot of preplanning to figure out what the judges like. 3. As the competition gets near, usually company names start appearing, judges names start appearing, as well as the challenge names. Do a lot of research on the companies and judges. If you wanna score points from a company, look into what API libraries they might want you to use. If you want to score points with a judges, and they are industry or professor, do a challenge that they can relate to. 4. Never rebuild the wheel. Use other people's code. Use open source frameworks and code from github.No hackathon winner will ever build their entire stack. The use frameworks and existing solutions. The only thing they will build themselves are the connections between the frontend and the backend as well as the business logic. 5. Add as much techstack and bloat as you can. Host it on a bunch of microservices, use OAuth, host it on the cloud. Add infinite horizontal scaling. Judges for some reason like that, even if it does nothing for your app. 6. The app doesn't even have to work. It only needs to seem like it works. --- Winning hackathons is a specific skill, and only some of it is transferable to actual industry. Over representing your app to judges probably isn't something you will do in industry, and hard coding stuff is probably something you won't do.

Rarely are there rigorous dives into the properties of the underlying enabling abstractions. If you are learning these at a university, the typical course names are calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, complex variables, nonlinear dynamics.Then there’s the math that's just about uncovering the deep underlying properties of abstractions. Everything is built from first principles, rigorously, no details overlooked. Definitions/theorems/proofs are the focus. Computation is an afterthought.

These days automatic transmissions are faster than humans can shift and nearly as reliable with less and less horsepower loss as the years go by. What your instructors are getting at is similar. C and Rust are cars with manual transmissions or in computer terms manual memory management. C#, Java, and the node.js platform are automated memory management languages. Manually controlling gears, downshifting into a corner, clutch kicking when you want the ass end of your car to slide, and dumping the clutch for a nasty burnout are things you can only do in a stickshift. Similarly, manually allocating heap (and stack) memory, directly accessing processor register information, running online assembly and other features are only possible in systems languages like C and Rust. Most people just want to get to work and back safely which is why most cars these days are automatic. Business software (and jobs) are the exact same. Businesses don't want to hire you to write a compiler or window manager. They probably want a crud app that is fast enough and doesnt look awful.

mommpil,"Everyone else is talking about speed and I think that's completely missing the point, there are very good reasons to use C++ other than just speed.Here are some things you can do in C++ that you can't do in Python. All of these things you can also do from C. Many of these things you can also do from Rust and other languages that compile to native code, but not all of them.1. Call native operating system APIs directly. If you're on Windows, go to [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/) and explore the tens of thousands of APIs. The ONLY way to call these APIs directly is from a compiled language like C++. If you call them from any other language you're just calling some wrapper function that calls the function from C. That's even true for C#, even today there are some Windows APIs that you can't call from C#. Some specific examples below.2. Memory mapping. Let's say you have a 1 GB file. In C++ you can memory map that to an array of bytes with 1 billion elements. The memory map function returns almost instantly, it doesn't copy the file into RAM. When you access byte 777,000, it doesn't read the previous 700 thousand bytes, it just reads only one small chunk of the file from disk into memory at the moment you access it.3. Shared memory. You can have multiple processes on the same computer that ""share"" a chunk of memory directly. To communicate they don't need to copy huge data structures back and forth if they don't want to.4. Hardware drivers. Using C++ you can write directly to a memory address, or read directly from a memory address. Most hardware peripherals are entirely controlled this way, by communicating via nothing other than accessing special memory addresses plus hardware interrupts to let you know when something changed. On a modern operating system you can only do this if you write a kernel driver, but if you get an embedded development kit you can write bare-metal code that talks to keyboards, sound chips, push buttons, or whatever just using direct memory reads and writes.5. Hooking system functions / injecting code into other processes. For example on Windows, write a DLL that provides an alternate implementation of some common function like ShowWindow, then inject that DLL into some other process so every time they call ShowWindow, it actually calls your function instead.",dmazzoni,2025-04-23 16:00:35,228,learnprogramming,t3_1k5xqyo,False,
molmju8,"A useful resource is Bjarne Stroustrup's site for A Tour of C++: [https://www.stroustrup.com/Tour.html](https://www.stroustrup.com/Tour.html)Even if you don't use that book, you can look at his exercises document, which could be used in principle along with ANY C++ learning reference. And if you look through it, you will very quickly find little ""baby projects"" that could be made that are very C++-specific. For example, let's look at the list for concurrency:> \[2\] Write a program with two threads: one that writes ""hello"" every second and one that writes ""world!"" every second.>\[3\] Time a loop. Write out the time in milliseconds. Do this for the default setting of your compiler and for a setting using an optimizer (e.g., −O2 or ""release""). Be careful not to have the optimizer eliminate your whole loop as dead code because you did not use a result.>\[4\] Repeat the histogram drawing example from §5.6.3 for a normal\_distribution and 30 rows.>\[5\] Use a regex to find all decimal numbers in a file. So, on that list, \[2\] and \[3\] \*could\* be done in Python, but they would not make sense. The issues that Mr Stroustrup is trying to teach here (e.g. how concurrency works on the OS or hardware level) is probably best observable in C++. Also for \[3\] this is purely a C/C++ thing. Python turns code into bytecode in a completely different way. I very doubt that Python does loop elimination or anything like that, for example. Also, to properly do all parts of \[3\], you will also need to look at the assembly language output of your code to see what optimizations your compiler is doing (and to really verify whether it is eliminating loops, and under what conditions it does that).Exercises \[4\] and \[5\] probably could be done in any language, of course Python would be an easy language to use for \[5\]. I'm not sure why Stroustrup placed these exercises in the concurrency section.

However, your impression of how great it can be might not vary as much as you anticipate unless you are lucky.I use the word lucky depending on where you live. Depending on the area you live, country etc. it can be quite difficult get in the *right* job. In many ways I have been lucky due to my autonomy at work, but the actual coding part is like 10% of the time many cases. Tasks won't be well defined. Communication is extra overall including meetings. You'll work on code made by others that is weird. You'll work with people that might not share your views on coding standards. My worry is that you don't know anywhere near what a developer job would encompass and it wouldn't be nowhere near as fun as personal projects. What I would possible do in your case is to extend and improve your current work by automation with code, and not just no-code tools, but actual coding as well. Python would be great for this for example. When you have some real-world coding projects and experience, maybe then you can go further.I'd hesitate making the jump before you have done a side-gig of coding, or getting to know it much more than what you know now.

mp5o804,">I have no idea how my degree is supposed to get me a job.A harsh truth nowadays, which is not communicated well to students at all, is: your degree gives you **skills**. Without those skills, you can't get any experience, so it's a necessary part of the puzzle! But the tech boom of the last decade or so has meant a **lot** of people have learnt some coding skills, so jobs increasingly require both skills **and** experience.>how the heck does programming even work? What the hell is happening?Think about a simple circuit, with a battery, a push button and a lightbulb: you press the button, the lightbulb switches on; you unpress the button, it switches off.Now imagine you have a 7-segment LCD display (like the ones on digital clocks that display numbers): that's just 7 versions of the same thing, so in order to display the number ""5"" on your screen, you need to press and unpress the right combinations of 7 buttons. But that's really annoying, so instead, you create a mega-button labelled ""5"", and just wire it so that when you press the ""5"" button, it press and unpresses all the right buttons for you. Congratulations: you have abstracted away the electronics, and now you have a simpler interface.Programming is just that: abstractions upon abstractions. You can't write a ""hello world"" program by interfacing with the monitor directly - mapping each key on your keyboard to the setting and unsetting of individual pixels - primarily because that would be insane. It would be like my 7-button example above, but trillions of buttons. Computers would be utterly unusable without abstractions to handle all that for us.>I know I could probably just import a GUI library and use it, but I don't want to just use a library, I want to understand how this technical stuff (that my school didn't teach) works.Firstly, don't blame your school for not teaching you how to build a computer from scratch out of transistors and diodes. That's like complaining that your school allowed you to buy pens and notebooks, rather than teaching you how to grind your own ink, whittle your own quill, fell your own tree and process it into paper. If you're really, deeply interested in that, then you **can** work towards it: it's not a bad thing to do, it's just a very niche thing to do. For most people, as they transition from school to work, they should really be focusing on what they need to do / learn / practise to make their skills **productive**.

I'd done a lot of professional programming before I got my degree (decades ago, when one could more easily get work without a degree). I didn't start on my degree until I was 30. To me, nearly every class-required programming project until my senior year looked like a toy project to me.*(The one project that wasn't a toy project was insanely big and complex, most people dropped out of the class doing that project, myself included, and the three people who did finish the class had to spend an extra semester beyond the one semester the class was supposed to take to get the classwork done.)*Not to brag (okay, yes, very clearly to brag) I graduated at the top of my class in Computer Science. I couldn't help but feel my classmates were in for a rude shock when they had to do real-world coding projects.What helped me feel more prepared is that programming had been a hobby of mine since high school. Even before I got my first programming job I had already, just for fun, done stuff much more complicated than I had to do to get a Bachelor's degree in college.This is not to say I didn't learn anything useful in college. I most certainly did. I gained a lot more discipline and perspective on coding than I had hacking away on my own.It helps if you actually enjoy creating software and aren't just after a degree because it seems like a good way to make money. If you've got that kind of interest, I'd suggest jumping in to help on some open-source project that interests you, or just come up with your own projects that pique your interest. Challenge yourself. Find things that keep pushing the edge of what you know how to do so you're always learning something new as you go along.This is not to say you won't be able to get a job and work your way up while learning on the job.

Again, while you _can_ build perfectly fine stuff with it… why not use a better language?IMO, the only thing PHP does better than any other language is the seamless integration into HTML pages. Which is how it got started anyway, and why it's so easy to pick up, and why it's become so popular. Because the progression from dicking around with HTML to adding some programming to said HTML is seamless and easy and likely a natural gateway drug for many.

morawh7,"\> I'll just memorise the syntaxThe reason you're struggling is because memorising has nothing to do with programming. Now programmers do indirectly memorise syntax, but it's only because this is a byproduct of understand the syntax.This would be my suggestion:1. Take an example of some C++ code from the internet.2. Open a text editor and type in the code. Don't copy and paste the code. The typing will help you to remember things.3. Run the code through a compiler making sure it compiles and runs. Understand what the running code is doing.4. Now go back to the editor and write one or more lines of comment for every line code in the file. Tie some of the comments back to the behaviour you saw when you ran the code.5. Now go back to step 1 and repeat this for another dozen or so different examples.Those 12 examples could easily be a day's work, only because you will need to research each and every line of code so that you can write the line of comment for code that makes sense and is accurate. But what you should also find; as you loop through more examples that process of adding a comment get easier; you should also find the typing gets easier and is more accurate.Now if you repeat this for two or three weeks, you'll find your way on the way to being a programmer.And using this approach you can actually measure your progress. If after one week you're still struggling to write a line of comment for each line of code, then you really have not learned much. Over those many examples there will be many common lines of code, meaning the comments will also be common. It is the details found in those comments that you are trying to memorise, not the code.PS: For context, here are some examples typical line comments. But in general, these comments should also span more than one line.// import the iostream.

So for example if a project builds with gcc, clang, and MSVC they might wait until all three support all of the syntax, but if the project only needs to run on one platform with one toolchain they might upgrade sooner.Allowing features from a newer C++ rarely means updating all existing code. Parts of the code that are stable and haven't changed in a while might still be written in an older style, including a pre-C++11 style.So if you joined a company today and got put on a C++ project, my expectation would be that it supports and allows C++20 (which has been stable in all compilers for a while), does not support C++23 (most compilers have incomplete support, the average project doesn't want to be bleeding-edge), but that lots of the code doesn't take advantage of newer features where it could because nobody has bothered to rewrite it.Newer versions of C++ standardize things like networking and threading that were previously only available from third-party libraries.

Also consider your definition of a ""project"".A project does not have to be large. And if you do have a larger project in mind, you can probably break it down into smaller ones. When I was writing file parsers as part of an automated test tool (it took in a file describing expected values and various data recording files), I studied parsing techniques. I wrote a variety of one-off programs that parsed the various input file formats and then turned them into libraries that could be used by the actual target program. Each one of these took me 1-5 days (some formats were simple, others were not, by the end I was able to reuse code as well for similar formats), then I integrated them into my main program and glued it all together and had a beta version for my colleagues.What I didn't do was try to implement all the parsers all at once (context switching between each task) or only write them as part of the main program with no way to evaluate my partially working system. By setting them up as these one-offs I was able to stay focused, generate some tests, and figure out if I really was parsing the data correctly (mostly taking the parsed data and regenerating the original files and comparing the two).If you have multiple projects that you want to complete, set deadlines. Decide that ""By 15 May I want project X to have features A, B, and C."" Then do it. If there's no external driver of priority (no work or school objective, all personal) you declare your priorities. Otherwise everything is the same priority and no progress is ever made. Even for work I do this. If I have a 12-month project with no one deciding which features needed to be done by a particular date, I just set them myself. If the customer/user didn't like my ordering I'd ask for their priorities and if they still didn't give them (or everything was #1) then I stuck to my plan.

mpp9cjx,"The right QA solution is going to be different depending on a lot of factors related to your project. How often the code changes, how solid your requirements are, what your dependencies look like, etc. During development it's a huge boon to already have tests written that you can use to exercise your code path. If not TDD just as an assist to get your debugger to hit while you're sorting out the quirks. If your shipping an SDK or package especially unit tests are important.I have a personal preference to dislike unit style tests for applications. My experience with them is that you end up with a lot of test cases, that's a lot of code to maintain. Most if it is repeated and exercising the same part of a function dozens of times. I often find unit tests that aren't testing anything at all, but rather validating assumptions of the language or platform, which is completely inappropriate and a waste of time. I've read plenty of great unit tests too, I've just grown exhausted pruning and curating them.What people don't often account for is that tests aren't just expensive to write, but they can be expensive to maintain too. Because of this, I prefer a smaller curated set of tests that cover larger scenarios than a 'code unit'. Not integration tests, but something that exercises the actual intent of the application as thoroughly as possible while not requiring real dependencies to be set up. Then I use a comprehensive monitoring solution to detect when edge cases occur in our production environment.Everything is a trade off.

Bring in the data - this part is easy if someone else has already done the hard work of collecting the data, but in many real-world scenarios the data hasn't been collected yet, so this might involve building apps, sites, custom tools, scrapers, whatever is necessary to collect the data for your particular application.2. Clean and prepare - this can be quite subtle and nuanced. If you accidentally bring in any features that are biased or correlated with the class you're trying to predict, your model will overfit and you might not realize it until months later when it fails to work in production.3. Call the class of algorithm and fit - this seems easy when all of your data fits in RAM, but once you start trying to train on hundreds of terabytes worth of data, this is no longer simple. Also, when you have to wait days to train instead of minutes or hours, it becomes far more important to figure out how to validate your approach on smaller subsets first before trying to train on everything.4. Predict - in most real-world scenarios you're not just calling predict once, you're trying to take that model and embed it into an app so that it can do real-time predictions.

Spending a whole year faffing about with HTML and CSS is not going to work. This is a challenging field to find work in with a lot of competition. So to make it here you're going to need to shift your expectations, and really commit to learning properly and at pace.It can be done.

I am trying to align your expectations to be more realistic so you have a better chance of success if you're actually serious about this being more than a fun hobby.The level you are at now (know the basics of HTML and CSS, and a little bit of interaction from JS) is where I would expect someone to be after a few weeks. Not a year. You are nowhere near being ready for work. So have a serious think about if you want to do this, and if you do commit and set yourself up for success.For a junior role you will need: \- A solid understanding of TypeScript\- A solid understanding of some front end frameworks / libraries (React & MUI/Mantine/Shad-CN)\- A solid understanding of some backend framework (Express/Hono/etc)\- A solid understanding of testing\- A solid understanding of databases and ORMs\- A solid understanding of surrounding tech such as GitHub & Actions etc. Nobody, in 2025, is building websites with basic HTML and CSS. That is how we did it back in 1999. And commercial work is going to require that you have the skills and understanding necessary to work in a modern way. The bar to entry is high.

But these prototypes aren't the deliverable, the drawings and 3d models are. They'll use the prototypes as seeds/base for building mode complex models sure, but the direct output from a no-code or low code solution is rarely ever passed on as the actual deliverable.To sum it all up - For a typical career in programming, I feel you don't really need it (outside of cases where using them speeds up the feedback loop).

mokosj2,"Python is a good start and is enough to understand programming concepts.To be completely fair, the most important concepts you need to learn have nothing to do with actual programming or languages. Those are your foundations - Data Structures, Algorithms, Networking, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Databases. There’s a very good reason most universities focus on theory for the first two years of a CS degree, and not so much on coding. Learning these will make you understand programming as a whole. After that, any language will be equally valuable to you.To answer the question. I’d say, after learning Python well, you can either go useful, frontend or lower level (well every other language is lower level but that’s not the point).If you want to find a job as quickly as possible, learn Java or C#. Those languages are by far the most used in the industry and there’s never lack in demand (keep in mind that there is also a lot of supply). If you choose this option, you have to know that you’ll also most definitely need to learn their respective web frameworks - Spring and .NET, as they are pretty much required by the job market. This is a very good path to take and I can highly recommend it. Also, keep in mind that there’s a very good chance you circle around to Java/C#, even if you choose a different path now, since these are one of the most essential languages and are taught and used everywhere.Another popular route is to master JavaScript and become a capable full-stack developer. That’s also where React comes in. React is a JavaScript framework used for simplifying the way to build responsive web interfaces. I think there will be time in the future to worry about frontend, so I wouldn’t choose learning JavaScript at your current stage.Finally, the lower level route. I personally encourage any beginner to go deep into the land of pointers because you gain soo much more understanding of the way a computer works, than you do by using Python or JavaScript. For this I recommend you go with either C or C++ (personally, I’d go with C). These languages are what we call “lower level” because they don’t have fancy built in features to simplify the hard stuff and you have to think a lot more about everything. Those languages have no “garbage collection” meaning you need to allocate your own memory, and you need to free it when you don’t use it anymore. They use pointers to reference the data you use. C has no Object Oriented Programming, meaning you can only encapsulated data using a “struct”, and you can’t have methods tied to that data (procedural programming).",todorpopov,2025-04-23 08:04:29,1,learnprogramming,t3_1k5s9wt,False,

The biggest differences are: (1) C++ is compiled, so you must first run the compiler to produce the program, which you can then run; (2) C++ is strongly typed, you must declare a variable before you use it; (3) C++ has two types of variables, those that hold values (x=1) and those that point to another variable or location in memory (pointers). In Python, everything is a pointer, which can cause a lot of confusion for people used to 'C' or 'C++' (or most other 40+ year-old languages).Take a look at: [https://cs.kenyon.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CForPythonProgrammers.pdf](https://cs.kenyon.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/CForPythonProgrammers.pdf)",fasta_guy88,2025-04-24 12:33:17,1,learnprogramming,t3_1k6qtkz,False,

We all have our favorite little solutions, but if you can write a function with a loop and a few \`if\` statements, you're done.>However, the above link doesn't explain why the hashmap solution is more efficient.Hashmaps trade space for time. They offer O(1) time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions, which is to say that you can find, add, or remove an element in constant time regardless of whether it contains 5 elements, 5 thousand, or 5 million. But they get that speed by using enough space to avoid collisions (where different keys hash to the same location) most of the time, so they're very efficient in time, much less so in space.>I've heard that in technical job interview problems, if you can use a hashmap, then you should. Would you agree with this?Certainly not. Use the right data structure for the job. Hashmaps are often a great choice, because if you can get constant-time access to every element, that's pretty appealing. But hashmaps are unordered, so a poor choice if you want to access elements in order. They use a ton of space, so not great if there's a space constraint or if the number of elements is huge. And they don't handle multiple values for a single key.

momk8j9,"Big O, `O()`, is an **abstraction** to help us _estimate_ algorithm complexity, performance, and scalability. * In _theory_ there is no difference between theory and implementation. * In _implementation_ there can be a HUGE difference.Like all abstractions the devil is in the (implementation) details.The reason we DO count instruction cycles when profiling is because it gives us an absolute time that we can use to compare against. We can compare:* _actual_ **run-time** time versus the* _expected_ **theoretical** best case. That is, we can do A vs B comparisons such as A is `X%` faster or `Y%` slower to answer the question: _Is our optimization helping, hindering, or neither?_But oftentimes we want to know HOW an algorithm scales up relative to input size. `O()` is an _estimate_ of this which may, or may NOT, be accurate:If we have three algorithms that all perform the same task and have this scaling ... * O( n )* O( n^K )* O( K^n )... then the linear `O( n )` algorithm is probably going to be the fastest, by far, all things considered.However `O()` IGNORES RAM speed, RAMaccess patterns, and branch prediction -- all which MAY be factors!The _reason_ this was done was that pre-2000's CPU speed and RAM speed roughly had a 1:1 mapping. We used to store calculations in tables because the computation speed was SO slow.However by the 2000's CPU speeds became significantly faster than RAM. As CPU speeds increased and RAM didn't (as much) it became faster to calculate more, lookup less.Unfortunately Computer Science textbooks never got the memo that `O()` has COMPLETELY failed to adapt to the changing hardware and performance uplifts of modern systems. **It is an INCOMPLETE metric.**Let's take a [simple example](https://github.com/Michaelangel007/cache_line_speed) of summing up entries in an array. sum = 0; for( int col = 0; col < STRIDE; col++ ) for( int row = 0; row < SIZE; row += col ) sum = data[ row + col ];_Normally_ stride is 1, sequential acess, but what if it isn't?We can change the stride to show HOW we access data (and the data cache) plays more and more of a role the larger the data set.For example with an array of 2^30 elements (1,073,741,824) we see this falloff:| Stride | Op/s | Time ||--:|--:|--:|| 1 | 1 G/s | 00:00:00s || 2 | 1 G/s | 00:00:00s || 4 | 733 M/s | 00:00:01s || 8 | 388 M/s | 00:00:02s || 16 | 213 M/s | 00:00:04s || 32 | 141 M/s | 00:00:07s || 64| 116 M/s | 00:00:08s || 128 | 115 M/s | 00:00:08s || 256 | 115 M/s | 00:00:08s || 512 | 100 M/s | 00:00:10s | | 1024 | 66 M/s | 00:00:15s |EXACT same O(n) but HUGE differences in the Real World^TM.HOW we access this array matters! This is why ... * AoS (Array of Structs) and * SoA (Struct or Arrays) ... can have such a HUGE difference even though we are iterating over the _same_ data. **All those cache misses add up to slower performance.** This demonstrating O() IS incomplete for modern algorithms.In modern performance programming, often times we want a _branchless algorithm_ as we are _trading latency for throughput._ We want to keep the CPU pipeline saturated with work and not cause pipeline bubbles or flushes via branching.There are 3 categories of optimizations from slowest to fastest:1. **Micro-optimization** or [Bit Twiddling Hacks](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html). On older compilers and slower CPUs you would replace `MOD` with `AND` for powers of two, division with multiplication and bit shifts. i.e. Calculating `7*n` as `n + 2*n + 4*n` -- assuming your CPU even has a `MUL` instruction!2. **Algorithm.** Using a faster algorithm used to be the second step in optimization . We would use `O()` as a guideline for performance/scalability.3. **Macro-optimization** or Cache-Oriented aka Data-Oriented Design (DOD). As we deal with larger data sets optimizing for _minimizing cache misses_ becomes more important.See [CppCon 2019: Matt Godbolt “Path Tracing Three Ways: A Study of C++ Style”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG6c4Kwbv4I) where OOP, FP, and DOD is compared.",mysticreddit,2025-04-23 15:48:41,3,learnprogramming,t3_1k5y2ma,False,

Assembly expects you to be explicit, and it's impossible to IMAGINE all the things that would break if you changed it.It's not that - theoretically - assembly couldn't have been written so `var` always explicitly references the pointer and `[var]` always explicitly references the value, but that's not how it played out and it's not how assembly functions under the hood.This is pretty common in every language and language-syntax. There's always things that seem like they should work, that don't seem to conflict with anything else, that simply don't work.For example, in JS we have what's called ""optional chaining"". We can use optional chaining to access an existing property's value, but we can't use it to assign values to an existing property, nor to create properties w/ assignments (if the property doesn't already exist). Why not? Seems like it'd work.But it doesn't, it isn't that simple, and making it work would short-circuit all sorts of other things JS does. However, I do believe there are some JS proposals to add ""optional chaining for assignment"" to the spec. But assembly is way lower-level; it's nearly raw processor instructions.

mphrv9m,"I'm not really satisfied with other posters' answers. There are two important facts they seem to be missing:- Not accepting ""MOV AX, var"" is a quirk of your assembler. ""MOV AX, var"" works fine in my preferred assembler, [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/).- ""LEA AX, [var]"" is semantically equivalent [1] to ""MOV AX, var"" but they are actually different instructions! [2]You can prove LEA and MOV are different by looking at their binary representation (for example if you use a disassembler, or check into your assembler's command-line syntax to discover how to make a listing file). The bytes for each instruction are: 8D063412 LEA AX,[0x1234] B83412 MOV AX,0x1234My personal opinion is that your assembler sucks. If you're doing this for a class, you probably have to live with the professor's choice of tooling. For your own projects, I recommend looking into NASM. (I hear the cool people are using [yasm](https://github.com/yasm/yasm) these days, but I've never used it so I have no personal opinion on it.)Out of curiosity, what assembler are you using?[1] By ""semantically equivalent"" I mean they have the same effects on the registers and flags.[2] The reason LEA exists is to let programmers use indexed addressing modes for calculations instead of memory access. `LEA AX,[0x1234]` and `LEA AX,[BX]` are functionally equivalent to MOV instructions, but `LEA AX,[BX+DI+0x1234]` does a calculation that can't be accomplished with any other single instruction.Experimenting with LEA can be maddening if you don't understand it. That's because 16-bit LEA will only let you use certain register combinations, you can only combine one of {BX, BP} with one of {SI, DI}. (This was a hardware decision of the chip designers, and applies to all address arguments.) With 32-bit assembly in the [386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386), they added a whole extra byte to the encoding of indexed addressing modes (SIB, scale-index-base). So in 32-bit 386 assembly you can use any registers, and they even added the ability to multiply one of the registers by a constant factor of 2, 4, or 8. So the 32-bit instruction `LEA EAX,[ECX+4*EDX+0x1234]` is legal, but its 16-bit equivalent `LEA AX,[CX+4*DX+0x1234]` is not.",white_nerdy,2025-04-28 15:04:13,3,learnprogramming,t3_1k9pbq1,False,

This can often stem from feeling overwhelmed with too many commitments and feeling like you're struggling to keep up. It can creep up on performance driven people who push through hard circumstances not fully realizing the toll taken on their own mind and body at the time, until it chips away at them and they just can't handle the stress anymore and break down, usually in spectacular fashion. Speaking from my own experience.Start with introspection, and learning to have more respect and care for your own self. If your mind and body are not functioning optimally because you have been neglecting or overly stressing them in ways, you are consequently reducing your performance in all other areas over time. So think about taking better care of yourself as an investment towards doing everything else you are trying to accomplish to the best of your abilities.Next, learn when you need to slow down. Recognize when your mental state is ""redlining"" and figure out where you need to back off to restore your sanity. For me, this meant recognizing my work environment was unhealthy and finding a new job.

As others have pointed out, Intel has not innovated in a while.Back in the 1990s, the thoughts that Motorola would stop producing processors and innovating was absurd. The 68k CPUs drove entire generations of home consoles, not to mention oodles of commercial applications.The fact is, they couldn't keep up with Intel. That's what buried them. Now, if anything, they build ARM designs, no need to innovate. But that's also why you don't find them so prevalent in modern markets. They still do stuff, but the Motorola of the 1990s has been subdivided and chopped up more times than a tin of tomatoes. It never really recovered it's prominence in the processor world, it just makes low key devices, that's why you only sometimes see the Motorola logo gracing various products. They license a lot of it's IP. The question is, what's burying Intel? In the home markets, maybe AMD? Samsung certainly has a major edge against either company's offerings with most of Samsung's fabric being manufactured and designed with far cheaper labour than what the Americans can do. I don't doubt that in 15 years, when we want to build a new home PC, we'll be looking at NVidia and Samsung processors instead of Intel.

Even though the tool absolutely was tracking stats at the individual-level, they just said they weren't gonna use it.Everyone knew they were gonna use it.

Step two was to disable `@channel` and `@here` notifications in channels where people like to abuse that. Even a channel that you need to pay attention to, you can often treat it more like email and check in every hour or two instead of getting instant notifications.> ...unexpected urgent meetings...If it's an actual production emergency, sure. Short of that, most of this urgency is false. Having to constantly push back is exhausting, but you can, for example, start scheduling blocks of no-meeting time, and start actively declining surprise meetings, until people get the message.> ...late-night pings...Go into Slack and set a notification schedule. If your employer has a separate work phone, give it a Do Not Disturb schedule.

mpjlg6a,"I'll tell you this much: Every team I've seen whose swapped to writing code with chatGPT has made more PRs than they ever did before they adopted the tool. The issue is that the boost in ""productivity"" has come from scrum masters mandating that every dev split their Stories into a PR for every Task so that their performance telemetry indicates a 10x increase in productivity to upper management that coincided with adopting AI. That in turn scores the middle managers a bonus for meeting performance goals, but it never took more than 6 weeks before the additional PRs were coming primarily from trying to **fix the problems in the AI generated code**.That was only an issue because the senior devs were terrible at PR reviews and refused to admit it, opting to instead just blanket approve everything after a token pause for ""consideration"" while they listlessly browsed the internet. They made me a PR reviewer, but because I was rejecting code that failed unit tests, well- Didn't last long. The way it was going when I saw the door was they were keeping the ""1 PR per task"" scheme, but swapping off of using AI while the lower management were stealthily canceling the new hires' PRs and re-PRing the new guys' work as their own and approving their PRs themselves to make themselves look productive while they were doggedly trying to find *some way* to get functional whole project code out of chatGPT. The poor bastard who figured out they were doing it was fired summarily for bringing it up.I don't know if anyone has had a positive experience with AI development integration, but if I had to guess, it'd be with the tools that are making library suggestions/ autocompleting your lines to improve your typing speed and decrease your dependency on cross referencing syntax for multi-language code bases. (I.e. having the AI help the back end Python guy work with the Javascript/HTML that the front end guys made and vice versa).

After three decades of demand exceeding supply in tech, the market is caught with a sudden drop in demand at the absolute peak capacity of producing new engineering talent both domestically and globally. This is worse than fields where supply has generally matched demand and production pipelines weren't greatly increasing.Big tech recently ended their decades long practice of hiring talent to keep it off the market and instead is firing employees (across all functions, not just tech) to boost profits.

Today, capital isn't looking for growth without outsized margins. This further reduces forward looking demand.Its unclear how AI, tariffs and economic instability will affect most jobs in 5 years, not just tech. As a consequence companies are dramatically scaling back capital expenditures and focusing on operations. That's further softening the job market overall. This hits tech harder than other roles because tech jobs lean heavy towards capex.People with 5-10 years of experience are mostly fine. It's just taking a lot more time and effort to find roles. It's an absolutely awful time to be in or just out of college, no matter the career path.The days of tech being the easiest path to a high salary and stable career might be over but it's hard to know for sure.Every college kid needs to be told that they will enter the workforce in a period of change, uncertainty and instability most people have not experienced and can't even conceive of unless they are from countries like Venezuela, Argentina, Russia (that turned out bad), Brazil South Africa (that turned out mixed), South Korea or China (that turned out mostly good).If you want to steer your kid to a career with stability, tell them to be a doctor. The supply of medical schools is artificially constrained. The work requires a license by law. It's a field where coming changes like AI will augment but doesn't look capable of softening demand.",unskilledplay,2025-04-27 20:48:10,12,cscareerquestions,t3_1k9cgqo,False,

mojbqka,"Outsourcing to India sucks from the US for a reason that's entirely unrelated to racism: Time zones.Collaboration sucks. Needing to ask questions during the work day is impossible. The number of times I've seen a team work for eight hours on the wrong task, or a solution that's completely unviable, is nearly equal to the number of days I've worked with Indian engineers.And there's another reason that outsourcing to India sucks: The best developers in India don't want to work under those conditions, and they don't work for $20/hour or whatever you're paying your outsourcing team members. I'm told that many of the junior developers who get hired by outsourcing companies are making $10/day, and it's blatantly obvious that they do just enough work to keep the contact live for as long as possible. None of this is even remotely racism. Put a billion people in an area that has insufficient employment opportunities and you'll find millions who are willing to learn just enough software development to be able to do a crap job in outsourcing as part of a scam to extract money from richer countries. It's human nature. It has nothing to do with their culture or the color of their skin or their accent (though extra strong accents can impede communication, and that's a real problem).Not only that, but scammers running consulting companies run them in the US as well. Several of such companies are well known as defense contractors. Remember the debacle of the Obamacare web site that had something like 50 different consulting companies working on various parts? I'd have a hard time assigning that work to fifty people much less fifty teams. And the result was a disaster.That said, at the low end of developer skill? It may very well be permanent. For the last 30 years it's been bad for lower skill developers more often than it's been good. Higher skill developers are still doing OK even now, at least if we're willing to accept lower salaries. So the question to ask yourself is what your relative skill level is. If you have always been in the bottom of your class or the slowest employee wherever you have worked, it might be best to try for a pivot.(Edits: Fixed auto complete fails)",TimMensch,2025-04-23 01:38:40,190,cscareerquestions,t3_1k5mwwc,False,

India has plenty of amazing engineers, but those engineers are actually getting their money's worth and companies won't be saving by going with them as much as the other picks.The cheaper ones that are tantalizing to companies consist of higher amounts of self-taught and bootcamp coders. They are incentivized to focus on passing the interview rather than long-term transferable skills. I'm sure some of them are good enough for the position, but that isn't always the case.With AI and vibe coding, it's never been easier for mediocre developers to pose as a higher skilled one, especially when you only work remotely. Once the companies start to smell the shit pilings of AI generated code as it starts to cost them in maintenance, we might see a recovery.

mojn42z,"I dont think this is permanent. Tbh, i may be optimistic but look throughout history. It always takes a few years to fully recover. The 2008 crash we probably didnt fully recover until like 2012 or so. The argument i always make (and i have little actual numbers or data) is that covid made everything ridiculously high. Government was giving out money like candy to any independent worker or business. People were getting money that they didnt deserve to get (some did need it). I didnt deserve a stimulus check tbh, and i got one. In 2020 everybody stayed put to their jobs because they didnt know how the future would look like so it was best to stay put. Then things open up in 2021, companies all have the money to use for hiring so companies of all shapes and sizes ar hiring. Jobs become remote and it looks like remote is the future. But what i think happened was that companies didnt realize how hard it was to hire remote workers and have them quickly learn their codebases. Jr engineers didnt have any camaraderie with their older engineers. Then the free money is gone, people arent spending as much as they did in the high time of covid, and many projects get acwd because small companies can no longer keep up after the government help ended. Bigger companies realize that they can either get a similar engineer for less money or that they overhired in 2021-22 and can fire PIPd employees quicker without having to give severance. Companies have still paused hiring for some time and because of that many people have stayed without a job. I also think potential candidates are too in love with the idea of remote work that anything less than that they are avoiding. But i applied to many jobs and sooke with many recruiters.

We came out of a huge hiring spree in 2021-22 and when things normalized it forced the market to produce mass layoffs and slowly reduce hiring. In CS there are a few types of people. There are the ones who love it with a passion, will spend 50-60 hours working each week and creating new tasks for themselves. These are the overachievers who likely will end up working st faang or will dominate their mid-level company because they are the one employee everybody goes to. There are the types who like it but dont want to spend more than 40 hours unless it’s crunch time to finish their stuff. They do what their asked and sometimes they will look for things to do to show some motivation. They will do what the role entails. Then there are the types who also kind of like it but it’s clear it’s mostly for the money. They wont overacheive but theyll try to not underperform. They wont be front and center. There is nothing wrong with being either of the 3. But id say the 3rd person should never be in a job thats too demanding because this person wont have the motivation to do it.

Consider the fact that, on Stalin’s birthday, prisoners would send him congratulatory telegrams from the darkest gulags: it isn’t possible to imagine a Jew in Auschwitz sending Hitler such a telegram. > It is a tasteless distinction, but it supports the contention that under Stalin, the ruling ideology presupposed a space in which the leader and his subjects could meet as servants of Historical Reason. Under Stalin, all people were, theoretically, equal....> But why a master at all? The other way to deal with the decline of traditional authority is the anarchist way, and anarchism is having a revival today, from Noam Chomsky to David Graeber. Anarchism is not against public power—Catherine Malabou, another neo-anarchist, refers to Jacques Rancière, who asserts “radical equality between citizens who are considered able to both command and obey.” (Catherine Malabou’s words in: Malabou and Balibar 2022, p. 179) There is an essential relationship between the lot and democratic expression: there is public power, but “true democracy would rely on the contingency of who governs and who is governed because governing does not require any particular skill.” (Ibid.)...> Consequently, a paradox I argue for is that false opposition is to be left behind: we do not overcome alienation by disalienation, we do not overcome the master by eliminating it, and we do not overcome public power by limiting it to useful public services.\The non-alienated autonomous liberal individual is itself a product of alienation in capitalist society; a master effectively serving the people, taking care of them, is a fetish created to prevent the possibility that individuals will themselves take care of themselves; the idea of power serving society justifies power and thus obfuscates its constitutive excess.",clotifoth,2025-04-29 13:45:15,1,cscareerquestions,t1_mpiefh9,False,

mpqfe9q,"I never went to a school as good as Berkeley and I'm not saying this is necessarily your problem since I don't know the full context, but from what I can tell -- there are some signs of my early mistakes so I'll elaborate in case it helps you out.Looking back at my early start -- the one trap that I fell into was having the ""smart kid"" syndrome. I would always compare other people's lows to my highs and was always surprised at the end result. That being, they ended up much further than I did at the end no matter how well they did GPA/knowledgeable they were about coding etc.In hindsight, my mentality contributed to two major detriments in my first job search:1 -- I unknowingly built a moat around myself and classmates who could've been a resource, ended up becoming competition or inaccessible instead. In your story, it sounds like you have plenty of classmates who got into F500 or FAANG, yet it sounds like you never reached out for help or built enough connections to avoid applying 400/600 times per cycle. Assuming you carry the same mindset to a company ""in the middle of nowhere,"" you might fall into the same trap of assuming everyone in your new environment is beneath you and not building the correct connections to get to where you want to go.One of my early jobs was in a small private company that I've never heard anyone mention in this sub in a random state in the South. From my time there, I knew a few data scientists and engineers who ended up going to great companies 2-3 years after their tenure to places such as LinkedIn, Meta, Paramount, etc. Had I went in with the same energy as I did in college, I would've never made friends and been able to reach out to them for help when it came to career advice or referrals. Instead of coming in with the expectation of getting something out of every interaction, I just became the person people want to work with -- be there for when they need help or talk about the project or life in general. All the ""small talk"" that you think is a waste of time makes you personable and they'll remember you when time comes.2 -- That mentality carries over into how you present yourself as a person and affects you in ways you probably didn't notice before. For me, it caused mismatched expectations and actually set me back from learning to my fullest potential. I always told myself that I should've gotten a better offer or shouldn't have struggled for as long as I did due to my capabilities; my worldview was shattered over and over again, once someone I deemed ""dumber"" got a more coveted position or had breezed through their job search. And this mentality doesn't really stop, there's always someone luckier or someone better than you in some way, that got an opportunity that you wanted and it looms in the back of your mind on every task that you do. I don't much advice here aside from realization, but getting hit with reality and coming to terms with having weaknesses in certain areas or unlucky in others actually helped me learn a ton and that acceptance of capability and circumstance got me more opportunities and help from others than I had gotten previously.Inadvertently this also helped in interviews and building connections, at least at the entry level as no interviewer or coworker wants to work with a new grad/mid-level with a pompous or fake persona even if they do mostly know their stuff. At the end of the day, we all want is someone human to work with and one of the most human traits you can exhibit in an interview is that you make mistakes, can learn and are competent/graceful enough to pivot with a team to come to a solution.",terrany,2025-04-29 21:38:22,12,cscareerquestions,t3_1kaya3g,False,

mpqevhk,"I'm at Amazon.There are a few qualifying questions I'd ask before giving a definitive answer:* What org?* Where is your team based? This is a biggie, because it's not uncommon for Amazon to hire people in one location and then tell them to move in 60-90 days or lose their job.* What's the ops load like?* What is the make-up of their team? How many L4's has your manager promoted? Are there opportunities for growth up to L6?* Where is your office? Is it Seattle or Bellevue? What's the rent situation like, and is Seattle somewhere you want to live for years? Transfers are tricky at Amazon since 2022, so you'd be waiting a while for L5 before you can transfer - and even then you'll be up against hundreds of others.* Do you want to join in what is essentially a new grad role, or would you prefer to wait and join as a new L5 in a few years? Amazon has started downlevelling people lately, and it really fucks with URA as you have some L4's with years of experience making newer engineers look bad (and eventually up for the chop). The ""hire to fire"" culture is also still there in some teams.Most importantly, if you choose to join Amazon you should have a contingency plan in place in case you end up in Focus/Pivot. Speak to your current boss and see what their boomerang policy is. If you can bounce back in a year, great! If two, even better! There's little to lose.At face value, I would say that joining as an ""experienced"" L4 isn't a great idea, unless you're going to drastically improve your income by joining Amazon. Even then, layoffs are still occurring, and PIP is always looming, so you might not even see that salary. If despite all the warnings you're still sold, absolutely go for it.

Technically, you still qualify as a ""New Grad"".Whether this is the case or not, hear me out, you should take the Amazon offer, but keep your F500 job for the first month while you figure out if Amazon is the right place for you.Here's why:1. It is actually difficult to switch teams at Amazon. You will have to do a full loop and they may ask you for meaningful code reviews that you've authored. If you haven't been on the team for long OR if it's too ops heavy OR if there's just not enough scope, then HMs may not be interested in you.2. You might be a hire to fire. If you're put on focus, then you can't switch teams.3. Your manager/team/org might suck. If your manager isn't keen on your growth, then you won't get the scope to grow to the next level. You may also face issues if your team isn't balanced levels wise (e.g., no L6s or 0-2 L5s -> overworked L4s). EnderMB's comment is golden, esp ""What is the make-up of their team? How many L4's has your manager promoted? Are there opportunities for growth up to L6?""4. You might hate the work your team is doing (esp if you're randomly placed). You could be a frontend wiz, but get placed on a team working on compilers. Or your team might be a KTLO team where all you're doing is ops and bug fixes (zero feature work).Take PTO or a leave of absence from your F500 job, scope out Amazon, and then make your decision. Best Case: you're a great fit for your role at Amazon and you're happy. Worst Case: you have to leave Amazon and go back to your fully remote job.FWIW: I worked at Amazon as a new grad SDE I and fell into a team of no L6s, only 1 L5, and rest L4s. I had to put in over \~70 hrs per week to keep up with expectations. I burned out in 1 year and quit without having anything lined up.

Have a straightforward explanation ready for interviews: ""I joined eager to contribute, but the expectation of 70+ hour weeks without compensation adjustment isn't sustainable long-term."" Most reasonable hiring managers will understand.3. Target companies known for better work-life balance.

mp7f0ep,"I've worked at a smaller defense contractor (in comparison to Lockheed Martin, for example) and then moved to big tech. I'd say there are two primary advantages of working in defense. One is that you have better WLB as you can't really work at home with a laptop since most of your work has to be done on a clearance computer, so after your 8 hours you just check out which you can't really do at big tech because your laptop is basically expected to be always with you. The second is your job can't be outsourced and you won't be H1B'd either.The disadvantage is that your pay reflects that. Another disadvantage, although this is team based, is that the work we were doing also reflected that - we were using JavaFX in 2022. Like what. IMO, if you have on call or if your WLB is ever compromised in defense, flat out no, definitely not worth it. If you don't, it depends on what you prioritize - do you prefer better job security, but lower pay, or do you prefer less job security, higher pay? I will say that defense as a stepping stone is very good.

This is obviously not a concern in a synchronous exam. I know for my online masters program, there’s a huge de-emphasis on testing, and I suspect it’s because it’s impossible to police.

You're worrying about code size and performance too soon without seeing the performance impact here. It's normal for performance for applications to be tested. You shouldn't waste time reinventing the wheel when it's unnecessary. There's a couple factors you should consider. How much time will it take to implement, onboard, and document your protocol?

moq0kln,"are you checking r/ExperiencedDevs ? I have 2 Bay Area centered 10 YOE friends who got jobs both through LinkedIn reach out from recruiters. They spent months and didn't have as much luck in beginning of 2024 in doing the cold applications. They've had more luck during the end of 2024, though one moved to NYC. Both based in the Bay. One hired an ex-FAANG recruiter who was a resume writer but basically they both filled in their linkedins and got premium and connected with as many recruiters as they could to start the process, sent some cold messages. Basically SEO gaming to show up higher on a recruiters radius. I think they were averaging between LinkedIn big company applications and startups on Wellfound about 1/50 call backs per application. This included top companies not just FAANG and local + hybrid positions not just remote. Focused on the Bay Area geographically but NYC as well for one of them. One is a former .Net dev the whole time and the other was an embedded systems/C++ developer for half their career, then Data Science focused developer the other half. They both did around 6 months of cold applications, one did maybe 100 since they wanted to make their own cover letters and the other did about 300. Both non FAANG but F500 company SWEs. One BS in CS and one BS in ME, no MS nothing else extra. Some side hobby projects on their Github but apparently no one has looked at those. The both got full time positions again in F500 companies, one as a senior SWE and one as a staff level SWE. So I'm not saying that you don't get call backs from cold applications and you're doing the right thing with applying as soon as possible, but I think your geographic region matters a lot too. A lot of it is just luck. The numbers are insane. We're into a new presidency and past Q1 2025 so things might be looking different in terms of effective advice compared to even 2023 - 2024 which were both brutal for the SWE market. While you do cold applications, polish your LinkedIn profile, increase you SEO with recruiters. You don't need to pay anyone for that, I think the various job search subreddits have a lot of LinkedIn tips all for free. You just need to pay for LinkedIn Premium. I'm averaging 1/100 ratio of applications to call backs as a data engineering applicant with 2 YOE of direct DE experience, though on prem and I'm working with a huge gap of almost 18 months. I only use cover letters on applications to startups on Wellfound or YComb jobs. Otherwise I've just been submitting without a coverletter following the advice posted on r/EngineeringResumes for working on my resume using their wiki and template. I've applied to around 400 jobs, almost all of them directly through the HR portals of the company but a few through easy apply because I saw someone on reddit say it worked for them, totally by chance. I've applied for mostly on site or hybrid positions in most of the major geographic regions of the US. I've had recruiters reach out on linkedin, after I changed my LinkedIn seeing their success. 2 actually, for contract work but better than nothing and if my shitty profile can get it then there's hope for others with even some experience. Also not to shill for a service but to really maximize the cold applications I used hiring cafe because the Job Title + multiple Geo region search was a bigger time saver compared to LinkedIn and just opening all the jobs in new tabs and working through each one, one by one.

mplt72s,"Hey I can somewhat answer this as I went from a STEM bachelors 12 years ago to doing the WGU BSCS program and now I’m currently in the OMSCS program at Georgia tech.There ARE people who do the gtech program without a CS background but it’s painful for them. Gtech lets you in but then it’s sink or swim as you get thrown into the rough seas. You get to decide if you e got the stomach for it. There is A LOT of coding and it happens very quickly and there’s little to no support if you don’t already know how to code proficiently. It’s sort of expected that you either already know how to code or that you’ll pick it up on your own.WGU on the other hand will teach you from the beginning and if it’s too easy for you at first, then the magic of the WGU program that makes it unique is that you can accelerate through the program right up to the point where it gets hard for you. That’s why for some people who are already experienced software engineers, they can blaze through that program in 6 months if they were self taught years ago. On the other hand, people might take 3+ years to finish it similar to a typical bachelors because the WGU program, despite the elitism from a lot of people, is still a legit program that requires you to know your stuff.You seem like a decently smart person having done aerospace engineering, so maybe you’ll connect with my experience. My first bachelors (biology at UCI, moderately prestigious for premed) was tough but I finished with a 3.2 gpa. WGU was a cakewalk for me BUT I did learn a ton and finished in a little over two years. I learned how to code Hello World approximately 3 months before I started at WGU and feel proficient by the end of the program (can code decently sized programs from scratch in three different languages with minimal assistance). WGU tells students to expect 15-20 hours of work per week but realistically I was only doing 5-10 and still accelerating at a fast pace. The first half of the program I blazed through since I’m good at math and still remembered a lot of calculus. Discrete math was very intuitive for me.Now at OMSCS, when course reviews say that a class takes 20 hours per week… it actually takes 20 hours per week for people who have a strong CS background. People without that background are reporting 25-30 hours per week in order to learn all the stuff on the side that they need to learn.The average time per week per course is 15 hours per week and it’s a very accurate estimate for most people. Few people put in less time than that. Without a CS background, you should expect to spend an extra 25%-50% of your time learning all the things you need to code all the projects.Ultimately it’s how you want to break up the time. Doing WGU first means you won’t get to the really cool stuff like ML for another two-ish years and will also spend some time doing typical bachelors stuff that you don’t want to do, but the ramp up in difficulty will be much smoother and you can just passively do this on the side without too much disruption to your life.Or you can jump feet first into OMSCS, get to the end goal faster, but your life might be hell for the next 3 years straight.",vwin90,2025-04-29 04:13:34,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1kadnz6,False,

Professors are generally more accessible at community colleges, too. Good vibes there. I was admitted for the Fall term for OMSCS and I come from a non CS background(English Education BS / English MA). I was originally working towards a second bachelors (only required to take courses within the major), but I applied to OMSCS, got in, and decided to switch. In preparation I took Discrete Math, Discrete Structures, Intro to Programming, Object Oriented Programming in C++, Object Oriented Programming in Java, Computer Organization and Assembly, Computer Architecture, Data Structures and PreCalc/Calc1/Calc2. My experience is likely not the norm and I’ve seen people admitted to the program with fewer classes taken. I think OMSCS would be a more rigorous program with better name recognition, compared to WGU.One note is that if you’re applying for next Spring, classes in-progress aren’t really considered for your acceptance. So if you end up taking these classes in the Fall, with a Spring application deadline of August 15, that could be problematic for a Spring admission.

I definitely like the company, but I’m letting it go. I think what happened is they hire who they want to hire. People call in favors for one another all the time. It’s crazy.

mpdyz03,"Generally speaking, most jobs are going to be 9-to-5. Less means you're technically slacking (i.e. probably not holding up your side of the contract, possibly to the detriment of your own long term employability/competitiveness). More means they're probably taking advantage of you and/or you're not setting your boundaries correctly.Some things have reputations for being meat grinders (early startups, game dev), others have reputations for being chill (insurance, defense), but YMMV. Lots of people specialize in specific tech stacks, which usually makes them versatile enough to pivot to SWE roles within any industry.",lhorie,2025-04-27 22:21:10,4,cscareerquestions,t3_1k9ebry,False,

mpe9pej,"I always recommend defense industry (raytheon, bae system, lockheed martin). You charge the government for your time so you can never do more than 40 a week. But its flexible enough that you can do it in any way. Some do 4/10s others do 9/80s. I worked in one of those companies fkr a few years and i never thought anout work after 5 pm. Bosses were hardly on your ass and i really worked like 20 hours and was a top performer. You just need to be able to get a security clearance and the security of the job is always there. You wont make faang wages or get stock but you will earn a respectable wage. I earned 80k in 2018 and left at about 94k in 2022. Really bad WLB comes from companies and industries that are a bit more 24/7. Cloud is usually the worst at this because it is so 24/7 that availability and on-call is pretty much expected. I did cloud for a few years and was miserable. Honestly for what you want id say avoid faang, most “big tech” and especially cloud. It’s possible to have great wlb at faang but its very team dependent. I know a guy who works for amazon but doesnt have to work past 5pm. The thing is faang had a silent agreement to always be available and go all out for the company but there are plenty of companies with good benefits who just want you to get your tasks done and go home.",Broad-Cranberry-9050,2025-04-27 23:21:25,0,cscareerquestions,t3_1k9ebry,False,
