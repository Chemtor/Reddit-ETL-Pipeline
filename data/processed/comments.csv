In a situation where multi-tenant means a low number of organizational tenants (not individual humans) and the customer base is not growing significantly over time the shared db but split schema model can work really well as the high ops cost for multi dbs is not justifiable but the separation of concerns and queries via schemas brings lots of values in delivering features especially if different tenants have different demands which lead to asynchronous feature delivery and therefore async schemata to be handled by service versions.Overall the application layer is also not considered at all as schema splitting can help in certain scaling and complexity scenarios way more than splitting dbs or mixing everything in a single schema,OberstK,2025-04-12 15:33:51,2,dataengineering,t3_1jwl4w8,False,

So you can always leverage or pivot different technologies. And it’s a lot more forgiving in an architecture choice. You can mix and match lots of different stacks on the same data if desired.

That isn’t meant to discourage or trash DWH it’s just you need to understand the goals of the platform, requirements, and how users consume and develop to see what would be best.

Here's the argument: the whole point of conformed dimensions is to have a consistent set of dimensions that can be used across many many fact tables.

So if you build a datetime dimension at the second granularity, either you'd have to arbitrarily assign those dates to the first second of the day, which is misleading and wrong, or create a different dim_date dimension anyway.For a similar reason it's sometimes useful to have a separate dim_month table with year-month as the key (can be created as just a view on the dim_date table.) If you get data that is only available at the month resolution, you can either assign it to a specific day (not ideal) or use the month dimension to faithfully represent the data as it was recorded in the source.Retain the timestamps as measures, use two dimensions as you have.",dhawkins1234,2025-04-16 00:20:14,7,dataengineering,t3_1k05837,False,

The small number of engineers could not keep up with the volume and variety of requests so the analytics team bought a BI solution that allowed them to maintain their own models (Looker in this case). Based on your definition this was a ‘Shift Right’. The analytics team operated for years without dedicated people to ensure their environment was well organized or resilient to new business processes that require the logic that was locked in that transformation layer.When I took over that position we started to migrate logic out of Looker and into DBT, a process we are still working through today. The pilot project here was to deal with a deviation of a legacy data model in our data engineering environment by cleaning up and replacing it with all the goodies our analytics team extended and prepared in Looker for years. Once the legacy model was replaced we also made sure everything was set to refer to the new models.We are not moving away from having analysts model in Looker/LookML, though we have also set them up with DBT Cloud. Instead we are treating that workflow more like prototyping. Once our analysts have iteratively refined those models and they are stable we find the best way to ‘Shift them to the Left’.

mmu64jk,"It's ok to write lots of files to open table formats like iceberg *up to a point*, and as long as you're doing blind inserts.The append-only blind-inserts are part of the purpose of a bronze layer. By appending everything you receive without reference to what is already in the table at the time you insert it you can have multiple writers all writing at the same time without conflict. If you start doing merge operations or `where not exists` on the target table then you can start getting write conflicts.Having lots of small files is an issue when you're reading the data back, as it takes longer and longer to make all the individual API calls to grab each object. That can be handled by periodically doing a compaction on the files. A compaction can be run at the same time as blind inserts -- they don't conflict with each other.But this is all fine on a scale up to writing every second or so. If you're *constantly* making tiny writes and inserts then you're crossing more into streaming territory. If you can receive your data through a stream (or queue) then you can buffer up writes for a while then bulk write them to iceberg. AWS Data Firehose and Azure Event Hubs can do some of this for you automatically - each has a capability to automatically write all streamed data out to data files every time a buffer threshold is reached (up to ~15 minutes / ~300MB, whichever is first). If you don't need ultra-low latency queries, then these can work, and generally if you're working off of some open table format your queries have a certain minimum latency anyway.---The post you read may be talking about something like [Databricks autoloader](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ingestion/cloud-object-storage/auto-loader/). If anything else automatically does this for you it will have to be part of the execution & orchestration engine that you're working on. It *needs* some kind of eventing system and metadata-storing db to track everything. Iceberg is just a table format spec, not an ingestion engine of its own.Whatever it is it will basically be catching blob triggers and writing their data into a managed low latency db, then periodically grabbing any unprocessed files and batch loading them. It isn't super difficult to roll your own, but there's a few components and you'll have to reason things out yourself around managing the state for un/processed file metadata.",azirale,2025-04-13 02:59:24,10,dataengineering,t3_1jxun0q,False,

mmhyjax,"> I find a developer easier and if I find him he most probably knows a lot about modellingOnly applies to some organisations. I've been in some where everyone come up through a more traditional analyst pathway on SQL databases, and they had absolutely no concept version control, or version control, or literally anything other than SQL. Sure, you can find these people and grab them if that's all you need.Other organisations however may be more oriented around their own internal technology, and may have more SWE around the place. In that case finding developers that can work in something like Python will be a lot easier, and they'll be a lot more used to writing code that can be run and tested locally, and they'll be more familiar with all of the tooling around all of that and they'll prefer it -- they will be aggravated by the limitations of having to only work on a remote db and not having debugging tools.So this is just about matching up with the type of organisation you're in.> I dont care about scaling because the scaling part is taken over by...Not relevant to a decision between dataframe libraries and SQL. Scaling is handled by the execution platform and is entirely independent of the data transformation and querying code you've written.> I don't care about dependency hell because there are no version changes.This also isn't really about dataframe libraries vs sql.SQL databases do go through version changes and they can change behaviour or syntax and that can break things. As an individual pipeline or procedure writer you might not see that much if you've been relying on a DBA or an ops team to handle all of that for you, or if databases aren't upgraded for years you just may have not have gone through such a process. I have been at an org that spent about a year and a few million dollars desperately trying to update their all their SQL to work on the new DW because it worked *slightly* differently and randomly broke all sorts of things.If you get things working and just stick with a version, you're not going to get dependency hell regardless, because your dependencies aren't changing. Even if you are updating... I can't recall ever having any data issues due to version updates.All software gets updated over time. All changes can potentially break things. You can have frequent changes and small easily fixed issues, or rare big changes that are horrendously painful. These are platform considerations, so they don't directly relate to whether you're using dataframes or sql.> It is quite general and I don't face problems with migrating to another rdms.For the most basic of select statements, sure, you can usually copy+paste things over. For actual pipelines and management though, you're often going to have to change syntax around to fit with whatever server you're running on.* T-SQL uses `TOP` after `SELECT` but other dialects use `LIMIT` at the end* QUALIFY exists in some dialects but not others* Does your DDL have `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` or only `SELECT INTO`* What options do you have for tables in your DDL -- they are often quite different* Some RDBMS allow partition exchanges, but they don't all work the same way* Some servers allow `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS` while others require you check first.* Some servers allow `CREATE OR REPLACE` while others require you `DROP` then `CREATE`* Some dialects have ANTI and SEMI joins, others require you to implement in a subqueryIf you completely swap your dataframe libraries around you'll have to go through a similar process of finding equivalents. Or you could just not - if your pipelines run on their own host then each pipeline can use a different library, allowing you to gradually migrate from one to another. It isn't like when you have a single SQL database you're running on, and when you want to switch you have to move *everything*.> In most cases it look's cleaner to me than f.e. snowparkYou're just used to it (though I can't speak to snowpark specifically). Personally *I* find that the composability of dataframes and transformer functions allows me to better encapsulate certain behaviours and abstract them away. It allows me to run partial transformations rather than having to faff around with reworking subqueries or CTEs, and I don't have to scroll up and down massively long queries even for what ends up being a large and complex transformation.> The development roundtrip is super fast.You're probably just more used to it. What even is the 'roundtrip' to you? What are the development, test, and deployment cycles you're looking at using?> Problems like scd and cdc are already solved million timesAnd they have the same approaches in dataframes. You're still doing the same operations, you're just expressing them differently.---> Unittests are easierThis is significantly underselling it. By integrating the dataframe library into your imperative language, like Python, you can generate synthetic data during the script. Your transformations can be expressed as functions, which means you don't even need to load data into any kind of locally-run database, you can just inject data directly into the transformation function to check for the result. You can do this interactively when developing, chaining your own custom data directly into the functions that you are testing. Everything you write here can then by turned into an automated test.---The biggest aspect you are missing is that dataframes are integrated into another programming language, which allows your pipelines and processes to be much more dynamic and much more capable.For example, I can write a function that takes a dataframe and a list of key columns and it will automatically generate a column expression to generate a hashdiff. I don't have to list out the data columns every single time, it can inspect the dataframe schema and figure that out without running any actual transformations.I could have a function that looks at a struct column and automatically comes up with the column expression that will flatten it out. It can automatically do this recursively as well, making it very easy to flatten out ingested json data.I can write a UDF that can make use of *anything* in my programming language and return the result data back to the execution engine.During a long line of transformation steps I can inspect the data as it goes to change behaviour, including conditionally sending messages or alerts out. I don't have to wait for the end of a procedure to collect a result, I don't need another system to query some logging table to poll for results.I can make use of the fact that the programming language will have an LSP in my IDE to allow me to jump between transformer functions. Every time I see some abstracted behaviour and want to know how it works, I press a single key and jump directly to that code. If I want to rename something in my logic it is a single keypress and typing the new name, and that variable reference is renamed everywhere without error.When building complex transformations I can handle what would otherwise be complex subqueries or CTEs by chaining a single function call. I don't have to re-nest the previous statement in their own `SELECT` statements, I just take the existing dataframe and chain another `.select()` off of it.Overall this gives you more flexibility and expressiveness, but requires a slightly more complex approach. That tradeoff isn't necessarily for everyone, but it doesn't make one option absolutely better or worse than the other, it just depends on what you *want*.---As others have mentioned, they're not inherently exclusive. While using an RDBMS as your execution engine may prevent effective use of dataframes, using a dataframe-based execution engine you can also write SQL. Spark allows you to swap back and forth between SQL and dataframes (https://spark.apache.org/sql/) ; [Polars can also do it](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/dev/reference/expressions/api/polars.sql.html) ; and [Daft is bringing it in too](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/sql/overview/#example)",azirale,2025-04-11 02:25:28,7,dataengineering,t3_1jw8ov7,False,

When your needs change, you just update your business logic, delete the database, and replay your events through this improved logic. No more migrations, no manual backfills, no fragile one-off scripts, no emergency data recovery jobs, no writing painful ETL pipelines just to restructure your data — you simply reshape your models and press replay.

We worked with a Faroese company information platform that pushed all their raw events into Flowcore — and even though the events were pretty basic (like CRUD changes and updates), we were able to layer meaning on top during replay to build dedicated AI-optimized models. The result was that they now have an AI chat interface where users can ask super abstract questions, like *“Which municipality had the most new companies in 2024?”* or *“Tell me about this specific person and all the companies they’re involved in”* — and it just works.

Aggregating from raw data in each query sounds bad but I've done it on even very large projects; it saves a lot of ETL headaches and can be fast if the DB can store the data in a format that supports aggregation (eg sorted/partitioned on the grouping keys).

Instrument vendors usually don’t provide parsers or APIs, as they want to protect their proprietary technologies.This is a huge ballache. You'll want to put all unprocessed binary files into their own folder and convert them into a digestible format if absolutely required.

You can do essentially everything without coding or minimal coding whereas azure SQL you'll be building a database with code by code.Beyond that you're going to have to get familiar with azure portal and azure tools versus dynamics/dataverse etc. azure portal is in general much more complex than the latter.Azure SQL will shine when you have more experience and are in need of more throughput. An example being dataverse handles queries through fetch xml which is rather slow and clunky versus a traditional SQL query you can execute in azure. Relationships between tables is also annoying and superficial in dataverse.If you are new dataverse is a good POC platform until you outgrow it.,lysis_,2025-04-15 03:48:44,3,dataengineering,t3_1jzi6u4,False,

About 30% of the way through the process we got onto datafold and started data diffing the datasets in both places and found a tonnnnnn of random stuff we missed in migration because sql server and snowflake just work differently, like with case sensitivity and extra spaces and date function quirky-ness. We even found issues with our previous load process in sql server that we had no idea about XD.

mnay5f7,Thanks. The query I was working with already had nulls last in both redshift and spark. It looks as though my problem comes down to a lag function for which there are 2 identical rows coming back in the list of more rows at the start. The first row the lag should be null as it’s the start. But spark is favoring the second row and the lag is from the first row. In redshift the lag for the first row reports null. Just annoying.

mn3t969,"Some hard-won advice on this topic: 1. Have a good working relationship with your manager. Build trust. This will ensure they _actually hear you_ when you ask to take on opportunities to push yourself. Pushing yourself without this trust can cause your manager to view you as self-sabotaging (causing delays, ""biting off more than they can chew""), which makes everything harder. 2. Identify the developers on your team (or close to your team, this includes DevOps, architects, and even senior QA) who actually care about the quality of their work. Like someone else in this thread said, many people work in software simply because of the pay. Sometimes the ""this is just a job"" people are very talented engineers, but it's not as likely. When you find the people who really care, pair with them on your work, go to them with questions, etc. 3. Don't waste time, but ask questions when you can. In particular, if someone more experienced than you has work you can look at (e.g. in a pull request), and their implementation doesn't line up with how you would have approached the problem, ask them (politely/when it's convenient) to help you understand why they chose their approach vs your ""obvious"" approach. A major strength of more senior engineers is their ability to perceive/understand complicating factors, with nuance (see the last sentence in #4). A word of warning here... don't ask endless follow-up questions/don't get really in the weeds on every little thing. You run the risk of being seen as overly pedantic, nitpicking, or wasting time (for the pull request example, keep in mind that often the PR is only a final ""does this make sense to everyone?"" check before merging new code. So a developer might not appreciate having long conversations on every PR. For this reason, having a conversation or DMing them is often better than leaving a vague question as a PR comment). 4. Get involved in the design process as _early_ as possible. If you have the opportunity to sit-in on a meeting with an architect/dev lead while they design a new feature/project/service, _do it_. You won't be able to contribute (probably), and that is fine. But especially if these people are the ones you identified in #2, watching them work through a complex problem from the beginning will be a great learning experience. A big part of having engineering expertise is knowing what's important vs what is not important to the actual business requirement(s) (especially as it relates to the existing constraints of your application), not just knowing the ins and outs of your language/framework. 5. Talk to your coworkers about the work and build up your reputation as someone who cares. When you discover cool language features or software development practices, bring them up with people (""I found this cool HN article the other day talking about , do we use that here?""). Then, when other devs are working on something new, they'll think ""I bet /u/Spiritual_Donkey_521 would love to hear about this.""

We have mentors assigned to our interns so they always have someone to check in with to help them out and get them up to speed, and they're probably not even committing any code for the first two weeks with all the training thrown at them.Internships aren't just for the company to decide if you're ""good enough"" to hire after graduation, it's also for you to evaluate the company and decide if *they* are good enough for *you*. I would encourage you to try and finish out your internship and make the best of the experience, but wouldn't stress over the position so much that it comes before your classes. Set boundaries and communicate any unrealistic expectations - don't let them take advantage of your student mindset by giving you homework, just put in your hours like any other job then don't give them any more of your mental energy. Don't sacrifice your schooling for a potential job at a company that you know isn't going to treat you well anyway.

mmm7eqr,"Sorry to hear you're going thru this. No, not all internships are like this. The ""this is an easy task"" and other passive aggressive responses in particular are major indicators of a fairly toxic culture in that team and very likely the company. That's not typical of most teams, but it's also not as rare as one might wish. (And it is more common in teams that are hiring, because those teams have a higher turnover.)Toxicity aside, the overall lack of guidance sounds like what happens when the hiring team is more swamped than they expected when they signed up to have interns. The pattern of having to drop lower priority balls in a crunch is pretty normal, and it's likely ""intern support"" is one of those lower priority balls.In that situation, an attitude of ""interns are both cheap and temporary, let's give them a non-essential nice-to-have and if they get it working, great, if not we'll sort it out later"" is the kind of strategy some people will run with if they have some interns they don't know what to do with. Another possibility is they're attempting a sort of extended interview, where what they wanted wasn't so much to train people as to identify people with the tenacity to get it figured out, with an intent to make a job offer to those already at the ""swim"" level of capabilities (in a complete failure to understand (or probably even comprehend the possibility) that this is a side gig for you while you're mainly trying to graduate, rather than your sole full-time work focus like their jobs are).Either way, your best outcome here is to get it running more or less ok, get a good letter of recommendation, and find a different place for your next paid position. (Tenacity, managing burnout, and finding alternative second-best outcomes under limited support and uncertainty of project success are all important skills in this field, but ideally you'd be sort of eased into them with some decent mentoring along the way, rather than left alone to maybe figure out your burnout damage or not. Also, burnout is a pretty well-studied phenomenon, and it will serve you well into the future if you read up on the literature, as another side project for an hour or 2/week.)For getting your actual task figured out, there's a few decent options under the guidance they've (implicitly) given that they don't want their engineers to be bothered. You're doing the right thing by posting in external forums, this approach can help with your technical questions too. (Plus of course the web searching you're presumably doing about the error messages and unexpected behaviors you're seeing.)You can also try finding a person or 2 in the company (edit: or outside the company) (but not your official team and not the point of contact telling you it should be easy) who you like their vibe, and just ask if they'd be available for an hour each week or so, and if they can, see if you can collect good questions they can help you get thru efficiently, or point you in their idea of the next step, for stuff you don't know what to do with.Also a useful trick is to keep a slide deck open and capture screenshots of useful things to ask about. Later you can trim it into a presentation or a walkthrough of issues you still have that you can show people easily.Anyway, good luck and remember that your most important goal in this arrangement is to impress someone enough they want to work with you and will write you a letter and/or be a good future contact in another job. Getting your ""easy"" project running is a decent means to that end, but you can also potentially achieve it by showing people the hurdles you did overcome on the way to not finishing.(Btw, most sane people doing actual backend work know that nothing in this space is as easy as it sounds, so the people telling you this are probably either lying to put pressure on you or not all that experienced themselves and mistaken about the difficulty of something they haven't attempted. Possibly they just forgot how they learned the things they know now and how hard it was, but probably they don't know how to do it either, and would take at least twice as long as their estimate.)",dosadiexperiment,2025-04-11 19:37:14,5,learnprogramming,t3_1jwf1z3,False,
mmmslpr,"I was in your position before. Just my two cents:What is not ok * No onboarding structure: Being dropped into a codebase on day 4 with minimal context isn’t setting you up for success—it’s just irresponsible.* No dedicated mentor: Saying “this should be easy” to a new hire without offering guidance is lazy management. Interns and entry-level engineers usually need a few weeks to a few months to become productive contributors (reference: The Manager’s Path by Camille Fournier).* Poor leadership: The people supervising you either don’t know how to mentor—or they just don’t care to. That reflects poorly on them, not on you. * If I were mentoring a second-year college student, I’d fully expect them to get stuck and need hands-on guidance at first. That’s normal. Once they’ve merged a few pull requests and built some confidence, then I’d start stepping back and letting them operate more independently. That’s how real growth happens.What you can do * Document everything: Keep track of what you tried, what went wrong, error logs, who you asked for help, what they said, etc. It shows initiative and covers you if anyone questions your effort. Learn as much as you can but do not stress over it after working hours.* Ask for clarification in writing Something like: *“Just to confirm, we’re expected to deploy a live service to EC2 using Docker and environment variables—is that correct?”* This can prompt a reality check or at least put expectations on the record. This sounds like bad internship experience, and that’s OK. Internships are a two-way street: *they* are evaluating you, but *you* are also learning about them. If this is how this team treats interns, I wouldn’t want to work there full time. Don’t let their disorganization hurt your confidence. And like others said—prioritize school. That’ll outlast this internship.Many people have gone through rough starts and still gone on to build great careers. Doing your best in a poorly managed environment speaks volumes about your resilience. Try to take what you can from the experience, learn from it, and keep moving forward.

They don't do many for complex tricks because analyzing the number to see if the trick applies would take longer than just computing the answer.So how fast can a modern processor ""grind everything out"" for something like an integer multiplication?The important thing to understand is that it's hard-coded in circuitry. It doesn't have to execute a bunch of steps to multiply, one at a time - the circuits are right there in the chip and they parallelize as much as possible.That said, multiplication is not instantaneous. On a modern processor you can expect it to take 3 - 5 clock cycles, whereas something like addition can be done in 1 clock cycle.So, it is worth checking for some really easy tricks like multiplying by 1 or 0. Maybe multiplying by 2 even. Those checks are simple enough that the processor can detect them when decoding the instruction and shift it to another instruction, and that's exactly what's done.But, there are a lot of ""tricks"" that humans use to save time that wouldn't make sense for computer processors, because they can just ""grind out"" the answer faster than checking it.In general when you write code in a language like C or Python, the compiler/interpreter does some easy optimizations, and then your processor does some easy optimizations.

So if you add 01 and 01 you get 10, if you add 10 and 01 you get 11. So you can look at this as a truth table. For the first bit if you have:0 + 0 = 0 1 + 0 = 1 0 + 1 = 1 1 + 1 = 0 (with a carry)Electrically this is a xor circuit. If they are both 0 or 1 the first bit of the sum is 0, if the are different values then the first bit of the sum is 1. Now for the second bit of the sum you have the logic:If there is no carry from the first bit, xor the second bits. If there is a carry then you now have the truth table:0 + 0 = 1 0 + 1 = 0 (with a carry) 1 + 0 = 0 (with a carry) 1 + 1 = 1 (with a carry)Remember that there is carry you have an additional 1 coming it.

This is because it would increase the time to do most of the multiplications, because now you have a first step of checking if only 1 bit is set on one of the numbers then do a shift, otherwise continue with the multiplication. That check is only going to help rarely, and the check does take time.Now with a computer the compiler might notice that you are always multiplying a number by a constant like 16 and insert a shift instruction into the output rather than doing a multiplication. But that means you are always multiplying some number not known at compile time by a constant that is a power of 2. Most compilers will actually do all the math it can during compile time so if you have it calculate x \* (1 + 3) / 2 then the compiler might look at that say oh, you want really want to just multiple by 2, oh that is a power of 16, you just want to shift by one, rather than making the computer always add 1 + 3 multiple that by the input value then divide by 2.",pixel293,2025-04-13 15:51:29,9,learnprogramming,t3_1jya33j,False,

mmq9vt5,"Have you ever completed a course by yourself? The reason I ask is because there's a reason people go to university and major in computer science. This content isn't easy. Keep in mind, in the US, it takes 4 years to graduate with a CS degree.To be fair, in the US, you have to take a bunch of other courses. Maybe 1/4 of your courses are CS courses, and the rest are some related courses (say, in math and sciences) plus more general education (humanities such as history and English).Even so, there's a linearity to the CS curriculum where certain courses are taken before others. Much of which courses you focus on will depend on your goals. In any case, if you want to master this, you could go back to school. Yes, unrealistic, but as pointed out earlier, it's tough for CS majors to complete this curriculum with decent grades. They have the added benefit of time, friends, teaching assistants, professors, and perhaps even free tutoring (or paid tutoring). CS majors are often under time pressure to learn this material so some feel, even after a semester, that they missed stuff along the way.OK, now to address your question, this is my opinion on what to take.1. Discrete Math * This is a precursor to data structures and algorithms. I would say it's not fully required. Discrete math, in my opinion, should be a course where you learn how to do mathematical proofs. Specifically, direct proofs, proof by contradiction, and the various induction proofs (weak, strong, structural). It should also cover formal logic, in particular, propositional and predicate calculus. The rest of discrete math is a bunch of topics where you can apply your knowledge of proofs. Many self-taught learners tend to skip this and head into DSA, and that can work too.1. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) * If you were to take a real courses in DSA, especially algorithms, then you'd do work on solving recurrence relations. This is the math behind big O notation. Otherwise, you could skip that, and just know certain algorithms O(n) or O(lg n) or whatever. It would help to work out book problems, but I think implementing the various data structures and algorithms is educational. For example, I don't use pointers for work (at least, not to build linked data structures).1. Computer Architecture * I taught this a number of times. My current belief is the goal of a computer architecture course is to show you can build a CPU that can run a simple assembly language out of a clock, a flip-flop (a one-bit register), and logic gates. I had envisioned the class building this in software, but never got around to doing that. Personally, I think CS majors learn that the computer isn't completely magic (yes, it does do a lot) and realize, yes, 0's and 1's can make a program do something.Beyond that, I think you can read about the rest (e.g., computer networking and operating systems). I've taken OS before, so building something (again, super simple) is interesting, but you realize that real OSes are extremely complex, but at its core, it's something you can understand if you strip it to its bare essentials.The question, should you choose to study this, is how much time you can devote to this, and how deeply do you want to study it given a lack of resources. If you can find some online courses offered through a reputable university (you wouldn't get credit, but you could follow the content), then that can help structure your learning.At this point, you need to pick an initial starting point, which is probably data structures and algorithms as that's the most pertinent and comes up in job interviews.",CodeTinkerer,2025-04-12 13:26:54,11,learnprogramming,t3_1jxera8,False,

mmq3g8j,"When you call a function, you are asking for something. Return is how the function gives you what you ask for.Take some code like:```function timesTwo(int i) int { return i * 2;}```This is a function, which means it can be called from other places. It has an `int` *argument*, `i`; this means that, whenever someone wants to call this function, they will have to supply some int to be used in place of `i`. The final `int` after the right parenthesis denotes the *return type*. In other words, whenever you call this function, you are *asking for an int*. So, in all, the function represents a sort of contract: I give you an int, and you give me an int back.Here's how you might use this function:```int x = 5;int y = timesTwo(x);```What's going on here? You have an `int`, `x`. Then you initialize another `int`, `y`, and assign it to *the result of the function call*. As we said, calling timesTwo means supplying an int, and then receiving one in return. Here we are supplying `x` - that is, `5`.`timesTwo` receives `5` and uses it in place of `i` in the function body, so we can read the return statement as `return 5 * 2` which evaluates to `return 10`.Now, timesTwo promised its caller that it would give it back an int, and that is exactly what `return` does - it gives `10` back as the result of the call and gives control back to the caller, which assigns the returned value to `y`.Essentially, the return type of a function allows you to use a call to that function *as* a value of the return type in most places in your code, because the return type is essentially a promise that the function will give you a value to use there. `Return` is how functions actually make good on that promise.",Technologenesis,2025-04-12 12:45:07,178,learnprogramming,t3_1jxg1zu,False,

mmcdqe0,">The specific example was including \`using namespace std\` which I know full well has issues, but it made me question what ""industry standards"" even entail.The real issue is using that directive in a header file, because then you force any client who wants to ""include"" your header file, to also be ""using namespace std"", which she may not want to do.As for ""industry standards"", though, the only ""real"" industry standard is ""to follow the rules of the team leader"", as it were. In a University course, your prof. is the ""team leader"" position so if he/she says ""thou shalt not use 'using namespace std'"" then that is The Rule and you must follow it.For my own C++ code I like to use 'using namespace std' because personally it makes my code easier to read for ""me"". But I can see the arguments against it for ""production code"" (e.g. what if the future C++35 adds a new word to the std:: namespace, a word which you're already using in your local code). A better in-between solution is to use ""individual using"" directives like ""using std::cout"", ""using std::cin"", etc. However, that's a bunch of stuff to type out -- so to use it in practice you should either put them all in a header file, or use some smart IDE that inserts them all for you at the top (some IDEs can automatically insert all of them for you as needed).Most C++ programmers I have seen online just tend to avoid using directives and just write a bunch of std::cout, std::cin blah blah everywhere, which personally I think contributes to the impression that C++ is very difficult to read. It's a subtle style issue balanced on an issue of future-proofing the code. Sometimes we cannot have it both ways, unfortunately. Try to find a style which is readable for you, but also respect the local standards if they are in place. That's the best we can do for this.A commonly cited example is that ""using namespace std"" imports names which you may want to use for your own variables, like ""max"". OK, you got me there. However, how you resolve this is up to you. You can name your local variable something else, for example, ""max\_value"", or you can even resolve it by adding a trailing underscore, like ""max\_"", since the likelihood of a name ending in an \_ being declared in a Standard or in an external library is extremely slim. Personally I got used to that style from programming in Python. I know it looks kind of ugly at first, but it seems like Python has a lot of reserved words that I often want to use as local variable names, so I ended up seeing a programmer using that convention when porting code from C++ to Python (to append \_ to a name which we would 'obviously' use in the C++ code but which was 'conflicting' in the Python code), and it stuck for me.However, I would hesitate to use this style in ""production team code"" unless I saw explicitly that it were already being employed there. Stick to the local conventions, is rule 1.Same goes for prefixing ""m\_"" to member names in C++ class designs. Personally I think that's weird in C++, but \*a bunch\* of programmers do it for various reasons. So, if that convention is being used currently in the code you're working on, then by all means, continue to do so in that codebase when you add code to that class, for the sanity of your co-workers. It's kind of a weird style rule which seems to only apply for the unique situation to make naming the parameters of a constructor initiazer list less confusing. OTOH, once the convention is in place, something in your brain associates seeing the the ""m\_"" before a name as a hint that it's a member name, and vice versa (that an absence of the m\_ means it's \*not\*). So this makes it kind of hard to ""quit"" using this convention once you start using it.The other benefit of m\_ is that it makes ""naive autocomplete"" more convenient. By ""naive autocomplete"" I mean autocomplete which is not actually understanding your code, and which is just memorizing the symbols that you typed previously in the document or in other documents. So that's another convenience of that. Personally nowadays though I always try to use ""C++-aware"" environments for this language.

Make it known to the seniors around you that you're really invested in learning, ask to take on harder tasks, be willing to say ""I don't know how to do that but if you give me a chance I'll figure it out"" and sincerely mean it.I think the big thing that stops juniors from becoming seniors is a lack of ambition - some people, a lot of people even, are content to just do their job and not stretch themselves to learn or do anything new. But if you show you've got intelligence and motivation and are eager to step up, the opportunities to do so are usually there - they just usually aren't handed to you.A lot of this depends on the specific work environment you're in, of course.

Re-implementing logging to add global log level, log file, and log rotation was a bad idea, but creating a helper class that did it for you was super trivial and made writing tests and adding features a lot easier. The code was the same, but the implementation was flat and didn’t change the behaviors of the logger. Essentially I had seen the different patterns and could recognize them. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-design-patterns/",No-Let-6057,2025-04-10 19:57:15,26,learnprogramming,t3_1jw3wun,False,

mmhyqtr,"IMO what separates a junior engineer from a senior engineer is the difference between solving a problem and architecting a solution. A lot of that just comes down to time and experience as others have already pointed out. I do think there are some things you can do to fast track your way to a more senior level though. * Pair program with other more senior engineers, especially early in a project so you can understand how they balance architecting a robust solution vs solving the immediate problem. If you can coax one into being your mentor, even better. Most employers encourage this sort of interaction to foster growth in their engineering departments, it's just a lot of devs can be solitary creatures and choose not to exercise this muscle.* Review PR's from other more senior engineers. Sounds like you're already doing this to an extent, but don't be afraid to leave non-blocking comments on the PR and ask questions about how or why they did something. If anything this will make them feel good for being so smart and getting to explain the cool thing they did to someone else. A lot of people are afraid to ask questions because they think it will make them look dumb, but the opposite is almost always true with software development - in fact you will find senior engineers are often the most inquisitive.* Check your assumptions always. Senior engineers ask lots of questions because they assume nothing. Senior engineers don't learn to do something one way then always do things that way just because that's the way they already know. They try to consider every angle in every circumstance before those circumstances are encountered, which may mean exploring a different solution instead.* RTFM more. Go through all the docs for everything in your organization's tech stack and familiarize yourself with the basics, focusing on a breadth of understanding rather than a depth of knowledge. You want to know what possibilities and capabilities exist in your environment, so you can consider all those options in your project planning. You can then return to the docs for a deep dive into the specific features that prove relevant to your current project.Hope this helps.

(Or I guess more formally -- k = 1 is a counter-example)You can also formally prove this using the definition of Big-O and proof by contradiction.In short, if the two sets really were the same, that would mean that c^(k+1) ∊ O(cᵏ). Per the definition of big-O, that would mean that there exists some positive integers M and c₀ where c^(k+1) ≤ Mc^k for all c ≥ c₀.We can simplify this inequality by dividing both sides by c^k to give us c ≤ M. (Note that we don't have to worry about accidentally dividing by zero, since we can safely assume all variables are positive, per the definition of Big-O and our constraint on c₀).But, this inequality c ≤ M results in a contradiction: c can grow forever, so clearly cannot remain less then our constant M. Therefore, c^(k+1) ∊ O(cᵏ) cannot be true, which in turn means that O(c^(k+1)) cannot be a subset of O(cᵏ).

mn3yibn,"Big-O notation defines the **asymptotic upper bound** for the running time of an algorithm/function. Let us first look at the second case ie **O(c\*(k + 1)) Vs O(c\*k)**. Here, **O(c\*(k+1)) = O(c\*k + c)**. Here, **c\*k > c ie c\*k** will be **asymptotically bigger** than **c ,** because c,k are variables and nonetheless will be positive, and since in Big-O, we care about the dominant term, therefore it will be **equal** to **O(c\*k**). An example can be c = 10 and k = 10. c\*k = 10\*10 = 100. c \* (k+1) = 10 \* 11 = 110, which is asymptotically equal. However, for the other case ie **O(c\^k) Vs O(c \^(k+1))** ; here **O(c\^(k+1)) = O(c \* c \^ k)**. However , c is a variable and **not** a constant. Therefore, **c\^(k+1)** is **not** asymptotically same as **c\^k**. Therefore, **O(c\^k)** and **O(c \^(k+1))** are **not equal.** An example can be c = 10 and k = 4 . c\^k = 10\^4 and c\^(k+1) = 10\^5 ; a **10 times** increase in the running time**.** This is my interpretation , I could be wrong as well. Please correct if my approach is wrong. (Also, note that though c,k are input variables, when we use them in Big O , it is expected that they are large positive values, because we care about the asymptotic growth as the input size gets large. So all inputs are expected to grow larger and larger. For people who are not familiar with the word 'asymptotic', in general it means that how fast the running time will grow when input size increases. Take two functions : n\^2 and n , where n is the input. For some duration, n\^2 and n will run in parallel, but as n increases, n\^2 will grow rapidly compared to n , then we say that n\^2 is asympototically larger than n. )",Glass-Captain4335,2025-04-14 19:07:17,5,learnprogramming,t3_1jz1oep,False,

Just having a Sec+ and 0 actual work experience is worth pretty much nothing.Cybersecurity sounds entry-level because of titles like ""Junior Penetration Tester"" and beginner-friendly certs like CompTIA Sec+, but the jobs actually expect you to already have hands-on experience like from being a sysadmin, network tech etc. Sure, you can pass Sec+ with 100/100 points, and you'll still have absolutely no idea how to iterate over Active Directory and find attack vectors in a Windows environment, or how to securely set up a domain controller (random, not connected examples).Say you see a Junior pen tester job, and it requires a Sec+, OSCP and/or GPEN certs. You might therefore conclude that you can get it without much experience because 1. it's asking for a junior and 2. you can just obtain the certs.You see, ""junior"" is there because it's an entry to the role of a pentester, but not in an entry domain. It's a junior role for someone who has been an network administrator for 5 years, or a junior role for someone that did different levels of SOC support for 5 years etc. You will be expected to have x amount of years in lead up roles before you're hired as a pentester. You could for example get an IT helpdesk job, during which you can get your Sec+ or similar. From there you can try and move into a sysadmin role or similar, where you will actually be working in a real environment for a few years, during which you might try getting OSCP and similar certs, and only then would you be applying for a junior pentester job, only after you spent years solving issues and learning how things actually work in practice.You need actual experience working in real IT environments before you try to become an expert at any of its domains. You wouldn't be doing security audits on code written in C++ if you don't have years of experience working writing C++, similarly you wouldn't be doing network infrastructure security implementations if you never even set up an AP, a switch, a vlan, a domain controller etc. So say you do have 10 years of writing C++ in various areas, and now you want to shift to cybersec, only then would you be looking for ""junior"" positions in which you would do C++ code audits, not because you don't have experience with C++, but because you don't have experience doing audits in a c++ environment.",FriendlyRussian666,2025-04-15 09:25:53,2,learnprogramming,t1_mn7dj4p,False,

mmy5t6k,"Well, this takes a rudimentary understanding of generative AI, especially image generation. Unless you have a reasonably powerful Nvidia GPU it can be a bit challenging but I can sum it up for you. Get comfy ui and watch a few quick tutorials about it. Then learn about something called ""IP adapter"". Basically, it allows you to take an image and upload it to comfy UI to create images based on the likeness of the uploaded image.The models you use are open free to download from within the comfy UI GUI. Most people use stable diffusion, but if you have a really powerful GPUs like 4090/3090 you can use Flux. Or, if you're looking for something specific (stylistic artistic styles) you can check out civitai.com (huggingface for image generation). You can find a wide variety of LoRAs (sort of like really fine tuned mini models) for exactly what you're looking for. After typing this out, I would probably avoid going too deep down this rabbit hole if you only have 15 days. As for the video generation, I don't have a lot of experience with video generation models, but diffusion generative AI (video generation) is very similar to image generation as far as I know. So, I imagine there are models that exist that can operate with IP adapter etc. However, image generation is very computationally expensive and video generation just takes it to another level. If you don't have access to powerful GPUs, look into some of the virtual machine services. They are fairly cheap, maybe a couple dollars per hour or find a way to use a free Google Collab for compute. Then, just spool up python and create a gradio web UI for the user to do all of this connected through API. It sounds like a lot, and it kind of is, but you could definitely pull it off in 15 days.This is a weird way to do a hackathon, IMO. Mostly because they're giving you what they want the result to be.

If you really really are worried you can hash both client side and server side using two completely separate cryptographically secure hashing systems. However this doesn't add very much security - if a hacker compromises an individual's password they can still run the hash, or if they compromise the hash they can just send it directly as a dummy client. The only thing you're protecting is a potential client trust (e.g. what if they're storing the passwords in plaintext?).

Only time an admin gets to access serverside data is when a user is banned/suspended (because in this enviroment it means you either put the server's security at risk or repeatedly violated TOS/Server TOS) and the data is needed for the administrators (namely the owner of the server, for other purposes there is a separate security role called moderators, whom get lots less info for the exact reasons some of you pointed out) to debug what exactly did you break. My best guess was to save the password as the hash to prevent the server from knowing the exact password. \- I'm not in the US, so my laws aren't the same, but this was a big oversight in my part and I'd like to apologize for it.

Role Based Access Control is your friend here.

Like if you're working at a bank you might get information that Apple is executing an order to sell $1 billion of USD over the course of 3 days, or even non-public information about acquisitions and mergers. Not everyone has access to this information at the bank however, just the people working on the computer systems or on the deals. A person could potentially abuse this and frontrun their own trades or hand the information off to a relative. However IMO the stakes are too high to do this in nearly every case, and everyone that has access to this non-public information has a restriction on buying individual stocks, commodities contracts, or large amounts of any currency without explicit approval from compliance.I don't know about the realm of modern laws for social media, but I do know at one point in time there was a creepy Facebook employee that was using their position and access to data stalk a user. Since then Facebook has added additional restrictions on the amount of information granted to developers, and getting more information about someone specific had to be run through a compliance team to ensure it was for debugging/programming reasons.The one place where this material non-public information restriction does not exist, unfortunately, is for the US congress. They are given zero restrictions on stocks or products they can purchase or sell, and a huge ass 45 day window to report trades. It's concerning especially considering the amount of non-public information they deal with. Like if a congressperson knows that there is a huge deal in the works for a car manufacturer, they may buy the stock with no restriction, and only have to report the trade way after the deal has gone through and the stock has made significant gains.",Spare-Plum,2025-04-13 09:49:40,2,learnprogramming,t1_mmvcb8i,False,

What would you need to do in order to receive a full-time offer?IMO it's somewhat unprofessional/odd that you were not given that feedback: part of the job of a manager is to make sure every employee knows if they're meeting expectations/remove uncertainty about where they stand. But that's by-the-by -- I think the important thing here is to get direct info + directly ask for the feedback you're looking for.> I’ve been doing a programming internship at a big, globally known company for a year nowThe length of your internship is pretty unusual. Maybe this is a regional thing, but at least in my corner of the world (US west coast), most internships last ~3-4 months, typically during the student's summer break.In any case, I do think it's reasonable for you to be feeling burnt out. I don't think it's reasonable to expect you to juggle both schooling and work for this amount of time.> When I landed this internship, I had zero technical knowledge and was just starting my degree.I'm a little surprised by this, tbh -- somebody with zero technical background doesn't have the ability to contribute in a meaningful way in a programming role. It's an odd pick for an intern; usually you want somebody with partial experience so the intern mentor doesn't need to spend time covering the basics.Did the company know this when they hired you + ask you to go through some training program? Or was this more of a hybrid internship, where you applied some of your other skills in in addition to programming? What were their expectations?TBH my first instinct here was that the company did not set you up for success by hiring you at such an early stage in your career.> I made mistakes, of course,but no one really explained what I was doing wrong or how I could do better. Any internship program worth its salt should assign you a dedicated mentor. Do you have one? If not, can you ask your manager (or whoever is managing the internship program) to assign you one?> over time, I’ve started to feel like I’m being excluded. Nothing direct or obvious, but there are signs. I try to contribute, show interest, ask questions… but everything I do seems to go unnoticed. [...snip...] Despite being an intern, it often feels like we’re expected to deliver at the level of someone with years of experience.It's hard to tell what's happening here without more specifics.For example, maybe what's happening is that you rose to the occasion and people are treating as you as having roughly the same skill as a junior engineer -- and maybe they're leaving you alone since you seem to be doing fine and are not realizing you're actually struggling to keep up? Or alternatively, maybe they're disengaging because they need to focus on their own work now, or are burnt out themselves with teaching and mentoring? It's a bit hard to say.> Lately, I’ve been thinking that maybe I should try working at a smaller company—somewhere with a slower pace, less pressure, and where I might actually be able to learn and breathe.Usually an internship has a concrete end date; I'd try sticking it out until then. If yours does not, then I'm not quite sure what's going on tbh.Other things to try:- Quit to focus on your schoolwork. Find another internship next summer.- Add your current internship to your resume; use it to help you find an internship at a different but similarly well-regarded company.- Ask if you can transfer to a different team. Maybe the working culture will be different there?- Tell your manager that you're struggling to balance school and work and seeing if they can help adjust your workload.

Imagine you have a function that is called calcUserData ehich gets a user and does some processing. In this case you would only care about the processing part, as that is the main functionality of this function. Problen is now that this function calls the db to get the user data, and wr of course dont want to include that in the unit test as we ONLY want to test the function.This is were you use testing doubles as you mentioned, mocks, fakes and stubs. Mocks tell you if an interaction happened, for example you can check if the database function getUserData was actually called by calcUserData.Fakes are working implementations but simplified. Lets say that instead of mocking away the database, you want to use an in memory db, or you could even store values into a list if all you want is something to put in and retrieve data from.Stubs are when you want to pre-define a response. Imagine you have a function called isAdmin, which simply checks the db if the user is an admin or not, instead of actually calling the db we can simply stub it to return True or False. This is useful when you want to force an interaction. Imagine you want to test if you correctly throw an error to the user if they are not an admin, you can do that with stubbing.The mindset you need for unit testing is using these 3 tools to force yourself to ONLY test what a small piece of code does.

In regards to actually paying for a 1:1 mentor, I am open to the idea but this is coming from someone who is already employed and making pretty good money.

mmetyb2,"I've seen people offer to mentor/tutor for free, but what those people are willing to do and what the person wants from a tutor can be completely different.For example, a mentor might say ""Watch this video, and work on this exercise, and get back to me in a few days and show me your progress"". The student might want a custom lecture, want it recorded or transcribed, then be hand-held through solving the problems, and, one more thing, they have to be available when the student is available. I'm exaggerating, of course.When you see posters looking for help, they want someone to motivate them, figure out stuff when they get stuck, keep it interesting. Some students are given assignments, but then come back and said ""things got busy"" and they didn't have time to do what was being asked, so the mentor decides the student wants too much, but isn't serious about doing stuff on their own.One key is to level-set between mentor and student. The mentor should ask the student what they expect, i.e., how much time per week, what they expect the interaction to look like, etc. A potential mentor would express their expectations. Hopefully, they could find an agreement.From the student perspective, I'm sure they'd prefer free over paying, and they would be concerned, if they did pay, that the mentor was any good (presumably, they could quit if it wasn't working well).It's also a challenge to mentor well. A mentor needs to be aware of what the student needs and what they can provide. Some people over-explain going on and on with a concept not realizing the student has tuned out. They don't get the student to do some tasks during their meetings to keep things active.Intermediate programmers might fare better because they already know some programming. The student has to know what they want from a mentor and the mentor has to know what they want to offer.Look at the topics in this subreddit.

Its like drawing rectangles under a curve for the first 2 weeks of calc 1 ... if you got the concept 30 min into it, the next 2 weeks are blah blah.Take data structures: almost all modern languages have either these built into the language or libraries where they are done for you. It serves you no purpose to build a linked list out of pointers in C; first, its inefficient (page faults), second its error prone (pointers and inexperience don't mix), and thirdly as I said, its already there to be used in a library or language innate. What you need to know is when to use what data structures, and that isn't even well explained in the courses (they focus on reinventing them, not how to use them!). So go review a web site (not AI generated, find a human written one) on when to use what data structures.Big-O is just a jargon notation. Its like the math class on convergence of sequences (if you had that one?) where you examine the dominating term to see if it converges on infinity... except here we look for it to converge on an exponent. So bubble sort, where you go over the whole list of say numbers, find the smallest one, move it one location at a time until it gets to the top, repeat for the list except ignore the top item, then next time ignore the top 2 items... converges on N\*N amount of work being done to sort the data, which you can review online how to get there but its 2 nested loops effectively over N each, so its not too hard to see (this one). Proving an algorithm takes however many operations is helpful to know if its good at its job. The good news is that studying algorithms will include an explanation of how to do big-O & use it.Which leads me to algorithms. While a LOT of algorithms are included in languages and libraries, you still need to study them and to be able to solve your own problems using either the known common ones strung together or a totally new thing. I advise you to then do a quick overview of datastructures as I said above, and after that, do a pretty solid study of intro to algorithms and keep on digging into it as deep as you think is useful. I recommend not getting trapped/bogged down in graphs or graph theory unless you think you will be using that stuff (its pretty rare in most fields).after those, study object oriented programming if you have not gone deep into it. The last thing to do is design patterns, which require an in depth understanding of OOP & other basics or much of what these are doing will not make sense.avoid leet code. Its like tricky word problems in a math class more than practical programming. It can be fun, but in real life, no one will actively try to confuse you with the requirements and if they do, you can ask questions. Hit it up SOME, but don't ""grind"" it.

This way, it is closer to the function header, so everyone can see what kind of data is expected when looking at the header. Also, it reduces code complexity because. You will generally need less (nested) if conditions. In this case, the if-clauses are greatly simplified because you don't need to check for the lower bound.Secondly, you don't need else-if clauses. The return statement kind of has an implicit 'else'-effect. Everything after a return statement is unreachable code, so the program will only reach the next statement if it did not go through the return statement.Thirdly, this kind of code can probably expressed as a loop or even a one liner, because the if statements are very repetitive.

I almost think of it like holding a cylinder full of liquid on its side and tilting it to one side or the other. If the cylinder is flat, the liquid is evenly distributed, if it's tilted slightly it begins accumulating on one side, more with a greater angle. My thinking was that it was an 8 bit value being compared to give a finer granularity in determining the greater than or less than values.In practical application it's for a self-generating musical sequencer, like an algorithmic player piano, to determine the length of a musical step (analogous to how long a piano key is held down). If you turn the knob all the way to the left, the musical notes generated by the sequencer will only be one musical step long. If it's all the way to the right, it will only generate 8-step-long notes.

mmvkvp7,"I really admire that you're diving into HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Python at 54—your passion and diverse background are definite strengths. That said, I want to be as candid as possible:Freelancing in programming typically comes after years of experience in the industry. While there's no formal barrier to entry beyond setting up a profile on a freelancing platform, this low threshold means you're competing against a vast pool of skilled coders—many with years of experience, advanced degrees, and robust portfolios filled with positive client reviews. Back in the mid-2010s, there was a surplus of tech needs, and companies were more willing to take on individuals with bootcamp training or certifications in lieu of real experience because the talent pool was scarce. In today's market, the situation has reversed—tech is high-paying and attractive, leading to a surplus of highly experienced, often laid-off programmers. Most companies have their pick of talent, whether hiring full-time employees or freelancers, so they have little incentive to take a chance on entry-level coders or invest time and money into training someone without a proven track record. It's not impossible by any means, but it will take several people willing to ""give you a chance."" Until you build up those client experience reviews, finding freelance gigs will be especially challenging. It's the classic chicken-and-egg scenario: you need a job to gain experience, but you need experience to get the job.The alternative—landing an entry-level programmer role remotely—is almost completely out of the picture. Remote positions nowadays are typically reserved for those who already have a strong background because the market for remote roles is fiercely competitive. The COVID era, where remote work was the norm, is rapidly fading; everyone wants to work from home, but few get to. In many parts of the world, especially in regions like the U.S. (at least where I'm writing), remote experienced freelance or full-time programmers are still a thing—but entry-level remote roles are virtually non-existent. Even on-site roles face fierce competition. I'm not sure how things shake out in places like Albania or wider Europe, but the trend is similar: only highly experienced folks, often bolstered by a flood of laid-off talent, get those remote opportunities.On top of that, generative AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are changing the game. These tools can handle many of the routine tasks that junior developers used to do—completing boilerplate code and similar work much faster than a human. As a result, the real value in programming today isn't just about writing code; it's about leveraging it to solve complex, real-world problems. The true edge lies in depth and creativity, where your ability to draw on years of industry-specific experience can help you harness generative AI efficiently—something AI by itself can't do. This shift leaves even less room for entry-level programmers, as companies lean on the efficiency of AI and the expertise of veterans.My advice? Keep learning the basics and enjoy the process, but once you have a solid foundation, jump into advanced tools like Google Gemini Canvas. This isn't just about using fancy new software—it's a reality check that shows how far generative AI has come and how it can outperform entry-level folks on routine tasks. It also reminds you that real value comes from using code to solve meaningful problems, something that only someone with experience and creative problem-solving skills can do. In other words, don't just aim to be a freelance coder; consider positioning yourself as a consultant who can merge your decades of industry expertise with your growing tech skills to solve niche, real-world challenges.Bottom line: You haven't missed the boat yet, but today's boat is more like a high-speed ferry crammed with highly experienced, AI-enhanced pros. Your journey will be challenging, but by being realistic and strategic—focusing on niche projects, learning the basics, and quickly adopting advanced AI tools—you can carve out your own path in this highly competitive, ever-changing market.Good luck, and keep enjoying the learning process!",mintplantdaddy,2025-04-13 10:54:15,6,learnprogramming,t3_1jy3gap,False,

Don’t optimize unnecessarily. If a function doesn’t need to be fast, a simple, slow solution is fine. Each file in your project should be able to be read and understood by itself. Ideally no files should exceed 2000 lines and a competent developer should be able to read and understand the file within 1 hour.

Your code should be able to be read from top to bottom. A reader ideally should not have to jump around a file, or jump between multiple files for things to make sense. Use functions to eliminate/reduce similar code blocks. Inline most single use functions. Use single line functions sparingly. Reduce the amount of useless information that the reader has to see. Example: if a class’s field is the same 99% of the time, use a default value for the field in the __init__ function. If you pass that field in every time, you’ll waste space and you’ll make the more important set fields less visible. Use white space to separate code blocks. Too much white space can be a bad thing.

Do not take shortcuts (in the beginning). Actively compare your expectations with what you read. Does it really say what you expect/want it to say?Reading documentation is a very active and hard process. I constantly check what I read against my expectations. It shows more unknowns: some I move away for later (:thinking_face:), others I keep on a stack to be resolved while reading on.I have no idea what flutter does and just checked some API reference (https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/gestures/BaseTapGestureRecognizer-class.html). Here is my thought process in reading the docs:Before reading the first paragraph I assumed I know what a *gesture* is, and what a *tap* is.I soon recognised the *abstract* keyword, which told me to expect subclasses or even write subclasses to actually recognise a tap. I remembered to look for subclasses later.I read about a *arena*, and picture of fighting recognisers came to my mind. Maybe that is a model flutter used to decide which expected gesture best matches the recorded events my fingers do? Let’s look for more information.There is something like a GestureArenaManager. Ok.What then is described matches my expectations on a tap. I was surprised to read about a button. Can I only tap buttons? What if I have a canvas to paint on or something? For now imagine a button that I can drag or tap. I expect to recognisers to fight it out in the arena.The pointer concept in the next paragraph escaped me: maybe this down-1 down-2 refers to two fingers which touch? Is down-2 completely ignored? What is down-1 is on the button, but down-2 is not? :thinking_face:The next paragraph confirms that the class is abstract. *isPointerAllowed* does not make too much sense to me. The pointer concept is still weird. But the paragraph gives some indication how a gesture might be linked to a button: Subclassing has something to do with it.Aha: a ready made, therefore less variable, therefore easier to understand *TabGestureRecognicer* does exist. Maybe I will have a look at it to better understand the concepts. Also this answers one part of the questions I stacked earlier: which subclasses to exist. My interpretation of *abstract* and *Base* are confirmed. I do wonder: “tabs *of* the primary button”? I expected *on* the primary button! I thought of a button as a screen widget. Maybe it is something on a controller (remember: I still have no idea what flutter is)?I ignore ModalBarrier and inheritance for now.I move on to the constructor: Oh! What is a debugOwner? Must be a fancy flutter concept. Why do I set supportedDevices? What are devices? I need to learn more about flutter concepts. I need more context. Let’s read on, maybe I do not need to fully understand the constructor. I might back down to the simple TabGestureRecognizer.AllowedButtonsFilter refers back to scroll click. So Buttons are probably screen widgets and not controller elements. But why allow some and not others? Weird.Deadline: Ah that makes sense again: if it take too long to tap you loose and are out of the arena.DebugDescription is probably just a nice debug meta concepts. Like string conversion of Object in Java.DebugOwner is the recognizer’s owner. Weird: Is *ownership* just for debugging in flutter? Usually Ownership is an important concept to build hieraries and split responsibilities. :thinking_face:Going on …PrimaryPointer: the pointer this one is tracking: ok my assumptions about one or two pointers (Fingers?) with Down-1 and Down-2 from above might be correct: Down-2 is from another pointer that gets ignored.Team: what is that???Now lots of methods what check and set lots of more or less expected or unknown stuff. I stop again at *getKindOfPointer*. What might different kinds of pointers be? I expect (before I click and read on) fingers and mouse pointers. I check on *PointerDeviceKind*: Touch, Mouse, Stylus, etc. my expectation is met.I thought the handle… methods to be called so an action can take place like a callback, but instead they make the recognizer handle events to do its own thing. InvokeCallback: it especially mentions exceptions: is to *just* handle exceptions? :thinking_face:Ok more methods ….If I now like to know more, I would read on the subclass and look for some code which uses it.

mmha8tb,"`RPC` in `gRPC` stands for **Remote Procedure Call**. Essentially the idea behind it is to expose API as a set of arbitrary *functions* and let the API clients call those functions.The idea behind **REST** is to not expose functions per se, but to expose *resources* to let client directly manipulate them (read, make changes, make new ones, etc.). You can think of RPC functions as *verbs*. Meanwhile resources are *nouns*, and there's a limited set of verbs representing actions on those nouns. Specifically, the verbs are different HTTP request methods: GET, POST, DELETE, etc.**With REST APIs** you often can get the idea what you can or cannot do with it by looking at the available resources. Like, for an imaginary Reddit API you would see the resource `comment` and would assume that:`GET /api/comments?post_id=xyz`would give you all comments for a specific Reddit post.**With RPC** this can be something like `getCommentsForPost(xyz)`, and gRPC would convert it to a protobuf on the way to and from the server.Both approaches have **pros and cons**. REST became popular when many people started building APIs for web apps and mobile apps and used many different languages to make them. At the time the primary RPC technology was SOAP and XML-WebServices (essentially the same thing as gRPC except with XML and not protobuf), and not many languages had libraries for SOAP. With REST if your language could speak HTTP you were ready to use it.Even today, like you said gRPC is faster and theoretically should replace REST for everything, except that outside of about top 5 / top 10 most popular languages support for it is almost non-existent. Last time I worked with gRPC was about 5-6 years ago, and at the time there was no convenient way to make RPC calls from a web page, so the largest proportion of potential clients couldn't use it at all. I haven't looked at it since, to be honest.In practice, REST can be fast enough for many / most situations, so people keep using it because it's convenient.",andreicodes,2025-04-10 23:55:28,20,learnprogramming,t3_1jwc490,False,

In my experience it's also more fiddly to get working correctly and more difficult to test.If you're talking about gRPC for service-to-service communication, that's definitely on the rise because if it's set up properly it can be significantly more performant and secure.",ehr1c,2025-04-11 01:01:38,4,learnprogramming,t3_1jwc490,False,
mmhp5cs,"**TL;DR - gRPC takes a bit of extra work and solves problems that REST users may not have.**gRPC's performance advantages over REST come primarily in two flavors:1. Protocol buffers are more space + time efficient for message passing than JSON.2. gRPC is set up over HTTP 2, which means you can send many messages with less TCP/HTTP connection overhead (in a nutshell, many requests can share connections)Advantage #1 doesn't require gRPC, you *could* protocol buffer encode your messages and send around binary payloads if you wanted to. This advantage doesn't actually apply very much to strings or small integers, so jumping through the hoops of defining and distributing protocol buffer definition files isn't really worth the effort usually.As for advantage #2, this is actually something REST *can* have as well with HTTP 3, and depending on your network topology you can get the main benefits here without having to re-write any of your application code.gRPC is a godsend if you have internal services that are quite chatty with each other and are paying all the network/CPU bills for all of them, since the serialization cost and wire size is strictly better and sometimes better by a noticeable (double-digit percentage) margin. Protocol buffers are also quite nice because they allow you to generate message passing logic for multiple languages, meaning you don't have to write a lot of overhead to translate to/from JSON when your C++ data chugging service is talking to your NodeJS client-facing websocket server - but that only saves you effort if distributing/consuming that generated code is easy.",sessamekesh,2025-04-11 01:26:39,2,learnprogramming,t3_1jwc490,False,

mmi5jia,"IMO gRPC + protobuf is pretty nice, but it does require some up-front effort to set up and make seamless. For example:- To use protobuf you need a code generation step where you transform your proto files into the actual interfaces you implement + objects you use. It may not always be easy to integrate this into your build system in a seamless way, depending on your setup.- You'll also probably want to write some sort of wrapper to smooth out some of the tedium of launching your server and creating your clients.- Sharing protobuf definitions between different repos is a bit of a PITA, last I checked.These factors mean that:1. For smaller companies or projects, you'll probably see negligible overhead from using plain-old HTTP + JSON. So, it's often not worth the effort of setting up gRPC + protobuf: the speed boost isn't big enough to justify switching for many.2. Using gRPC + protobuf _can_ be worth it for larger companies. However, you'll most likely use it purely internally and continue using HTTP + JSON for your externally-facing API -- the browser support for gRPC is not quite there. If your API is something designed for others to use, you'll also have to take into account that most users of your public API will (statistically speaking) be smaller companies or hobbyists that cannot or do not want to use gRPC + protobuf. So if you want to maximize adoption, you'll have to stick with the least common denominator, which is HTTP + JSON.",michael0x2a,2025-04-11 03:12:15,1,learnprogramming,t3_1jwc490,False,

mmlgoqw,"I was lucky to use it at a later stage (late 2000s), and by that time most glaring problems with SOAP were generally ""solved"".All these WS-* standards were not pedantically defined, and in practice Java tools were doing whatever .NET tools were doing and vice versa. Both Microsoft, and Sun-Oracle and IBM were working really hard to make sure that the two sides of the ecosystem had seamless experience. But if you were ""outside"" of those two stacks you were in for subtle bugs.However, I worked on projects that were Java and .NET, and for us it was pretty awesome. When you needed to connect two services the two teams would sit down, design a WSDL file, and then our tools would generate both client and server code *and test stubs* so we could test (or run) the rest of the application without having the other service running. Both languages had top tier IDEs, so if, say you wanted to load patient appointments you'd fire up the autocomplete, and it would find types for requests and response messages, data validators, etc.If you find something missing you'd ring up the other team, you would agree to changes to WSDL, and then both teams would regenerate code and the IDE would instantly highlight all places where the code was broken. I worked on a medical project like this at some point, and the teams of dozens of developers (both Java and .NET) worked on individual services for months without actually running the full system ever (That was the time before CI was widespread). We finally had a demo scheduled, we connected the real endpoints, and you would think it all would brow up spectacularly. But no! The stuff actually worked! Our WSDLs had thousands of lines in them, and we had, like, 5 functions where things didn't work as expected (people passing wrong IDs or assuming different time zones, you know the drill.).So, all things considered, it was a pretty cool set of tech. The devil was in a details. Despite everything, XML was annoying to work with, the generated types may have fields with stupid names (`field1`, `field2`, or `meaningfulName0` or something). If you wanted to debug this code you'd have to send XMLs with a tool called SOAP UI (it's like Postman, but much worse and in Java). Messages had a lot of wrapper tags with XML namespaces in them and tons of unnecessary meta-info. Both Sun and Microsoft insisted that the best way to make some classes in your favorite language, and then let *them* generate WSDL, all the tutorials showed that, and not how to work with WSDL-first approach. So people who were excited about how simple it looked in the examples were in for a very rude awakening. All in all, it was a very strong tech on a ""strategic"" level, but day-to-day as a single engineer on one of those projects you didn't really enjoyed it, and I can easily see how people would say it was PITA! Especially, those who worked with it in its earlier years when half of things it promised didn't really work. I remember at the time I was not a fan of WS and SOAP at all, but over the years and looking back I started to appreciate it more.With gRPC Google took the main idea: have a protocol defined in a spec file (new WSDL), and use code gen for every language. They improved a lot of stuff: the new spec file format - proto - is much nicer, it works with a lot more languages, there's a lot less ceremony and special tools involved. But they also made a few decisions to make the whole thing annoying in its own way. Like, making it binary only which is bad for observability, require an exotic transport, having web browser support as an afterthought, etc. So, while objectively I liked my time with SOAP *somewhat* I'm not really rushing to try gRPC.Funny thing: SOAP was not the first either, before that we had CORBA and DCOM in the 90s and some proprietary stuff from Unix vendors in the 80s. And like every other thing in our profession RPC, too, was invented at Xerox.

They'll be hiring a replacement as soon as they can.Being *laid off* means the company is eliminating your position, probably alongside a ton of others, because either they literally can't afford you, or they're making some big, strategic decision about where they want to invest. And there's a better chance you get some kind of severance package.It's not as clean a difference as I'm painting -- sometimes companies use layoffs to get rid of people they wanted to fire anyway, and not everyone gets a good severance. But it's a difference that can matter to companies hiring, or to lawyers if it comes to it. Very few people ever got *fired* from Google.

I had nothing to lose so you can do that sometimes. 2nd interview - COO is involved.. Very open honest discussion, great discussion. Dude knew I achieved what I wanted in EHS, looking for an opportunity into business side (non-ehs), was bored, etc. He tells me I am overqualified and that I am better than Safety. While some may have gotten offended, I did not because I agree lol. Nothing against my EHS brothers/sisters.. I just have always been bored and found it not challenging enough (I am director level currently). He was just spot on with everything and we were just starting to converse.. At this point, my interviews are not your typical ""give me a time you had to use decision making in a high-stress situation"" but more conversational, management style, personality assessing, etc. At least in my experience the last 2 job changes. I get rejected, but while being rejected for role I interviewed for, they tell me there is another opportunity that they would love to discuss with me if still interested. I checked their website to see what jobs were listed, and it was only a handful and none of them would match any I would fill. I believe the COO I connected with is throwing me a lifeline for a career change. They know how much I currently make and that I would not take less (3 small kids, wife to support), but he must have seen or heard something that caused him to throw me a potential bone and transition into a new career.

Your manager has a very large role in your happiness and how horrible your deadlines are and your team will make it fun + help you... or they won't and you'll cry yourself to sleep because you can't figure anything out.

You could be in any career, in any field, in any position and still get laid off. This is just the way of the world.With your YoE, you should be getting messages from recruiters on LinkedIn and other platforms that can easily land you interviews. Try premium for a month, spruce up your LinkedIn and add all the common skills you see across the job descriptions you are interested in. Even if you don’t have the skills, read up on docs and just get a basic understanding so that you can speak to it during interviews. Add those skills to your LinkedIn and Resume, I guarantee your profile starts getting hits from recruiters. Talk to the ones who supply Job Descriptions you’d actually consider taking. This is genuine advice that worked for me. I found a position after about a month and a half with 7 YoE (NYC area) which is really the same as 5 in the grand scheme of things.I’m sick of hearing people cry that CS careers are over. There will literally always be a need for SWEs. If you think AI will replace us, then you clearly haven’t used AI very much yet.

Stop dick riding FAANG as well. FAANG is what made the market what it is because they over hired and over paid for people and set unrealistic expectations for what SWE careers should actually look like. They set a standard for unrealistic hiring practices that is not reflective of actual work we do on a daily basis. We’re grinding LC for months just to do a job where we do basic system design and basic logic. It’s absolutely ridiculous.Also, FAANG looks good on resumes, sure, but so does experience in any real job where you can back up that experience with technical knowledge. If someone is gonna hire you just because your resume says FAANG, then they’re an idiot and you probably shouldn’t work for them anyway.Lower your salary expectations a bit, you have to realize that you’re in competition with a ton of other people who were laid off and are all expecting to make more money than what they were making than when they were laid off.

Anyone can pick that stuff up, junior or senior, and it doesn't increase your value as an engineer on its own.Your value as an engineer comes from your ability to solve hard, impactful problems of increasing scope, complexity, and ambiguity. Scope has to do with how large a task is and how long it takes. Junior engineers work on small tasks that only take a few days or weeks. Senior engineers work on large multi-month deliverables.Complexity has to do with how tricky the actual task is. I work in video streaming. A junior engineer might work on something like ""fix this tiny bug in the encoding module."" A senior engineer might work on something like ""design and implement a scalable transcoding pipeline for use case.""Ambiguity has to do with how well-defined the task is. A junior engineer would work on something that's really obvious, clear, and requires very little clarification. A senior engineer might be given a vague problem statement like ""our video transcode pipeline is too slow. Go fix it."" or ""We need feature, figure it out."", and the onus is on them to dissect that request into actionable, concrete technical tasks for the team to work on.The more you focus on these three things, the better an engineer you become.Read [DropBox's technical career guide.](https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/ic1_software_engineer.html) It goes into even more detail than this, at all levels from junior to director.Note that *nothing* in the guide mentions *any* of the things in your post.

And being bored at work could easily make you feel kinda burned out, or lethargic, or like the spark is gone.I resonate with this a lot, because 3 years is about the point where I start getting bored on a team. The easiest way to cure this is to have a candid conversation with your manager, and see if they can either find you some different work, or transfer you onto a different team.Doing that usually reignites the spark for me. The longest I've lasted at one company is a little over 5 years, and the main reason I lasted that long was I switched teams after 3 years. Switching teams gave me a ton of new stuff to learn, it was in an entirely different tech stack, I had to learn all the business knowledge from scratch. It's fun, everything's new again. It's shoving you back into the ""honeymoon stage"".My new grad company was actually great with this. They *encouraged* internal moves at the 2 year mark for all employees.

The only reason I left them was because I wanted to live on the east coast, otherwise I could've stayed there for life. And some of my friends have, I think there's 5 or so people from my new grad cohort that are still at that company, 12 years later.So that's what I'd recommend. See if you can transfer internally, or get a completely new type of work. If you can't, start looking for a new job .See if that fixes things for you.

As always with the US, the social services are lacking compared to Europe, though if you get a high paying job with great benefits, that difference is mostly mitigated2. Education in the Boston area is excellent, rivaling the Nordic countries3. Public transit is acceptable but easily the worst out of the 3 cities you’re considering, bike infrastructure kind of sucks, but the city itself is supremely walkable4. Boston is not a late night city, restaurants and bars often close quite early compared to other similar cities5. Most of the neighborhoods in Boston feel meaningfully distinct from one another, it’s something I love about the city but you should definitely shop around for a neighborhood you like before deciding where to live6. Food is good, not great for a city of its size - beer scene is arguably the best in the country though7. Quick access to New York via Amtrak is awesome8. As you noted, Boston is probably the safest major American city and rivals many European cities9. No shade, and I’m obviously biased, but I really prefer New Englanders to other Americans and Northern Europeans. I feel New Englanders are the perfect mix of being pretty friendly and kind without being obnoxious or fake about it10. Speaking of which, New England itself is awesome. Great vacation or long weekend opportunities all over the place for all seasons11. Boston is easily the coldest and hottest/most humid of the cities you’re considering, but it also gets the most sunlight. I prefer Boston winters to Berlin winters even though Berlin doesn’t get as cold12. The rental and buying market in Boston sucks, but I’m not sure it’s better in the other cities you’re considering13. Boston is absolutely the most “European-feeling” of the major American cities, but it’s still definitely an American city at its core.",BradDaddyStevens,2025-04-12 13:26:09,8,cscareerquestions,t3_1jxf5cu,False,

Being your own boss is overrated. If you scale up, most businesses fail.>Should I start looking for big companies to work for, to build up reputation? Yes and don't leave. Or learn how to run a business, save up money and make industry contacts and try to start your own consulting firm. In the US, I'd recommend an MBA. You're not the freelancer doing the grunt work, you're the owner or account manager delegating to the grunts and freelancers. Be on the other side of the hustle.>Is it enough to continue building a portfolio with private freelance projectsDon't do that. Every job offer I sign the contract for has a clause that forbids outside work without approval. It's not enough money compared my salary broken down per hour anyway. Stick to work experience. Ask for more work if you want. Just me but I find after a fulltime software job, the last thing I want to do is go home and code more for a hobby or for pay.

mmwoix5,"MBA is a pretty fine entry point into the business side of things in which an effective product manager will dabble heavily. An MBA by itself is very unlikely to secure you a job as a product manager. Experience in the markets the business is targeting (healthcare, additive manufacturing, law, etc), the model by which the business operates (SaaS, PaaS, b2b, b2c, etc), and domain expertise over the product/market (peripherals, infrastructure, HRIS/ERP/EHR/etc), is king.> I was considering MBA but then I came across LinkedIn profiles of people who shifted to Prod roles of different companies without an MBA.Those people probably have heaps of experience in one or all of the areas I described above.To be clear, ""I worked for a SaaS vendor"" does not automatically mean you understand the full lifecycle of sales, support, adoption, and development of a SaaS product. Cranking out Jira issues is not the same as sitting in contract negotiations with a big client, producing estimates/SOWs, planning/executing a multi-month/year implementation across multiple functional groups (sales, support/training, development, etc), planning a launch to expand/capture a market segment, dealing with a pissed off customer because milestones are slipping, etc.My experience prior to moving into product management in my current org was in b2b sales/contracting of IaaS and managed services as an owner/operator. That's roughly the same model and domain I work in currently. I had practically no prior experience in my org's specific market segment but picked that knowledge up over ~2 years as a software engineer and ~3 as an engineering manager at my current org.Product management as a functional role should be pretty consistent among your F-100s and FAANGs. But it's going to vary wildly between practically any other company. Product management as a discipline is very much a YMMV thing.> Can someone guide? Are there any certifications or courses that companies consider in place of an MBA.[Pragmatic](https://www.pragmaticinstitute.com/), [PMI](https://www.pmi.org/), and [IIBA](https://www.iiba.org/) all have certification programs which bear some weight.

mmbf5dr,Start by just getting some certain and building stuff (personal projects and such). I think that you overestimate the knowledge you’ll gain in a masters degree. Most of those professors haven’t had a real job in 20 years (if ever) and a CS degree lacks the kind of applied knowledge that you need in the workforce. My advice is get a GCP or AWS account and use the free tier to start playing around with stuff.,josh75337,2025-04-10 01:36:13,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1jvmayv,False,
