The follow-up questions are especially important because that's where the complexity will come out.You'll need to back this up with good theory which can come from a few placesFor textbooks I really like T-SQL fundementals by Itzik Ben-Gan. It's focused on SQL Server, but it covers a lot of generic SQL, and it has a really good explanation of the core concepts. Things like three-value predicate logic make a lot more sense with his explanations. I generally recommend people at least read the first chapter. I think you can find a free PDF somewhere but I just bought it on amazon (almost exactly 10 years ago!)Websites like Leetcode CAN be good because of the ability to compare your answers to others, but it's important not to blindly trust that someone else's approach is better. If you see faster solutions, look up the techniques they are using and try to understand if it's actually an improvement or just or just a hack for that specific dataset.For performance, Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann provides a lot of the theoretical foundation you'll need to understand how to think about queries, you'll need to supplement this with resources specific to the database you are working in.

nczj0fq,"Gonna give a different perspective here. I’ve been around the block and have worked with quite a few job roles in my time. Data engineering is one of the most lucrative fields in IT. Data engineers are really really well paid. On the stress spectrum, it’s also on the lower end. It’s also one where a lot of self-teaching is still a valid pathway forward.There are other IT roles where the entire company is down and you’re stuck working days straight to fix it. Or security professionals, when the company is under attack 24 hours a day and everyone is looking at them to fix it and then blaming them for what happened.In your case, I would say much of the stress is coming from layoffs, and a management that does not really understand AI and what it’s used for. Bad leadership looks at AI as a way to reduce headcount. Good leadership looks at it as a productivity tool. It should be helping to get more work done and a more streamlined, quality product.Also, AI should not be replacing the templating and standards. That’s up to the lead to come up with and enforce.I do think AI is giving a lot of people some existential crisis issues. However, I think using it is going to be required for almost all roles. Personally, I treat just like any other tool, like a spreadsheet, or a calculator, or a web search. Not using it means I am gimping myself, so why would I fight it and try and use the old way? The AI can’t think for itself. That’s where humans come in and will never be replaced. Someone still still needs to understand everything at the higher level, figure out what needs to be done, and glue it all together.If it was me, I’d take a step back and take some breaths.

ncxxsbn,">the tech is no where near the point of replacing multiple tenured engineers, at least in our situation.AI is the ""zeitgeist"" of the times. Unfortunately we're currently living through a period of FAFO, where it's normal to tear down status quo, including gov't regulations for novelty because going viral is where the money is. The same thing happened with the blockchain craze, and the people who understood the tech were right to point out that all you need was immutable dbs to solve most of the use cases that were used to hype the trending tech. I feel the same as you do, but companies will need to learn the hard way, because the world of VCs have convinced companies large and small that the only way to be worth more or to enhance productivity is to jump to the next novel tech that is going viral - This works great for start ups attempting to pump up their valuations, but not so great for companies that are larger with processes and governance in place. This sort of behavior continues to degrade products, and Google is a great example of product degradation. Even Klarna restarted it's hiring because their jump in to AI that is still premature hurt their business operations. You're just early in the game to realize this, but the fact is the hype will keep at it until AI matures and is productionized properly, or the next trending tech starts attracting investor capital. It's all a game, but that does not mean that the pleasure you gained from building data pipelines no longer gives you satisfaction.

ncj6gat,"I worked 2 years with Airflow, then changed to a new company where I have integrated dagster into the tech stack.From a dev ops point of view, deploying dagster to k8s was a nightmare but once done, it works good.When it comes to developer experience, the DBT integration is brilliant. It simplifies a lot of the tediousness of using DBT with Airflow (v2.9). It is easy to generate your DBT assets and those can be linked with your other dagster assets.The main difference is the paradigm. Dagster does not have jobs/tasks at the forefront. Jobs are a process to group functional assets together i.e. you have 1 ingestion process and 3 DBT models to generate your analytics table and you can ran all of them at once, on schedule. Dagster uses data assets at the forefront, which are what the name suggests, your data as an asset. You do not think of the process of creating the data as you think of the final data product. I ike the lineage feature, which allows you to see how all your assets are interconnected. You can define a job with a schedule for any cut of your lineage graph.Dagster is also more pythonic than Airflow. You use python's best practices when writing your processes.Testing is much simpler with the integrated 'dagster dev' command which quickly spins up a local instance for you to test your pipelines. Can write a lot more about the difference but I am at work now :-D.To conclude, both are good tools (haven't tried Airflow v3+) but for different needs. Dagster is better for companies where data lineage is vital, whereas Airflow is better for automation of tasks. Data pipelines are good in both (however, in dagster it gets tedious to integrate a random pipeline with the rest of your asset lineage)",mind_pilgrim,2025-09-05 10:30:25,35,dataengineering,t3_1n912uv,False,

The typical path, and what you've identified, would be to work as an analyst or scientist to get exposure to these tools and technologies and then make the move afterwards.One emerging role that presents an excellent path to data engineering is analytics engineering.

ndh7xan,"Although there could be many if we go deep down documentation of both Airflow and Dagster but on top of my head in this context I would say they are 1. Dagster is asset-native; its primary abstraction is the data asset itself (a table, a model). You define the asset, and Dagster figures out the tasks needed to create it. Airflow is task-native; its primary abstraction is the task (a unit of work). You define the task, and can now declare what assets it produces. This makes Dagster's worldview intrinsically data-centric, while Airflow's is operationally-centric with data-awareness added on.2. In Dagster, lineage is automatic. When you define an asset that depends on another, the lineage is instantly captured in a unified graph. In Airflow, you must manually declare lineage by specifying inlets and outlets for each task or using the @asset decorator. This requires extra effort and is prone to being overlooked or misconfigured. 3. Dagster's integration understands your dbt project natively. It automatically ingest your dbt manifest and displays every model, source, and test as a first-class asset in its graph with no extra code. Airflow's integration orchestrates dbt runs. It excels at running the dbt run command as a task within a workflow, but the deep, model-level visibility and lineage is not inherent and requires more setup to achieve. Airflow will try to somehow catch up to Dagster by narrowing this gap, not just copying the exact way of doing things!",rtalpade,2025-09-10 16:59:32,9,dataengineering,t1_ndh4vmk,False,
ncqqeb7,"First off, I have to say I'm genuinely curious, how did you land a DE role without an IT background? That’s seriously impressive. Many folks on this sub will tell you that DE isn't an entry-level position, so you must have done something right to get your foot in the door.Regarding your question, it's smart to focus on the fundamentals. It’s easy to get lost in the sea of specific ""data engineering"" tools, but they all build on a few core IT concepts. My advice would be to focus on these areas for the next six months.1. The first thing I'd focus on is the programming basics. Since you're using Python, I would go deep on that. Don't just learn syntax, but really try to grasp the fundamentals so you can solve problems with it. Do a few mini-projects in pure Python to make the concepts stick. This will be your foundation for everything else.2. Next, you need to become very comfortable with SQL. It’s the language of data, and you'll be using it constantly. Understand what it is, get the basic syntax down, and then really practice with it. Microsoft has some great sample datasets like AdventureWorks that are perfect for learning things like joins and aggregations.3. While you're learning those, the third crucial piece is Git. It doesn't matter if your company uses GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket; the principles are the same. You absolutely need to understand the basic workflow of making a branch, committing your changes, and merging them. It's how all modern tech teams collaborate. As a bonus, look into what a simple CI/CD pipeline does, maybe with something like GitHub Actions.4. Finally, try to get a basic understanding of one cloud provider. It doesn’t matter which one—AWS, Azure, or GCP. I'd probably stick with AWS since it’s the most common right now. You don't need to be an expert, but learn the core concepts. Studying for one of the associate-level certifications is a great way to get a structured overview.If you can get a good handle on these things by your sixth month, you'll have the solid IT foundation you need for this role. Only then would I start worrying about the more advanced, specific DE concepts.

Pipelines and job scheduling: Learn about which service(s) are used to create data pipelines and schedule jobs and how they work.4. Version control: Learn about the codebase you're working in, what coding standards they have (rules for writing sql queries, DDL, DML, dags, etc....) and how to use github and your IDE (probably VScode).I would start by learning what's most relevant to your day to day work and then learn more about each area as you go.

But with Claude's help its really very nice.The key to getting good quality code out of Claude is not that different from getting good code out of people:- unit tests- automated linting- manually specify function type signatures where it matters- have Claude run the tests and the linter after every change, and then have it fix all the problems it finds.- actually read the resulting code, make sure it makes sense, and make Claude refactor where it gets messy.In the end it worked great, and the code was very readable. This was very exciting because using a conventional JSON parser in the conventional way was just not going to work at all.But it was a little slow. I told Claude to optimize for performance. It came up with about 10 recommendations. I told it to implement the top 6 that I thought would make a big difference.

ncvr5oh,"It's interesting feedback Whooster. There was an implementation Arrow2 which I found more ergonomic than Arrow-RS initially, which is now forked into Polars-Arrow and backs the Polars project in Rust. However, that merged work into Arrow-RS, and I hear the team invested time learning from the earlier mistakes.In both cases, without going too far down the rabbit hole - both implementations use a Rust concept dynamic dispatch, which makes typing in the IDE disappear, and Rust type downcasting to be required, which personally, I find awkward to use. This also blocks some automatic compiler optimisations that can automatically inline more aggressively for a faster build. The result is once you get up to a top level library like Polars, there are many layers of objects between the object you are working with and the actual data backing it. Once you are in Python, I found this really doesn't matter - it's like water into wine.However, in **Arrow-RS** (for numerical data) Rust looks like:1. **Raw allocation** (heap bytes)2. `Arc` (ref-counted ownership of allocation)3. `Buffer` (view over the bytes)4. `ArrayData` (ties buffers, length, datatype, nulls)5. `PrimitiveArray` (typed wrapper, implements `Array`)6. `ArrayRef = Arc` (trait object used in generic contexts)So, you constantly need to downcast from ArrayRef just to get typed data, even though you built all the layers.In **Minarrow**, you also have layers, but they are, in my opinion, more straightforward:1. **Vec64 / Buffer** \- Plays like a normal Rust vector. You can use it like one2. **Typed Buffers**: IntegerArray, FloatArray, etc.3. **NumericArray:** Enum, with accessors, e.g., 'myarr.i64()'4. **Array**: Enum, with accessors e.g., 'myarr.num().i64()'The result is they are composable - you opt-up to the level of abstraction you want and need, rather than being locked behind an opaque object. In Rust, this is particularly helpful, as when building libraries and functions, it means their signatures can be compatible with more use cases, but I'm digressing here.The point is that it was enough that I went and rebuilt my own implementation, as I need it for other projects and didn't like wrestling with the system as the underlying data foundation.

ncq0ytw,"This isn't a pharma problem. The OT/IT bridge is complicated. I used to do this at a utility. The first thing is to get the data out of OT so it can be used integrated with IT. Depending on the setup this can be done using OPC-UA for most SCADA systems. I've seen in Pharma before that most manufacturing has a gateway so you can pull off the gateway instead which aggregates several PLCs/machines to pull from a common point. Most of that data is pushed to a pub/sub like Kafka or some other MQ. The schema for each step in most manufacturing processes is based on how the cards are programmed on the PLC. Since message queuing systems can handle schema evolution, you can usually combine this with a schema registry so you can see the steps and versions. Now getting it into a structure built for OLAP is not the easiest. There might be controls engineers that already have a common data model for reporting on just the OT. This is needed to understand signals, etc. They might also have a digital twin which represents a virtual system so you can begin modeling yourself. There are decent articles discussing OT/IT convergence but there is no silver bullet ( https://iot-analytics.com/it-ot-convergence-27-themes-define-future-of-industrial-integration/). If the schema isn't defined anywhere, there are tools like Apache Flink that can use schema inference, however you are still going to need to figure out the model so you know what step stage relates to what schema and how keys (columns) are related to each other.

nct16p2,"Thanks for the excellent link.Patient_Magazine has a solid answer. It’s not just in pharma. OT is typically an underinvested and unappreciated area in technology and staffing. It’s like the opposite of sales lol.The software is often just a means to get the manufacturing equipment to work. The engineers in OT are more operational focused and have a different set of responsibilities. They are also very busy most of the time and want to get things working and keep them working. There is typically no laboratory setup where they can isolate data and services out for stuff like analytics.Also, manufacturing is usually a low margin business, so there’s not a lot of spare change there for new initiatives which take time to show value.Good news is, overall I have been seeing lots of push over the past 5 years for more integration of OT with IT, as the link you provided shows. I think this started in security as OT has been a vulnerable gateway into IT, since it’s not been hardened from a security standpoint. Example, there’s a ton of pressure to not touch anything for simple stuff like firewall or patches when the greater risk is perceived as bringing a production line down.Hopefully some of the success stories start getting more visibility over time and we can learn from examples of where value is created from integrating OT data where everyone can access it and use it to improve the company overall.One tip is see if there are any relationships built in your group with the OT group.

If setup/teardown of the resource only happens once per run, then maybe you get lucky and it stays available.Multiprocessing in the DuckDB steps will still be available because DuckDB itself will spin up processes.

Helped me start to compartmentalize and break things down into smaller parts instead of things as a single large thing (objects). Recognizing how two things that are alike can be uniquely different but share a lot of common traits and abilities (inheritance). And lastly the biggest impact, "" if then"" statements. Oh my god it reshaped basic logic for me and how I view people's actions/decisions/fallacies. It made me infinitely more forgiving and compassionate to strangers and their mistakes.

ncirtcb,"Programming languages are called ""languages"" kind of like an analogy to human languages, but it's not really a good analogy. With a human language, if you know it well, then you can really express ANY IDEA AT ALL with finesse and comprehensibility. But with programming languages it's not really that way at all. Although formally programming languages that are ""Turing complete"" can be used to express any program, in actual practice, some tasks/types of programs are definitely way easier in some languages than others. Programming languages are tools, more like a hammer and a saw. You need to know how to use both of those, based on what task you are going to do. Also there are many types of hammer, many times of saw, just like there are many flavors of some programming languages that resemble each other. When you're first learning, you should learn to use an easy-to-use one, a safe one, etc. Later on, you can learn to use more powerful tools, more specialized tools.It is the same in programming, except the tools change frequently and depend a lot on in what domain you are working.In Web development for example you're likely to use a lot of JavaScript. In other domains JS is making headway with Node.js but to me it's still not used as much. The other languages you mentioned (PHP, SQL) are that way as well. Most people don't consider HTML a programming language because you can't write a loop, there's no real control flow, etc. It is possible to ""modularize"" HTML though, so there's that. Nowadays though it seems like most people prefer to generate HTML rather than to code it by hand.Also SQL is a very specialized language used to query a database. For example, what would ""hello world"" look like in SQL? Can you make a command-line app in SQL? Maybe it's technically possible, but I would not want to maintain such code if you gave it to me.

And when a program runs in machine code, it becomes much, much simpler to understand how it calls other programs that are also in machine code. Calling another machine code program is as simple as asking the CPU to jump to the address of that program. Of course you need to know that address, but that's what the operating system helps with.But the programs (or the compilers that compiled them) still has to agree on a ""calling convention"", like how are arguments transferred to functions. They can for instance be stored in specific registers in the CPU, and then the return value is expected to be in a certain register. Or maybe a single register stores a pointer to the list of arguments, and then the function itself has to extract them from that memory location.Look into ""calling conventions"" if you want to learn more, and maybe take a look at [https://godbolt.org/](https://godbolt.org/) and analyze how a C program gets converted to machine code - but be warned, it isn't simple :)",peterlinddk,2025-09-07 10:19:14,6,learnprogramming,t3_1nape3q,False,

Most languages can read and write any file format, these days (that was less true 50 years ago.)If a running program written in one language invokes a function written in another language, the caller has to set up the stack frame in the way that's expected by the function being called. Different languages have different calling conventions.And when information is transferred over a network, that has its own problems.

ncwbpmc,"It depends on what you mean by ""talk to each other"". Let's look at your example. Are you assuming that for Python to open a file, it needs to talk to C? It doesn't need to do that. Whatever underlying mechanism C uses to open a file, Python has that feature too.Yes, it's possible to have a language that doesn't have any features to open a file which means you're stuck unless you want to figure how to do it which might require rewriting parts of the compiler (or interpreter) for the language.Someone pointed out that Python can make foreign function calls to C. Python's weakness is that it's interpreted. Compared to languages like C, this makes it slow. You would think this would make Python and unlikely choice for doing math (which is computationally intensive), but because Python has this foreign function call specifically to C, then you can implement these numerical calculations in C, but let it be called like a standard Python library.But it's because Python has that feature built in. It doesn't have (as far as I know) a foreign function interface to, say, Erlang or Java.In general, languages don't have the capability to talk to each other directly.Someone pointed out that there is the front end (the browser side) and a back end (the server side), and that this is a way that two languages communicate. This is done indirectly, at least, if you're talking about a web browser.A front end is going to send a HTTP request which is a protocol to send information to a server. The server responds with that protocol. This means whatever language that front end is written in (Javascript is most common) has to eventually send an HTTP request. The back end needs to decode that request and then run some code in whatever language (there are numerous backend languages) then translate that to a response back to the client end.Two languages interact through HTTP, a protocol both sides understand. It's a little like someone who speaks Mandarin talking to someone who speaks Hindi by both speaking in English.One reason this happens is the front and back end are on separate machines with separate memory, so this requires some connection, namely, the Internet, and some way to communicate across this connection (HTTP which runs on top of TCP/IP).With Python calling a C function through a foreign language interface, then you're running code in the same memory space together. Again, it's a bit uncommon.You could have two languages communicate via a socket, which can be done via the same file system or via the Internet. You could invent a protocol to do this, but it wouldn't involve one language making a direct call in the other language, unless that was built into the language itself.Beginners often think languages talking to one another is cool and that it happens all the time, but it's not the way most people think.",CodeTinkerer,2025-09-07 12:58:44,2,learnprogramming,t3_1nape3q,False,

You should be able to establish a connection between the two, enter data in the client, send the data to the server, read the data on the server, write it to standard output,send data back to the client, have the client read it the data and display it.Just 1 and 2 will improve you leaps and bounds.This will genuinely improve you more than you will ever know.

nddm2xf,"OOP is basically mandatory to write good Java and honestly can help you greatly.The example I like to give is you have to start thinking of your program as different pieces that work together to accomplish a goal. As a piece gets too complex to keep track of, you want to look at good ways to break down what it does. Java sometimes goes too far with this in my opinion but it's a sensible premise to start from.It's fairly similar to how function design should be done. A function should do ideally one thing very well that takes a relatively small number of lines of code (though it might end up doing a couple of things honestly). But in OOP, we want to consider what those functions are usually working with and put all the similar functions into a class.For example, classic ATM design. You could build a deposit(account_no, amount) and withdraw(account_no, amount) function and just tie your UI into them. But note that there are a few complicated bits these functions will need to share. Both will need to access and update the database table for your bank account for example. Both primarily work on your account.So instead of functions, we can build one Account class which takes an account_no as a parameter to the constructor (ie an Account object is representing a specific class in the database) and has methods deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount). Since the Account object knows it's account_no already, there's no need to pass it in again. Likewise, imagine we'll have our database with multiple tables that we will need to access. They all share common tasks though like running a Select or an Update query. As we build out our application, we don't want to keep all this logic in every other object we make. So the Database itself can become an object which knows how to talk to the database. Then the Account can build one or be given one to work with.The ultimate goal is that every object knows everything it needs to know to operate and other things have to tell it as little as possible. The Database object doesn't need to know how bank accounts work, and the Account object doesn't need to know how the database work. They just need to know how to use what's called the interface: the way we intend for the object to be used by other objects (these are declared public in Java). This is the principle of cohesive class design - all the similar things are in one class and one class only.The nice part of this is if you swap how the database works, say from MySQL to Oracle, then you just have to redesign your Database object. Your Account object doesnt change at all. This is the idea of loose coupling - your objects rely on the public interface declared, not the internal workings of it.The best way is just to practice. Build object oriented applications and try to keep them cohesive and loosely coupled. You'll get better with practice.",ottawadeveloper,2025-09-10 02:19:37,5,learnprogramming,t3_1ncowuo,False,

Check if the letter has already been used. Pick a word from a dictionary. Check if the letter is in the word etc... It took me far too long to learn that the assignment wasn't about a hangman game, it was a lesson showing how to split big problems in to small ones.

In fact, there are (at least) four different types of resources that people may use while programming and they all serve different purposes:1. Introductory material/tutorials: Separates information into buckets, reducing cognitive load (pre-selection and focus of attention)2. ""How to do X"" guides and other instructions: Complete ""recipes"" for how to do something you don't know how to do exactly, like algorithms that can be mixed and matched, or adapted to your actual needs3. References: No explanation, just to remember things that aren't in your memory (syntax, functions, conditions, ...)4. In-depth guides and explanations: Used to form connections and help you understand related details, to gradually expand your knowledge graphSome common issues I've seen are people focusing extensively on one specific type of resource, picking the wrong type for a given situation, trying to understand every detail instead of finding other resources to compare, or trying to do everything at once instead of just one individual step.The second big issue might be the complete lack of visualization. Humans are inherently visual creatures and our visual system is the most bandwidth-heavy of all, it's really fast and (within certain limits) excellent at relaying information to your brain that would be more difficult to get in the ol' noggin by any other means. You can draw stuff on paper, in apps like EcaliDraw, or use oldschool graphics programs like Paint. Diagrams like MermaidJS also work but are usually too much effort for everyday tasks. For some people, explaining ideas in language may be helpful. This takes more time and doesn't work unless you know roughly what you want to do, but it can be a great aid in clarifying your ideas. Even if you later delete the text, you can try explaining what you are doing and what you want to do as if someone was reading it later. Or find a real person/rubber duck and talk out loud instead.Finally, there is a difference between ""bottom-up"" and ""top-down"" learning. Many regular people seem to prefer the latter, where you start with a high-level idea go down further as needed. This has the benefit of reducing the cognitive load as you get to ignore all the low-level details, but this simplification can make true understanding much more difficult than necessary. It is commonly seen in math where the lecturer knows all the details and sometimes ""forgets"" to mention them or just glances over important topics, leaving students utterly confused. The reverse is also possible, and of course you can try to attack each problem from both angles. I suspect autistic people have an easier time with bottom-up approaches as the details are what allows them to really understand, while it may be overkill for someone else (but this is purely an anecdotal observation). You need to find your own preferred style and see what exactly makes it easiest for you to understand the actual problem, before you encode it into an executable program specification.Personally, I found that ""low IQ"" or working memory deficiencies etc. may manifest in that one can't as easily (or rapidly) step through each part of a given problem in their mind, or might make more errors while doing so. But that still doesn't prevent you from doing it on paper or using any other medium, and you might find that someone who seems ""stupid"" is actually quite adept at visualizing graphically in their head instead, or they're great at teaching the material to others and thereby learn it themselves, etc.I would assume that people with severe cognitive disabilities who are ""brainess"", as you put it, have neither the capacity nor motivation to ask for programming help on Reddit. So my best guess would be a mismatch in approach or missing skillsets, not a lack of general problem-solving ability. Abstract problem solving is more difficult than doing it in context; you could try reframing the problem so it represents specific instances.",BeardSprite,2025-09-06 09:04:32,2,learnprogramming,t3_1n99osr,False,

ndft1u4,"Professional programmer with 20y of experience here. So it really depends where you live and do you want to become a corporate dog or you're more of a loose cannon.Thing is in North America the most popular set of technologies are few things, in Europe are other things. No idea what they use in Asia and South America.Either case, first of all it's great to know more than one operating system. Knowing iOS or Windows is fine, but learning linux is a must. And you must be able to install your OS from scratch and do basic maintenance.Second - learn git. In the modern world nothing goes without git. The entire planet nowadays can't live without git. In rare cases they use other things, like TFS (Microsoft), but git is a must.Third - you said you know SQL - this is great. SQL is a must too. Choose a relational database and learn it. I would say choose MySQL (or MariaDB) or Postgres. You must be able to do basic queries, you must know in theory what are the normalization forms and you must be able to design a simple database.Next - you must know HTML, basic CSS and basic javascript. Which means to design some html form, being able to validate it with javascript before form submit.And here we come to a very sensitive point - you must know how to properly write a Word document and basic knowledge of Excel. Because if your'e a master programmer but your resume or CV looks like crap - it speaks bad of you.Finally - programming. It really really depends. There are several ways you could go.FRONT END DEVELOPER: Be a master of HTML, XML, JSON. Magician of CSS and commander of Javascript. And you must know working well with Photoshop or a similar program (like GIMP which is free).DATABASE DEVELOPER: Master of SQL. You must be able to effortlessly write 3rd Normalization form (at least) queries in your sleep. You must be able to optimize SQL queries for fun. You should know database administration to a degree.BACK-END DEVELOPER (ANY LEVEL): You must know what is Object Oriented Programming. You must know and use at least 3 Design Patterns (but be sure to read the book).BACK-END DEVELOPER LOOSE CANNON: Know PHP but know it real good. Last time I used PHP was in 2004, before I get my first professional development work. I was designing small websites. After that it evolved a lot. There is one framework called Laravel which from what I hear is very Popular. Be sure you know how to build web apps with it. This does not save you from learning HTML and basic Javascript with some CSS. And SQL is a must. Loose cannon level means working for you as a freelancer or working for a start-up. Nothing wrong with it. They give you great freedom of technological choice which lots of people love. Yes, PHP is not widely used nowadays but it's still used a lot. You could learn Perl instead, which is a super-strong language and I've built my career with it, but I won't recommend it. If you want to easily be able to get a job - learn Python. Python evolved a lot. I first learnt it and used it professionally in 2007 but in 2025 Python is a whole constellation of itself and I adore it. If you go the Python way - learn Django.BACK-END DEVELOPER CORPORATE DOG: You must be a master of either: C#, Java or Python. You must feel fluent in at least one of the popular cloud platforms: Azure, GCP or AWS. You must be able to write CI/CD pipelines. I have no experience in C#, so don't ask and last time used Java many years ago. For Python - Django and NumPy are a must here. You should be into AI/LLM and Machine Learning here.Coding editors: Yes, learn how to use VSCode, but also learn vim or neovim (or emacs).Side project: Learn how to make presentations in Power Point or a similar app.So geographically speaking - last years what they loved in North America seems spreading into Europe as well and vice versa. But choose a path you want to go and choose technologies accordingly.Last word and probably the most important: Winning a technical job interview nowadays is way harder. Make account on Leetcode or Hackerrank and start doing the exercises there. Which means - LEARN DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS!

Which at the time I had no idea what I was doing. Completely messed this handrail all up. Then my boss came back and said ""HA...You messed that up.....fix it...."" ao I did. And I did...and I didn't until I finally started figuring out what needed to happen. 4 years later I had my own welding business and was contracting out my old boss because I was too busy and needed an extra hand on jobs.This isnt welding but same concept applies. I'm still very green so definitely not a ""senior dev"" response. But learning without a conventional school before, I'll say this. You can only learn so much in a sandbox (meaning guided help and projects, not your own). You won't have motivation brcause they arent your own problems or things your solving. Now, if you code your own app and run into a problem, when YOU fix the problem YOU will remember how you did. And if you dont, you'll remember enough about it to know where to look. You will force yourself to start approaching things differently. You'll feel more accomplished, you'll learn more in the sense of ""real world skills"" vs book skills. Something I noticed learning to code and currently being self taught is you will run into a roadblock everyday. Some of them are big, some are small. I'm currently in one regarding github and git that I messed up so bad I cant even code right now until it gets sorted out (thank God for reddit help and kond people). Download vscode, get on here, ask questions, check youtubes, start doing it! Make a portfolio about your skills and experiences for future employers, make one solely for shortcuts with code (things you use a lot of need to have on hand but cant remember). Start building that base now so later when you're deeper and have a dev job you can look back and not only see how far you've come but also you have a huge set of cheats to look up. Better yet, create an app for said cheat sheet that categorizes your cheat codes! There are 3 projects right there that solve 3 problems for you that you can show employers. Biggest thing is focusing on what's important. Is learning react important? Yes. But dont force yourself to not ask for help on that. The more you work it the better and easier it'll get. Code? Force yourself to not throw in the towel when your stuck, thats important. Work it for 20 min or even more before you say ""alright, I'm gassed"". Make it a point to code every day and have atleast 1 meaningful push to github so your activity level stays up on there and dont miss a day. Focus on 1-2 languages and dont switch from them until you are comfortable enough to tell an employer ""I dont know all the answers but I know where to look and I can articulate what I need to happen."" In essence, I know I want my background to be red, purple and black and I want it to fade into eachother in a circular pattern. I may not remember it's specifically conicle-gradient (or whatever it is). But I know its a gradient and I know to look up gradients for colors and backgrounds.This is longer than I thought it would be. But keep going! Get react, vscode, node.js, get a github, and start coding. Its daunting at first but once you start it'll flow. Oh, and when you do get a win, whether it's fixing a problem, finishing a project etc. Dont stay there long. Accept the win, give yourself 5 minutes to freak out and jump around, but get back to the next win asap.

nco7170,"Fair warning, this is going to be very long.I prefer the Black Box Method to writing code. I think a lot of developers do this without really thinking about it. No matter what the program is, you should be able to break it down into some smaller steps, some important operations that need to happen for the program to work. The Black Box Method basically just involves creating placeholder functions for the more complicated operations, then coming back later to define the details of those functions. You start with the big picture, make sure it's behaving like you want, then work your way down to the finer details.For example, let's say you need to build a program that can read a bunch of names from an input file and update some data files using the information from that file. It's something I've had to do at my job quite a few times now. Immediately, what are the two big things we know it needs to do?1. Read the input file2. Update the relevant data filesSo you write whatever boilerplate you need to get going, then in your main() function, or wherever your program begins, you simply write two lines (I'm gonna be using Pythonic pseudocode from here on out): def main(): parse_input_file() update_data_files()And the key is that you don't have to define them just yet. I normally just have these placeholders display a message like ""Parsing input file..."" and ""Updating data files..."" to make things easy to debug. You can do a sanity check here and run your new program to make sure the messages are displaying in the correct order. This would be especially important to do if this is being integrated into a larger system. Make sure your program is actually running.Anyway, now you can start breaking down these functions individually. Let's focus on the input parsing. This is where we should start asking questions like, ""how do we know which file to read?"", ""what is the format of this input file?"", ""how should we store the data that we read?"". Immediately, we have some information to figure out and some decisions to make.For the first question, let's assume that we want to prompt the user for the filename (as opposed to passing it in as a parameter to the program, like using argv in Python). For the second, let's assume that the input file is a plain text file that stores each data entry on a new line, and each line contains a username, first name, last name, and email address, delimited by commas. This type of information should be provided to you by your professor/manager/client/lead developer/someone else. The third question is more of a personal preference, and this is where your knowledge of data structures becomes important. You should base it on what's efficient and easy to maintain, but there are often many correct approaches, so do whatever makes the most sense to you. Let's keep things simple and store the data in an array of tuples for now.So, thinking about this logically, in order to parse the input file, we need to:1. Prompt the user for a file (what should we do if it doesn't exist?)2. Read each line of that file, and for each line:a. Split the line using a comma as the delimeterb. Clean up the data (if necessary) and build a tuple with itc. Append that tuple to the arrayYour program might look something like this now: def parse_input_file(): parsed_data = [] input_file = prompt_input_file() if exists(input_file) for line in input_file.readlines(): data_tuple = build_tuple_from_line(line) if data_tuple: # make sure data exists parsed_data.append(data_tuple) return parsed_dataAnd now that we've decided to give this function a return value, we can go back and update the main function: def main(): parsed_data = parse_input_file() if parsed_data: # make sure data exists update_data_files(parsed_data)Note that we also defined two new placeholder functions. One of them is build_tuple_from_line() which takes as input the text from the line and outputs a tuple representing that data. If it fails to parse for whatever reason, we can return an empty tuple, and nothing will be added to the array. The other is prompt_input_file() which takes no inputs and outputs an object with a readlines() member. (There is also the exists() function, but I am assuming that one is imported.) Hopefully you have an idea now of how this might continue. You can start breaking down each function from here.No matter what you're doing, you can always break it down into smaller steps. Focus on the core features and start with the parts you understand best. Leave the more complicated parts as abstract functions until you're ready to get into the weeds. You might find along the way that you took an inefficient approach, but it's almost always better just to get something that works to begin with, then you can always go back and optimize later. Like I know the approach I just laid out is very inefficient with memory. If you know that will be a concern, then this would be the perfect time to make adjustments before things get too complicated.That got way longer than I anticipated, but hopefully it's somewhat helpful. I'm not an expert by any means, but I've seen some decent success as a programmer, and this is the approach that works best for me. Best of luck in your journey!

ncpc5fd,"At the beginning I often struggled with translating e.g. homework tasks into code. I then read a beginner programming book which has used C#. The programming language isn't important as the first two chapters were the most relevant for me. The first chapter talked about why you want to learn to program, what possible fields of work are there.The second one was about algorithmic thinking. In general most programming language are built on 3 concepts:\- Sequence (A sequence of actions that are executed in order of their appearance)\- Branching (Actions are executed based on certain conditions)\- Repetition (repeating an action until a condition is met. loops and recursion are different forms of repetition)Most lectures only present you the synthax of e.g. an if-statement or of a loop in a certain language. But they don't tell you when to use these parts of the language. In the book they were talking about looking for keywords in the text or the requirements.For example: If you see the word ""if"" in a text then it is a strong indicator for branching as ""if"" implies there are at least two options to handle. ""As long as"" might be an indicator for a loop. If there are many separate actions mentioned one after each other it is a strong indicator for a sequence of actions that you have to perform to reach a certain goal. For each of the actions you could write one single program instruction or a function to group multiple connected instructions in one place.In the book they give examples like opening a door where you execute an algorithm to achieve your goal. The sequence can't be changed as you can't enter the room without opening the door. In programming you have to think about which steps have to be performed first in order for your code to solve a problem.pressDoorHandle()openDoor()enterRoom()closeDoor()Of course this is easy when you get university homework as most of the time they try to tell you as accurate as possible what you should do. If talking to a client you actually have to find out what the requirements even are.Of course this is programming on a micro-level as we are dealing with the specific steps but you can apply this also on higher levels of abstractions when you describe how a user e.g. interacts with a system like a website when he e.g. creates an account, deletes a post.When programming I often use pen and paper or I write comments (pseudo-code) like this:\# For each pdf-document do:\# Open pdf-document\# Extract values with a regular expressions\# write them into table\# close documentAfter writing the pseudo-code I add the real code below the comments. This way I can focus on solving the problem without having to delve into the specifics of the programming language that I use (this is something you can google easily).There are more tips about thinking techniques for problem solving but I have to go do groceries now:)). Feel free to ask any questions. Good luck! EDIT: Book recommendation: Thinking like a programmer by Spraul it's a book on problem solving techniques. It uses C++ but this isn't important.

The school is checking if you’re a good fit for their system and looking for any red flags.The main things they look at are:* **How you handle adversity.** Do you shut down when you feel in over your head, or do you push through?* **Your learning curve.** You might not be able to write a function today, but can you make progress by next week? They’re measuring growth, not starting ability.* **Collaboration.** How well do you work with others, both giving and receiving help?* **Time commitment.** 12 hours a day is common, and if you can manage it, you should.It’s also important to remember that the piscine isn’t just the school testing you, it’s also **you testing their system**.

nd9iv4v,"Not really an answer to your question, and I dunno if this will help you, but I use a mental trick when I'm coding recursion (e.g. when traveling trees or linked lists or deeply nested markup language structures).I imagine that there are a bunch of people standing around, each of whom manages a single node in the nested structure. When the recursive method is called, each person has a list of information they are handed (the argument list), knowledge of the specific node's properties (its attributes, its list of children, maybe a link to its parent, whatever is there), and tasks to perform. That person knows NOTHING about the rest of the list, the other nodes, etc.Then I just imagine the person doing the task needed and then handing off information to the next node.Silly example: I have a tree structure with a node that has a name and links to its own children. Some unknown person needs a big long list of only the names that start with A or B appended to a list.So, as the person responsible for a single node, when it's my turn, I get the A&B name list that's already been started by whoever is above me and the node's properties in the argument list (or in my own object's properties if the recursive function is baked into the object and my own method was called). I check my own node's name and if it starts with A or B, I stick it on the list. Then, I ""hand off"" the list to each of my node's children so they can do the same (i.e. I call the method for the kids the same way my parent called it for me).Obviously this example is simple, but when I get something more complicated like aggregating values, interacting with both parent and children, using shared resources, reversing results, etc., this method helps me isolate my thinking to a single node.Hint: first build your code as if your node has a parent and at least two kids. Then re-run it in your head as if you're the top-level node and make sure you have what you need to hand off to the first kids. Then re-run it in your head as if you don't have any kids to make sure you return properly.",saffash,2025-09-09 13:48:47,5,learnprogramming,t3_1nchg60,False,

Then print the list of numbers afterwards. Then you can add operations inbetween numbers, this is more complex but teaches you how to separate a string using delimiters or whatever method you want to use. Add some functionality for operations, like add, subtract, etc. Just super basic stuff. Print out the answer and boom you have a calculator. This exercise will teach you the basics of how arrays, lists and stacks work, just experiment with different ways of storing numbers, from the common and basic, to the dumb and unique. Learn from failure, if your code doesnt work, it will tell you where, then you can try redo that part or try something else.

I was talking to a new engineer on our team and I realized the vocabulary I was using isn’t something a rookie would follow, but that whole time I had always thought and still feel that I’m the rookie. The best thing you can do to get better at coding or really anything is to seek out a group that is already doing it. So I always advise newcomers to seek out a friend or a group or network of other people also interested. I also recommend if possible to look for people who are already skilled that you can just bounce a conversation with. Then when you’re out of your depth as OP says, you’ll learn a ton in order to keep up conversation with these folks.From my experience the best engineers always seek out this out of their depth feeling. I used to have so much self doubt in college and in life until I figured out that anyone can do it if you put your mind to it. These things take time and programming has a high skill floor. You just have to trust yourself and have patience. Now I’m at a point in my career where I’m learning to “trust myself” that I do have those qualities.

This means minimal commenting, and certainly, not to the level of a beginner.Imagine you want to learn how to cook like a professional chef, but you're a total beginner. A really good chef might show how they make something, but then you ask, how do you know this, how do you know that? How did you cut that chicken? They want to get to the point when they make something, not teach you all the basics of cooking.Similarly, you want real-world code. That's difficult code. People aren't writing bubble sort by itself, something so self-contained and short that it can be explained. Also, when you ask an expert to explain something, unless they have experience teaching, they will skip over many detail that they assume you already know (but you may not). They may use a bunch of terminology that have no idea what they mean.This is the problem with one-way communication. How much should an expert assume you know? At some point, if they have to tell you why a nested loop works, then they are spending more time teaching you the basics of programming, and not talking about the project the build.They have videos of people coding, but then you watch them click this, type that, etc. They barely say anything so you get nothing from watching even though many beginners want to see a real coder code until they realize it's like watching a real chess player play chess. It can be incredibly difficult for a master chess player say why they make certain moves. They can tell you why some moves are dumb and they see things you don't, but unless you start to play and get in those situations, watching an expert doesn't help.To be fair, chess is a super extreme example, but at least you get the sense that even if you study for a year, you still couldn't figure out why a top chess player makes the move they do.In effect you're saying> I want real-world code, but something super simple that I can understand, then explain all the detail and the thinking behind it as if I were five years old.Most experts explaining their code wouldn't do it at that level, but even if they could, they'd invariably leave something out that you would want explained.

It's just the thing you do when setting up your tools, to make sure compiling works, to make sure you can run the program that you just built, to make sure you can see what output your program is generating, etc.I think the book The C Programming Language explains it best. It seems like the book is the origin of the practice but according to the writing, the tradition was around before that. At that time, the message was apparently ""hello, world"" and not ""Hello, world!"" (i.e. someone added the capitalization and the punctuation to the tradition along the way):> [Printing the words hello, world] is the big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output went. ...> Just how to run [the hello, world program] depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the program in a file whose name ends in "".c"", such as hello.c, then compile it ...And then it continues to show how to do it on UNIX (steps which still work today on modern Linux, BSD, etc.).""Create the program text somewhere"" may entail installing/learning to use a text editor in case you have not done so before. ""Compile it"" means you need a compiler and need to know how to use it. ""Load it and run it"" may mean you need to learn how to use your system's shell to run programs in case you don't know already. Or if you're using the GUI and double-clicking on it each time you want to run it, you may have to add in a ""press any key to continue . . ."" type of message to avoid that the terminal closes right after the program is done.Nowadays you may also have to configure/inform your virus scanner that the code you are generating is not dangerous. Well, ..., technically the code may be dangerous. But you need to convince certain dynamic scanners that you are generating code intentionally and not trying to do something nefarious.If you have an IDE a lot of this will be automated for you. Many IDEs today even automatically create a literal ""hello, world"" boilerplate for you when you create a new project. The idea is that you run that first to make sure it's working, then you change it to put in your ""real"" code and keep doing the same thing, to practice iterative development.",chaotic_thought,2025-09-11 10:10:14,3,learnprogramming,t3_1ne2188,False,

Do they know anything about TCP/IP or DNS? Can they use Git/GitHub? Do they really appreciate what TypeScript gives us versus plain JavaScript? Do they have any sense of what React is actually doing under the hood that would let them debug an application. Considering the time commitment you say you are willing to dedicate I don’t think it’s unreasonable to recommend you use some of that time to read something like **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** by Randal Bryant, there is a pdf of it as the top result from Google. The hallmark of a self taught person on any subject is that they never learned the “boring parts”. Musicians who don’t know their keys and scales, programmers who don’t know what a subnet mask is or their algorithms and data structures. Also, you probably aren’t going to be able to just be a “front end developer” without a degree. If you work at a place that is happy to just have you work on React code and know nothing of the backend or operations or anything else, I would be surprised. I think you should expect to have to have at least superficial full stack knowledge. You should be able to set up a simple monolithic CRUD backend that can make simple SQL requests to a database using one of the following:- Express (JavaScript)- Django or Flask (Python)- Spring (Java)- ASP.NET (C#)Without credentials you’ll have to work much harder at developing a portfolio and this is going to be easier if your sites can have at least some backend functionality.

Refine the steps until you have a clear, minute description of the solution to the problem.Ideally, your steps should be so detailed that they correspond 1:1 to code statements.Practice is what helps. Practice, practice, practice, and practice more.For your current problem: What does being a Palindrome mean? It means that a word read in both directions is the same, like *racecar* or *RADAR*.How could you detect this? By checking the original vs. the reversed word.How could you reverse a word? There are a couple ways, one of which is to loop over each character in a word and to push the current character into an array from the front.You could also just simply concatenate the letters with the current letter being added at the front of the reversed string.Last, you need to compare the original and reversed strings.What definitely is important as well is to *sanitize* the case, e.g. make everything uppercase or lowercase.",aqua_regis,2025-09-05 12:20:02,7,learnprogramming,t3_1n93d6s,False,

Just like how you wouldn't go to the gym and do an exercise just once before moving on to a different exercise, apply the same mindset to coding.Once you complete something, whether it's big or small, start from a *completely* blank slate (not a half-blank slate), and do it again. Then, do it again. Do it again in an hour, then a day, then next week.Each time, you may encounter different bugs that challenge you.

At what step in your process did you realize MADMAN was not a palindrome?Now can you write a general procedure for doing this? Luckily you have some test-cases already for palindromes and non-palindromes, so you can test your procedure and probably fix many bugs already.If you want to get really ""serious"" about testing, then you can even take a break and write a separate program (not required, of course), that generates long palindromes and long non palindromes, and can use that as input to ""stress test"" your final procedure. For such a problem this is probably overkill, but for building an ""industrial strength"" library or program where there are strict performance requirements this kind of thing is often done.In any case don't forget to test edge cases, for example is the empty string a palindrome? Maybe it's not defined anywhere, but as a programmer you have to handle that possibility appropriately, either by defining a safe default (e.g. """" IS or IS NOT a palindrome by arbitrary fiat) or else return an error, saying you need at least one character to determine palindromeness/palindromitivity.",chaotic_thought,2025-09-05 12:34:51,3,learnprogramming,t3_1n93d6s,False,

ncnd1cl,"This is a great example of a problem where you can just solve it in real life, CLOSELY observe what you did to solve the problem, and then just write those steps in code. Most beginner programming problems are like this, I mean really everything is like this.So like, the way you would check if “racecar” is a palindrome (it is) would basically be to look at the first letter and see if it matches the last letter. And then see if the 2nd letter matches the 2nd to last letter (and of course when I say “letter”… I guess I should be saying character, if it should be able to handle anything that is technically a palindrome I guess), and then check the 3rd letter matches the 3rd to last letter and so on.If EVERY comparison returns true, then the result is true (it is a palindrome). If the you ever get a false at any point, you immediately return false, because that proves it isn’t a palindrome.You could of course have to handle all the little details, and make sure invalid things never happen. So like you have to set up the loops correctly to not get any out of bounds error on the string you’re working with. And also you could notice things like how you only have to check half of the word, because you’re checking the first half against the back half. So setting a loop to go through the entire word would needlessly double check everything. But you have to make sure not to mess up and only check just under half the word, so you should do half the word plus one character (just to be safe).Etc. But yea the part you need to practice the most is the first part. Figuring out how to actually solve the problem (forgetting about programming completely. Like literally just figure out how to determine if a word is a palindrome by yourself, or whatever the problem is), this is generally the hardest part. And then figuring out how to translate this solution into code (this is generally the easiest part). And then you have to deal with making sure you’ve handled all the edge cases and whatnot correctly (probably 2nd hardest part).",monster2018,2025-09-06 00:00:31,1,learnprogramming,t3_1n93d6s,False,

There are a couple of ways. You could reverse the string, you could compare the first letter to the last, etc. let's reverse the string.4. Now we have the original word and a reversed version of the string. Compare them. Is one the same as the other? 5. Return true or false depending on 4. It really isn't any harder than that.

ncpmkwz,"Breaking down problems into smaller sub-problems has already been mentioned. Another ingredient is trying to make sure you understand the data. All programs operate on information that exists in some form of storage, which the program instructions manipulate (read, write, modify, compare, ...) to implement solutions to the problem you're trying to solve.Therefore, understanding the data means you will understand the problem. That's a requirement to implement any solution. The actual programming work is almost irrelevant in the sense that you might as well do it on paper, or on a blackboard/whiteboard, etc. Only the implementation is language-dependent, but the problem itself isn't usually - unless it's an artificial problem introduced by limitations of the system, programming environment, libraries, tools, etc.Using your palindrome example: What is the actual problem? Well, what is the data? Presumably, you're given a string of text. You assume it has some known encoding, probably ASCII (or Unicode), so that there is a specific number for each letter/code point. There's also the notion of a position because the words ABC and CBA are not identical. A position is just another number that represents where in the word the letter (represented by the first number) actually should appear.OK, so what is a palindrome? Well, it's a word (sequence of numbers + position) that just so happens to not change if you swap two letters that have the same ""distance"" from the beginning and end. But if positions are numbers and distances are required, can't you just use the absolute position for each letter (from *both* sides) and check that it's the same, for every letter? Sure, that is probably one solution - though it may not be what you need, or too difficult to do in a given programming language. Another approach is to just swap the entire word, and check that both versions are the same. This is simpler to understand but arguably less efficient.You may have special cases, where the word has an odd number of letters. What now? Well, one basic way is to add conditionals, like ""if it's odd, do this. If even, do that"". Often it pays to think harder and realize, in this case, that it makes no difference - the same algorithm ""just works"" and so you need not complicate your solution. If the problem is too difficult, remove special cases. In code, you can write `assert` or similar or even just a `TODO` comment, then revisit that part later.A solution is different from its implementation in code. If you can't solve the problem that's an entirely different issue than not being able to implement the solution (""write the code""), or writing complicated/slow/insecure/incorrect code, for that matter.

You are going to see books called things like:“Learning C++”, “The Python Book”, “Definitive JavaScript”. These are **not** books teaching you how to program. These are books for people who can already program, teaching you that specific language. *The Rust Programming Language* is a book like this. You want to find something like “Learning to Program with Python”, “Beginning Programming with JavaScript”. To my knowledge nobody has written a book like that that uses Rust. And I can understand why. Rust has a lot of difficult concept which are unique to it, meaning that if you want to teach generalizable programming skills to a new programmer, it’s a poor choice. Rust is also a language designed for building low level systems, which will generally require programmers to have fairly advanced general computer knowledge, and while you *can* use Rust for anything, it’s bread and butter isn’t short scripting tasks like you’d usually try to teach somebody first learning to program. All this isn’t to say you should give up. Rust is a great programming language, and I have a lot of love for it. But I will say you are probably making things harder for you than they need to be by starting with it as your first language, mostly because of the lack of educational material for you. I would strongly recommend trying to learn something which has more accessible introduction material, and then come back to Rust after a few months. You’ll find it’s much much easier. I would maybe recommend trying C. You don’t seem shy about a challenge, and it has a ton of material aimed at new beginners, and also when you return to programming in Rust you’ll have a completely new appreciation for why Rust is weird in the way it is, being as those are mostly ways to avoid pitfalls you can fall into while coding in C and C++.Edit: reading some of the other replies and I’ll also say the people who recommend you start with Rust over C originally either don’t know there are no good beginning programming with Rust material or are people who forget how difficult learning to code is from scratch.",jfinch3,2025-09-10 21:08:07,2,learnprogramming,t3_1n9k5j6,False,

nd5ri9t,"I suggest looking at the [StackOverflow technology survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2025/technology) \- it has a lot of really interesting nuance.Rust is an interesting one - generally speaking it's *just so dang nice* to use, and it comes with some wonderfully modern features that are delightful. Pattern matching *alone* makes me miss it when I use other languages. Interestingly, it's the most ""admired"" but only the 6th most ""desired"" language.As nice as it is, it suffers from limited practicality - I rarely use it outside of toy projects at home, because practical software engineering leverages ecosystems and the Rust ecosystem is still immature. It can interop well enough, but in my experience doing interop with C/C++ and JavaScript (via WebAssembly) maintaining the interop boundary is more painful than just ditching the language entirely for the project.Python is an ""easy"" language to learn - you cover the important programming fundamentals of control flow and abstraction without having to muck around with compiler toolchains, type systems, static guards, etc..., which is awesome. Those are all important things to learn but pretty overwhelming up front.JS has two pretty massive advantages that make it popular in application development, both which come with its ties to web technology: (1) it works on *every single dang device*, and the installation process for web apps is ""click link, load page"" which is delightfully low-friction for devs and users, and (2) it comes with HTML+CSS, which are *incredible* tools for writing UIs.",sessamekesh,2025-09-08 21:51:17,11,learnprogramming,t3_1nbz7rd,False,

nd61e4q,"**JavaScipt** is most used because it is the built in language of the browser, meaning every website more or less has to use JavaScript. Websites make up a huge portion of what people do with computers so that alone gives it a major place. Asides for that you can use JavaScript as a server side language, and because of its role in frontend web dev people have increasingly used it to make the backend of websites also so they can do it all in one language. **Python** is the most commonly used language while dealing with AI, so it’s so surprised to me that with the AI boom of the last few years it’s being treated like that. It’s also an attractive language to new programmers because of its simple and clean syntax, and it’s long been used by data analysts for its ecosystem of data tools. **Rust** is well loved by its fans (myself included) because it has a lot of unique features which are really elegant once you learn to use them. If you’ve never used a language which treats errors as values using Rust’s Result type feels like a whole new way of thinking about effects in programming. Pattern matching on Enums feels so much more elegant than using a switch statement. For me at least it contains so many tools you can use to ensure that “invalid states are unrepresentable” at the type level, which feels so powerful and means that when you code actually compiles it does exactly what you want far more often than in other languages. It’s also just very cool to see a program you write in Rust run 50-100x faster than the same program in Python. Writing Rust can be painful, and it’s often very slow going, because actually getting it to compile is difficult. Rust is the perfect language for places where you need to be really confident in the correctness of your code and also have very high performance, but not if building things with any speed is the priority.

Our abstractions steadily climb higher and higher, moving further and further from the ""world just as it is"" with it's particles and whatnot.In programming we talk machine code, binary patterns, on the lowest level, but again we ignore the details and use higher level languages, where creating a variable hides everything that really goes on.

You're limited to the actual resources. But you can hide that from the user so they think they have an unlimited number of variables. Behind the scenes, the implementation moves the data between registers and memory giving you the illusion of unlimited variables.Higher levels of abstraction let you think far away from the actual implementation, usually in a mathematical sort of way, and hide the grungy details.

You know it is enough but not how many. But now you know ***through repeating the same thing over and over*** that it is about 32 teeth.

ndokgkw,"You don't call `wait` to provide thread-safety. You call `wait` because you want to wait for something, and you want to do so in a thread-safe way.For instance, suppose you're implementing something like `ArrayBlockingQueue`. If someone calls `take()` when the queue is empty, you want to block until it's non-empty and there's something to return. Therefore, the implementation of `take()` might need to call `wait()` on some underlying synchronization object. And conversely, the `put()` method calls `notify()` to wake up any thread that was waiting for the queue to become non-empty.The reason `wait()` interacts with the same ""monitor"" that the `synchronized` keyword operates on is so that you can do this in a thread-safe way. For instance, suppose you do something like: while (internalQueue.size() == 0) { wait(); }If you do this *without* holding a monitor that protects the queue state, then it's possible that after you check the queue size, but before you call `wait()`, somebody else will add something to the queue and raise a notification. But you've already made the decision to wait, and you missed the notification. So if a second object is never added to the queue, you might end up waiting forever, even though the queue contains an object. This can cause deadlocks.On the other hand, if you hold the monitor the entire time you're waiting, then you prevent any other thread from adding anything to the queue. This also causes a deadlock.The solution is for `wait()` to **atomically** release the monitor at the same time it suspends the current thread and adds it to the ""waiting"" list. And then when the thread wakes up again, it re-acquires the monitor. If you read the javadoc, that's exactly what `wait()` does, and this is why it does it.----If you didn't have `wait()` and `notify()`, you would have to implement a blocking method with a spin-loop or polling, along the lines of: while (true) { synchronized (obj) { if (internalQueue.size() > 0) { // do stuff return; } } Thread.sleep(T); // sleep without holding the monitor so other threads can access the queue }But no matter what you do, this will perform poorly. If you set T to a small value (or zero) it will waste CPU repeatedly checking the queue when nothing has changed. If you set T to a large value, you will add a lot of latency and cause the CPU to unnecessarily sit idle.",teraflop,2025-09-11 18:44:56,8,learnprogramming,t3_1negha9,False,

ncwx6qp,"Most of the other answers in this thread are wrong.Some people are saying that the addresses are different because forking creates a new address space. That doesn't explain the output because the new address space has new *physical* memory mappings for the same *virtual* address space, and the address you're printing is a virtual address. Userspace programs can't (easily) see physical addresses at all; they only see virtual addresses.Some people are saying this is due to address space randomization. That's wrong because ASLR doesn't change any of the virtual addresses in a forked process. (Doing that would require also updating every existing pointer to point to a different location, which would be super complicated.) The behavior shown in this example will be the same regardless of whether ASLR is on or off.The answer is really simple: **the variables have different addresses because they're different variables**, even though they have the same name. They are defined in different scopes and their lifetimes don't overlap.Your code is exactly the same as if you had defined `a` and `b` in the ""if"" branch, and `c` and `d` in the ""else"" branch. In that case it wouldn't be surprising at all that `a` and `c` have different addresses.More precisely, the variables are *allowed* to have different addresses. The C language compiler and the C language standard make no promises about the actual addresses that are used for different variables. (If you never use the `&` operator to look at a variable's address, it might never have an address at all -- it might be stored entirely in registers.) The actual results you get can depend on things like your compiler's optimization settings.If you change your example to take the address of the *same* variable on both sides of a fork, you'll see that the memory addresses are identical: https://godbolt.org/z/xPvWanz1dBut even though the virtual addresses are the same, the fork causes them to point to different physical mappings. So changes in the parent won't affect the child, or vice versa. (It's slightly more tricky to make an example that demonstrates this, because it requires synchronizing the two processes so that one process tries to read memory *after* the other one writes it.)",teraflop,2025-09-07 14:56:03,3,learnprogramming,t3_1naopyy,False,

It makes a new process with the same memory, then returns the result of that process.Edit: they are referencing the same stack, but it has to make a new reference to the head of the stack for the child.

Nevertheless, even if you were using InterProcess (IPC) shared memory, where the underlying physical memory would be the same for both processes, they would still have different virtual addresses, since in general mmap won't map to the same virtual addresses the underlying physical memory region on both processes (unless explicitly requested to mmap to the same specific virtual addresses on both processes).",9larutanatural9,2025-09-07 09:40:20,1,learnprogramming,t3_1naopyy,False,

It is free, asynchronous, and you get to practice Python by solving problem sets at your own pace. The class is run by Harvard(no need to apply) with a great professor and its basically the online version of the actual class. Its beginner friendly and I highly recommend this if you want to learn more about Python. I did this course before going to college and felt it aligned well with what I learned in my Python class(make sense since CS50 is also a college level class).2. Harvard has other course under ""CS50"" like one for AI, web dev, cyber security, etc that you can do after you get more familiar with coding. These are also free and you can check them out here: [https://www.edx.org/bio/david-j-malan](https://www.edx.org/bio/david-j-malan)3. You also say your like web dev so I definitely suggest checking out [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)(also free). This one more self learning you need to read about each topic on your own, but the content is curated(I am doing this and like the resources they provide so far). As for content the course goes over HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and in the advanced course more web dev tools like node.js or ruby(there are 2 advanced courses, choose a path you like).4. You can stick with the FreeCodeCamp course as well, that is a good course and you should keep doing it. As you said ""like it better as there is more involvement and actual coding"" this is great that you get to do more hands on stuff.5. W3 schools is alright, you are definitely right to think the problem is you are just reading but are not applying any of the things you learn.

They test problem solving skills as well which never hurts.# The Odin Project:This has excellent projects and to clarify The Odin Project is for front end and back end. It has an introduction course teaching HTML, CSS, and Java Script. Then you can choose to learn ruby or node.js or both and these advanced course are at least 5-8x longer than the introduction course so plenty to learn.The structure is:* You basically read a few curated lessons and external resources* Make a project which is a website such as: * Basic HTML page * Landing page with styling * Making web page games or interactive pages after learning Java Script * Even more advanced pages after learning more tools* This cycle of reading and making projects repeats itself. They have a discord to help you if you get stuck, but the course is pretty detailed/clear. Essentially there are many chances to make projects and if you feel comfortable you can make your own outside of the course.This is heavily project based as you are given a general goal when you reach a project assignment. Other than that you just make your own website following the general theme or requirements. This is also self graded but with web dev its pretty easy to see how well you did by viewing your website based on content, design, and functionality. You also get to learn about version control through Git and Git Hub. This is great since now you projects will be on a repository that you can make public or private as you wish. Furthermore you can actually see your website live and deploy it.

ndcvnug,"Economist here. Lots of misconception about things like full employment and your nubers are wrong.Unemployment rate which is people who are actively looing for work and do not have any work is the sum of three different kinds of unemployment: frictional, structural and cyclical. These can each be defined as follows:* Frictional - labor market entry unemployment. This is essentially people like new grads, career break people, voluntary job quitters re-entering the workforce.* Structural - People who lost jobs due to structura changes specific sectors i.e. AI wiping out whole job categories is a form of structural unemployment.* Cyclical - Unemployment due to movemetns in the business cycles (recessions/expansions) this is the one part of unemployment rate that can be negative.Natural Rate of Unemployment a.k.a. non-cyclical unemployment a.k.a. full employment level of unemployment a.k.a Non-Accelerating Inflation level of Unemployment rate is when you have zero cyclical unemployment. That is Natural Rate = Structural + Frictional Unemployment. The government estimates this number its been trending down over time:[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU)This number has been tredning downwards since the 1970s nd right now its around 4.3 percent. This suggests we are rigth at full employment and any higher we are going to have a positive cyclical unemployment rate.From 2021 through 2023 we essentially had unemployment rate lower than the NAIRU meaning we had negative cyclical unemployment rate. That number has been gradually climbing towards the NAIRU through 2024 and if it keep growing we will have positive cylical unemployment (meaning unemployment because the economy isn't doing well).[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)Now why is this Sub-reddit going to feel worse.1. Its clear something is happening with frictional unemployment rate. New College grades are having a harder time finding a job compared to anytime other than a out right recession. Some of it might be AI effecting entry level jobs etc. AI might make it harder to screen legitimate candidates. It might mean less entry level demand etc. This is not the same thing as cylical unemployment because the assumption is that this is some kind of shift in full employment rate that is unlikely to go away if the economy is doing well.2. There is some degree of structural unemployment in tech. Tech overhired inthe pandemic. Take google: [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/number-of-employees](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/number-of-employees) They increased head count by 60 percent after the pandemic. They have now laid off about 10000 workers, but they still ahve 50 percent more workers than they did in 2019. Job posting rate on indeed indicates other companies did the same. Notice there were over 2 times more listings in the end of 2021 as there was before pandemic. Now in 2025 its about 60 percent of the pre-pandemic level.[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)3. For young workers the job market feels worse, because people who graduated in 2024 or 2025, missed what was probably the best job market for all workers in decades, especially for tech. The last time the job market was this good for workers was probably in the 1990s. This means the people graduating now unfortunately are entering a world where the job market is getting worse and watched the people that graduate 1 to 2 years ahead of them enter the best job markets ever.Anyway I do think we are entering a recession. But the problem with recessions is that we don't officially know we are in a recession until after we are alrady in one. It tkaes at least 6 months of negative GDP growth for the NBER to decide if we are in a recession. That means given the current environment the earliest NBER would declare recession is the beginning of April of 2026. Just for all you Gen Z kids, an economy exiting an actual recession doesn't mean the job market will get better. The 2008 recession ended by end of 2009, the unemployment kept rising for another year and took 6 years for the job market to get to the pre-recession levels. Meaning if you graduated college in 2009, you didn't see a job market better than before the recession until 2016. I can't predict if the next recession will be as severe as 2008 (hopefully not), but buckle up kids.",Snoo-18544,2025-09-09 23:45:50,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1ncx98l,False,

I don't think it's in your best interest to sit around and tell you that you're doing fine and that you're not struggling when you clearly are, so I won't. Chances are, you're part of the problem too. \> I have been working in the same feature for at least 10 months now.This is not good, if I'm being honest. Even in the worst places I've worked I've seldom actually seen a single feature take that long to finish without reasonable blockers. If the issue is genuinely ""I don't know how to do this"" then you and management both have issues. No one typically just lets a feature story just creep for 10 months without bringing it up to either backlog it or give it to someone more capable. Not saying it never happens, it's just incredibly rare that it would go for so long without anyone checking. Especially if you work somewhere remotely credible or a start-up. \> The last thing that happened that pushed me to the edge is that the manager asked a Senior to help me out with this feature and he just started asking a bunch of questions of the technical decisions I made and was ultimately confused and suggested we change a lot of stuff to make things right, basically saying that the last 9 months of work was poorly done by me.This speaks to me that people are tired with your work and that you are not prioritizing your learning and improvement at all. You're telling me that you didn't update anyone on your work for 9 straight months? You didn't communicate with a single person on your team to get feedback on a PR or something? This sounds really unbelievable and I really doubt this story as being true. Whatever though, assuming it is true; I understand people are going to tell you that it's management's job or your senior's job or someone else's job to teach you and make sure that you're doing well but it's really a two way street.

You're far beyond the point of being some baby junior who doesn't know how to get the job done, or at least you should be. It's part of your job to make sure you're improving and actually getting better.

As others have said, you're just starting mid to senior engineering roles, that's a lot more responsibility and requires a different mindset. Are there some things you could be doing better? Yeah, probably. But honestly, from what you've described, this seems like a systematic communication issue between the team. How large are the sprints? How large are the features that you're working on? Do they encourage you to talk to other teammates to get advice? Do they encourage you to find optimal solutions before implementing them? Or do they just want you to shit out a feature as quickly as possible before the Sprint ends? I went through something similar because I don't have a degree and every few months the imposter syndrome would hit me hard. But then I would reflect on my work, what I've contributed, what I've done poorly and what I've done well.

Hang in there.EDIT: Also, I would like to add, no developer should be working on one feature for 10 months.

He usually asks why I did things a certain way, and why I didn’t go down a different route. This either ends up with him agreeing it was a sensible decision, or suggesting looking into alternatives. When you reach out for feedback on a regular basis, acting upon it becomes far more manageable and feels much less like your work is getting crapped on.You can’t expect every line of code you’ve wrote and decision you’ve made over the span of 9 months to be the best option available. That’s an insane standard. Recognize that all developers are prone to making mistakes or suboptimal decisions, and take the initiative to reach out to your senior developers and get feedback more frequently.Personally I ask my architect to be brutal when critiquing my code so I can avoid repeating the same mistakes even when they’re small.When you go 9 months without reaching out for feedback you’re pretty much asking for every subpar decision you’ve made to be pointed out to you all at once. It can be hard to take that without it feeling like 9 months of effort is being crapped on.Ask for feedback more regularly, act upon it quickly, and take everything you learn from it with you moving forward. It also has the bonus of making the work feel more collaborative, and helps build a good reputation with your seniors in my experience.Edit: just to clarify, when I mention getting feedback, I will literally hop on a call with my architect and walk him through all the code changes since the last time he’s seen it, explain what it does, and give him a minute to glance over it. It usually ends up with him either saying “looks good” or asking more questions and then suggesting changes or accepting the reasoning. This approach allows the architect or senior to take some accountability for the code you’re writing which takes some of the pressure off.",TilYouSeeThisAgain,2025-09-11 03:18:28,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1ndh96e,False,

It’s mostly for team bonding and not flying everyone everytime. We don’t have enough desks in office so theres no chance we ever do hybrid or full rto. The teams that culturally go into office more often do not go in more than once a week, and no one cares if you only show up once a quarter or smthing.

We are fundamentally different from other companies of similar or bigger size (e.g. etsy, ebay, etc) which do not care as much about their tech.Leadership: can’t comment on details.

Not sure if its a good or bad thing but certainly still trying to expand/grow. We are more of a visual search and recommendation system for inspiration expanding into e-commerce and etc but new initiatives are being explored (or is it just wallstreet milking us?

You say you're doing code reviews but how is that possible without requirements and a development plan?2. you say the team is oversized yet still drowning? Unless they're all completely useless that doesn't make much sense.Those inconsistencies aside, it seems clear why the lead position was open. Either the previous lead was incompetent and built the wrong team for the task, or they were setup for failure and that happened. Or they left on their own after either creating or being put in a failing situation. The cause doesn't really matter here, the vacancy is just a strong hint that this team is dysfunctional. I would start by having a 1:1 with your immediate boss (senior lead? director?) and be totally upfront about the issues. DO NOT SUGAR COAT ANYTHING. Tell them that you don't believe this is the right team for this project and need to rebuild. Say ""The staffing on the team is not appropriate for the project."" or something like that.If your boss doesn't agree, then you have another data point on where the incompetence is that caused this mess. Schedule a 1:1 with your skip and repeat.The key here is to be direct and back it all up with as much evidence as you can. I assume that you have had 1:1s with your new reports so you have some direct knowledge. Pull all their commits and review them. See if they're that bad or just complacent under the previous lead.Get your lead or your skip on board and then have HR start the separation process for all the dead weight engineers on your team.

ndk4h12,"My consulting business deals with this specific kind of pain - modernizing legacy apps. Here are some suggestions, take them as you will.Be the single point of truth. It may not be feasible to know the codebase inside and out, but try your best to familiarize yourself with every commit. I would strongly suggest not forgoing code reviews. You can spend a little or a lot of time on them, but simply going over the commit with the dev prior to merging will go a long way down the road when you're dealing with changes and regressions. Over time, you will develop an intuitive understanding of where everything is and to whom to assign the ticket. Offshore teams can sometimes feel like a black box. Try to give them as little rope as possible with which to hang you. Set up guardrails. If possible, configure git hooks to run static code analysis and reject commits that fail. Have the devs install a linter, formatter, and style guide into their editors, or better yet, package them into an extension and give it to them. The specific rules don’t matter so much as the code adheres to some agreed upon standard. Utilize a branching strategy. git-flow is one, but there are others. This will make your job so much easier when pinpointing regressions. Bonus tip, learn git-bisect, it’s easy.If you don’t know where things are, it’s difficult to estimate how long it will take to solve a problem. The more order you can impose on the system, the easier it will be to make changes and fixes.  You say the offshore team has no taste for problem solving. That’s frustrating. Maybe they’re committing AI slop or copypasta from SO. Maybe you’re seeing huge blocks of inscrutable, unreadable code, but fulfill the AC, if only barely. And maybe you’re stuck with that code, for whatever reason. In that case, you can write tests for the feature before you assign the ticket. That way, it’s easier to push back if they try to submit something that’s 90% there, but to get it to 100% might take you an entire day. Avoid one-offs. This is harder to enforce, but worth it. That means, develop reusable and composable components that can be used to implement every feature. That may sound like common sense, but I’ve seen a lot of devs try to reinvent the wheel unnecessarily. Even if it is just a simple custom feature, they add up and make it difficult for another pair of eyes to understand what’s going on. Libraries like MUI are robust and rarely require you to develop new components from scratch.You say you have weak UI devs working on the back end. Personally, I often find the frontend to be more challenging than the backend, since users are finicky and APIs don’t complain. You can devise patterns for the back end and write them up, or even just name all the calls and have devs implement them. This is another place where having a test framework can be helpful. You don’t need 80-100% code coverage, just the critical paths and pain points.The bottom line is, the more you incorporate repeatable patterns and automation, the more time you’ll have for interesting problems (and sleep), and the less time you and your team will spend thrashing.

The full interview process took about 2 weeks.Third layoff was in February 2023 and also only took about a month. VP told a bunch of us about a colleague of his that was hiring, I recognized the name as a recruiter I connected with at a conference about five years earlier. Pinged the recruiter on LinkedIn and got in the mix quickly. This one took about 1.5 to 2 weeks.Fourth layoff was October 2024, and it took about a month to land my current gig. Went to a local user group meeting I hadn't been to in a couple years, which was having its first meeting in the offices of the place I now work for, also their last meeting of the year.

Not every company has a microservice architecture where you can choose to simply write a new feature in Go.On the other hand a lot of what would formerly be written in Java if the project is greenfield Go is becoming very popular. I've worked at two places now that concurrently supported services written in either Java or Go. The benefits of Go are pretty obvious since you don't need to allocate a giant arena for the JVM so cloud costs can usually get reduced using it. So its become more attractive in that sphere. If your company runs on bare metal that benefit doesn't really hold true.So basically I'd say if you're looking to get a job in the near term Java is still the safer bet but I only see Go's usage increasing as time goes on. Luckily Go is a fairly tiny language (which honestly gets people in trouble because they become expert beginners in it very quickly) so its pretty quick to learn.

As long as you continue to do your tasks well, a good manager shouldn’t hold it against you if you express dissatisfaction. That being said, they might take this as an implicit threat to leave the role as soon as you find something better. Think carefully about what leverage you have and what other options you have. If you are a high performer and aren’t too worried about finding another job, you have a lot of leverage, and you could even consider making your intentions to seek another job explicit.

nd3mt1q,"I'll echo the others - bait and switch happens all the time. It's happened to me a couple of times and I've unfortunately had to do that with some employees. A backgrounder on what maybe going on. I am sure given they were onboarding you in that position that the intent was to keep you there. A couple things could have happened. I don't have all the details on your particular situation but generically it can be: (1) they really need someone to do the hardware/software integration and you're the new guy so you get to do it or (2) your performance may not be what they were looking for and they're trying you in this role because it's easier & a lot less expensive to reassign vs terminating. Yeah, the second one stings and is a shitty move for the person affected. But it happens and that's often the rationale. I hired someone for a front end UI development job - had stellar references, had really good work in his portfolio, passed our coding exam - and their code quality in the first 90 days was really, really bad. Like do over with the help of a senior developer bad. IDK where we messed up in catching this but after a particularly disastrous demo with my co-founder and our sales team, we had to figure something out. He was a good guy and tried hard and asked for help. We didn't want to just fire this guy 90 days later. So we gave him very small features and a lot of customer support and operations which we needed (and were about to open a role for). The big difference here is that I and my VP of Engineering had a call and explained why were making the role change. He was disappointed but okay with it. I think the big one here is your manager didn't have the stones to tell you why. I bet if he did, you still might be pissed or wanting to leave but at least you'd know. Also, politically, this manager may have been told to fill that software integrator immediately by higher ups. Maybe sales is pissy because the integration isn't done or it doesn't work or whatever. He may not have had a choice. This is pretty common and may be a reason why he didn't want to tell you. Or he's a jerk or a coward. Here's what you may want to consider: 1. Have a conversation with your manager. Be friendly and open. Do not go in there loaded for bear about the job switch and presenting any kind of threat that you're going to leave. You don't have leverage. The manager could call your bluff and you're out a job. Just ask them ""hey, curious why the job role change? Is there a problem?"" And if you can hold your nose and do it, you can say something like ""I get it I'm helping out and I'd really like to get back to my other work. Can you give me an ETA or some idea of when that will happen?"". Do not mention the other job openings, etc, etc - you're going to set yourself up for a fight that now your manager is going to feel like they have to win. 2. If you don't like the answer, vote with your feet. Start looking for a new job immediately. Do a good job at your current role, keep quiet, and get out. I think you've already seen enough signs that this isn't a good company or manager to work for. These things tend not to get better. 3. If your manager gives you a legit reason like ""upper management needs this role filed and you were the new guy/best choice"" or ""we need someone to cover this for 6 months"" then again you'll need to evaluate. You \*might\* get to back to your own role but I'll tell you that if you're filling a gap, people aren't going to want to move you.

If you got a call or email about a job you had a good chance of remembering who it was and what they did. If you applied for a job there was a good change an actual human looked at your resume, and even read your cover letter as you were one of dozens who applied, not thousands.If you knew a recruiter you could reach out to them and maybe be one of 5 or 6 people who reached out about jobs.

For the question above you can do something like, “When I have a disagreement with someone I do [X]. I approach it this way because [X]. An example of me having a disagreement with someone is [X].

That's actually stronger than just giving a theoretical answer because it shows you've actually dealt with these situations before.The key is reading what the interviewer really wants to know. Questions that start with ""Tell me about a time"" or ""Describe a situation"" are screaming for STAR format.

ndlfzg9,"I've been in the Dynamics space for almost 20 years and I also came from a .NET background. Your friend is absolutely correct:>it’s less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communicationI go back and forth whether it's ""real programming"" or not. You're not technically building anything from the ground up, but instead are modifying or adding onto an existing application. However, that can be said for some legacy systems, too. The language isn't not hard to pick up at all and I feel like you can definitely tackle some interesting technical questions/problems. So, maybe you can think of it as programming at a very high (abstracted) level.As for your questions:1. **Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?** I have always valued my .NET background because I understand what is going on ""under the hood."" I've run into some interesting issues over the years and knowing how the framework works has really helped in getting to the root cause of the issue. I've also talked to a few managers at different companies and they have said it's nice to have someone with a non-Dynamics background.2. **What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?** If you already have a good handle on understanding business requirements and communication, it would be beneficial to take a look at the development ecosystem so you see what you're getting into from a technical perspective. I can only speak for Business Central, but the MS documentation site has a ton of information, including some tutorials: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al)3. **Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?** I feel like there is an uptick in the market, but I don't have any data to support that. As a customer, it's easier than ever to get started and the product does offer a lot. If you're kind of over the grind of traditional ""programming"" and want a little more interaction with customers, then it sounds like it would be a good change for you. One really nice thing is that the language has been going through quite the overhaul the last decade and MS is really working to improve the developer experience. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than when I started. I will say the only issue I'm running into is I've just about hit the upper limit of the pay scale -- the last offer I received was for the same salary with just a bonus added on. Because of that, I'm looking to make the opposite move and go into a more traditional developer role. I hope that covers all of your questions!

In one response you admit to not knowing what job you want in the field so what does a cyber security job look like to you?General advice is go for a computer science or IT degree. Computer science is theoretical and is the foundation of how software systems are built. That knowledge helps in a lot of ways. IT is generally learning about software and how it’s used in businesses. Depending on the university you may have more or less hands on/practice. You skip computer science theory for business courses and technology courses that teach you the software/hardware that businesses need to run their operations. Cyber security is an umbrella term that addresses many areas of technology security. There’s also information security, which has a technology component but extends to more than tech. Certifications are generally vendor based and show that you understand a specific implementation of technology. They can be useful but you just have to get ones that matter to the domain you’re trying to enter. Truthfully though, cyber security is entry level for people with experience in the fields in which they attempt to secure. It’s hard for someone who hasn’t had practice in using a technology to understand some of its weaknesses and vulnerabilities.

ncm36uc,"I managed a software team and had one employee move to half-time for a while.What we observed was that productivity wasn't cut in half, it was cut way more than that.In a 40-hour week, you might have an average of 8 hours of overhead - basically anything other than time you're spending actually working on code. That can include meetings, mandatory training, reading status update emails from others on your team, reading companywide emails, installing security updates, and so on.That leaves you with 32 hours of productive work (e.g. coding).If you switch to half-time, that overhead doesn't noticeably decrease. So now you end up with only 12 hours of productive work, which is a lot less than half.In my experience, the most junior employees are the ones who have the least overhead - so they'd probably be the least affected - but then again, they're also the least productive so I wouldn't want them to be even less productive.The most senior employees tend to have the most overhead - they're in more meetings, they email with many more groups within the company.Honestly, there are many weeks where if I only worked 20 hours, I wouldn't have time to finish a single productive task.",dmazzoni,2025-09-05 19:50:24,9,cscareerquestions,t3_1n9cglp,False,

If he decides to leave the business, you only have your code which amounts to nothing. I would counter him and say that he can put in some capital to offshore the work to India and you can manage them (1-2 hours a week). You will get a rough MVP that's not scalable but is sellable. Once you get some investors or income then you can take a salary + equity If you are not a cofounder then 10% is reasonable, but to me it sounds like you are so it should be closer to 20%.
