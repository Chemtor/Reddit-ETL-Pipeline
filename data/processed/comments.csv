msdz10t,"I have a recent real world example of this, I think.I work with data from social media platforms. Instagram just deprecated their “plays” and “impressions” metrics and replaced them with a new metric called “views”.“Plays” was already a replacement for an older metric called “video_views”, and “plays” measured initial plays on Reels only. The new “views” metric includes replays. There was another metric deprecated called something like “reels_aggregated_plays” which included replays on Reels and therefore matched the new “views” metric.Also new “views” populates for post types that traditionally wouldn’t get “video_views” because they aren’t technically videos: think carousels, images. New “views” are basically “impressions” but they’re higher than impressions for reasons we don’t really understand yet.For almost a decade now we’ve been charged with creating cross-platform data sets that measure total video views. How do we do this when the metric you’ve always used for video views no longer exists, and views happen for more than just video? What we’re saying was a video view in March 2025 is not the same as what we’re saying was a video views in May 2025My point is: this sucks ass. How are you going to validate these changes and explain the data to stakeholders?

msc6kfj,"I’m a DS so what do I know. But here’s my two cents.I work at an org with a hybrid cloud approach. We have on-prem data, some data is in Oracle or db2, and my division mostly lives in Synapse.The Synapse data is often pulled from those other sources (via Synapse Pipelines or stored procedures), cleaned (usually in SQL, sometimes in pandas), and finally dumped into a table.Notice - there’s no bronze layer. I think this is the definition of ETL since we transform before we load. I could be wrong.What’s nice about this workflow: it minimizes costs and it reduces cognitive burden since, there’s fewer intermediate tables.What stinks about this workflow: it’s hard to reason about data lineage and there’s little to no audit trail. Where does this variable come from? Have to dig deep in some low level db just to find the source. If a table churns out questionable data, where did the mistake happen? Is it in the transformation logic, or was there some miscommunication with the source table? Again, tricky to understand. So while having a dumping ground for raw  data seems redundant and can introduce extra expenses, sometimes it’s worth it. I believe that pattern is called ELT, since you load the ugly raw data into a new source system before cleaning it.Another benefit of the bronze layer or ELT approach is that it can reduce the number of ad hoc queries against the low level transactional database, which slows everything down. And having the raw data under the same roof as your data warehouse’s clean data, again, opens up new forms of exploratory analysis.A nice compromise, instead of having permanent intermediate tables, is to have trunc and load tables that are refreshed at regular intervals. That way the data doesn’t eat up so many costs, but there’s still an audit trail for testing and observing data lineage.",BrisklyBrusque,2025-05-14 21:00:15,9,dataengineering,t3_1kmq1ew,False,

msxfok2,"Ways I would tackle it:1. Denormalized counters in your post record (small scale)You add integer columns like `comments_count`, `likes_count` directly on your posts table.Whenever someone adds or removes a comment (or like), you increment/decrement that column instead of re‑scanning all comments.Most relational databases (Postgres, MySQL) can do an atomic `UPDATE posts SET comments_count = comments_count + 1 WHERE id = ?` cheaply, especially when that column is in memory.This would be my first pick given you can ship this in minutes with zero infrastructure beyond your main database.2. Sharded or distributed counters (mid scale)For “hot” posts with millions of comments/likes - think celebrities, viral content etc., a single counter can become a write hotspot.You break it into N shards: UPDATE comment_counter_shards SET shard_count = shard_count + 1 WHERE post_id = ? AND shard_id = rand_between(1, N)To read the total, you sum over those N shards. N is tuned (often 4–16) so no single row fights over locks.This solution pays off only when your single‑row updates actually become a bottleneck (once you hit sustained write contention). Until then its probably an overkill.3. In‑memory caching (Redis, Memcached, etc.)Maintain the “current” counts in a fast key‑value store. On each write you atomically INCR or DECR the Redis key (e.g. post:123:comments).Feed readers pull from cache, falling back to the database only if the cache miss occurs.Each 1 & 2 solutions could be combined with this method for low-latency reads.I am about to drive - lemme think of other ways, I will edit and add to this post if something else comes up.UPDATE: Some more thoughts:To keep write latency low, counters could update asynchronously (e.g. via a message queue).You accept sub‑second lag in the displayed count in exchange for high throughput (which for non-YMYL stuff like like/comment count is acceptable).Also worth noting, there are specialized data stores with native counters like Cassandra and Bigtable from Google. They support atomic counter columns across distributed nodes, so you offload the complexity of sharding and locking.But if you are at that stage and its your own service, you probably made it and I want your job :)Anyways, its weekend.

The reason is not so much the pleasure of starting a new project with them or the time it saves when starting. It is rather the ease of on-boarding a new member into an established tool, instead of spending months training the person to a highly specific home-cooked solution. I am also speaking from experience of being on-boarded into this kind of home-made complex ETL.Scala had some history as a DE language because Apache Spark main UI used to be its Scala API. Then it introduced a Python API with similar performance, so the complexity of Scala could not be justified, and the language is globally dying for all its niche use cases, as far as I know.So for me, it's not really a question of language, Python and SQL are consensual kings and here to stay.

Python is a very easy language to get up and running with, which is (in my opinion) why people who aren’t Software Engineers (ie data analysts/scientists) use it. Since it’s used so much by them, the data ecosystem ends up using it a lot in general, so it then bleeds over to tools used by actual engineers.I personally loathe python for basically the same reasons you outlined.

ms4t471,I think the flip side of this is that python makes it easier to write extremely unopinionated highly meta sort of systems that just eat up basically anything they get given. Doing this same sort of thing in other languages is much harder and almost immediately devolves into an explosion of complexity that can quickly become very hard to maintain and understand. Other languages are all fine and good when all your data is super well behaved and you have control of it at every layer. Python really is the goat for handling flaky weird sorts of stuff coming from systems outside of your control. This is why Python has largely won this particular race. Real world data doesn’t always have nice structure to code up as some nice fixed schema and you still need to be able to handle it.That said certainly there is a move within Python to use pydantic as the core serialization and deserialization system that builds basically better data class objects. Then your actual business logic Python code can simply check that it receives an object of the type it expects irrespective of internal complexity of those objects and their construction.,TheRealStepBot,2025-05-13 18:17:18,3,dataengineering,t3_1klpzaf,False,

mrv97w8,"I was a software engineer for nearly 15 years. Worked in mobile, desktop, web development. I write network and security automation stuff for fun. My final role as a software engineer was a team lead in an insurance company. We had legacy C# desktop stuff, legacy web stuff (ASP.NET/PHP/ColdFusion), and more modern web stuff for the time (ASP.NET + Angular). I still used to write a lot of data engineering-like tasks in this job - financial services, so tons of integrating with SFTP servers and writing/ingesting XML everywhere. Heavy SQL Server stuff underpinned all of this, which is how I ended up in data. My track in data was BI developer -> data engineer in wealth mgmt (Python/BigQuery/dbt) -> data consultant (Azure/Databricks/Synapse) -> tech lead in retail (Python/BigQuery/dbt) -> senior engineer in security for retail org (Python/BigQuery/dbt for analytics, Splunk for SIEM + security automation). I am a very code-heavy data engineer. Everything I do is in code except for dashboards, which I wish I could change. Regardless - and I get downvoted into oblivion here a lot for saying this - I don't view data engineering as anything close to software engineering. The needs, requirements, and use cases are all entirely different. Your average software engineer will fail even the most basic data modelling task these days. Most don't know SQL or even touch a database directly. Your average data engineer will struggle with anything beyond a basic CRUD app. They are different specialties and the code for data pipelines is simpler by many orders of magnitude. I have watched this time and time again with data engineers thinking they can just switch between the two. I even think if I tried to go back to my old ways in the C# ecosystem I would have a really hard time (forgetting that I'm about 10 years older now...) Any pivot is possible, but keep in mind it will take a long time. It took me something like five years to fully move to data engineering after a complete reskill, and that was still with my prior SQL history.

mspw4xq,"> orbits/predictions that would require going through the entire database more than once to establish relationships between planets/stars and calculate distances based on multiple columns and making sub queries based on the resultsThis aspect sounds like you want to step out of SQL for some steps, or at least generate intermediate tables. Generating a subquery based on the results of another query isn't really how CTEs work - a CTE just creates a view or 'virtual table' that you can query from. The 'going through the entire database more than once' sounds like you want to do some kind of iterative work, where you want to save the results at each step and move on.This doesn't necessitate using a particular DB, but you might want to think about how you would approach some of these things in another language. Using Python, for instance, lets you make use of many different tools that work well together, it will let you take an imperative approach to calculating things, and you'll be able to easily write output data to files and review them using csv/jsonl/parquet formats.You would also be able to set up long running processes to be done incrementally. Say you create a list of all systems 'A' to calculate the distance to all other systems 'B' - if this would take a long time, you can store a table with which 'A' systems have been done. Then your imperative program can just find the next 'A' system to calculate, and do the calculations for that. This sort of chunking might make processing more resilient to timeouts or memory issues.> if making multiple smaller tables with a few columns (5-10) or a single one with all columns (30-40) would be bestIf you land on columnar storage like parquet, or duckdb's internal storage, then it doesn't matter how many columns you have. Their data layout means that all the data for a column is stored together, so it can completely skip over columns you don't need. The general tradeoff with columnar systems is they often make it a bit slower to pick out individual values. So if your main way of using the data is to grab out the data for a specific system, this isn't as efficient.If you have a row-based store then you might be better served with multiple tables if you can organise columns into groups that are often used together. For example if coordinates aren't often used in conjuction with other columns, but you want to do a lot of work comparing coordinates, then you could split that off to its own table. If all the tables share the same primary key, and you make sure they are all indexed the same, it should be fine to perform joins between these tables. This is likely a relatively small optimisation, since it really just makes disk reads a bit more efficient.> The best database option that would basically be read only...This mostly means that something based on columnar-storage will be fine. You aren't updating rows, so you don't need anything transactional. It doesn't preclude row-based systems either, so essentially everything is open to you.If postgres is working for you, just keep it in there. That's fine.SQLite probably won't work - it doesn't have a compressed format, and you'll likely run into issues with the large data volume relative to disk size.If most of what you are doing is running through lots of data at once, then you could convert the tables to parquet files and query with something like DuckDB, Polars, or Daft. Each of those also make it easier to script with python and exchange data from an sql processing model to an imperative one in python. Daft may have a benefit that it has a built-in method to spread execution to multiple processes on your machine, so if something goes oom it can recover and retry, and can spill intermediate steps to disk.Or, as others have mentioned, you could add an extension for duckdb to get data via postgres.---In general, I'd leave things in postgres for now and see if you can point things like DuckDB at it, and see how their processing model works for you. Polars [can connect to a database](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/api/polars.read_database.html) and [so can Daft](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/integrations/sql/). If you're going to hit OOM issues it will happen in this processing step regardless of how the data is stored, so if you try out a few different processing engines working off of the existing postgres data, you might find what works for you.If any of these tools work for you, then you might consider shifting the data to parquet format as it may be smaller to store and more efficient to read.

You could export and compress with parquet although I'm not sure it'll be any smaller than PG's internal storage compression.[https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/guides/performance/how\_to\_tune\_workloads.html](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/guides/performance/how_to_tune_workloads.html)DuckDB supports spilling to disk but I think the internal data structures and access methods an In Memory Database like Duck or SQLite uses is very different from a disk based database that also has a memory buffer pool in RAM. Postgres for sure is one of those, but for your use case you'd want an Analytic (OLAP) Database so you could use Clickhouse.Doing rankings is a typical analytic task with a window function. Establishing relationships, the full table scan part is just part and parcel of what a traditional database does but you going in and actually mapping the relationships you could use a CTE. Better yet would be something like dbt (data build tool).Now I'm not saying you'll be accessing all 225G's at once in which case *maybe* you won't hit your 32G of system memory limit. I'm not sure queries you do plan on running. But to be on the safe side just use a traditional analytic server like Clickhouse and if it turns out that the queries you end up running don't have huge joins or aren't working with tables that are 60gigs at a time in size then you can just use DuckDB.Edit: How you end up modeling this data and what queries you run against it might be a separate issue. I think the baseline technical aspect is to get you up and running. Actually one thing I hadn't considered is you can just keep running everything in Postgres since it's already in it, and then use DuckDB with the postgres extension known as pg\_duck[https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/postgres.html](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/extensions/postgres.html)",data4dayz,2025-05-16 23:55:48,7,dataengineering,t3_1kodif8,False,

Data Mesh doesn’t offer a data modelling methodology as far as I’m aware but is more of an operating model for data organisationally (for lack of a better term). Inmon is upstream of Kimball and even Imnon suggested localised Kimball marts for business consumption downstream. Inmon is more effort up front to capture the business in 3rd normal form promoting better integrity and consistency for the longer term. This is why it’s rarely seen (comparatively), as many businesses can’t justify the overhead and see more immediate reward with Kimball (despite the potential long term technical debt this creates).",CommonUserAccount,2025-05-18 15:35:48,27,dataengineering,t3_1kpm88w,False,
msze1ti,"I'd say that an Inmon approach (at least originally, the man keeps evolving his ideas and publishing new books) compares better as a data architecture, much like a data mesh, more than Kimball (at least when he started, that guy kept on expanding his concepts as well).Inmon's DW design favored more or less 3 data layers:- A raw layer, that started as a landing zone and eventually evolved to an ""operational data store"". Originally is way quite simple, but an ODS was supposed to provide operational level reporting capabilities, with even near real-time if possible (it was quite visionary when proposed in the 90s);- A Data Warehouse layer, which was supposed to have a fully integrated view of the business for analytical purposes. This matched mostly his definition: ""subject-oriented, non-volatile, integrated, time-variant collection of data"". The DW layer is rarely, if ever, accessed by BI tools or end users. It is the single source of truth that feeds the specific databases (next bullet) supporting analytic and decision nerds. As such, it tends to be more normalized (not really full 3NF, but in that direction), as this would make it more reusable for different sets of requirements - including future ones.- Data marts: these are tightly scoped to the needs of specific use cases. For reporting and BI, it's common to model those as Kimball star schemas; for data science, other formats, even files, are possible. For specific reports, it could be a very custom thing.This actually is the source for a medallion architecture, and also became a full data architecture before Kimball came up with the concept of a DW using ""conformed dimensions"". I built quite a few DWs using Inmon's approach, and I can tell you they evolve well and survive a lot. The main challenges are:- Figuring out a good priority for which domains/subjects to build first. It's no use trying to model the whole DW layer before delivering something, but people still try that.- Knowing how to capture a business in its entirety in a data model. Eventually, as you iterate, you'll find inconsistencies, redundancies, things no one thought about, politics, etc. Solving those to one common model is hard; letting them pass reduces the value of the DW layer over time, putting g the entire architecture in check;- Compound effort of having data go through 3 layers (or more) before delivering value. Again, this is people just assuming they have to adopt and build it all before any value is delivered. My approach was to first do a high level business mapping in domains to identify opportunities and prioritize. The first 2-3 deliveries usually had very light landing and a straightforward middle layer model, generating stars was straightforward, fast and cheap. As the platform grew, complexity would be added but not as a burden - it is a way to actually represent the business and deliver higher-level analytics. The kind that needs cross domain analysis, decision and optimization. Doing that on top of starts is incredibly harder (been there, done that).Inmon kept evolving his design, addressing data quality, unstructured data, real-time and others, but he lost importance as the world moved to cloud and Hadoop - even though he published about those and his designs were perfectly applicable there. It's more that everything pre-cloud and pre-agile was sort of left behind by a new generation.Edit:typos",bobbruno,2025-05-18 17:11:04,10,dataengineering,t3_1kpm88w,False,

mstimrz,"There is an old adage of ""be forgiving in your inputs and strict on your outputs."" It's easy to understand but very difficult in practice. The biggest problem I had like this was cleaning addresses around the world. There were about 400 million of them. They were almost always manually input, inconsistent and had tons of dupicates and semi-duplicates. In addition to that fun, the rules that constituted a ""good"" address changed from country to country. The acid test for the US was the addresses in Atlanta, GA. There are dozens of valid variations of Peachtree. Some countries, such as Switzerland, had the individual/company as part of a valid address. This didn't even begin to address misspellings and incorrect abbreviations.It is solvable and straightforward but not easy. You have to use different techniques for different problems in the data set. Sometimes a lookup against existing data is needed. Sometimes it is a correction table. In this case, it required brut force data cleansing using SQL (so I could treat things as sets and get some performance). I was able to run through the entire set in about 25 minutes. Once the bulk of the data was cleansed, I started using the Google mapping API on the front end to validate addresses.

If they're large enough, you save them as s3 objects in their own right. If they're small, you send them to something like Kinesis Firehose, which will automatically buffer objects up to 15mins/300MB and then save them out to s3.If you want to track where you are up to, and you are running all this in a single process, you can just have a json object in s3 that you overwrite with the currently active data, so that if something stops or crashes you can pick up from the last request. If you have multiple concurrent processes or it is updating very fast, you can store it all in a tiny DynamoDB against a particular key.---Microbatching ingestion into a single duckdb database sounds off. You replace objects in s3, so every write will be a full rewrite of the file. If you wanted to make data like this available to duckdb for processing, you would be writing append-only to some other file format that duckdb could read.For remote data instances with updates like this, you might use duckdb as the processing engine, but you would be using an open table format like deltalake or iceberg to allow you to do write transactions on the data in a way that is more amenable to the way object storage works.",azirale,2025-05-18 04:31:30,16,dataengineering,t3_1kpaisy,False,

Weather predictions are usually given for the region and even if you could get it by problem/route it sounds unnecessarily complex to get data that is probably going to be wrong when you show up lol (weather is highly unpredictable at small scale is what I’m saying). I would find the mid-point for a given crag (or section if it’s really big or they are far apart etc) and just map that weather prediction by “area”. That will simplify things A LOT.

Also not sure off the top of my head what additional destinations they may support now - original post only says ""CES on **Azure SQL Database** and **Azure Event Hubs**, with plans to expand support for additional sources and destinations in the future"". There's a email address at the bottom of the post, or I can ask around :).[https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/introducing-change-event-streaming-join-the-azure-sql-database-private-preview-for-change-data-streaming/](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/azure-sql/introducing-change-event-streaming-join-the-azure-sql-database-private-preview-for-change-data-streaming/) 2) Fabric MirroringThis is a turn-key ""it just works"" native solution for SQL Server to Parquet in near-real-time - but it has one constraint that may be a non-starter for you - it can replicate to OneLake (which implements ADLS / Azure Blob Storage API), not S3. From there, you could use whatever ADLS-compatible tooling (including Databricks, Snowflake, Microsoft Fabric, et cetera) you like for further OLAP and reporting needs.Announced here [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/blog/2025/01/15/the-year-ahead-for-sql-server-ground-to-cloud-to-fabric/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/blog/2025/01/15/the-year-ahead-for-sql-server-ground-to-cloud-to-fabric/)Should be quite similar to [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/database/mirrored-database/azure-sql-database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/database/mirrored-database/azure-sql-database) but for SQL Server 2025.OneLake also supports ""Shortcuts"" to translate between Storage APIs and avoid you having to move all your existing data; but I'm a bit fuzzy off the top of my head whether writes **to** S3 are supported ( [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/create-s3-shortcut](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/create-s3-shortcut) ) - OneLake is not my area of expertise, especially around the Shortcuts side of things.

If you're open to non-OSS solutions, Glue can work, but it's not very flexible.also curious: when you say DMS didn’t work well, was it reliability, speed, or something else?

Airbyte is not a scalable solution especially for high volume database; whereas Fivetran gets expensive real fast. Custom Python / AWS Glue – definitely an option, but as you mentioned, can become a huge maintenance burden. Hard to scale long-term. If your goal is to stream CDC changes directly to S3 in Parquet without managing Debezium and Kafka or relying on batch jobs, there are a few CDC tools built specifically for this.

mrwncjc,"You should read about Git itself, what it's purpose is, and how it works fundamentally. Git is the actual tool here, it's an industry standard version control methodology. Github is just one of many tools that harness the power of Git. You can practice using Git directly on your own machine without using any other tool (and without even using code) if you want. You can just use a text file and practice committing and merging changes to the text via git.The basics are, essentially: You have a code base. You want to make one or many changes to that code base, but you want to keep the current state intact so you dont lose your functionality. You create a branch, which is an exact copy of that same code base. You make your changes to the branch. You test the branch. If it's a failure, it doesn't matter because the ""main"" branch hasn't been modified yet. When you get it to work properly, you merge your branch into the main branch. Now your main branch reflects the changes you've made. Repeat. It gets a little more complicated when you've got many people working on many branches at a time, which is when the pull requests and reviews come into play. That stuff exists so that someone who is familiar with the code base can be a second set of eyes, check your work, make sure there aren't conflicts with other people's work, etc. The whole construct exists so there is an easy way to do parallel development work on the same code base without actually changing the working code before the changes have been tested and reviewed.",omfghi2u,2025-05-12 13:01:58,227,learnprogramming,t3_1kkrb3i,False,

mrwqqjz,"I think when trying to learn it often ends up sounding more confusing than it actually is as a concept. Obviously there are layers and layers of complexity but at first I would try to understand at its core what it is. Imagine there’s a massive library of handwritten books and your team need to make various amendments to different ones. Someone has written a list of requirements for you. Your team divides up the tasks. Your first task is to remove any mentions of parrots from “My Life as a Hamster (1974)” - don’t ask why. Better not to ask too many questions in this team. To do that, you check out the single book (My life as a hamster) from the library and tell everyone else you’re doing it for transparency. You do your stuff. Now you could just go and pop the book back on the shelf as you’ve finished but what if you’ve made a mistake? Instead you put it in a little box for “review” and your other team mates can have a look and check they’re happy with your work. Once they are, it goes back in to the library. Yours is now the correct version for that book. Of course you don’t want to shut down the entire library while you do your job which is why this strategy of checking one book out, making changes, getting it reviewed and putting it back in works well. Everyone can be doing different tasks at the same time. The library itself remains central and “pure” - hopefully with your robust review box, no mistakes are getting in. The library is a single point of truth - everything in there has been approved and checked and is correct. Any mistakes are picked up in review. Now instead of a library, as a developer, what you’re working on is digital. It means that people are working on all different books (files). Sometimes people might even be working on the same book but doing a different task. While you’re doing your hamster task, someone else is updating page numbers in all rodent books including your hamster one. Sometimes this can cause a bit of confusion if you make changes to the same page but luckily Git gives you a nice simple (ish) way to fix these and decide which changes to keep when there’s such a conflict.Most importantly, to reiterate, despite all these complicated changes all happening at once, the library itself is pure and “correct” - because people cannot make changes and put the book back. They need check out books, make changes, then put it into the review box (make a pull request) and others in the team must approve it before it goes back in (gets merged in) to the library. It may help, moving away from the library analogy, to imagine the alternative. Imagine word documents named version1, version2 etc. imagine everyone trying to change it at once. Everyone saves their own local copy. But someone else has changed the same bit you were going to. Whose bit goes in? Soon nobody has any idea which version is the right one. People are no longer copying the original. - they are copying version 17. But oh wait, while you were doing something, version 18 became available and now all those changes aren’t in yours.",Schwicke,2025-05-12 13:22:14,23,learnprogramming,t3_1kkrb3i,False,

And no, you don’t need to build the next Minecraft, in fact trying to do that too early is gonna confuse you more.On the other hand, if you really want to build something, being a app, a game or wathever, then code becomes the tool but not the subject. You’ll learn plenty by doing, that's for sure, but your brain is focused on making it work, not on understanding the system. The trap is thinking the second automatically teaches the first.

I'll use some Free Pascal as an example, because that is unfortunately my favorite language to work with.

X : Y;In FPC // no ""ternary"" if X > Y then begin exit(X); end else begin exit(Y); end; // ""ternary"" if X > Y then exit(X) else exit(Y);For me, the ternary operator just makes it easier to parse because I know that its function is pretty much to facilitate the cleaner 1-liner. In FPC and other language that don't have one, it's only very slightly more effort to figure out what's going on, but it still kinda rubs me the wrong way and I might want to just use the whole if..else block to make the intention more clear.All that being said, it's basically all inconsequential and up to personal preference.

In my case it was an analysing books to understand the relationships between characters. I also had other ideas around web-scraping for data journalism type use cases. Rabbit-holes are great and you should dive into them, but having a project tethers you to what you're trying to achieve and you can drag yourself back because you start to feel guilty that you've not made progress. If your goal is undefined ""I'm going to learn"" that mindset will encourage you to keep going deeper. For example, in my case I spent time working out how to get data into pandas, but I also went down some rabbit-holes of anonymous functions and different file formats which were good to know, but not directly applicable. I didn't get into what's possible to do in numpy because my motivation was to get my project done, not to learn learn learn. 1. Same answer as the other two. ""Do projects."" 99.9% of programming is going to fall outside of your project's scope, so it naturally limits you to a domain that should be manageable. If it doesn't, then the programming mindset of continually breaking down the problem until you have something you can solve or you can research how to solve it will get you the rest of the way.",Crypt0Nihilist,2025-05-14 13:24:33,2,learnprogramming,t3_1kmdgmk,False,

To completely hand over software development to AI means you are just automating automation, which gives you less control and specificity.That said, for writing difficult algorithms or complex systems, AI may be used for most of that work in the future, the same way that chess engines can outplay humans.The problem with AI coding right now is that it is simply based on large language models, not a formal system such as coding verification. for example, you can task large language models to play chess, but they constantly suggest illegal moves and while they can make some very clever moves, they also make incredibly stupid ones at times as well.AI coding will take off once the machine learning systems are based on rigorous formal descriptions of programming languages, not just general large language models.Right now I would argue the best uses of AI for coding is translating large code bases from one language to another, prototyping of very simple ideas, or embedding an AI system to allow users to prompt the text.The problem is LLMs are very easy to apply to a wide variety of tasks, but LLMs aren't specifically tailored for programming, so just like LLMs are much worse than a chess engine, specifically designed for chess, there will likely be innovations for ai programming that aren't just ""feed this LLM a bunch of code and see what it can do.""LLMs will continue to get better, but even before LLMs people created logical proof systems and formal verification tools that are much more specific to programming.I imagine a scenario where you just write the test cases and then the ai system generates the code and algorithms that can pass those test cases.",Live-Concert6624,2025-05-18 13:51:07,20,learnprogramming,t3_1kpjhc0,False,

If all the web browsers supported LUA or some new language, then maybe JavaScript wouldn't be he language of choice. Additionally you could argue that TypeScript is the web development language, but it's compilation phase turns it into JavaScript...so is it TypeScript or JavaScript?I suspect Java and Android is because Java existed, was free, and android needed some language for programmers to develop in. Also JAVA is nice in that it really hides the hardware/OS from the development process. You can develop a JAVA app on Windows, Linux, MacOS and be reasonable certain it will run in the Android OS.I would ague against C++ as the king of the OS, C is more the king of the OS development. Mostly because all the popular OSes were developed when C++ had more overhead and ran slower, so writing the code in C avoided those issues. You really don't want your OS to be slowing you down. The Linux Kernel for example is all C and now Rust maybe, I'm not sure. I suspect Windows is all C. These days C/C++/Rust are good because they compile down to native CPU instructions so your program has the least amount of overhead. There is a cost however, in that you have to handle idiosyncrasies between hardware and OSes yourself. This may be as simple as just compiling for that hardware, but can have other issues.C# and games I have no comments on. My guess would be time to market, some programming languages let you produce code faster with fewer bugs, the code may not run as fast as code written in another language, but as long as it runs ""fast enough"" then people will buy it, the company will make money, and the developers will get paid, so everyone is happy.",pixel293,2025-05-14 17:50:16,8,learnprogramming,t3_1kml1l7,False,

msbd8iz,"It just depends. You have the enshrined problem (this language is used for this field, so all the tools use that language, and at some point its hard to 'break in' with another language to do the same thing, even if it would be great for it). You have the 'no can do' problems, like java has a ton of things it simply will not do without arm twisting and work arounds, like operator overloading. Not a big deal you say? Consider some linear algebra: AX=B. In C++, that could look like B = A\*X; In java that has to look like B.assign(A.multiply(X)); Now imagine an equation with 5 or 6 pieces in it written the java way... it looks nothing like the math and is hard to write, hard to read, and hard to maintain. There are several other key things java does not directly support that make it frustrating to use for some tasks, including a bizarre workaround just to have an unsigned int. Java has nice stuff too, though: it works pretty cleanly on various OS without the frustration that some C++ projects can present when porting. C# is tied heavily to windows, and windows has 'won' the gaming audience by and large. Less so today, but like the enshrined problem with languages, gaming is enshrined in windows very heavily (compared to other desktop OS). Between that and game engine support and native OS tie in, it has a leg up right away. Then you add in the pointers and other support that push it towards C++ and away from java's rigid approach, and its performance, you start to see why it pulled into the gaming industry. Java got (and deserved) a bad rep early on for being slow, and while that has been fixed in a broad sense, it still suffers from the rep and the reality (it still isn't as fast as c++ when push comes to shove). So to sort of try to answer.. its a mix of the language's performance, tools, design, and so on alongside an almost 'social' problem of getting a foothold in an area that is already dominated by something else. New languages come and go, but the ones that stick and are used heavily in any field get there by being better than what was used before. Python is kind of an oddball there, as its niche is being easy to use for hobby programmers, which is an area that has grown huge (everyone wants a little knowledge now) in the last 20 years or so.

mrvxgcc,"You not only need to ""learn programming"". Learning a programming language is like 1% of what you need to learn. The most important aspect you have to acquire is thinking like a dev. Problem solving skills above all else. Languages are the easy part, especially these days where like 70% of the main languages follow the same syntax and if you're able to use one, you'll get used to another one in a few days (OOP related). Besides that, most jobs not only ask for a language, but a specific set of technologies such as Docker + Kubernetes + GCP + Java + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL. Learning development isn't learning a language, it's learning to solve problems. How you solve those and which tools you use is another topic and most of the time you can choose between multiple tools to solve the same task. Another - in my opinion - important aspect is that you need to be able to explain complex tech heavy topics as simple as possible without using the word ""code"" once. Many companies work in agile environment with different products, roles and departments and you'll have a lot of meetings where you have to explain what you did in simple terms so that every PO understands it. In your case, you should first find out what you're lacking the most, which will probably be problem solving skills as it is for most devs. If you have not even build a single private project yourself once, it's very unlikely that you're ready to work in a professional development environment in a year. Developing a private project and developing a b2b project as an example are totally different worlds. But thats just my take. Ask 10 devs and all 10 will have different opinions and approaches.

It represents an economic transaction, and the price it refers to is not the current catalog price, but rather the price snapshot at the time of the sale, specifically referred to that order.In fact, this is exactly where discounts, custom prices, or promotions could apply. Directly in the LineItem. Tying it only to the current Product data breaks the integrity of historical records and assumes that product attributes are timeless, which they clearly aren't.Edit i see many answers with triggers, other tables and so on. If you move redundancy out of a table that should be ,because of semantic, ""denormalized by design"" you are not removing redundancy from DB and you have an inconsistent LineItem table as result.Normalization should not be ""never replicate data, even when it has different meaning"".Normalization is a technical tool that originated because, before ORMs, data persistence was handled directly by application code, which led to all sorts of issues. The idea was to solve these problems by abstracting the physical layer of persistence and using relational algebra rules to optimize the logical design.But normalization must be subordinate to proper modeling of entities and meanings.For example, suppose you have a product_quantity field in a product catalog table, meaning ""units per package"", and another product_quantity field in a warehouse table, meaning ""units in stock"".Should you normalize the schema to avoid redundancy, or disambiguate the semantics first?The answer is obvious: semantics first.

Write down in text the interactions, like ""the dealer shuffles two, three, four decks of cards"", ""the dealer deals one card to every player"", ""the players bet"", etc, etc, and then find the nouns and the verbs. Nouns are potential classes (player, dealer, card, deck, bet, etc) whereas verbs are potential methods (deal, bet, withdraw, etc). Then build the relations between the different nouns, in terms of pure OOP how the player interacts with the dealers, what is the ""protocol"" between them, which ""messages"" does the player expect the dealer to handle, which ""messages"" the dealer expects the player to handle, etc.Maybe you should begin with simpler designs?

And even then, be very careful with it, keep it absolutely minimal, and don't layer it. Especially multiple inheritance.Don't use static props and methods in your design. They are typically just a bandaid on what could otherwise be done by regular props and methods.

Real world code is not made out of Dogs and Rectangles.If you're fighting the multimethod problem, aka if you cannot decide between doing `dog.eat(food)` or `food.eatenBy(dog)`, consider making an `Eating` class, and then call `eating.eat(dog, food)`.Use OOP mainly to encapsulate state, as in, have each object only directly talk to its own data. Don't modify values inside objects other than self. Use getters/setters. That way you can intercept the modifications and ensure that the data within the object is always consistent.Try to have classes that are either mostly/fully just data, or mostly/fully just functions. Those are your ""nouns"" and ""verbs"", analogical to the structs and functions in non-OOP languages.Be perfectly happy with making a class which is only instantiated once. In fact, most of your classes should probably be instantiated only once.""The problem with OOP is that you want a banana, but you get a monkey holding a banana, inside the rest of the jungle"" - someone else's quote.OOP is too much. It's a huge pile of features. The worst thing you can do is trying to use them all just because they exist.Consider this: goto and global variables exist too.Write a basic class that doesn't inherit anything, add regular methods, regular properties, one constructor if needed to pre-fill the properties, and then instantiate it and use it.

Most of the top software engineers make a ton of money at work and then spend their free time with their families and friends—they don't hang around on Reddit all day typing comments about OOP. Typically it's the jobless, the students, or the juniors with low responsibility at work who have extra time and motivation to hang around on programming forums all day. Exceptions apply of course, but that's the general gist of it.2. Most of the best software out there is written with OOP, Java, C++... Basically with everything that you don't see as being fancy or recommended on Reddit.Can you find a connection between these two points?Could it be that the real seniors who are working on real projects and being paid top money are still using OOP, Java, C++, etc.? Or to be more accurate, they use whatever works the best for the task at hand, whether that's OOP or FP or something else entirely?Meanwhile the ""seniors"" who either 1. haven't quite grasped OOP *yet*, or 2. gave up after they failed once instead of thriving to improve —are the very people who are most active on these forums, trying to justify their opinions to others, religiously hating the most successful and widespread paradigm of all time instead of learning the ups and downs of each approach.So why do these people hate OOP in the first place? Because it's easy to get wrong. It's an insanely potent tool when used right, but it takes years of experience, active studying, experimenting, and trial and error to get right. They've seen horrible inheritance trees based on the ""is-a"" vs ""has-a"" rule, which completely fails if you use it with the English language rather than the physical constructs. Some examples of this going with English are:- Wrong: A football player *is-a* human -> `FootballPlayer extends Human` - Correct: A human *has-a* job or a hobby -> `player.hobby = football`- Wrong: An invisible video-game enemy *is-a* video-game enemy -> `InvisEnemy extends Enemy` - Correct: An enemy character *has-a* opacity -> `enemy.opacity = 0.0`- Wrong: An android phone *is-a* phone -> `Android extends Phone` - Correct: A phone *has-a* operating system -> `phone.os = android`These are just some of the examples where following the English language fails you, and where you should rely on the [Composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) principle instead. Of course people have taken this too far to the other extereme as well, going as far as erasing all of language support for inheritance and forcing inheritance through composition... which sucks as well.

That said using classes and objects can be good in the right circumstanses.OOP can also be bad for speed optimizationd. It have a tendency to create arrays of pointers to structs/objects.

This framework is often used for teaching and, while not always perfect, can give you an idea on how to structure your learning efforts.1. Before we create, we must be able to evaluate.2. Before we evaluate, we must be able to analyze.3. Before we analyze, we must be able to apply knowledge/skills.4. Before we apply, we must understand what we do and why we do it.5. Before understanding, we must be able to recall accurately.Things slipping through your mind is a signal that the foundations aren’t strong enough, and frankly this is an iterating process of discovery whenever you try new things.Be patient and start slow.Start by mirroring the stupid simple stuff until you are able to recall facts and the basics.Then practice explaining the ideas or concepts behind what you are doing. Also, predict and test experiments to facilitate assimilation; e.g. what would happen if I DO or DONT DO something? What if it’s slightly different?Progress into applying your knowledge into solving simple and complex problems. A simple problem is one where you directly apply some knowledge. A complex one is where you first need to decompose into smaller problems, then build up to the bigger more general solution.When you are comfortable with those, the next cognitive level is analysis. Draw connections among ideas, compare them against others.After that you’ll be able to confidently evaluate options and alternatives and justify your decisions (and if proven wrong, then you’re still learning more).Finally, after all that, you’ll become able to synthesize all that knowledge and skills with fluency so that most of your efforts are focused on designing and creating solutions.Practicing the basics, over and over, will naturally put you in a position to apply what you learned and eventually reach mastery.This framework can help you charter your learning journey—yet the key remains being patient and consistent.",Ordinary_Peach_4964,2025-05-18 02:34:01,4,learnprogramming,t3_1kp4oln,False,

My family got a home PC and this helped, but I still needed to write out all my answers for tests.2. My short term memory was found to be lacking. This frustrated my parents because if I wasn't actively listening to them when they told me to do something I would literally not remember what they said, or often not even remember we had a conversation.

Programming is the one discipline where it’s actually encouraged to rely on the internet as much as you want since it would be impractical for us to remember every little detail about every language and library we use, and most programming languages and libraries have extensive documentation online.Once you are past learning the fundamental structures of code (data types, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc.) everything you want to do with code is just a few well-constructed google searches away. Learning to code is as much about learning how to do efficient research as it is about learning actual coding.I will say, having short term memory just emphasizes the need for good coding practices even more, which many beginners tend to neglect. Good coding is all about foresight, and sacrificing time in the present to save you work in the future. Make sure you take the time to write yourself clear and helpful comments at every step of the way while coding and whenever you see multiple ways of writing some code, choose the way that is easiest to read; this will save you so much mental strain down the road. You should be able to tell generally what a piece of code does just by looking at it for a few seconds, even if it’s like you’ve never seen it before.You’ll also learn there are ways of structuring your code such that you don’t have to remember how the whole system works all at once in order to understand one piece of it. This is actually one of the key tenets of object oriented design, often called “abstraction”.

Neovim is extendable with plugins (just like VSCode), and has several advantages that some people value: 1) ultra lightweight. You could probably run it smoothly on a laptop from 2010.2) It's 100% in terminal. You don't even technically need a DE or WM to run it (lightweight)3) EVERYTHING works with keyboard only. (Yes, that's technically possible with the other IDEs, but they are not built for that and you can tell. Even if you have hotkeys for everything, switching focus to another panel can be a pain in the ass alone, when compared to neovim) Not just the code editing, but the file searching, project managing, git controls, probably even database access. I am pretty good with my IDE, but I must admit, switching to a different part of the project is more clunky than it would be in neovim with a correct setup)4) It's just fun to configure.

It's not the fastest way to do it, but if you have an unordered array then you might provide the ""somehow"" as \`return max(the\_current\_number, the\_max\_so\_far)\` then by the end the the\_max\_so\_far variable has whatever the max value of the array is.Or you could have an ordered array of chapter objects that you want to output into a combined book, so the ""somehow"" is like \`return book + this\_chapter.to\_s()\`So instead of a big ugly loop with temp variables you could just do \`book\_text = chapters.reduce(string.empty, (book, chapter) => book + chapter.to\_s())\` To be clear, as with basically everything in programming, you can of course do all this without \`reduce()\`, and you just have to choose based on clarity of intent whether to use it or not.",PeteMichaud,2025-05-16 01:15:06,3,learnprogramming,t3_1knod52,False,

Hardest part of learning something new for me is being overwhelmed by so much new stuff that I don't know where to start.Anyway, hopefully this explanation of reduce will help:So you said you understand map and forEach? Perfect! You're close to understanding reduce because all 3 share one foundational behavior: Run a function on each item of the array.Now, here's how they differ:forEach: You want to just call the function for each item in the array. You don't necessarily want to do anything to the items or the array itself and you don't want to return anything.map: You want to transform each item in the array into a new value. Example: You have an array with the values 1,2,3? Use map to transform the array into a new array with the values 2,4,6. The key here is your goal is to transform the original array into a new array with new items. The new array is an array of the same length as the original. Start with 3 items in your array? You'll end with 3 items in your new array.reduce: Similarly to map, your goal is to transform the array into something else. However, that something else can be anything! With map, you return a new array. With reduce, you return a new ANYTHING. You can turn the original array into an object (most common use case) or you can return a number, string, boolean, literally whatever you want. Example: Have an array of 1,2,3?

Write a function to, I don't know, calculate the totalPrice of a list of Product objects, each with its own price ... Here's the solution, just so you know what I mean: function calculateTotalPrice(products) { let totalPrice = 0; for(const product of products) { totalPrice += product.price; } return totalPrice; } Then, when that works, write a more generic function, that doesn't know about product.price, but takes another function as a parameter, one that returns the value to add to the totalPrice. Meaning that this function should be able to calculate any total.And continue on to you have basically re-implemented .reduce with your own code.It is important that you write it yourself, using your own thinking, and not get the solution from somewhere else, because it isn't about the solution, it is about the thinking that goes into it.That is how I learned most of the array-functions (filter, map, etc.), coming from the old procedural way of thinking, I wrote my own implementation (with loads of bugs and imperfections) to understand what was going on. And the benefit of using the builtin functions, is that other people know what they mean and can read it quickly, but having to understand someone elses implementation always requires having to read a lot of code, until you realize: ah, he's just reducing!",peterlinddk,2025-05-16 08:18:14,1,learnprogramming,t3_1knod52,False,

So as much as like the command-line and keybinds, I prefer the more visual approach, where I can swap over to the mouse at certain times (for for certain workflows). I prefer VSCode (even though I program on Linux).That said, you can use Vim keybinds (and custom keybinds) in VSCode, and you can use VSCode keybinds in Vim.Overall, I'd argue that Vim will slow you down (at least at first), and you're better off trying it out later when you have some more experience under your belt. With Vim, once you get a grasp on everything you're doing, all of your macros, and map all of your keybinds perfectly... you'll be blazing fast.

But getting there is HARD and, debatably, acute speed isn't a huge priority when it comes to writing code, or writing quality code.I'd say, in regards to people I've worked with who use Vim, they're typically ""not faster than me at all"" or they're something like ""10% faster than me at best"".

Classes, modules, folders, packages, microservices, clusters are just different ways of organizing functions. The bad architect (let's call them John) looks towards options higher up in that list, when putting a bunch of files into a well-named folder would be just as clean.2. Functions with side-effects need special attention: A pure function will rarely cause scalability issues, a function that upserts into a database will. Learning to segregate side effects is a skill that takes a lifetime to learn, but it really helps if you don't have to use @Transcational 8 times during a HTTP request's execution. The other day I sped up a messy procedure by 500% just by moving all db lookups to one place and parallelizing them, John would have held architecture meetings for the next half year to make the service with 20 monthly users ""multi-instance ready"" instead of identifying the bottleneck.3. Bounded-everything. To know how much scale you need, know how many resources you need. That's easy when you write code that needs a fixed amount of RAM, or that runs in a fixed amount of time. John does `database.readAll()` until one day the server crashes, and he gets pat on the back when he fixes the issue after a two-day outage. (Turns out the service was not multi-instance ready and they all crashed)4. Distributed systems are HARD.

Now this is a broad model of how a ui program works, there are many other paradigms used, however in event driven architectures it can mostly be boiled down to mvc or model view control. With games or any ui program with a simulation info does kind of loop in the simulation/model. But this still doesn't really break the previous statement, how paradox games work is in the event handling side of things it is basically 2 steps repeated over and over: get players input then compute new state, when one of the players is lagging what happens is its basically blocking on the get players input stage, the simulation doesn't look at real time it looks at simulations slices (ticks), and so to the simulation everything comes in at the same time, but at the get players input we know that isn't true.

Instead the game just runs slower and it takes longer to pass time in the game. Rimworld has a similar system where it aims for a set tick amount per second and throttles to a slower tick speed to try and prevent lag by slowing the game down.Lets say your cpu can handle 100 calculations per tick. In essence what happens is if over the course of the game you go from 100 calculations per tick up to 1000 calculations per tick over the course of a game, then the tick speed will get 10x slower by the end and you shouldn't in theory see your computer drop below 60 fps",TheSassyfrasLife,2025-05-15 21:18:54,2,learnprogramming,t1_msioc9j,True,

I'm pretty sure there's some bottom floor to the rock speed so instead of lowering the speed any more, the game lags2.) there's some fundamental problem in the Clausewitz engine paradox games made that causes the game to lag when hitting that lower bound where it processes stack up causing lag. I assume this is bc the CPU usage is wildly inconsistent second to second due to a possible lack of multi threading engine architecture, so the games frequently max out cpu usage at 100%. This is why the lag can sometimes disappear when lowering game speed by one level even though tick speed didn't change.RimWorld does not have this problem in my experience and only really experiences lag from running out of memory (or poorly optimized mods).",TheSassyfrasLife,2025-05-16 05:34:16,1,learnprogramming,t1_msizmrq,True,

What does a falling ball do?* A ball has a position *and a velocity** that velocity starts at zero* downwards velocity increases over time* when colliding with a plane, that velocity is reflected perpendicularly to the plane (possibly with some loss)What you've got is like a motionless ball that repeatedly teleports since you don't have any velocity information.

ms26vtm,"Recently I freelanced for a UI-focused company, and I picked up some interesting practices from how they structure their frontend work. They use Tailwind for styling and Next.js for everything else. Here’s a breakdown of their approach:**Start with a clear theme**They rely on design tokens to keep things simple and consistent across the UI. It helps centralize color, spacing, and typography decisions early on.**Component architecture: two clear categories**- Templates:These are dumb components. They just display what’s passed in via props. No state, no logic. In Next.js, these are implemented as server components.- Traditional components:These do the heavy lifting: handle state, run computations, etc. They render templates and manage the layout. - **Avoid prop drilling by leaning into composition**Most components accept a children prop. That, combined with smart layout components, makes it easy to nest and compose without passing props down five layers.**Type safety everywhere**They use TypeScript, and schemas are defined using Zod.Types are derived from the Zod schemas, so you get strong typing and runtime validation in one go.**Always validate backend data**First thing they do with any data from the backend: run it through Zod. If it doesn’t match the schema, it gets rejected. This protects the app from unexpected API changes or malformed data.**Some of my own preferences that I mix in:**- For complex state, I like using a reducer. It can grow big, but having all actions in one place keeps things maintainable. Plus, reducers are easy to unit test.- For simple state, I lean on signals (when available). They’re lightweight and reactive, perfect for local UI state.- I’ve also grown to like the “crash fast” philosophy: use assertions to catch incorrect assumptions early.

Once they do that, the accounts `confirmed` flag is changed to `true`. To make this better, the confirmation code (which may be part of the confirmation link), can be stored in a table linked to the account with a set timeout.This is the account verification process.The password rest works in a similar way. When a user clicks the ""forgot password"" link, an Email with a reset-link / code is sent out. The code is stored in a reset database, with the record linking code and account id and having a timeout.

Very much like being an engineer or an architect. If you've got the aptitude, it is a solid career, but it isn't worth pursing ""just to get a job"" type of a thing.If you're just looking for a job to improve your financial stituation, you might want to consider jobs that are a little less competitive, require a bit less learning, but still pay well. Everyone says ""HVAC technician"" but I don't know how true that actually is. I've got a bunch of family members who are electricians though, and they've always done pretty well. If you can handle bodily fluids, nursing is always in demand. I think the best balance between job security and decent pay is to get into a field that requires both brains and physical presence on site - needing to do some schooling to get in filters out the applicant pool some and drives wages up, but needing to actually be there to work with your hands/body means you're way less vulnerable to automation or being off-shored.",PoMoAnachro,2025-05-15 18:11:18,3,learnprogramming,t3_1knenjo,False,

msk37pm,">**IT and marketing seem boring/too social, but programming seems like it might be too difficult for me. I have learning difficulties and struggle a lot with math, and I tried learning web dev on my own twice and even the basics were hell for me.**Simple answer is no. I understand it might sound harsh and there will be people who feel we should say yes to you and send you on a boondoggle. But in all honesty this is not the path for you.1) It is a VERY competitive field. If you're struggling to learn the absolute basics you are going to drown here.2) It requires good social skills as much as anything else. Developer jobs are not Hollywood cases of a dude in a basement. You need to be engaged with the business. Able to drive conversations about needs and requirements. To provide feedback etc. So do not go down this route thinking that it is some easy path in that regard.There are many paths in life. Dev is not for everyone, and if we take your comments here at face value then it is not for you. Have a look at what options there are that better suit your interests. Regardless you will have to develop your social skills. There is pretty much zero exception there, so if I were you I would work on addressing those first.Then start exploring options. Careers are hard because often we don't know what we don't know. Which leads people to aim for the high profile stuff like software div / engineer / lawyer.

As others have mentioned too, the SLT executives also don't pay for quality execution and productization either (UI/UX, actual internal tooling, Quality assurance testing, organizational software to actually help PMs and engineers, etc.).It's not just being cheap on Total Compensation. Internally there's very little travel and expenses budgets, morale events are gone and often paid by managers, no free food or snacks, the equipment is cheap, internal IT is garbage tier, we had to fight to get replacement computers. Also, those bonuses were structured in a way to be weaponized. You NEVER hit max bonus and more often hit midpoint or less if the manager just disliked you.People like to joke about Amazon's ""frugality"" leadership principle. But there's a difference between the definition of frugal (pay for just enough) and Microsoft's cheapness.Edit: Let me add one more cheap thing. Microsoft just had their 50th Anniversary.

msrwkws,"Investors want profit, which is revenue minus costs. Software needs developers, which are expensive. The big promise of AI is to drastically slash software development costs. There are a couple of ways for doing that:* By allowing less skilled folks to create good-enough software without having to pay experienced developers. Here, AI tools compete with the low-code/no-code industry. Nothing new.* By making good developers more productive. This is where AI-based code completion comes in.* By having the AI system independently solve high-level tasks. This is the dream of “agentic AI”.It doesn't matter for AI companies if there will be fewer mid-skilled developers buying their subscriptions. A client company wants to get some amount of software development done. In theory, it can achieve this by some mix of humans and AI tools. Choosing some amount of AI is an economic win-win situation if AI-productivity is more cost-effective than human-productivity. But this means the price cap of an AI tool subscription isn't hundreds of dollars per month, but whatever it would cost to hire another human developer. And good developers are quite expensive.Now the neat thing for AI companies is that they don't have to realize these productivity gains themselves. They just have to convince other businesses that there *could* be productivity gains using these tools, that everyone else is doing it, and that your investors will start asking questions if you don't also jump on the hype train.In a gold rush, sell shovels.The problem here is that AI tools aren't cost-effective (yet). They are generally not cost-effective for users due to quite uneven quality, and they're not sold at-cost by the tool providers, because GPUs are so dang expensive. Currently, the field is propelled by the belief that the economics will work out soon:trade_mark:.Personally, I'm fairly relaxed about this. AI-written code is generally well below my skill-level (especially when taking architecture and design concerns into account), and I don't see a plausible path for AI to catch up. Ever-bigger models with ever-larger context windows cost exponentially more, which could mean that the productivity:cost break-even point for high-skill activities like software development is never reached before the tool providers go bankrupt. There are also systematic problems, like software projects having a lot of implicit and oral context that is not available to an LLM.AI is probably here to stay, but software developers are some of the last folks who have to worry about this.",latkde,2025-05-17 10:56:23,119,cscareerquestions,t3_1kopoca,False,

ms62j0d,"I think in some instances it is just never having enough money and constantly moving the goalposts for yourself. Having said that, there are two things I tend to think about:1. Stagnating is a great way to jeopardize your financial future. You stay at the $170K company with a chill job, you don't keep advancing in your career, and then in 10 years when the company decides to lay you off... now what? Recruiters want to see growth, and you will just be able to say ""I've been in the same spot for like 10 years"". Especially in an ageist industry that evolves quickly, you really don't want to find yourself obsolete at 40.2. Inflation. When I graduated college 20 years ago, $100K was a lot of money. Now you need $160K to have the purchasing power that $100K did back then. So if inflation is going up higher than your salary (which is likely if you don't seek advancement opportunities), you might gradually lose purchasing power - and pretty substantially.3. Even with lifestyle creep, you will often find yourself accumulating wealth in other ways as your salary goes up. Bigger 401K, the bigger house you bought gets a bunch of equity + appreciation in it, etc.4. Accumulating extra experience early can actually land you in better work life balance later.

They hired you for the role, and asking for additional money to do the job they hired you for isn't going to go over well. I think they did make a mistake not hiring someone with leadership experience and putting them in a lead role, but they think they can get that on the market, and it's a reasonable expectation.",justUseAnSvm,2025-05-13 03:13:36,126,cscareerquestions,t3_1klbjft,False,

Now apply the exemplar pattern to feature B,""And it would do a good job of correctly implementing the pattern and saved a substantial amount of time. It'd get things wrong here and there and always needed a clean up, but overall it did about as well as a decent intern.And then I started giving a little more latitude. I wrote out a requirements document for a new feature, got it to analyze the code base again, feed it the requirements document and worked through it with it.It did a reasonable job of putting together code that met the requirements. I did catch it trying to cheat on the unit tests, very badly. Something it definitely learnt from the unit tests in its training data. It did hallucinate a few things and left some half implemented code it had started and then deserted lying around. The worst thing I caught it doing was going of and off and making changes to completely unrelated code that would've broken things.But overall, it's output was mediocre AF. It was messy, convoluted, had nonsensical functions it had added and forgotten about, barely conformed to the patterns required.So next session, I loaded it up and ask it to review the code base, it does so and comes back with ""Areas of the code are well designed and implemented, with clean code and adheres to best practices, but feature XYZ contains numerous errors, technical debt and fails to meet the same stand as the rest of the code"". Feature XYZ was the feature I'd asked it to implement. So at least it was able to identify that it's output was garbage. I did let it have a go at clean up it's mess, but it just made it worse to the point I had to roll back all the changes fir the session and then went and cleaned it up myself. So no time was saved that day.So lesson here is, just like with juniors, if you give it a well crafted exemplar to learn from, it'll do an acceptable job of implementing code  based on that. But, just like with juniors, if you give it a requirements document and turn it loose on a new feature, it'll get the job mostly done, but it'll be ugly as all hell and need a fair bit of work to get it over the line.But where the junior wins out is in when you send the work back, show them the exemplar and get them to rework things, the junior won't usually make things worse.",Venotron,2025-05-17 17:45:18,8,cscareerquestions,t3_1koxpk4,False,

The market is tough right now and you're going to have to suck it up and basically throw everything you have at this if you truly want it. Each thing your do here increases your chances of success: Before interviewing- leetcode hard, follow neetcode roadmap to fill in theoretical gaps in knowledge, once you have an interview focus on problems given from that company leading up to interview- time every leetcode problem to 40 minutes. Don't look up the answer until you finish the timer. Every single time you fail to solve a problem, work aggressively to ameliorate your weaknesses. - come up with a methodical problem solving process. Don't just change things and run them praying it works, get good at thinking about what you're going to do to your program and similating the output before even typing. Get good at running your own test cases against your code in your head rather than relying on printf debugging- get as many swe interviewers you can to give you mock interviews and giving you mock interviews- fill any gaps in your text stack that you may have (frontend should be angular, react, nextjs and typescript, backend should be Java , spring boot, postgres, mongo, redis)- brush up on AWS knowledge of core services including networking, security and databases, - build example projects that actually work and document them very well on your GitHub and publish live links to your portfolio site and GitHub. This is a good chance to combine both stack knowledge gaps and AWS knowledge gaps all in one shot- create a portfolio siteSomewhere in the middle of the above after some leetcode and projects are under your belt:- dont be as stringent about pay- expand the set of rules you're searching for (i.e. SWE, SDE, SDET, full stack, backend, frontend, SRE, ops, devops, etc...)- be willing to relocate- get as many swe interviewers reading your resume as you can- ensure your indeed, LinkedIn and resume are fully beefed up and peer-reviewed- don't just cold apply. That's completely useless. Cold message recruiters, hiring managers, team members, random recruiters / hiring managers on LinkedIn, connect with family members, old colleagues, old peers, anyone and everyone. Don't seem too desperate, don't ask strangers for referrals. - always smile, be punctual, dress appropriately, take your time, make the interviewers feel comfortable like it's a conversation and not an interview, show no ego whatsoever, appear extremely eager to learn, admit when you don't know something rather than guess and embarrass yourself, have a list of thought provoking and insightful questions to dazzle interviewers, and AGGRESSIVELY ask for feedback and FERVENTLY correct all of your mistakes every single interview, after enough interviews there will be no more mistakes left. Most importantly...- keep your head up, realize that if you keep trusting in the process you will come out ahead.

msk2mhc,"It is much more a consequence of the company values.Bad work culture and bad work/life balance aren't the same thing than having high operational target metrics.Amazon has an intentional culture of employees being always working, always tethered to operations, and committing to die at the job. They make you feel bad for taking more than a week of vacation in a year of 12 hours work days. That's more a correlation than a causation but Bezos doesn't see it that way and since he's writing the checks, that's how it works. This is not specific to AWS and affects other areas at Amazon which are less tied to operations. Regardless they built the narrative that such shitty conditions are simply the result of the nature of the job, that if you're not always on the edge of burnout, the business will crumble and the competition will overtake them. Most people have known nothing else so they believe it.Other sectors and countries have laws so that demanding jobs don't ruin the life of people. For obvious reasons, truckers cannot drive more than X hours per day. Airline pilots must observe rest times, etc. Because obviously pushing these limits isn't good. It doesn't mean we can't have trucks and airplanes, it means we had to find ways to make it work and compensate for the demanding conditions of such jobs, often in the form of regulations against abuses. Companies still find ways to be competitive.In some other countries if you are on-duty you need to be compensated for that even if the pager doesn't ring. Being available for the job is considered a work related duty so it needs to be compensated. If you join the call for an incident the law requires the employer to clock hours in addition to your regular pay -- even if you're not an hourly employee. On holidays you get up to double pay. And their online services aren't more or less reliable.The US tech has close to no worker protection laws so the only things that retains companies to crush employees is how long they want to keep them and how easily they can find a job elsewhere. That somewhat works if the job market is balanced and companies are compelled to watch wlb to be attractive. This is often made easier by the general American narrative that government is a bad thing, that politics are here to trick us not to protect us, so employees hope for their company to do the right thing by themselves and rarely think about forms of civil action.",JonTheSeagull,2025-05-16 02:08:53,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1knc2kx,False,

It's only a matter of time.With that knowledge, I hold onto a good WLB for as long as it stays good. I have no interest in job hopping just to make some more money, I already make plenty. When the WLB is good, I couldn't care less if I'm underpaid. I know full well those small 1-5% annual raises don't keep me up with the market, and I'm perfectly OK with that.

Staying at this company can increase job security too. Im sure many people your age are job-hopping to more money but more stressful jobs. Your company may appreciate how you stayed, give you huge promotions and when it comes down to layoffs they wont consider laying off a person who has been there 10+ years and knows the system and someone who everybody loves.

AI, no AI, it doesn't matter, the buck has to stop with someone, and that's a variety of managers.I do think there is truth to your statement, though. At least at my company, we have no team level managers. I run a team, and I'm a senior engineer. The next layer of management is on the ""team of teams"" level. I do like this, and although a lot of project/product management falls on me when it comes to planning and execution, it's a lot easier when the managers just trust me on the technical details, empower me with a team to get the job done and the right set of people to answer my questions, and just step back and let me do my thing.In my role, the managers just worry about goals, and how we allocate resources to go achieve them. For me, that's easy to deal with: everything we do must be towards some goal, I can get that done with the team, and management makes sure that impact/effort ratio remains high.After all, what I want for everyone on my team is to have a good, impactful review period which translates into good reviews. Instead of fighting management, I get a lot further by thinking of them as partners in the process, where trust is a two way street, and we are on the same team. Maybe that's niave, but the only way to be trusted to build anything significant, or lead, is to have a manager agree to the spend.",justUseAnSvm,2025-05-14 19:29:29,8,cscareerquestions,t3_1kmngzs,False,

Most of it was as a developer at a boutique consulting firm, and I stuck with the same client for about 3 years, a large at home healthcare company. Then bounced around other clients for a little over a year before we had a bad quarter and a headcount reduction. I got another job within the month building business software at a major auto manufacturer. All that said, here's something I wish I knew 5 years ago. The technical stuff, coding, architecture, deployments, are NOT the toughest part of the job. There's a good chance that coding is the easiest part of your work. It's working with and meeting the often inconsistent expectations of clients, product managers, stakeholders, and business analysts that will make your job hard. But, the good thing about that, is the better you learn to understand these people's perspectives and speak their language instead of nerd gibberish, you will be so much more valuable to your team. It's one thing to be a good coder, but when you're a good coder who can get the non-technical decision makers on your side, you become the person who GETS THINGS DONE. I inherited my current position from someone who was a good developer, but a really poor communicator. He didn't set expectations and just said whatever he needed to so people would stop asking him to explain. He developed a notorious reputation in the other departments as someone who didn't make sense and couldn't deliver. The tough part was he actually was a good developer, but people who didn't trust him tried to get in his way. Long story short, even though you're a developer, educate yourself in the business as a whole. Ask people from other departments about what they do and what their pain points are. Take their perspectives into account when it's appropriate and let them know that you're doing that (in a humble way, of course).

If you don't know something, anything that you don't know how to do/don't get/understand, ask for help. Do a bit of research first but do not spend more than an hour. If you are clueless on something even after an hour, just ask for help\- When you have learned something new, take notes on it\- Work on challenging tickets. It's the best way to learn things quickly\- If you are working with a tech stack/tools you are not familiar with/you are new to it, work on a project that uses the tech stack/tools\- Before you do something like make a PR for instance, ask what the company's convention/process is. Sometimes they may want you to write a PR in a certain way as an example. This goes for documentation, git commits, code as well. Pretty much anything where you need to do something for the company\- Don't focus so much on documenting things when you are working on a ticket. Document for you, not for the company. But if the senior dev asks you to document something, then document. E.g., say you are working on something new, don't spend so much time neatly documenting an activity diagram or a sequence diagram. Focus on the dev work. If the company wants you to create a documentation, then document it. Not all documentation are useful for the company\- Don't share anything personal/personal life issues. Colleagues may form negative opinions about you. This is like fitting into the company politics, if you don't fit, then you may be seen undesirable from a social point of view. Just keep it positive and professional\- Company may have certain events or even activities like weekly soccer or board games. They may even have an internal committee where they are responsible for holding team related events/activities. Join them to maintain and improve relationships with the people in your company\- At least when I did my internship, they valued efficiency.

They cover a lot of the same ground as LeetCode problems but in a more theoretical sense. As for actual practice, start by trying to design a simple system like a blog comment section or a user authentication system - it'll help you get your feet wet with thinking through scalability and performance.If you want to dive deeper, I've used an AI tool that listens to system design interview questions and suggests responses in real time.

Then you can learn why Dynamodb might be a better option over Redis or something, even if you've never used Redis.If you are not currently employed and are still a new grad looking for an entry position - usually system design isn't a part of the interview process because it's hard without on-field experience.",drugsbowed,2025-05-18 22:06:08,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1kph6i5,False,
