nc76w6m,"Well, its important to remember that the Kimball and Inmon standards were developed in the 80s. I think there’s three key trends that have happened in ensuing decades that explain the mess we’re in today:First and most obviously, computing has gotten exponentially more powerful. A big part of the reason people cared so much was because they literally had to. Nowadays, no one gives a crap, and if you’re a conspiracy theorist, you could even argue that medallion architecture is being perpetuated by cloud providers as a way to extract more money from their clients. **Quick edit based on some responses:** I’m definitely not saying there aren’t any positive aspects to medallion architecture and ELT supplanting ETL. But whether it’s *necessary* is a different question and one that, IMO, businesses should really think long and hard about rather than just defaulting to whatever the FAANG companies are doing or whatever the vendor’s recommendation is. Maybe I’m just old, but I can recall a time when the bronze layer lived in an FTP site (lol) and the Gold layer didn’t exist, and yet companies were still able to answer business questions and turn a profit. Second, and somewhat related, technology just moves so fast that you’re migrating platforms every couple years, in some cases. There’s a sense that tech debt is unavoidable, and the Agile/MVP approach exacerbates this as well. So no one really cares as much about getting things right the first time, because you know you’ll have to rebuild it anyway. Third, while the concept of “data” has been democratized and de-mystified quite a bit in the ensuing four decades, the actual database part of it still has somewhat of a barrier to entry. So I think part of the issue is that “Can I get this in Excel to do my own analysis?” has become such a ubiquitous question that you can’t really say no to it, leading to a bunch of bespoke OBTs that aren’t documented particularly well, if at all. IMO modeling is still important, but it’s largely because of BI/Data Viz software adoption and not database constraints themselves anymore.",No_Introduction1721,2025-09-03 14:31:47,84,dataengineering,t3_1n7fu2f,False,

nc7vx8r,"ooof what a wonderful topic to discuss... shame its not a Friday as I would have more time for a reply. Im being serious this is a ""pub"" kinda question that sadly I dont have collegues that share the same spark to discuss with.This industry has evolved so fast that terms have been highly convoluted and become some what meaningless. When I began my career Kimball was king and the data mart with at least star schemas were the expected minimum. Largely because of the limits of what we had (relational databases with indexes). To get things to work you had to thoroughly understand the requirements, plan and model accordingly.Compute and Storage are cheaper than beer (sadly), with that has come with the more lazy approach in favour of quick (although unstable) returns. We follow agile, we don't like long winded projects and if your query doesn't work then just add more compute.With this a generation has been bombarded with buzzword bingo. We have data lakes, lake houses, and other infrastructure terms. We also have data mesh, fabric and other strategic ideas that i always feel are more idealised than realistic. A person can only retain so much and indeed the core ideas of warehousing have disappeared. I asked someone if they would consider implementing surrogate keys, he asked me if I had made that up.It does feel like we are re learning alot of the problems that we had in the 80s just in different guises. I feel that maybe were just old enough to notice the turn of the wheel. What was learned will be forgotten and re learned again.Modelling will always be important, but modelling relies of having some key information.... like what do you actually want to achieve? What are you measuring.... I think most of this sub will admit.... actual requirements are always few and far between.

They don't want to talk about it because they don't have a solution to make it more productive. So, instead of admitting that it's a hard problem and they mostly work on the easy problems, they instead just try not to talk about it.They *should* talk about it - since it impacts performance, data quality, query functionality, usability, and operational and development complexity. And practitioners should also talk about it for the same reason. But this field has always been marketing-driven, and data modeling is difficult. So, they don't talk about it like we did 25 years ago.But that doesn't mean nobody is.

nc90qmp,"As a DW professional with two decades in the domain, I’ve lived through the transition data modeling and data architecture have gone through during those times. When I started my professional career in data, a 2-year Datawarehouse build-out project was the norm. We used to do rigorous requirements gathering (for months!), hire a multitude of skilled people to document the business processes, track down data sources and cover every inch of the enterprise reporting needs on paper. Then the laborious phase of ETL, physical data modeling, test runs, and QA will ensue. Finally some BI team would develop the static reports and before you know it, it’s already 2 years gone!Nowadays, every single business comes pre-wired to collect and move streams of raw data all over the place. Costs of data storage have significantly dropped so dumping it all in into a cheap cloud storage is a no-brainer and it’s an acceptable approach. Storage and compute are now segregated so no upfront unutilized servers anymore. I guess the fundamental idea behind serving data analytics has switched from building robust, audited and reliable DW architectures to just-in-time data modeling for a quick turnaround to answer a certain business question ASAP. It also allows for incremental question-answering with the same just-in-time analytics approach instead of asking business stakeholders exactly what questions they’d need answered for next 10 years and expecting them to have an answer for you. I’d say it’s just a paradigm shift that has acceptable flaws with upside advantages that outweigh the said flaws (i.e. lack of emphasis on the traditional DW approaches we built our careers around in the past).Edit: also wanted to mention how the term “datawarehouse” has now been usurped by the vendors to mean “snowflake, redshift or GCP”. Not the Kimball or Innmon style datawarehouses we used to build. In fact, Bill Innmon (he’s in my LinkedIn network) wrote a very expressive LI post about this a year ago. Now I see even him kind of coming to terms with the fact that the old school DW as a industry and a domain is dead.",DJ_Laaal,2025-09-03 19:51:44,7,dataengineering,t3_1n7fu2f,False,
nc7pvbg,"Data modelling crowd knowledge has dwindled over the years because of a few factors:\- in the late 70 to the early-90's, large orgs tended to develop their own in-house applications for everything (ERP, Finance/Accounting...etc) so there needed to be practitioners who could design stable, well considered data models which supported OLTP applications. With the advent of 'off the shelf' solutions like JDE, Peoplesoft, SAP...etc the need to design your own models fell off a cliff. While a BI/DW model is designed differently, it was generally the people with existing OLTP model knowledge that went down this path as well.\- As others have stated in this thread, 3NF or better modelling was a means to help squeeze the best performance out of hardware solutions. This is not as much a concern now. \- The 'need for speed' (AGILE) has caused our industry to get lazy and not worry about design.

The follow-up questions are especially important because that's where the complexity will come out.You'll need to back this up with good theory which can come from a few placesFor textbooks I really like T-SQL fundementals by Itzik Ben-Gan. It's focused on SQL Server, but it covers a lot of generic SQL, and it has a really good explanation of the core concepts. Things like three-value predicate logic make a lot more sense with his explanations. I generally recommend people at least read the first chapter. I think you can find a free PDF somewhere but I just bought it on amazon (almost exactly 10 years ago!)Websites like Leetcode CAN be good because of the ability to compare your answers to others, but it's important not to blindly trust that someone else's approach is better. If you see faster solutions, look up the techniques they are using and try to understand if it's actually an improvement or just or just a hack for that specific dataset.For performance, Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann provides a lot of the theoretical foundation you'll need to understand how to think about queries, you'll need to supplement this with resources specific to the database you are working in.

Data engineers are really really well paid. On the stress spectrum, it’s also on the lower end. It’s also one where a lot of self-teaching is still a valid pathway forward.There are other IT roles where the entire company is down and you’re stuck working days straight to fix it. Or security professionals, when the company is under attack 24 hours a day and everyone is looking at them to fix it and then blaming them for what happened.In your case, I would say much of the stress is coming from layoffs, and a management that does not really understand AI and what it’s used for. Bad leadership looks at AI as a way to reduce headcount. Good leadership looks at it as a productivity tool. It should be helping to get more work done and a more streamlined, quality product.Also, AI should not be replacing the templating and standards. That’s up to the lead to come up with and enforce.I do think AI is giving a lot of people some existential crisis issues. However, I think using it is going to be required for almost all roles. Personally, I treat just like any other tool, like a spreadsheet, or a calculator, or a web search. Not using it means I am gimping myself, so why would I fight it and try and use the old way? The AI can’t think for itself. That’s where humans come in and will never be replaced.

Of course, AI is not going to take jobs away. they will change and evolve. But we're not obliged to like this new thing it's evolving into. A lot of people will say that they're OK with AI taking out the coding part, so that they can focus on the architecture part. And that's ok too!!!! We're all ice cream (DE) enjoyers here.. some people like the chocolate flavor, others prefer strawberry… and I think of all this as AI having taken some flavors off the market. Those who didn’t like the extinct ones obviously rejoice and don’t even understand the bleakness of losing your favorite ice cream flavor from the shelves… It's perfectly ok to just not like your work anymore, you know. Everything you've learned in life *will* be useful to you somehow. I'm getting ready to go back to college and pursue a career closer to my theoretical education (econ & finance), and even if that means low/no income for a period, a job that will no longer be remote, or one that doesn’t demand as much from me, it’s better to pursue this rocky road than to live with a feeling of eternal “meh,” which seems to be your case too.

ncxxsbn,">the tech is no where near the point of replacing multiple tenured engineers, at least in our situation.AI is the ""zeitgeist"" of the times. Unfortunately we're currently living through a period of FAFO, where it's normal to tear down status quo, including gov't regulations for novelty because going viral is where the money is. The same thing happened with the blockchain craze, and the people who understood the tech were right to point out that all you need was immutable dbs to solve most of the use cases that were used to hype the trending tech. I feel the same as you do, but companies will need to learn the hard way, because the world of VCs have convinced companies large and small that the only way to be worth more or to enhance productivity is to jump to the next novel tech that is going viral - This works great for start ups attempting to pump up their valuations, but not so great for companies that are larger with processes and governance in place. This sort of behavior continues to degrade products, and Google is a great example of product degradation. Even Klarna restarted it's hiring because their jump in to AI that is still premature hurt their business operations. You're just early in the game to realize this, but the fact is the hype will keep at it until AI matures and is productionized properly, or the next trending tech starts attracting investor capital. It's all a game, but that does not mean that the pleasure you gained from building data pipelines no longer gives you satisfaction. You just need to find other corps that are mindful of assessing premature tech before jumping head first into the latest and greatest - there is a reason companies like Apple and Costco maintained their lead this long.",BoinkDoinkKoink,2025-09-07 17:55:05,3,dataengineering,t3_1navs38,False,

It simplifies a lot of the tediousness of using DBT with Airflow (v2.9). It is easy to generate your DBT assets and those can be linked with your other dagster assets.The main difference is the paradigm. Dagster does not have jobs/tasks at the forefront. Jobs are a process to group functional assets together i.e. you have 1 ingestion process and 3 DBT models to generate your analytics table and you can ran all of them at once, on schedule. Dagster uses data assets at the forefront, which are what the name suggests, your data as an asset. You do not think of the process of creating the data as you think of the final data product. I ike the lineage feature, which allows you to see how all your assets are interconnected. You can define a job with a schedule for any cut of your lineage graph.Dagster is also more pythonic than Airflow. You use python's best practices when writing your processes.Testing is much simpler with the integrated 'dagster dev' command which quickly spins up a local instance for you to test your pipelines. Can write a lot more about the difference but I am at work now :-D.To conclude, both are good tools (haven't tried Airflow v3+) but for different needs. Dagster is better for companies where data lineage is vital, whereas Airflow is better for automation of tasks.

For example when we need seperate retries, resources or parallelism.For example:- Task one: triggers a lambda to extracts data from an API & stores in S3- Task two: lambda that fetches the file from S3 & loads it into a Snowflake table.- Task Three: Python operator within Airflow that triggers dbt run (could also have this in a lambda).Then on the topic of passing data between tasks. Using the above example, passing the s3 uri from task one to task two would be a great use of xcom. Here, we're mainly passing metadata (row counts, S3 keys, schema versions, URLs, run decisions).We'll typically want to use object storage for larger payloads (CSVs, json, etc).",-adam_,2025-09-03 17:10:43,13,dataengineering,t3_1n7k1wv,False,

I prefer to pack things into a single task. I only break it into smaller tasks to keep runtime below 30 mins if possible. Or when one part of the task is more prone to failure than others.

By this I mean that it will be completely different from one document to the next. And there’s no particular reason to expect any record to overlap with any other.Even if there is a subset of your data which really does fit this description, you can still allow for it in Postgres with the use of the jsonb column type which others have mentioned.But from what you’ve described, your data probably is very similar and predictable from one record to the next. All the personnel are presumably going to have names and IDs and other common properties. In this context, you are giving up a lot by using a document store, such as the ability to reliably query the data, to enforce rules that maintain quality and integrity, and to optimise for certain use cases.

I would not have been able to write that code in Rust myself. I'm a very experienced software engineer, but I had written maybe 10 lines of Rust in my life. But with Claude's help its really very nice.The key to getting good quality code out of Claude is not that different from getting good code out of people:- unit tests- automated linting- manually specify function type signatures where it matters- have Claude run the tests and the linter after every change, and then have it fix all the problems it finds.- actually read the resulting code, make sure it makes sense, and make Claude refactor where it gets messy.In the end it worked great, and the code was very readable. This was very exciting because using a conventional JSON parser in the conventional way was just not going to work at all.But it was a little slow. I told Claude to optimize for performance. It came up with about 10 recommendations. I told it to implement the top 6 that I thought would make a big difference.

nceuw3t,"Firstly, you are asking a good question. You're trying to get a benchmark and basically a decent KPI. Secondly, the answer to your question hardly exists. I've seen people called a Sr DE with 2 years of experience as a DE, Ive seen someone called a Lead DE because they moved from a Lead DBA role to their first DE role. I know a person in consulting who is just a DE and has been a DE or SWE for 15 years. He is far better at coding that I am, and makes more money, but doesn't have the same level of title as others with far less skills. Myself, I spent my first year writing code, building pipelines, fixing bugs and closing tickets. Then everything changed and I am now running teams of implementation partners to build out enterprise projects. Nowadays, the only coding I do is to review PRs. I draw up architecture, work cross functionally with other teams to solution things, and tell my teams what all needs to be done with some guidance on how to do it. Someone else at a different company would need to work 10 years before being trusted to do what I do now. My job title will change to Sr DE next year per my manager. And I'll have 2 years of DE experience at that point, and a year of that is barely technical. For a standard 3rd year DE, if one even exists, I would start to expect a little more autonomy. Learn to make decisions. Start figuring out and proposing architecture. Start mentoring younger DEs and try to lead some small projects if you aren't already. By this point, you shouldn't need to be told what to do on a project, you should be able to identify what needs to be done, and work to implement it. A big thing is that you should probably at least start working with other teams on cross functional projects. Begin thinking about business value of various projects. I learned, albeit slowly, that maintaining collaborative relationships with other teams is vastly more valuable than transactional relationships. They are more complicated to manage, but it is the only approach I've seen work to actually get things done.

ncqqeb7,"First off, I have to say I'm genuinely curious, how did you land a DE role without an IT background? That’s seriously impressive. Many folks on this sub will tell you that DE isn't an entry-level position, so you must have done something right to get your foot in the door.Regarding your question, it's smart to focus on the fundamentals. It’s easy to get lost in the sea of specific ""data engineering"" tools, but they all build on a few core IT concepts. My advice would be to focus on these areas for the next six months.1. The first thing I'd focus on is the programming basics. Since you're using Python, I would go deep on that. Don't just learn syntax, but really try to grasp the fundamentals so you can solve problems with it. Do a few mini-projects in pure Python to make the concepts stick. This will be your foundation for everything else.2. Next, you need to become very comfortable with SQL. It’s the language of data, and you'll be using it constantly. Understand what it is, get the basic syntax down, and then really practice with it. Microsoft has some great sample datasets like AdventureWorks that are perfect for learning things like joins and aggregations.3. While you're learning those, the third crucial piece is Git. It doesn't matter if your company uses GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket; the principles are the same. You absolutely need to understand the basic workflow of making a branch, committing your changes, and merging them. It's how all modern tech teams collaborate. As a bonus, look into what a simple CI/CD pipeline does, maybe with something like GitHub Actions.4. Finally, try to get a basic understanding of one cloud provider. It doesn’t matter which one—AWS, Azure, or GCP. I'd probably stick with AWS since it’s the most common right now. You don't need to be an expert, but learn the core concepts. Studying for one of the associate-level certifications is a great way to get a structured overview.If you can get a good handle on these things by your sixth month, you'll have the solid IT foundation you need for this role. Only then would I start worrying about the more advanced, specific DE concepts.

Database structures: Whether you're using on premise servers or cloud services, look up documentation for those platforms and look at some videos to get an overview of how they store and process data.3. Pipelines and job scheduling: Learn about which service(s) are used to create data pipelines and schedule jobs and how they work.4. Version control: Learn about the codebase you're working in, what coding standards they have (rules for writing sql queries, DDL, DML, dags, etc....) and how to use github and your IDE (probably VScode).I would start by learning what's most relevant to your day to day work and then learn more about each area as you go.

ncvr5oh,"It's interesting feedback Whooster. There was an implementation Arrow2 which I found more ergonomic than Arrow-RS initially, which is now forked into Polars-Arrow and backs the Polars project in Rust. However, that merged work into Arrow-RS, and I hear the team invested time learning from the earlier mistakes.In both cases, without going too far down the rabbit hole - both implementations use a Rust concept dynamic dispatch, which makes typing in the IDE disappear, and Rust type downcasting to be required, which personally, I find awkward to use. This also blocks some automatic compiler optimisations that can automatically inline more aggressively for a faster build. The result is once you get up to a top level library like Polars, there are many layers of objects between the object you are working with and the actual data backing it. Once you are in Python, I found this really doesn't matter - it's like water into wine.However, in **Arrow-RS** (for numerical data) Rust looks like:1. **Raw allocation** (heap bytes)2. `Arc` (ref-counted ownership of allocation)3. `Buffer` (view over the bytes)4. `ArrayData` (ties buffers, length, datatype, nulls)5. `PrimitiveArray` (typed wrapper, implements `Array`)6. `ArrayRef = Arc` (trait object used in generic contexts)So, you constantly need to downcast from ArrayRef just to get typed data, even though you built all the layers.In **Minarrow**, you also have layers, but they are, in my opinion, more straightforward:1. **Vec64 / Buffer** \- Plays like a normal Rust vector. You can use it like one2. **Typed Buffers**: IntegerArray, FloatArray, etc.3. **NumericArray:** Enum, with accessors, e.g., 'myarr.i64()'4. **Array**: Enum, with accessors e.g., 'myarr.num().i64()'The result is they are composable - you opt-up to the level of abstraction you want and need, rather than being locked behind an opaque object. In Rust, this is particularly helpful, as when building libraries and functions, it means their signatures can be compatible with more use cases, but I'm digressing here.The point is that it was enough that I went and rebuilt my own implementation, as I need it for other projects and didn't like wrestling with the system as the underlying data foundation.

ncq0ytw,"This isn't a pharma problem. The OT/IT bridge is complicated. I used to do this at a utility. The first thing is to get the data out of OT so it can be used integrated with IT. Depending on the setup this can be done using OPC-UA for most SCADA systems. I've seen in Pharma before that most manufacturing has a gateway so you can pull off the gateway instead which aggregates several PLCs/machines to pull from a common point. Most of that data is pushed to a pub/sub like Kafka or some other MQ. The schema for each step in most manufacturing processes is based on how the cards are programmed on the PLC. Since message queuing systems can handle schema evolution, you can usually combine this with a schema registry so you can see the steps and versions. Now getting it into a structure built for OLAP is not the easiest. There might be controls engineers that already have a common data model for reporting on just the OT. This is needed to understand signals, etc. They might also have a digital twin which represents a virtual system so you can begin modeling yourself. There are decent articles discussing OT/IT convergence but there is no silver bullet ( https://iot-analytics.com/it-ot-convergence-27-themes-define-future-of-industrial-integration/). If the schema isn't defined anywhere, there are tools like Apache Flink that can use schema inference, however you are still going to need to figure out the model so you know what step stage relates to what schema and how keys (columns) are related to each other. It takes some work but again there is an automation and controls engineer that has to have that somewhere.",Patient_Magazine2444,2025-09-06 12:33:08,5,dataengineering,t3_1n9wlex,False,

nct16p2,"Thanks for the excellent link.Patient_Magazine has a solid answer. It’s not just in pharma. OT is typically an underinvested and unappreciated area in technology and staffing. It’s like the opposite of sales lol.The software is often just a means to get the manufacturing equipment to work. The engineers in OT are more operational focused and have a different set of responsibilities. They are also very busy most of the time and want to get things working and keep them working. There is typically no laboratory setup where they can isolate data and services out for stuff like analytics.Also, manufacturing is usually a low margin business, so there’s not a lot of spare change there for new initiatives which take time to show value.Good news is, overall I have been seeing lots of push over the past 5 years for more integration of OT with IT, as the link you provided shows. I think this started in security as OT has been a vulnerable gateway into IT, since it’s not been hardened from a security standpoint. Example, there’s a ton of pressure to not touch anything for simple stuff like firewall or patches when the greater risk is perceived as bringing a production line down.Hopefully some of the success stories start getting more visibility over time and we can learn from examples of where value is created from integrating OT data where everyone can access it and use it to improve the company overall.One tip is see if there are any relationships built in your group with the OT group.

For some like Salesforce it's easy as they publish their model and your CRM team get to add custom fields. You can then pull a source entity such as Customer or Case into your data platform. Other tools like Siebel will have 5,000 tables of which 100 will contain domain data, each of those tables will have 100 of columns so the task here is the identify which tables and columns are relevant - depending on how the system is configured. The final example is Success Factors, here they expose data through reports and APIs. The internal schema is their IP and not shared, but you can find out from the API spec or report engine what you can extract. My last 2 projects has kept data for ingestion close to the source with an initial seed load and then the delta loads. After that we current have a raw data vault which is essentially facts and type 2 history tables. Then we have the business consumption layer which applies any business logic that allows the BI team to create their dashboard. If I had asked you to do this then I would not want a generic schema for source but details of what I can get from the source system as raw maintaining their schema.

Especially if what comes next is a long and complex query that would otherwise be hard for the optimizer to build a proper plan for, if it were to run on a big table.Generally, write operations are slow and resource-heavy.

Language, art, music, and cultural identity never really interested me bc it felt very fluid and ever morphing with very grey lines. So coding was always likely a very natural path for me. But I would say ive had a different outcome in life. Instead of coding/programming as a job it'd been more of a passive hobby for me. Ive gotten exceptionally good at understanding underlying factors and influences that have shaped modern cultures, music, language etc. To the point that writing and expressing my thoughts is likely one of my strongest traits. But I think learning how to program ironically really helped with it. Objective oriented programming really helped shape my understanding of repeated actions creating ever growing outcome (loops). Helped me start to compartmentalize and break things down into smaller parts instead of things as a single large thing (objects). Recognizing how two things that are alike can be uniquely different but share a lot of common traits and abilities (inheritance). And lastly the biggest impact, "" if then"" statements.

Basically, when you ask a question, you should be at a point where you know the information you are looking for, but also know that you can't find it yourself.So, for example, asking ""how do I commit a change"" is not a good question, because it's vague, would take hours to answer fully and strongly suggests you have not done even basic research.Asking ""What is the URL of the GitHub server"" is a great question - I can answer it instantly, and there is no way you could have found it out yourself (errr - unless it's in the new starter guided in which case you shouldn't have asked it, obviously!).So, when asking a question (or raising a bug, or anything really) always start with ""What I did"", ""What I expected to happen"" and ""What actually happened"" - change those questions to ones that make sense for the question you are asking, but generally they are a good format for asking for help.People want to help - they just don't want to do your job for you.",HiddenStoat,2025-09-09 10:19:32,80,learnprogramming,t3_1ncdtru,False,

What you can do is make the process more interactive, provide faster feedback, and tailor it to your attention span.Instead of thinking about ""all the cool stuff"", pick one item from the list. Just one, ideally the most exciting one. Then try to make that, and only that. It will probably be way too big and difficult, which is why you need experience building smaller things first.

That way, what's left will be directly related to the eventual end result and you can see, in your mind, the next steps that will get you closer to the ""real thing"".Even if you never get there, the process is inherently motivating. You may find that you know exactly what to do, but not how exactly it could be done. That's good, because now you're intrinsically motivated to learn.

With a human language, if you know it well, then you can really express ANY IDEA AT ALL with finesse and comprehensibility. But with programming languages it's not really that way at all. Although formally programming languages that are ""Turing complete"" can be used to express any program, in actual practice, some tasks/types of programs are definitely way easier in some languages than others. Programming languages are tools, more like a hammer and a saw. You need to know how to use both of those, based on what task you are going to do. Also there are many types of hammer, many times of saw, just like there are many flavors of some programming languages that resemble each other. When you're first learning, you should learn to use an easy-to-use one, a safe one, etc. Later on, you can learn to use more powerful tools, more specialized tools.It is the same in programming, except the tools change frequently and depend a lot on in what domain you are working.In Web development for example you're likely to use a lot of JavaScript. In other domains JS is making headway with Node.js but to me it's still not used as much. The other languages you mentioned (PHP, SQL) are that way as well. Most people don't consider HTML a programming language because you can't write a loop, there's no real control flow, etc. It is possible to ""modularize"" HTML though, so there's that. Nowadays though it seems like most people prefer to generate HTML rather than to code it by hand.Also SQL is a very specialized language used to query a database. For example, what would ""hello world"" look like in SQL? Can you make a command-line app in SQL? Maybe it's technically possible, but I would not want to maintain such code if you gave it to me.

And when a program runs in machine code, it becomes much, much simpler to understand how it calls other programs that are also in machine code. Calling another machine code program is as simple as asking the CPU to jump to the address of that program. Of course you need to know that address, but that's what the operating system helps with.But the programs (or the compilers that compiled them) still has to agree on a ""calling convention"", like how are arguments transferred to functions. They can for instance be stored in specific registers in the CPU, and then the return value is expected to be in a certain register. Or maybe a single register stores a pointer to the list of arguments, and then the function itself has to extract them from that memory location.Look into ""calling conventions"" if you want to learn more, and maybe take a look at [https://godbolt.org/](https://godbolt.org/) and analyze how a C program gets converted to machine code - but be warned, it isn't simple :)",peterlinddk,2025-09-07 10:19:14,5,learnprogramming,t3_1nape3q,False,
ncvte59,"This is actually an interesting question, with multiple answers.If a C program writes to a file and a Python program later reads it, the Python has to be written with an understanding of how bytes are arranged in the file. This is a primary reason for CSV, XML, JSON, and other data formats. Most languages can read and write any file format, these days (that was less true 50 years ago.)If a running program written in one language invokes a function written in another language, the caller has to set up the stack frame in the way that's expected by the function being called. Different languages have different calling conventions.And when information is transferred over a network, that has its own problems. Often it's done with a text based format like JSON, but Protobufs are designed for the purpose. In the olden days, Sun invented XDR (eXternal Data Representation) and SunRPC, which did much the same thing but a lot less efficiently.In general we call this problem Serialization and Deserialization, and solutions to the problem have been introduced constantly for decades.",Leverkaas2516,2025-09-07 10:36:56,5,learnprogramming,t3_1nape3q,False,

If you don’t use the file system, but want to access data in memory, I.e. have a single app that is written in two or more languages, it gets very complex.

ncwbpmc,"It depends on what you mean by ""talk to each other"". Let's look at your example. Are you assuming that for Python to open a file, it needs to talk to C? It doesn't need to do that. Whatever underlying mechanism C uses to open a file, Python has that feature too.Yes, it's possible to have a language that doesn't have any features to open a file which means you're stuck unless you want to figure how to do it which might require rewriting parts of the compiler (or interpreter) for the language.Someone pointed out that Python can make foreign function calls to C. Python's weakness is that it's interpreted. Compared to languages like C, this makes it slow. You would think this would make Python and unlikely choice for doing math (which is computationally intensive), but because Python has this foreign function call specifically to C, then you can implement these numerical calculations in C, but let it be called like a standard Python library.But it's because Python has that feature built in. It doesn't have (as far as I know) a foreign function interface to, say, Erlang or Java.In general, languages don't have the capability to talk to each other directly.Someone pointed out that there is the front end (the browser side) and a back end (the server side), and that this is a way that two languages communicate. This is done indirectly, at least, if you're talking about a web browser.A front end is going to send a HTTP request which is a protocol to send information to a server. The server responds with that protocol. This means whatever language that front end is written in (Javascript is most common) has to eventually send an HTTP request. The back end needs to decode that request and then run some code in whatever language (there are numerous backend languages) then translate that to a response back to the client end.Two languages interact through HTTP, a protocol both sides understand. It's a little like someone who speaks Mandarin talking to someone who speaks Hindi by both speaking in English.One reason this happens is the front and back end are on separate machines with separate memory, so this requires some connection, namely, the Internet, and some way to communicate across this connection (HTTP which runs on top of TCP/IP).With Python calling a C function through a foreign language interface, then you're running code in the same memory space together. Again, it's a bit uncommon.You could have two languages communicate via a socket, which can be done via the same file system or via the Internet. You could invent a protocol to do this, but it wouldn't involve one language making a direct call in the other language, unless that was built into the language itself.Beginners often think languages talking to one another is cool and that it happens all the time, but it's not the way most people think.",CodeTinkerer,2025-09-07 12:58:44,2,learnprogramming,t3_1nape3q,False,

ncf1o9q,"There are a lot of reasons.For one thing, a stateless component always produces the same output for a given input. That makes the mapping (or function, in the mathematical sense) from inputs to outputs much easier to formally describe and specify. It also makes it much easier to test.For another, when a component has state, then its behavior depends on the order of operations that are performed on it. If you want to prove that a component will always behave a certain way, then you have to prove it for all possible orderings of operations. This tends to give you a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. It's not impossible to prove these sorts of properties, but it's something that you don't have to worry about if the component is stateless.Usually, an application *needs* to have state, in order to do what you want it to do. But by confining the state to the smallest possible ""region"" of the program, you make the both the stateful parts and the stateless parts easier to reason about, compared to how it would be if mutable state was woven throughout the program.Just as one specific example of this, programs that make heavy use of mutable global variables tend to be much harder to understand and maintain than those that pass parameters and return values around wherever they're needed.",teraflop,2025-09-04 18:20:55,101,learnprogramming,t3_1n8hh96,False,
ncf1nzx,"These are great questions to be pondering, and your observations are good.1. Generally, substitution model vs machine model. If it's possible to just substitute values into a computation to get an answer, it's very easy (in theory) to see where something is wrong. Once you introduce the idea that time matters, e.g. a value can be different at different points in time depending on what point a machine (of some description) is at in the computation, it starts to get much harder to debug things. Now imagine a large program/system with millions of bits of state, changing frequently. If the code doesn't produce the desired behaviour for some combination of those states, you have a bug, and it can be very hard to track down.2. Following on from the above, in the context of OOP vs Functional paradigms, OOP is (most agree) about associating behaviour with data. Grouping state with the code that changes it, usually modelled after some real-world thing (but not necessarily). In this way it encourages statefulness and mutation of state. It attempts to balance this with encapsulation (usually enforced at compile time), so that only certain code can access certain state. But that code is called by other code, so the positive effect of this can be limited. Contrasted with functional, where we try to write as much of the program without depending on state, meaning functions become ""pure"" (no reliance on state, no side effects, etc.). We need side effects and state changes, it's what we sell to customers, but we can push them to the very edges of the program, and wall off code that handles the messy stuff, hopefully making the rest easier to reason about and less prone to bugs. Just like OOP there is a spectrum. You can dip your toes in, or go full on.Edit, just seen you added 3. Think I basically covered it though so I'll leave it there for now. Also, interestingly, some languages are now turning off statefulness by default and having you opt into it, e.g. Rust with mut to enable assignment (distinct from initialising the value)",HashDefTrueFalse,2025-09-04 18:20:52,21,learnprogramming,t3_1n8hh96,False,

They just need to specify those fields and will get a predictable response.If your function additionally relies on implicit, mutable state, e.g. certain fields being a certain value at certain times that can be updated by anything anywhere, including randomly or by the mere passage of time, then it's way more difficult to use the function correctly because you don't control the inputs directly.No one's saying ""never have state"".

ncf5a3j,"I think you misunderstand what ""state"" is a bit - you are right in that a game is very much dependent on state, basically any game is an ordered collection of transitions from state to state, and a save-game is basically a technique to restore the exact state of the entire game. But that doesn't hold for the text editor - when you load a text to edit, you don't set the state of the entire application, only the ""data-model"" that it manipulates. All the rules, all the behaviour of the program would be the same as if any other text had been loaded, and thus not directly affecting the state. The state would be like if part of the text was selected, or a dialog window was opened, or a context-menu was active.Statefulness isn't necessarily considered bad - but the more states you have, the higher complexity you are dealing with, and the higher the risk for unexpected behaviour. If you have 32 variables that can all impact the operation of the application in different ways, you have 4 billion variations, and you can't possibly test every single one of them. So the less statefulness the better.OOP can encourage statefulness because it encourages objects to be able to manipulate themselves, and store their data, i.e. their state internally. An object ""remembers"" what happened to it the last time you called some method, and behaves differently the next time, depending on previous method-calls. Pure functions do not alter their behaviour depending on state - they always behave the exact same.Statelessness is preferred because that means that the application always behaves the exact same, and always in a predictable way, thus errors can't suddenly happen when a previous un-encountered state occurs. If new errors are found, they happen because of specific input, and it can be replicated and fixed. Whereas when errors happen in stateful applications, you might not be able to replicate the exact circumstances that caused the error.At least that is what we hope and wish for - but of course states can't be completely eliminated, and errors and bugs still show up from time to time in any kind of application.",peterlinddk,2025-09-04 18:38:50,6,learnprogramming,t3_1n8hh96,False,

ncf8ga1,"2 first: Objects are *data and their operations*. State is the definition of an object in the OOP sense.1 and 3: Stateless operations are trivially parallelizable and for practical purposes obviate the memory bus part of the architecture to focus on control flow and data transformation.Let us back up a little: Fundamentally every program is a transformation of data. At all scales, this is what a program is. From the macro to the function level, a program / routine / subroutine/ function, has input, performs a transformation, and provides output. The ""provides transformation and provides output"" is the key part. This is true even in places where it's somewhat unexpected: Gluing APIs together is largely taking the data from one API, performing a transformation, and then outputting it to a second API.This is the underlying premise for microservices, for instance. They perform a single small transformation on data and output it for the next consumer.Now, let's consider a matrix consisting of all stateful branches. This is a little opaque to think about at first, so I'll give a concrete example: In NetHack you can mix potions, or pour potions on items, drink them, etc, and essentially do any X to any item and any potion that you can do with *any other item*. If you have a matrix where all items are represented as rows, and the behavior of an item interacting with another item is defined by a function entry in that matrix, then you can see that the number of interactions and state transformations of the data grows exponentially with each item (for n-items it's n\^2 possible state transformations).It is possible to show that all stateful operations in a program can be represented this way, and so the complexity of a program grows exponentially as the number of possible distinct state-branches it can take on a given stateful object grows.Some programs, and some styles of programming (especially game programming) typically lend themselves to managing and processing large amounts of state. With a resulting large amount of bugs. It is difficult and takes a lot of engineering work to parallelize that in a consistent and meaningful way, and there are multiple approaches to doing so (the most ubiquitous in my experience has literally been writing your own IPC layer... jfc I hate game devs).The graphics pipeline can nominally be viewed as a (mostly) stateless series of programs. Ignoring some advanced counterexamples, vertex and pixel shaders inherently take input, provide output, and never operate on state at all. But this isn't quite completely stateless, because the graphics card / driver has a set of states that you have to set for those programs to operate the intended way. It has *minimal* state, but is not entirely stateless.That minimal state affecting control and inputs though minimizes the difficulty in parallelizing shader operations, and once configured globally the programs are trivially parallelizable.So, statefulness is ""bad"" from a philosophy of programming perspective where an increase in state and the number of transformations on that state increases the complexity of a program quadratically and decreases the composability and functional-ness of the program. OOP is by definition state and operations.BUT, the truth is that some programs require state, and/or are easier to reason about statefully. And where the rubber meets the road, you do what you need to do to get the data tranformed correctly and within acceptable external tolerances.Ed: I forgot to address the side-effects problem. State implies functions have side effects to transform persistent state. That's the entire point of functions on persistent state. Side-effects can sometimes be very hard to see or understand, making it harder to reason about complex programs (duh) and breaking data/transformation locality.",tellingyouhowitreall,2025-09-04 18:54:20,2,learnprogramming,t3_1n8hh96,False,

Check if the letter has already been used. Pick a word from a dictionary. Check if the letter is in the word etc... It took me far too long to learn that the assignment wasn't about a hangman game, it was a lesson showing how to split big problems in to small ones. Every step was laughably easy and suddenly I had a silly little game to show for it. If you ask me to build almost anything, I'll be at a loss.

ncpdbgu,"That doesn't make much sense, because there's no single cognitive ability that would allow one to program successfully without being able to understand enough to create your own solutions (however poor they may be at first).If you're talking about actual deficiencies, like those in working memory (e.g., if one has ADHD it is often impaired) then that's a very real challenge, but not one you couldn't work around. I know excellent programmers who are technically learning-disabled, they just take more time and are slower but they can still somehow do if after they gained enough practice.I think it would be worth investigating what forms of representation for information you prefer in other contexts. Usually, a combination of material works better than any specific one, but there are large individual differences. If you're using code as a reference, that is entirely different than using code to understand a concept. In fact, there are (at least) four different types of resources that people may use while programming and they all serve different purposes:1. Introductory material/tutorials: Separates information into buckets, reducing cognitive load (pre-selection and focus of attention)2. ""How to do X"" guides and other instructions: Complete ""recipes"" for how to do something you don't know how to do exactly, like algorithms that can be mixed and matched, or adapted to your actual needs3. References: No explanation, just to remember things that aren't in your memory (syntax, functions, conditions, ...)4. In-depth guides and explanations: Used to form connections and help you understand related details, to gradually expand your knowledge graphSome common issues I've seen are people focusing extensively on one specific type of resource, picking the wrong type for a given situation, trying to understand every detail instead of finding other resources to compare, or trying to do everything at once instead of just one individual step.The second big issue might be the complete lack of visualization. Humans are inherently visual creatures and our visual system is the most bandwidth-heavy of all, it's really fast and (within certain limits) excellent at relaying information to your brain that would be more difficult to get in the ol' noggin by any other means. You can draw stuff on paper, in apps like EcaliDraw, or use oldschool graphics programs like Paint. Diagrams like MermaidJS also work but are usually too much effort for everyday tasks. For some people, explaining ideas in language may be helpful. This takes more time and doesn't work unless you know roughly what you want to do, but it can be a great aid in clarifying your ideas. Even if you later delete the text, you can try explaining what you are doing and what you want to do as if someone was reading it later. Or find a real person/rubber duck and talk out loud instead.Finally, there is a difference between ""bottom-up"" and ""top-down"" learning. Many regular people seem to prefer the latter, where you start with a high-level idea go down further as needed. This has the benefit of reducing the cognitive load as you get to ignore all the low-level details, but this simplification can make true understanding much more difficult than necessary. It is commonly seen in math where the lecturer knows all the details and sometimes ""forgets"" to mention them or just glances over important topics, leaving students utterly confused. The reverse is also possible, and of course you can try to attack each problem from both angles. I suspect autistic people have an easier time with bottom-up approaches as the details are what allows them to really understand, while it may be overkill for someone else (but this is purely an anecdotal observation). You need to find your own preferred style and see what exactly makes it easiest for you to understand the actual problem, before you encode it into an executable program specification.Personally, I found that ""low IQ"" or working memory deficiencies etc. may manifest in that one can't as easily (or rapidly) step through each part of a given problem in their mind, or might make more errors while doing so.

nco7170,"Fair warning, this is going to be very long.I prefer the Black Box Method to writing code. I think a lot of developers do this without really thinking about it. No matter what the program is, you should be able to break it down into some smaller steps, some important operations that need to happen for the program to work. The Black Box Method basically just involves creating placeholder functions for the more complicated operations, then coming back later to define the details of those functions. You start with the big picture, make sure it's behaving like you want, then work your way down to the finer details.For example, let's say you need to build a program that can read a bunch of names from an input file and update some data files using the information from that file. It's something I've had to do at my job quite a few times now. Immediately, what are the two big things we know it needs to do?1. Read the input file2. Update the relevant data filesSo you write whatever boilerplate you need to get going, then in your main() function, or wherever your program begins, you simply write two lines (I'm gonna be using Pythonic pseudocode from here on out): def main(): parse_input_file() update_data_files()And the key is that you don't have to define them just yet. I normally just have these placeholders display a message like ""Parsing input file..."" and ""Updating data files..."" to make things easy to debug. You can do a sanity check here and run your new program to make sure the messages are displaying in the correct order. This would be especially important to do if this is being integrated into a larger system. Make sure your program is actually running.Anyway, now you can start breaking down these functions individually. Let's focus on the input parsing. This is where we should start asking questions like, ""how do we know which file to read?"", ""what is the format of this input file?"", ""how should we store the data that we read?"". Immediately, we have some information to figure out and some decisions to make.For the first question, let's assume that we want to prompt the user for the filename (as opposed to passing it in as a parameter to the program, like using argv in Python). For the second, let's assume that the input file is a plain text file that stores each data entry on a new line, and each line contains a username, first name, last name, and email address, delimited by commas. This type of information should be provided to you by your professor/manager/client/lead developer/someone else. The third question is more of a personal preference, and this is where your knowledge of data structures becomes important. You should base it on what's efficient and easy to maintain, but there are often many correct approaches, so do whatever makes the most sense to you. Let's keep things simple and store the data in an array of tuples for now.So, thinking about this logically, in order to parse the input file, we need to:1. Prompt the user for a file (what should we do if it doesn't exist?)2. Read each line of that file, and for each line:a. Split the line using a comma as the delimeterb. Clean up the data (if necessary) and build a tuple with itc. Append that tuple to the arrayYour program might look something like this now: def parse_input_file(): parsed_data = [] input_file = prompt_input_file() if exists(input_file) for line in input_file.readlines(): data_tuple = build_tuple_from_line(line) if data_tuple: # make sure data exists parsed_data.append(data_tuple) return parsed_dataAnd now that we've decided to give this function a return value, we can go back and update the main function: def main(): parsed_data = parse_input_file() if parsed_data: # make sure data exists update_data_files(parsed_data)Note that we also defined two new placeholder functions. One of them is build_tuple_from_line() which takes as input the text from the line and outputs a tuple representing that data. If it fails to parse for whatever reason, we can return an empty tuple, and nothing will be added to the array. The other is prompt_input_file() which takes no inputs and outputs an object with a readlines() member. (There is also the exists() function, but I am assuming that one is imported.) Hopefully you have an idea now of how this might continue. You can start breaking down each function from here.No matter what you're doing, you can always break it down into smaller steps. Focus on the core features and start with the parts you understand best. Leave the more complicated parts as abstract functions until you're ready to get into the weeds. You might find along the way that you took an inefficient approach, but it's almost always better just to get something that works to begin with, then you can always go back and optimize later. Like I know the approach I just laid out is very inefficient with memory. If you know that will be a concern, then this would be the perfect time to make adjustments before things get too complicated.That got way longer than I anticipated, but hopefully it's somewhat helpful. I'm not an expert by any means, but I've seen some decent success as a programmer, and this is the approach that works best for me. Best of luck in your journey!

ncpc5fd,"At the beginning I often struggled with translating e.g. homework tasks into code. I then read a beginner programming book which has used C#. The programming language isn't important as the first two chapters were the most relevant for me. The first chapter talked about why you want to learn to program, what possible fields of work are there.The second one was about algorithmic thinking. In general most programming language are built on 3 concepts:\- Sequence (A sequence of actions that are executed in order of their appearance)\- Branching (Actions are executed based on certain conditions)\- Repetition (repeating an action until a condition is met. loops and recursion are different forms of repetition)Most lectures only present you the synthax of e.g. an if-statement or of a loop in a certain language. But they don't tell you when to use these parts of the language. In the book they were talking about looking for keywords in the text or the requirements.For example: If you see the word ""if"" in a text then it is a strong indicator for branching as ""if"" implies there are at least two options to handle. ""As long as"" might be an indicator for a loop. If there are many separate actions mentioned one after each other it is a strong indicator for a sequence of actions that you have to perform to reach a certain goal. For each of the actions you could write one single program instruction or a function to group multiple connected instructions in one place.In the book they give examples like opening a door where you execute an algorithm to achieve your goal. The sequence can't be changed as you can't enter the room without opening the door. In programming you have to think about which steps have to be performed first in order for your code to solve a problem.pressDoorHandle()openDoor()enterRoom()closeDoor()Of course this is easy when you get university homework as most of the time they try to tell you as accurate as possible what you should do. If talking to a client you actually have to find out what the requirements even are.Of course this is programming on a micro-level as we are dealing with the specific steps but you can apply this also on higher levels of abstractions when you describe how a user e.g. interacts with a system like a website when he e.g. creates an account, deletes a post.When programming I often use pen and paper or I write comments (pseudo-code) like this:\# For each pdf-document do:\# Open pdf-document\# Extract values with a regular expressions\# write them into table\# close documentAfter writing the pseudo-code I add the real code below the comments. This way I can focus on solving the problem without having to delve into the specifics of the programming language that I use (this is something you can google easily).There are more tips about thinking techniques for problem solving but I have to go do groceries now:)). Feel free to ask any questions. Good luck! EDIT: Book recommendation: Thinking like a programmer by Spraul it's a book on problem solving techniques. It uses C++ but this isn't important.

ncfldou,"> Obviously, I can’t take a full course for every single thing I bump into.You can, and you should. Learning takes time, so you must also learn to become process-oriented by finding ways to make that time rewarding as opposed to being goal-oriented and only caring about the final outcome, because the latter gives you very little in terms of experience which is what you should be taking out of your learning journey. Yes, researching how to build everything from scratch takes a very long time in the beginning, but as you gain experience, the need to do that will diminish, you will gain intuition, and over time you will build a strong knowledge foundation that will serve you much better in the long run than the brittle thing that you will build if you keep approaching learning with your current mindset. You don't need to go any deeper than the public instruction set native to your computer as below that one can hardly call it programming, but in the beginning you should really aim at forming a strong notion of how things really work all the way down there.> My question is: How do you usually learn about the tools, libraries, or techniques that already exist, so you don’t waste time building everything from scratch? Is there a strategy or habit for this, or is it just experience over time?I don't. In personal projects I just learn everything from scratch, and enjoy the whole process, because the point is to learn, not to finish the project, and the time spent learning isn't really wasted time. As a beginner to some technology there's also a very high chance that my first approach to solving the problem will likely be a mess so it won't be of much use, so that's never my goal. Lastly it's also very likely that, in the research process required to actually learn how things work, I will come across existing projects that already do it right, but instead of cheating my way by just taking advantage of the existing solution I go down the rabbit hole and try to wrap my head around the rationale of that solution, and don't consider the problem solved until I successfully tackle it myself.My advice to you is to stop coming up with excuses to avoid learning when that's exactly what you should be doing. High-level development might feel rewarding to you because it gives you the impression that you are accomplishing a lot with very little, but in the end you are also only gaining a superficial experience, and without a solid foundation it's very easy for abstractions to create unexpected complex problems that you lack the intuition to solve on your own, so don't cheat your way out of the learning process. With large language machine learning models you have free access to teachers that can easily break down complex concepts for you and never get tired of answering your requests to explain things from different perspectives, which is a commodity that I didn't get to enjoy during most of my career, so definitely take advantage of that, not to write your code ant cheat your way out of problems, but to truly help you wrap your head around the solutions.",Fridux,2025-09-04 19:58:40,1,learnprogramming,t3_1n8evlj,False,

If you use AI take the code it writes and type all of that code in by hand, then study the code to understand what it is doing.

nd9iv4v,"Not really an answer to your question, and I dunno if this will help you, but I use a mental trick when I'm coding recursion (e.g. when traveling trees or linked lists or deeply nested markup language structures).I imagine that there are a bunch of people standing around, each of whom manages a single node in the nested structure. When the recursive method is called, each person has a list of information they are handed (the argument list), knowledge of the specific node's properties (its attributes, its list of children, maybe a link to its parent, whatever is there), and tasks to perform. That person knows NOTHING about the rest of the list, the other nodes, etc.Then I just imagine the person doing the task needed and then handing off information to the next node.Silly example: I have a tree structure with a node that has a name and links to its own children. Some unknown person needs a big long list of only the names that start with A or B appended to a list.So, as the person responsible for a single node, when it's my turn, I get the A&B name list that's already been started by whoever is above me and the node's properties in the argument list (or in my own object's properties if the recursive function is baked into the object and my own method was called). I check my own node's name and if it starts with A or B, I stick it on the list. Then, I ""hand off"" the list to each of my node's children so they can do the same (i.e. I call the method for the kids the same way my parent called it for me).Obviously this example is simple, but when I get something more complicated like aggregating values, interacting with both parent and children, using shared resources, reversing results, etc., this method helps me isolate my thinking to a single node.Hint: first build your code as if your node has a parent and at least two kids. Then re-run it in your head as if you're the top-level node and make sure you have what you need to hand off to the first kids.

You cannot solve what you don't understand.Then, sit down with pencil and paper and solve the task *your* way, as a human would do. Track down the steps. Test the steps on paper. Refine the steps until you have a clear, minute description of the solution to the problem.Ideally, your steps should be so detailed that they correspond 1:1 to code statements.Practice is what helps. Practice, practice, practice, and practice more.For your current problem: What does being a Palindrome mean? It means that a word read in both directions is the same, like *racecar* or *RADAR*.How could you detect this? By checking the original vs. the reversed word.How could you reverse a word? There are a couple ways, one of which is to loop over each character in a word and to push the current character into an array from the front.You could also just simply concatenate the letters with the current letter being added at the front of the reversed string.Last, you need to compare the original and reversed strings.What definitely is important as well is to *sanitize* the case, e.g. make everything uppercase or lowercase.",aqua_regis,2025-09-05 12:20:02,7,learnprogramming,t3_1n93d6s,False,

Then, do it again. Do it again in an hour, then a day, then next week.Each time, you may encounter different bugs that challenge you.

At what step in your process did you realize MADMAN was not a palindrome?Now can you write a general procedure for doing this? Luckily you have some test-cases already for palindromes and non-palindromes, so you can test your procedure and probably fix many bugs already.If you want to get really ""serious"" about testing, then you can even take a break and write a separate program (not required, of course), that generates long palindromes and long non palindromes, and can use that as input to ""stress test"" your final procedure. For such a problem this is probably overkill, but for building an ""industrial strength"" library or program where there are strict performance requirements this kind of thing is often done.In any case don't forget to test edge cases, for example is the empty string a palindrome? Maybe it's not defined anywhere, but as a programmer you have to handle that possibility appropriately, either by defining a safe default (e.g. """" IS or IS NOT a palindrome by arbitrary fiat) or else return an error, saying you need at least one character to determine palindromeness/palindromitivity.",chaotic_thought,2025-09-05 12:34:51,3,learnprogramming,t3_1n93d6s,False,

ncnd1cl,"This is a great example of a problem where you can just solve it in real life, CLOSELY observe what you did to solve the problem, and then just write those steps in code. Most beginner programming problems are like this, I mean really everything is like this.So like, the way you would check if “racecar” is a palindrome (it is) would basically be to look at the first letter and see if it matches the last letter. And then see if the 2nd letter matches the 2nd to last letter (and of course when I say “letter”… I guess I should be saying character, if it should be able to handle anything that is technically a palindrome I guess), and then check the 3rd letter matches the 3rd to last letter and so on.If EVERY comparison returns true, then the result is true (it is a palindrome). If the you ever get a false at any point, you immediately return false, because that proves it isn’t a palindrome.You could of course have to handle all the little details, and make sure invalid things never happen. So like you have to set up the loops correctly to not get any out of bounds error on the string you’re working with. And also you could notice things like how you only have to check half of the word, because you’re checking the first half against the back half. So setting a loop to go through the entire word would needlessly double check everything. But you have to make sure not to mess up and only check just under half the word, so you should do half the word plus one character (just to be safe).Etc. But yea the part you need to practice the most is the first part. Figuring out how to actually solve the problem (forgetting about programming completely. Like literally just figure out how to determine if a word is a palindrome by yourself, or whatever the problem is), this is generally the hardest part. And then figuring out how to translate this solution into code (this is generally the easiest part). And then you have to deal with making sure you’ve handled all the edge cases and whatnot correctly (probably 2nd hardest part).",monster2018,2025-09-06 00:00:31,1,learnprogramming,t3_1n93d6s,False,

ncpmkwz,"Breaking down problems into smaller sub-problems has already been mentioned. Another ingredient is trying to make sure you understand the data. All programs operate on information that exists in some form of storage, which the program instructions manipulate (read, write, modify, compare, ...) to implement solutions to the problem you're trying to solve.Therefore, understanding the data means you will understand the problem. That's a requirement to implement any solution. The actual programming work is almost irrelevant in the sense that you might as well do it on paper, or on a blackboard/whiteboard, etc. Only the implementation is language-dependent, but the problem itself isn't usually - unless it's an artificial problem introduced by limitations of the system, programming environment, libraries, tools, etc.Using your palindrome example: What is the actual problem? Well, what is the data? Presumably, you're given a string of text. You assume it has some known encoding, probably ASCII (or Unicode), so that there is a specific number for each letter/code point. There's also the notion of a position because the words ABC and CBA are not identical. A position is just another number that represents where in the word the letter (represented by the first number) actually should appear.OK, so what is a palindrome? Well, it's a word (sequence of numbers + position) that just so happens to not change if you swap two letters that have the same ""distance"" from the beginning and end. But if positions are numbers and distances are required, can't you just use the absolute position for each letter (from *both* sides) and check that it's the same, for every letter? Sure, that is probably one solution - though it may not be what you need, or too difficult to do in a given programming language. Another approach is to just swap the entire word, and check that both versions are the same. This is simpler to understand but arguably less efficient.You may have special cases, where the word has an odd number of letters. What now? Well, one basic way is to add conditionals, like ""if it's odd, do this. If even, do that"". Often it pays to think harder and realize, in this case, that it makes no difference - the same algorithm ""just works"" and so you need not complicate your solution. If the problem is too difficult, remove special cases. In code, you can write `assert` or similar or even just a `TODO` comment, then revisit that part later.A solution is different from its implementation in code. If you can't solve the problem that's an entirely different issue than not being able to implement the solution (""write the code""), or writing complicated/slow/insecure/incorrect code, for that matter.

But if you have to stop by the post office on the way, and it will take 5 minutes you need to include that in your time. But, it also changes the time calculation since you need to go to post office, spend five minutes there, then go to meeting.So, IF you go to the post office THEN add time for travel to it, time at it, and travel from post office to meeting. ELSE you don’t go to post office and simply add the travel time to meeting.Have other errands to run in addition to, or instead of, the post office? Similar logic, but applied to the trip to post office instead of the meeting. This introduces looping as you work back from your 10:00 and loop through your errands leading up to it. Get to the point where you would need to have left half an hour ago? Some errand needs to be removed…then you need an algorithm to decide which one to do later, or to reschedule the meeting. That can similarly be broken down.It may seem very tedious, but this is how complex decisions are made. You take all the variables and conditions into account, at whatever level of detail is required to give an adequate solution. Maybe you are just meeting a friend for a walk in the park, and it’s ok to be a few minutes late, whereas for a job interview you must be on time, and add a few minutes buffer in case traffic delays you.It is tedious.

The users were happy, the people who wrote that trash were not. I was never able to achieve 100x RTIs, which was disappointing. One needs to develop a design and methods instinct. The computer is a machine and you need to consider what you are making it do.At the time, the technical computing group was charging served departments for machine cycles, there was complete reorg because that model was blown up. I was challenged by my boss/idiot that the users were not using my software suite, the cpu use was so little. I took him to my desk and beat up one of the memory resident apps and did a bunch of scrolling, sorting, editing etc and pointed to a little bug in the corner of the screen showing session use of a few milliseconds. The data was in permanent swap space, memory resident in permanent disk swap space. The screen apps were actually an interface to edit and manipulate data in address space. There were no database calls which are all subroutine calls. When a app was launched the app instantly had data in its address space. All supported by an optimized library of reentrant code. Many people running several apps were supported by a single instance of the code in memory. RAM was very expensive at that point in time. There were table driven applications generators with terminal screen forms and fields. When doing some complex products built on top of this, the full screen app could be used to examine the address space of the product being developed, an optimal debugging tool. Things like optimizing pen plotters and manufacturing numerically controlled devices, minimizing pen changes and tool transit paths. In the pen plotters, overlapping line vectors were collapsed to one. Vectors were grouped into several regions which reduced pen-up excursions. The problem is that during CAD design, a component would be given a bill of material number and the bill of material in the corner would be completed. During plotting, the plotter would retrace those motions in the order of the drawing development. A hole in a part would have two or more overlapping circles, from each surface that the hole went through. So there were such challenges. The software did such operations in the background, the users did not need to run anything. My background was MechEng.I examined each code component's compiler machine code output, optimizing register use in each subroutine, especially anything data intensive. Without using files for data, I had to produce my own data sorting, printing, select etc. My equal key stable sorting was vastly faster than the OS sorting or SyncSort. The code included terminal drivers and supported a number of different models and brands of terminals within the one code base.

Our abstractions steadily climb higher and higher, moving further and further from the ""world just as it is"" with it's particles and whatnot.In programming we talk machine code, binary patterns, on the lowest level, but again we ignore the details and use higher level languages, where creating a variable hides everything that really goes on.

Those are all important things to learn but pretty overwhelming up front.JS has two pretty massive advantages that make it popular in application development, both which come with its ties to web technology: (1) it works on *every single dang device*, and the installation process for web apps is ""click link, load page"" which is delightfully low-friction for devs and users, and (2) it comes with HTML+CSS, which are *incredible* tools for writing UIs.",sessamekesh,2025-09-08 21:51:17,11,learnprogramming,t3_1nbz7rd,False,

nd61e4q,"**JavaScipt** is most used because it is the built in language of the browser, meaning every website more or less has to use JavaScript. Websites make up a huge portion of what people do with computers so that alone gives it a major place. Asides for that you can use JavaScript as a server side language, and because of its role in frontend web dev people have increasingly used it to make the backend of websites also so they can do it all in one language. **Python** is the most commonly used language while dealing with AI, so it’s so surprised to me that with the AI boom of the last few years it’s being treated like that. It’s also an attractive language to new programmers because of its simple and clean syntax, and it’s long been used by data analysts for its ecosystem of data tools. **Rust** is well loved by its fans (myself included) because it has a lot of unique features which are really elegant once you learn to use them. If you’ve never used a language which treats errors as values using Rust’s Result type feels like a whole new way of thinking about effects in programming. Pattern matching on Enums feels so much more elegant than using a switch statement. For me at least it contains so many tools you can use to ensure that “invalid states are unrepresentable” at the type level, which feels so powerful and means that when you code actually compiles it does exactly what you want far more often than in other languages. It’s also just very cool to see a program you write in Rust run 50-100x faster than the same program in Python. Writing Rust can be painful, and it’s often very slow going, because actually getting it to compile is difficult. Rust is the perfect language for places where you need to be really confident in the correctness of your code and also have very high performance, but not if building things with any speed is the priority.

I actually hated it hahaha. But Kotlin and Native apps were more popular than cross-platforms libraries back then.Now 2025, I'm a L4 mobile app developer with React Native as a lot of companies moved from native code to React Native apps.From my above experience, starting with SPA and Apache Cordoba (or any other hybrid app solution) is a great start to how mobile apps are compiled.From there I would suggest React Native.Learning Kotlin or Swift is a plus, but not mandatory.Also, perhaps a bit of Flutter would be a great too!",Last_Being9834,2025-09-07 03:57:57,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nacgbl,False,

ncwx6qp,"Most of the other answers in this thread are wrong.Some people are saying that the addresses are different because forking creates a new address space. That doesn't explain the output because the new address space has new *physical* memory mappings for the same *virtual* address space, and the address you're printing is a virtual address. Userspace programs can't (easily) see physical addresses at all; they only see virtual addresses.Some people are saying this is due to address space randomization. That's wrong because ASLR doesn't change any of the virtual addresses in a forked process. (Doing that would require also updating every existing pointer to point to a different location, which would be super complicated.) The behavior shown in this example will be the same regardless of whether ASLR is on or off.The answer is really simple: **the variables have different addresses because they're different variables**, even though they have the same name. They are defined in different scopes and their lifetimes don't overlap.Your code is exactly the same as if you had defined `a` and `b` in the ""if"" branch, and `c` and `d` in the ""else"" branch. In that case it wouldn't be surprising at all that `a` and `c` have different addresses.More precisely, the variables are *allowed* to have different addresses. The C language compiler and the C language standard make no promises about the actual addresses that are used for different variables. (If you never use the `&` operator to look at a variable's address, it might never have an address at all -- it might be stored entirely in registers.) The actual results you get can depend on things like your compiler's optimization settings.If you change your example to take the address of the *same* variable on both sides of a fork, you'll see that the memory addresses are identical: https://godbolt.org/z/xPvWanz1dBut even though the virtual addresses are the same, the fork causes them to point to different physical mappings. So changes in the parent won't affect the child, or vice versa. (It's slightly more tricky to make an example that demonstrates this, because it requires synchronizing the two processes so that one process tries to read memory *after* the other one writes it.)",teraflop,2025-09-07 14:56:03,3,learnprogramming,t3_1naopyy,False,

It makes a new process with the same memory, then returns the result of that process.Edit: they are referencing the same stack, but it has to make a new reference to the head of the stack for the child.

Therefore the contents in parent and child processes are totally different, as in they are in different physical regions in memory (in reality is a little bit more complex, since usually the Copy-On-Write mechanism will be used). Nevertheless, even if you were using InterProcess (IPC) shared memory, where the underlying physical memory would be the same for both processes, they would still have different virtual addresses, since in general mmap won't map to the same virtual addresses the underlying physical memory region on both processes (unless explicitly requested to mmap to the same specific virtual addresses on both processes).",9larutanatural9,2025-09-07 09:40:20,1,learnprogramming,t3_1naopyy,False,

nci6r6q,"# CS50p:Yes good hands on problems to solve, though they are not projects this course still offers a good foundation to expand and cement your Python skills(epically since you are interested in machine learning). To explain, CS50p will cover these topics week by week for 10 weeks aka 10 online lectures:1. functions,2. variables,3. conditionals,4. loops,5. exceptions cases,6. using libraries,7. unit tests file I/O,8. regular expression,9. Object-Oriented Programming & classes,10. recursion.This is more about applying little programming technique week by week. Each week has a few problems to solve using and expanding on the skills you learned up to that point. These of course are not full projects, but still very good practice to learn skills in a controlled and friendly environment. They test problem solving skills as well which never hurts.# The Odin Project:This has excellent projects and to clarify The Odin Project is for front end and back end. It has an introduction course teaching HTML, CSS, and Java Script. Then you can choose to learn ruby or node.js or both and these advanced course are at least 5-8x longer than the introduction course so plenty to learn.The structure is:* You basically read a few curated lessons and external resources* Make a project which is a website such as: * Basic HTML page * Landing page with styling * Making web page games or interactive pages after learning Java Script * Even more advanced pages after learning more tools* This cycle of reading and making projects repeats itself. They have a discord to help you if you get stuck, but the course is pretty detailed/clear. Essentially there are many chances to make projects and if you feel comfortable you can make your own outside of the course.This is heavily project based as you are given a general goal when you reach a project assignment. Other than that you just make your own website following the general theme or requirements. This is also self graded but with web dev its pretty easy to see how well you did by viewing your website based on content, design, and functionality. You also get to learn about version control through Git and Git Hub. This is great since now you projects will be on a repository that you can make public or private as you wish. Furthermore you can actually see your website live and deploy it. For the beginner course they just make these websites hosted on Git Hub, but in the advanced course they show others ways of hosting and using more advanced tools.If you have more questions feel free to ask!",Valuable_Alps4139,2025-09-05 04:56:39,1,learnprogramming,t1_nchy74y,False,

Most of my personal experience is in React, but others like Vue or Elm. I often recommend egghead.io for beginner JS tutorials (I highly recommend [Kent C. Dodds' beginner React course](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react))If you're looking for backend/server-side development, everyone has their own opinions, but generally speaking, you can't really go wrong with Java, Go, or NodeJS (also JavaScript). You could also look into .NET, since you have C# experience. As far as where to start, I like to recommend thinking of a simple app idea (the classic example is a To-do List) and just try piecing it out into bite-sized tasks and plucking away until you have it working. Once you have it working, try and see if you can break it. Enter unexpected characters into an input, put in emojis, try to paste text, try to paste an image. Try to figure out where your code comes up short and then try to fix those issues until you have a solidly working application.

By now you also have idea of the political camps and power structure. Be balanced politically but start to identify potential allies and adversaries.Now that you have managements ear, switch into the final phase. Get the big players on your side. Show them how much they get to gain by supporting your vision. Because you are ready to fill the big shoes. This is the most political phase and most dangerous. But if you have the main players supporting you, you should be able to wrestle the rest of the keys. By now you have all the knowledge so gate keeping is not possible. You have built a cred and since you made your boss look good, he suddenly can't start to shit on you. The people who he will go to are on your side already because they see their own gain.

Understand why the world actually works the way it does rather than invent an explanation that’s convenient for you, and use that understanding to become hireable.",2cars1rik,2025-09-04 04:03:09,50,cscareerquestions,t3_1n7xtw4,False,
nccqxxa,"> It's also pretty easy to create a practical coding test in gitpod, and then do point-based scoring. But most managers never thought of that, nor attempted to do so. They take the easy way out. I had an interview just like this a month ago, it was interesting.I'm too late to the party, but here are my few comments. I am tipsy.I have been an occasional hiring manager/tech interviewer for last 15 years in companies of various sizes. From nough startups to couple of billions in current account. Disclaimer - I mostly mostly work in highly regulated backend area (gambling/fintech) as a senior/staff/principal.* In organisation of any size hiring manager has way less input into how we evaluate candidates than you would think. From the company perspective your CV requires at least a screening meeting (internal), chat with HR (yes, candidate looks promising!) and time slots from at least 2 seniors for at least 2 different meetings + EM meeting (position fit) + executive meeting (culture/ambitions fit).* * We cannot spend time on every single candidate. You really are asked to stand out to proceed, cost of hiring you approaches $100k in time commitment from everyone involved + another $100k for your onboarding. I must apologise, but that is what our in-house recruiters are responsible for.* Good companies do domain specific take home assignment with known gotchas (e.g. rounding issues, how to handle various dimensions depending on domain, performance considerations, ability to join two tables to start with, not even talking about various consistency scenarios). Yes, it sounds like unpaid work, but it is a fantastic filter between those that have a clue and those that copy paste from stack overflow. We are about to invest 12 months in you getting up to speed, we ask for 4-8 hours of you showing off your skills.* * These assignments usually are crafted with great care by rather highly paid engineers in the org. There can only be so many of them prepared, check glassdoor, it usually will spell out what you need to succeed.* LC is a good screener for 99% of candidates that couldn't code their way out of looking up data from users table. Anyone who displays awareness of constraints, different naming nomenclatures, jeez (here comes the dragons) - time zones ... or even utf8mb4 v utf8mb3... automatically a plus.* Always remember that we WANT TO HIRE YOU! Seriously! We wouldn't be hiring otherwise! What seems to be a field of obstacles is not meant to discourage you, but to make sure you get a face time with your peers whose opinion will really count. Please accept that if my week is 40 hours and every day i have 2 hours blocked for hiring (with 15 minutes before each meeting to research candidate background, 15 minutes afterwards to summarize my notes and provide feedback all while actually moving business forward...) Executive or EM discussion fail can very easily be overriden if 2 actual team members says ""5 stars, he/she/they will fit GREAT"".* Candidates should and will be treated equally. Ignoring cases where candidate had a nervous breakdown during interview (has happened, more than once. it's not a showstopper, it's a stop-the-interview and reschedule to start from tabula rasa. One of the few things big tech gets right is to dismiss outlier incidents), we do need to show that we care about results, not about gender, race, etc. And we are pretty objective about it. Except positive bias.---As for your specific comment that most managers are bad. I used to think the same until I became an engineering manager. There's so fucking much politics and shoulder playing between teams and horse trading to just move ahead with the project that is our job to shield you from.Yes, you think your ticket with specification and acceptance criteria is done and easy and you can just proceed. 50% of the time that feature is actually under a chopping axe because someone else in the company wants to take eventual credit for it / is unable to formulate where their API points are expected to be / knows that you are doing null work that will be discarded because corporate strategy has separate team working on replacement. Sucks, but not due to you and not due to your EM.",Itchy-Science-1792,2025-09-04 11:17:35,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1n7xtw4,False,
ncbl32z,"Hard disagree as someone who is currently an IC, has been a manager, and in both roles have conducted quite a few interviews. I conducted over a dozen last month.For the record, our interviews include some discussion with the candidate on their experience, a leetcode type question, and some system design. The leetcode question is not meant to be difficult, and we use something that is classified as easy or homegrown stuff that is similarly quite easy. One question we often use, for example, has a very trivial n^2 solution (literally try every pair of values and make sure the index of j is after i).When I am conducting interviews everything matters. It's not just a black and white do you solve the question and I check off the box. Here's a list of some things that I am looking at to make a decision that aren't just * How quickly do you start solving and how quickly do you solve it? Does it look like you've seen the question before? Does it look like someone else or AI is solving the question for you?* How well can you articulate what your solution is and how it works? Do you articulate what your approach to the question is before you write code or after?* If you run into problems, what do you do for debugging? Are you reading the error logs? Are you printing things to see?* If you are struggling with the question, do you ask questions? What kind of questions do you ask? How long does it take for you to ask a question when you're stuck?* Our question has one common pitfall (which is honestly quite obvious). Do you fall for this? If you do, when I explain what is happening, can you pick up on where you fell into that pitfall? Do I have to explain it very explicitly or can you pick it up?* Can you even code? Do you run into basic syntax problems? Do you know what help to ask me for on the syntax issues? Does it look like you barely even know how to code?* Are you cognizant of the time we have and what our expectations are?* I specifically ask the candidate two follow up questions every time the answer is solved: what is the runtime complexity and is your solution optimal. This helps me figure out what kind of more formal education the person has (because all of us remember studying big O notation, right?). This also helps me figure out if they're capable of scrutinizing their own code. It also helps me see how they tackle a problem that may not have an obvious answer (or even one at all).Don't conduct an interview with a question that doesn't have a purpose. In fact, don't do things that don't have at least half a dozen purposes. Everything I do has a purpose and helps me evaluate it. I have absolutely no problem letting you sit in silence for 10 minutes as you mumble to yourself about your solution, it will help me see how you think. Heck, if you want to sit there in silence and write no code and ask zero questions it will show me how collaborative you want to be (and I explicitly mention they're welcome to ask me questions, even to ask for help). I very intentionally do not use difficult questions because I very intentionally want to measure other things. I could care less if you remember how to invert a binary tree or the difference between Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms or any of that mumbo jumbo that, as you point out, will never be useful on the job. I do care if you can reason your way through something new and present a working solution, even if it means asking someone for help.",TehLittleOne,2025-09-04 04:51:23,12,cscareerquestions,t3_1n7xtw4,False,

Under the reorg, my team would have been flattened, and I would go from five direct reports to well over a dozen. I chose to become an IC. I was a good people manager, but not so strong when it came to other aspects of the role, and a wider team would have put more stress on those aspects of the job.Going back to technical work was easy as I had a very technical team and had been very engaged in the work we were doing. The challenge was going from setting my own agenda based on our organization's goals and priorities to having some of that agenda decided for me, but I was a senior employee with solid tech skills and good instincts for which work really mattered/made an impact.

Usually, it's these:* Infrastructure/Networking* Application Orchestration* Observability* Internal ToolsTo start, pick one to go deep into, and develop a passable understanding of the rest. You will accumulate a deeper understanding of everything over time, and gain an instinct for what you should understand (principles) and what you can discard (bitrotting technical details). Work with your manager to get projects in the specific pillar you want to gain expertise in if possible. If that's not possible, pick something else for now and come back to it.When you're working on stuff, take notes on things that you learn that could be helpful in the future.

I've worked at two places now that concurrently supported services written in either Java or Go. The benefits of Go are pretty obvious since you don't need to allocate a giant arena for the JVM so cloud costs can usually get reduced using it. So its become more attractive in that sphere. If your company runs on bare metal that benefit doesn't really hold true.So basically I'd say if you're looking to get a job in the near term Java is still the safer bet but I only see Go's usage increasing as time goes on.

The job wasn't really an SWE position either, was some kind of weird support gig that was supposed to lead to one.Second layoff was June 2018, after several hops and it was the first startup I ever worked for. Landed my next job exactly a month after being laid off, like to the day. Got back into SWE full time in 2012 so at this point I had about 6 years of experience. The full interview process took about 2 weeks.Third layoff was in February 2023 and also only took about a month. VP told a bunch of us about a colleague of his that was hiring, I recognized the name as a recruiter I connected with at a conference about five years earlier. Pinged the recruiter on LinkedIn and got in the mix quickly. This one took about 1.5 to 2 weeks.Fourth layoff was October 2024, and it took about a month to land my current gig. Went to a local user group meeting I hadn't been to in a couple years, which was having its first meeting in the offices of the place I now work for, also their last meeting of the year.

You are within your rights to be annoyed, and your leverage is the fact that you can look for a different job. If the tasks are sufficiently different from the job req, you might be able to collect unemployment if you leave the job, but I am neither a lawyer or expert in these laws.If you want to bring this up to your manager in a professional way, you should acknowledge the assignments, assure him that you intend to perform your assigned duties to the best of your ability, but then directly tell him you are dissatisfied with this type of work and it does not match the expectations you had when taking the job. As long as you continue to do your tasks well, a good manager shouldn’t hold it against you if you express dissatisfaction. That being said, they might take this as an implicit threat to leave the role as soon as you find something better. Think carefully about what leverage you have and what other options you have. If you are a high performer and aren’t too worried about finding another job, you have a lot of leverage, and you could even consider making your intentions to seek another job explicit. If one or the other of those things is not true, then you don’t have much leverage, and I wouldn’t expect your manager to change anything.",JOA23,2025-09-08 14:33:14,4,cscareerquestions,t3_1nboy03,False,

He then put me on software tasks (in addition to lesser procurement)But this is more difficult as it looks to be full time. You might want to print out the offer letter (and JD) that says you'd be working with C++, Comp. Vision, AI etc. Talk 1-on-1 with your manager about how this is not what you signed up for.

You might need to negotiate that while you are willing to do **some** integration work you want to focus on the tasks you were originally hired to do.

nd3mt1q,"I'll echo the others - bait and switch happens all the time. It's happened to me a couple of times and I've unfortunately had to do that with some employees. A backgrounder on what maybe going on. I am sure given they were onboarding you in that position that the intent was to keep you there. A couple things could have happened. I don't have all the details on your particular situation but generically it can be: (1) they really need someone to do the hardware/software integration and you're the new guy so you get to do it or (2) your performance may not be what they were looking for and they're trying you in this role because it's easier & a lot less expensive to reassign vs terminating. Yeah, the second one stings and is a shitty move for the person affected. But it happens and that's often the rationale. I hired someone for a front end UI development job - had stellar references, had really good work in his portfolio, passed our coding exam - and their code quality in the first 90 days was really, really bad. Like do over with the help of a senior developer bad. IDK where we messed up in catching this but after a particularly disastrous demo with my co-founder and our sales team, we had to figure something out. He was a good guy and tried hard and asked for help. We didn't want to just fire this guy 90 days later. So we gave him very small features and a lot of customer support and operations which we needed (and were about to open a role for). The big difference here is that I and my VP of Engineering had a call and explained why were making the role change. He was disappointed but okay with it. I think the big one here is your manager didn't have the stones to tell you why. I bet if he did, you still might be pissed or wanting to leave but at least you'd know. Also, politically, this manager may have been told to fill that software integrator immediately by higher ups. Maybe sales is pissy because the integration isn't done or it doesn't work or whatever. He may not have had a choice. This is pretty common and may be a reason why he didn't want to tell you. Or he's a jerk or a coward. Here's what you may want to consider: 1. Have a conversation with your manager. Be friendly and open. Do not go in there loaded for bear about the job switch and presenting any kind of threat that you're going to leave. You don't have leverage. The manager could call your bluff and you're out a job. Just ask them ""hey, curious why the job role change? Is there a problem?"" And if you can hold your nose and do it, you can say something like ""I get it I'm helping out and I'd really like to get back to my other work. Can you give me an ETA or some idea of when that will happen?"". Do not mention the other job openings, etc, etc - you're going to set yourself up for a fight that now your manager is going to feel like they have to win. 2. If you don't like the answer, vote with your feet. Start looking for a new job immediately. Do a good job at your current role, keep quiet, and get out. I think you've already seen enough signs that this isn't a good company or manager to work for. These things tend not to get better. 3. If your manager gives you a legit reason like ""upper management needs this role filed and you were the new guy/best choice"" or ""we need someone to cover this for 6 months"" then again you'll need to evaluate. You \*might\* get to back to your own role but I'll tell you that if you're filling a gap, people aren't going to want to move you.

Every single person who had worked on the system had quit before I got there and there was basically no documentation. Here’s what I did:1. Spent about 1 month reading, understanding, and *documenting* as much as I could. What’s the path of a regular request? What is each backend responsible for? I also drew a massive map in LucidCharts (whatever, pick your favorite drawing site) with arrows and boxes for the different backends and whatnot. I wrote 12 pages of documentation that is likely still being referenced today. 2. Make sure to make absolutely clear how cooked you are. Right now, you are learning how to navigate and understand a large, unknown codebase. Inform your manager that whatever change they’re requesting will take over a month (or however much time) because you need to orient yourself and nobody can help you. It also helps to bring up that you are only here for a few months and want to help make sure that other engineers are able to make fixes after you’re gone. 3. Try to figure out how to make changes, test, and receive feedback on those changes without bricking the system. For example, make custom endpoints/functions/whatever in the relevant backend that only you know of and use those to test logic before pasting it into the actual production code. It may even be good to inform your manager and seniors what error handling/logging currently looks like, and see if you can improve it. If making whatever fix is made impossibly difficult before this, let your manager/seniors know you need to be able to properly debug or you can’t make the fix. This may seem sucky, but it was honestly an excellent learning experience for me. Although frankly, your situation seems worse than mine haha. You have to be bluntly honest about how screwed you are for whatever deadline they’re trying to push for that fix. You’re an intern lol.

nc7xv3g,"Building confidence in this market requires focusing on what you can control rather than external factors. Keep your skills sharp through consistent practice and stay updated on relevant technologies in your field, but don't chase every new trend. Having a solid emergency fund reduces desperation and gives you negotiating power during job searches.For quick job placement after layoffs, preparation matters more than speed. Maintain an updated resume, active LinkedIn presence, and professional network even while employed. Document your achievements with specific metrics and keep a portfolio of recent work ready. Many developers wait until they're unemployed to start networking, which puts them at a disadvantage.The harsh reality is that ""quickly"" landing new jobs isn't realistic in the current market for most people. Even experienced developers are facing longer search periods than in previous years. Setting expectations of 3-6 months for job searches prevents the anxiety that comes from unrealistic timelines.Focus on financial preparation over trying to become ""layoff-proof"" since job security has decreased across the industry. Having 6-12 months of expenses saved provides genuine confidence because you can be selective about opportunities rather than accepting the first offer out of desperation.Consider contract or consulting work as bridge income rather than holding out exclusively for permanent positions. This keeps money coming in and often leads to full-time opportunities while maintaining your professional network.The confidence issue often stems from comparing your situation to the boom years of tech hiring.

ndb4kzx,"I hate to break this to you too: the stress of applying for external jobs is going to be WAY higher than navigating the social situation with your manager. The key is to not set expectations about anything unless it benefits you. Telling your manager the you're not going to apply for any other internal roles doesn't benefit you and sets an expectation that you might have to break for something that actually does benefit you. This case seems fine to pivot, just avoid pigeon-holing future-you with unnecessary restrictions to fulfil expectations set by present-you when there's no gain.",ExpensivePost,2025-09-09 18:25:37,1,cscareerquestions,t1_ndb2x2l,False,

ndaiedj,"1. Nobody expects you to quit before looking for a new position. In a perfect world, you should be exploring for opportunities constantly and not just when you feel the need to change jobs or have quit / been fired. It never hurts to know your market value and the available openings, up to you whether you want to do that daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly, whatever fits your goals.2. Never tell your boss or company that you're applying elsewhere. Any prospective employer will ask for permission before contacting your current employer, so really they should have no way of knowing unless you're publicly posting about it. Schedule interviews on WFH or PTO days, say you have an appointment, call in sick, etc.3. Again, no reason to try to hide your current employment. Just have an answer prepared for when they inevitably ask why you're leaving your current position. Never bad-mouth your current employer, that doesn't look good on you. Be honest or just say it was time for a change, you wanted a fresh challenge, exploring different fields, etc.4. Again for interviews just do whatever is necessary. It's 100% worth it to take a day off work or call in sick or make up some bs excuse. And if you've made it to the final stage, you know they're seriously interested in you and will accommodate for your schedule for interview dates/times.Do not tell your current job ANYTHING until you have a signed the new offer letter.
