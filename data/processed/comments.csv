I was quite satisfied until I was asked to conduct technical interviews for few of new future team members with 4-5 years of experience each. The interviews went well, and I shortlisted several candidates for further rounds.Last week, I was pulled into a call with HR, the Team Director, and PM, where I learned that they had shortlisted two candidates, both with around 5 years of experience. However, both candidates turned down the offers, requesting better compensation. The salary they rejected was approximately $11,750 more than what I currently earn annually. I would like an extra 800$ every month, Who wouldn't?This revelation devastated me. When I discussed it with friends, everyone told me there's no point trying to negotiate a raise with my current organization. They advised me to either start interviewing elsewhere and leave, or only discuss a raise when I have a competing offer in hand. According to them, there's no easier alternative - either accept the status quo and continue doing what you're doing, or pursue what you believe you're worth.Most companies show no empathy toward their employees and view them merely as workhorses.

This is fairly common though, so the thought of cloning a prod table to dev environment could get you in trouble. Generally speaking though, any transformative logic that needs to be worked out can be done via specially curated files containing essential data points and scenarios within the data. Or you can simply write up a script against prod data so you can ensure your features make sense and then plug that in. Though in my experience the latter is less common.And yes during deployment phase you would ensure that these parameters that point to specific environments would be replaced with the relevant environment that the code has been merged to. Dev -> Test, Test -> Stage, etc… keep in mind though that there are times where dev, test, stg, prod are not simply different schemas in a larger database but are entirely different databases/workspaces themselves and have maintained the same naming convention so sometimes nothing needs to change.

mu3n6tj,"Let’s put it this way - dbt takes care of a lot of the procedural aspects of data pipelines. Instead of having to think through how to handle things like incremental loads, materialization, and workflow, you can just focus on the model definition. It shifts the focus to creating and maintaining the business logic instead of the mechanics of getting data from a to b. You write your model to show you the output you want, and it takes care of the rest. We use dbt in our databricks pipelines currently, and it makes management of 100s of models MUCH easier. Also, you can create tests using dbt to verify that the results you want match certain criteria - things like uniqueness, completeness, etc. it also has pretty good methods for tracking lineage and adding documentation, and you can create reusable macros across projects. Ultimately, dbt is a great framework for maintaining all the business logic that goes into semantic models. All that said, when it comes to raw ingestion, python notebooks or dlt pipelines are still the way to go.

mt58el1,"Wait, am I understanding correctly: did you set up Airflow such that it is pulling DAG code from multiple repos? That's what the ""git submodules"" thing makes me believe is going on.My advice: do not do that. Unless you have literally thousands of engineers, **just do a monorepo for Airflow DAGs**. There are few reasons to make it more complicated than that and there are a lot of upsides to the monorepo in terms of how real world projects develop, in addition to just relieving yourself of the deployment headache (which is the #1 reason). Those other reasons are:- a single commit can touch multiple DAGs across multiple projects- projects can share Airflow-level utils- sync dependencies in Airflow runtime- external DAG dependencies- easier to run a local version of the whole instance if your Airflow isn't dependent on CI-specific things to glue things together- less magicSo save yourself the headache and just do the monorepo.From there, deployment is very simple. Every major Airflow deployment method, including the Helm Chart but also MWAA and Astronomer, just mounts the `dags/` folder as a volume, and so deployments that do not introduce new dependencies are as simple as updating the folder.External systems that get called by Airflow can be in their own separate repos, but know where the dividing line is between those systems and Airflow as an orcestrator: KubernetesOperator, CloudRunCreateJobOperator, EcsTaskRunOperator. Yes modifying the `argv` of a container's command requires two commits across two separate repos, but that's not a big deal (cross-DAG commits are way more annoying when they're cross-repo; within-DAG commits being cross-repo is really not that annoying. The monorepo really wants to optimize for that case to be easier).Also, never ever use git submodules.

Learning from other people is a crutch and always will be. I always thought in my previous career ""well, I'll just learn from this person until I can stand on my own two feet, and everything will be fine"". It never happened. I never improved and ended up hating my job because I became more experienced on paper, but in reality, my knowledge didn't correlate with my experience. And it showed.When it came to DE, I taught myself and found it liberating not feeling like I was stuck, waiting for somebody else to hold my hand all the time. I could just look at a piece of work, play around, get a feel for it and then continue from there. Every time I learnt something new, it stuck much harder because I discovered it myself rather than somebody saying, ""Make sure you sort out XYZ"" before I had time to think about it.On top of that, it's another incentive to go ahead and start building instead of another excuse to sit on social media all day, pushing you into the greatest trap - the illusion of learning.My recommendation is to stop chasing the ideas of other people and develop your own. Knowing what's good and what's bad comes with time. It's really common with beginners that they want to be perfect from the get go, so go out of their way to try and seek knowledge from people who claim to know more.

Are you talking about like adding columns or adding new fact and dimension tables? Any data warehouse will require maintenance, add new features, etc. but if you are doing a regular major rework, that is either a business issue or you may need to consider evaluating a skill gap on your team around data modeling.Lastly, this would be a poor KPI. Like some other folks of said, it would be similar to counting lines of code. If you are looking for some good KPIs, general ones that I’m a fan of are:1. Data Quality time to resolution. How long does it take from when a data quality bug is reported to it being fixed.2. How many Data Quality issues get through to end users. If you do not have a good data quality test suite in place, you will end up with a lot of bad data getting presented to end users which loses trust and can potentially be costly to the business.3. Data Platform uptime. The percentage of time the data platform is available and appropriately supplying data.

So I think it could be useful where: \- A: you need to interact with non-technical staff\- B: You need controls (e.g. security, special data processing rules, high complexity) that warrant implementing via code and having that version controlled-- think GDPR compliance on automating marketing data workflows.\- C: The data you are working with relies heavily on 3rd party connections (e.g. CRM data from Hubspot).I'm still exploring, so would love to hear what others are thinking, but I think it's one of the best tools out to build quick AI workflows while having some form of version control and staying on a local machine.",on_the_mark_data,2025-05-23 17:20:30,1,dataengineering,t3_1ktc6so,False,

mty4gug,"Practical advice: You mention wanting to organise your files but didn't state a clear end goal. You have to first ask yourself: why is it important and/or useful for me to organise this? What benefits do I hope to achieve? Answering those first will give you some guidelines on what needs to be done. Then from there you can pick specific techniques. Though it's important to note that having a 'random stuff' drawer where everything gets put in with no sorting can actually be useful since it cuts the cognitive load of having to sort things. If you haven't found a compelling reason to organise it after 15 years then it's a strong indication that you either don't have a strong reason to do it, or the system you currently use - albeit informal - is workable enough.Ok now I get to put my autistic hat on: As an autistic person I have at times enjoyed organising things 'for their own sake'. Whilst it's been fun and I learned a lot, the end results were never anything \*that\* useful. If you're anything like me then just be aware of it. It's fine to spend time and enjoy the process but be cautious about any perceived future benefit.The system I like best for lots of random stuff is the PARA method. You can start by dumping everything into one big 'archive' folder and then either move things out one-by-one into an organised place, or you can move things ad-hoc when you 'touch' them. e.g. if you find yourself needing to use an old python script or look at certain docs, then make sure to move those into the organised structure when you do so.",nNaz,2025-05-24 02:46:06,2,dataengineering,t3_1kro76m,False,

mt9w1yj,Are you running on-premises or in the cloud? You have to deploy a web server that can handle the request/response process for your REST API.,Nekobul,2025-05-20 10:49:46,2,dataengineering,t3_1kr1azg,False,
mtcstrz,"One way of doing it could be trough some orchestrator like airflow, or dragster. You create a dag that compiles and run your model and exposes the orchestrator api.But it might be to complex.I would probably create a fast api app and expose its api ( secure it and so on).Calling your api would create a background task that compiles the dbt project and run it. Not using the background task could make the request timeout coz it take some time.And this could be your biggest problem: this would take a lot of time.Is it possible to compile your model in different variations and then use correct version based on the columns in the request? If not the case- try catching the queries so if an user calls with columns a and b. You compile the models and save the compiled model in a map. Colums as a key. When next time the same user calls the api with the same columns they do not go trough the pain of compiling it. And as one suggest previously wrap the dbt in a service with the queue. So it work on one request at a time.Lots of additional questions could be asked but it seems like nice interesting task.",PotokDes,2025-05-20 20:10:25,1,dataengineering,t3_1kr1azg,False,

It automates some of the heavy lifting and has great built-in features like security and database schema mapping. Plus, it works nicely with a range of databases if you ever need to switch things up.

There's other views after that but the point is to store unstructured, then structure on read. You can do stuff like materialised views if you need more performant reads. The benefit of this approach is your ETL doesn't break if the object contents change, and you can always just change the views to reflect evolving schema.

And why do you specify your filter conditions in lambdas?

For example, if you had a DataFrame with the tablename, api, and offset cached, then when you chain a proper spark filter off of that it can avoid making API calls for the other tables in the first place, because it can apply the filter earlier in the sequence (as the value never changes). It can't figure that out when you're using rdds and lambdas.Also, it has to serialise every row to python, so python can deserialise it, just so that python can execute a basic equality check.

mu68y4x,"> how about check pointing?RDD checkpointing should give you a similar effect, but only within a session and only if you specifically pull that RDD by id. If you rerun the pyspark code you'll generate a new RDD definition. Even though *you* know you'll get the same result, spark can't tell, so it is a new RDD.> I start from RDD but you start with UDFThat's not really the distinction. Both versions are running a python function on the executors with input args being sent over from the spark data. The only distinction with a UDF is that the `udf()` call is a wrapper so that you can call the function as if it were a spark function and send it column definitions, whereas in an `rdd.map()` you pass the function reference (rather than call it), and it takes the whole row as its arg.The main difference is to process everything once and just save the json output as text as you go with no further processing. That will complete the data retrieval step, without mixing in possible issues or errors from anything else that could unnecessarily cause you to have to hit the API again. It is a lot like making a 'bronze layer' for your overall process. There's likely little overhead in writing then reading back the data, since it can likely write the data while it is still processing requests, and also because spark is going to have to go over the data multiple times to infer the json schema anyway.> What is the benefit of using UDF over RDD in first place?Again, it isn't a UDF over an RDD. A UDF is just a way to wrap a python call so you can use it as if it is a spark function that takes columns as input, rather than passing a function reference and that function having to take a whole row.For one thing, it is a bit faster because spark only has to serialise (and python deserialise) the specific columns that go into the function, which can help performance when the row is very wide. It also means that spark can potentially skip execute the UDF entirely, if its output isn't required for anything.A benefit with using DataFrames is that spark can optimise things by cutting out steps that aren't necessary. Here as an example you can run locally -- just do a `pip install pyspark` and make sure you have openjdk17 with JAVA_HOME set. import json from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col, lit from pyspark.sql.types import StringType spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() data = [ (""A"", 0), (""A"", 100), (""B"", 0), (""B"", 100), ] input_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=""category STRING, offset INT"") input_df.show() def python_func(category: str, offset: int) -> str: with open(""side_effect.txt"", ""a"") as filewriter: filewriter.write(f""{category}:{str(offset)}\n"") return ""--"" python_func_udf = udf(python_func, StringType()) ( input_df.filter(col(""category"") == lit(""A"")).withColumn( ""python_func_call"", python_func_udf(col(""category""), col(""offset"")) ) ).write.format(""noop"").mode(""overwrite"").save()If you run this once and open `side_effect.txt` you'll see that it *only* has rows where the input data `category` column is equal to `""A""`. Spark *completely skipped* processing the other rows, and the python function was never called for them.In your original example spark *cannot* know what the result of the filter is going to be, because it is being done in Python code. Therefore it must execute the entire source RDD and push every row in its entirety through the filter function in order to get the correct results. This is what causes the execution of the 'invoices' json rdd to also hit the api for the purchase_orders endpoint, even though that data won't go into that RDD.If you use DataFrames from the beginning, and use a DataFrame filter to pick the table you are processing, spark will *only* hit the API for the rows that match your filter, even though you specified the filter in a later step. You could avoid this double-processing without even trying.---The actual suggestion is to stick with DataFrames and just save the data immediately. Then after pulling down the data from the API -- which is *highly* likely to be the slow part -- and saving it, you can just read it back to do everything you need. You *have* the data, you just need to process it. You can take the response json strings and write them out to 'text' files, then read them back in 'json' format and spark will do all the schema inference for you. You can even automatically split up the writes by table in a single pass by setting a partition on the tablename, then read back just the files for a specific table. from pyspark.sql import SparkSession from pyspark.sql.functions import udf, col, explode_outer from pyspark.sql.types import ArrayType, StringType spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate() # set up API calls data = [ (""Invoices"", ""https://api.example.com/invoices"", 0), (""Invoices"", ""https://api.example.com/invoices"", 100), (""Invoices"", ""https://api.example.com/invoices"", 200), (""PurchaseOrders"", ""https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders"", 0), (""PurchaseOrders"", ""https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders"", 150), (""PurchaseOrders"", ""https://api.example.com/purchaseOrders"", 300), ] input_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=""tablename STRING, endpoint STRING, offset INT"") def fetch_responses(endpoint: str, offset: int) -> list[str]: response_body = YOUR_REQUEST_RESPONSE return response_body fetch_responses_udf = udf(fetch_responses, ArrayType(StringType())) # define the process to fetch the data and save it as-is to avoid reprocessing due to errors responses_col = fetch_responses_udf(col(""endpoint""), col(""offset"")).alias(""response_array"") get_everything_df = input_df.select(""*"", responses_col) get_everything_df.write.format(""parquet"").save(SOME_SCRATCH_SPACE_PATH) # use the saved data to generate the per element data and save to separate folders per table fetch_each_col = explode_outer(responses_col).alias(""response"") per_element_df = get_everything_df.select(""tablename"", fetch_each_col) per_element_df.write.format(""text"").partitionBy(""tablename"").save(SOME_PATH_FOR_YOUR_JSONL_TABLEDATA) # now read back for your desired tablename - this uses the hive style partitioning to pick just one table invoices_df = spark.read.format(""json"").load(SOME_PATH_FOR_YOUR_JSONL + ""/tablename=invoices"")",azirale,2025-05-25 14:05:24,1,dataengineering,t1_mu012a9,False,

It's pretty much the only way you can hit massive scale without expensive join operations.. you need to join a bill rows to a million you're better off using nested arrays.. or in other instances when you'd normally have to flatten table a get lots of data multiplicity you can get the benefit of speed without the storage and processing penalty. Also bit of a red flag seeing you mention changing data often.. it's purely a OLAP not an operational store.. that's what AlloyDB is for..,Tiny_Arugula_5648,2025-05-25 20:25:40,2,dataengineering,t3_1kvbr5b,False,

mt8cbqt,"[I’ve answered this same question before](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/s/rsxWDC8zme) and my answer is the same, so I will just quote it here.—As a personal recommendation I have found that learning how to program is best facilitated and supported by using a language that can be used to interact with some personal interest that the learner has. This allows you to use an existing passion to help fuel a growing passion— or, more literally, you will be less bored and more curious and driven to experiment and learn, because you have the ability to apply your learnings to something you already enjoy.In my case, I believe this to be true because I picked up JS to write some user scripts that helped me automate some tasks as a customer support worker. This experimentation of using programming to help me make my life easier lead to me learning other languages for other things, but in general having that user script to work on while I was doing customer support allowed me to actively identify and experiment with new features that could make the job easier for me. That experimentation is what made me keep going with coding, because of the instant gratification provided by my new feature making my job easier.Ultimately, if you can think of an every day thing that you do that you deposit a significant amount of time into, if you can find a language that will allow you to effectively “hook into” and augment that interest of yours, you will find it a lot more rewarding and satisfying to write code.Practically speaking, with Java or Python as your two presumptive options, if you’re interested in AI you will have to use Python. On the other hand, I know so many people who have tried python and just given up on coding, while I know so many people who have gotten into Java development because they wanted to write mods for Minecraft— this Java development then blossomed into a career in software development.If you play Minecraft, learn Java. You’ll be able to write mods for the game and play with them and this will help you keep your curiosity and enthusiasm.",I_Lift_for_zyzz,2025-05-20 02:28:47,6,learnprogramming,t3_1kqsuoi,False,

Form POSTs specifically predate CORS and developers have always been allowed to submit a form to another domain by simply creating `<form action=""bank.com/...` HTML and either tricking the user into clicking the submit button or submitting automatically with JS. This wouldn't allow an attacker to see the response to a cross-domain form post, but it would allow you to make the cross-domain form post.

mtmlo5v,"I understand, in fact I think we all understand. Everyone here will have had similar thoughts at one time or another. The number of projects I or friends of mine have started and never finished massively outweighs the ones completed, that's the nature of things. Even the ones that got done were a struggle, you have to decide when something is truly worth pushing through for and make yourself do it (sometimes because you really believe in it, sometimes just because you're being paid). Otherwise chalk it up to learning and move on. I think the main thing is for you to release some of the pressure you're putting on yourself. Your family wants you to do well, and you want to do well for their sake, but pushing yourself into a corner won't help with that. Focus on what you're doing, not anyone else. Finish your masters. Put effort into looking for a job, but understand there's no guarantee so don't punish yourself if you're having trouble. If getting a job was easy, or guaranteed, everyone would be following the same path. That path doesn't exist. Just do your best, play your cards as well as you can, and hope like the rest of us. You are not special, or in other words, you're as special as any of us. Everyone fails sometimes, even the best in the world, everyone can compare to another and think ""damn I wish I had that"". As long as you keep going, maybe some day you can make something amazing and be someone special for that moment - but that moment always fades, glory never lasts forever. Nobel prize winners will wake up one morning and dread plugging away at the next thing, wondering if they've lost their touch... point I'm making is you carry on going regardless, sprinting or crawling, that's the only way it all happens. No-one stops ""feeling like a failure"", not permanently. Don't stress the low points, and try to keep your mind clear so you can recognise when you've got the chance for brilliance and take it when it happens. Personally, and this is where the sub might disagree, my excitement and curiosity is all around the crazy progress being made in AI tech. Big changes are on the horizon, if you ask me, so try to stay flexible and see if you can take advantage of that in some way. The job market is bad for non-seniors right now, but we have no idea how it's going to shake out over the coming year or so. Stay alert, learn whatever you can, and hold on for the ride. Anyone telling you they *know* what's about to happen is lying, or foolish. TL;DR - Finish your masters. - If you can get a job, any job, great. Working for money is an experience just like learning a new tech. - If you can't, try to survive. Everything is about to be turned upside down anyway (IMO). - Nothing is forever. Falling behind and pulling back ahead again are natural in the rat race of life. - Relax. As much as is possible. You're 22, you have many, many high points and low points ahead of you. - Do your best and hope.

mtn3yxx,"I've been programming for 8 years, and honestly, this feels like one of the toughest times to be a developer — even my boss, who’s been in the industry for 20 years, agrees. The engineering world is in a bit of a strange place right now. With the rise of AI and a shaky global economy, tech jobs have become harder to find. But I do believe this will shift in time.One big challenge is that many people involved in hiring aren’t developers themselves. They're often finance-driven decision-makers who don’t fully understand the nuances of engineering work. That can make things frustrating — especially when the hiring process includes unrealistic coding challenges that don't reflect real-world development.These days, there’s a dangerous expectation that every dev needs to be ""elite."" The truth is, tech moves fast, and everyone has different strengths. Some are more technical, others better at architecture or communication. The role of a developer is evolving — communication, collaboration, and adaptability are becoming just as important as coding skills. The era of working in isolation, coding for hours without interruption, is mostly gone.Still, there *will* be jobs. The industry is in transition, and once it stabilizes, opportunities will open up again. Try not to stress about being “mediocre” — imposter syndrome is incredibly common, even among experienced developers. I’ve been doing this for years and still feel it at times, but I’ve learned that most people do.At the end of the day, software development is about solving problems and moving data — it doesn’t have to be overcomplicated. Many tools and frameworks have added unnecessary layers, but the core principles remain the same.So hang in there. Keep learning, stay curious, and don’t compare yourself to others. Just focus on getting a little better each day — that’s how long, fulfilling careers are built. Yes i chucked this into chat gpt to fix my terrible grammar.

Also LeetCode and that type of programming doesn't really translate to real world projects. The best way to get better is by doing simple projects at first, and add complexity over time. For instance, I used to be a trainer for cyber developers in the C programming language. We used to start them off by having them build a simple calculator. What they didn't know is that we weren't really grading how well they could add and subtract numbers, but rather how secure their code was. Can I break it, or exploit it in some way? Are they checking for underflow and overflow? After a couple failed submissions they would finally catch on and understand what they needed to do to pass the tests. Next would be FileCalc, which is okay do the same thing, but all the equations are stored in files, and I want you to give me a file of all the solutions. Again we'd test them by giving them bad files to see if they were doing proper error handling and such. Then there was ThreadCalc, which was okay now do everything using a thread pool. And NetCalc, okay now do ThreadCalc but over a network.If they could do all of that we figured they had learned enough to be on the team and contribute. But it takes time. You do most of your learning through failing, not succeeding. So take everything you're doing right now and understand that it's hard and that's okay. Nobody should expect you to be able to contribute immediately unless you're experienced.Also, we have quite a few west point grads, and they struggle as much as anyone would. So don't feel like you're going through it alone. It takes time to get good. A lot of it is about pattern recognition. Over time you'll start to see what are called ""code smells"" and you'll immediately see things that look weird and out of place, which means you're improving. If you can look at code you did 6 months ago and your immediate reaction is: ""this is garbage"", then that's a tell-tale sign you're improving.

mtugqo2,"Good answers here, so I won't reiterate what has already been said, only mention that it was common to distinguish between ""programs"" and ""scripts"", where you could write a script inside another program, like Excel, and make it manipulate the objects that already existed in that environment.But if you wanted to run your code outside of that other program (it will always run inside *some* ""program"", like for instance the operating system) then you'd have to write a proper program. The idea was that you could write that in any text-editor you like, and then ""compile"" the source code to a binary program that could be run on its own.I use the past tense, because nowadays the differences are a lot more blurred - you can write programs in languages like Python and JavaScript inside spreadsheets (Google Sheets and Excel supports both, as far as I'm aware), or inside the browser, or custom applications, or you can write code on its own, but then execute it with a runtime. And often this runtime contains a virtual machine, and it is all very complicated, but you usually don't need to know - you just write your program in an IDE and then run it directly in the IDE while working on it, until you are done, and can run it from anywhere on the computer.I recommend getting started with Python - follow a tutorial to help you set everything up, and get something working.

You have Django, which is a powerhouse of a framework, making development of any backends very secure and reliable.Golang is very nice to use. Static typing makes it a lot easier to work with. Also, the performance is almost comparable to language like Rust and C++, especially considering how much easier it is to write good code in it. I personally quite like the community behind it. They seem to not like using too many dependencies, which alines with my personal preferences. Building a solid, thoroughly tested API in Go can be done exclusively using the standard library. It’s also very efficient. Small scale APIs and apps can run containerised on a few dozen megabytes of memory, which I imagine could be very good for freelancing, as it will lower cloud bills for clients. Unfortunately there is no Django-styled batteries included framework in Go, which can make development of smaller projects harder.I’m also going to add one more suggestion - Java.

Also, it has been running literally on billions of devices for decades, making it pass the test of time with flying colours.

Just say it, you don't have to *announce* that you're going to say it before you do.Anyway, the idea that corporations wanting things other than to create the most aesthetically pleasing code is ""greed"" is... Silly. As you mention in the article, if you create the most pleasant to look at, neatly organized code *that doesn't work,* you haven't created a ""masterpiece,"" you have created a dud. I could arrange the pieces of a car engine in them most pleasing, feng sui design I can, but *if the car doesn't drive* (or if it only drives unbearably slowly, or unreliably, or can't turn corners, ect) then the end result fails at its intended purpose.I think your article really helped cement for me, the idea that ""clean code"" is an *aesthetic* sensibility, not (at least primarily) a practical one. While there's some value in making things more aesthetic, and some of the principles of some conceptions of ""clean code"" overlap with functional concerns... It's always primarily about *what looks nice,* not what does the job the software was intended to do.I think it's a bit of a separate point to say that the code that exists is often influenced by the transient concerns of a complex system that produced / influenced the code, but... You're also not wrong about that. When we're looking at code someone else produced, we shouldn't assume they *intended* the code to look the way it does, in the sense that they approached a blank file and *decided* to produce the code you see. Far more often programmers are given an existing file, and told to ""make it work"" *without* enough time or resources to do a ""proper"" job. In a sense this is still ""bad"" code because it's creating legitimate technically debt... But it may not be bad because *the programmer* was bad - it may the best code that the programmer could create, given the constraints they were working with. (The most important of which was ""make it do what we want it to do."")Only sometimes is that because of true ""greed"" - usually it's because like any system, corporations have incentives to operate as close as possible to the line of failure, (hopefully *without* going over it, or having an acceptably low risk or failure anyway) in order to deliver the most functionality for least cost. That's stressful and upsetting for the humans tasked with ""making it work"" in that environment... But it's a *feature of any complex system,* not just corporations, and not just ""greedy"" systems.

mtwd7ys,"I can give you some advice, brother. What you should learn really depends on what you want to do with programming. Try answering these two questions:1. What kind of job or project do you want to do?2. What skills or technologies are commonly used in that field?I'm not too confident when it comes to frameworks, so I won't go into that. But based on my personal experience, here are a few examples of different paths you could take. Still, I highly encourage you to do your own research and explore further:1. If you want to make video games, it's useful to learn C++ and C#, along with engines like Unreal Engine (C++) or Unity (C#). C++ is a lower-level language, which gives you more control over performance, but it's harder to learn. C# is widely used in Unity and also good for building desktop GUIs.2. If you'd like to make websites, you'll need HTML and CSS to structure and style web pages, and JavaScript to make them interactive.3. Lastly, if you want to work as a data scientist or in the AI field, Python is the go-to language. Learn libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and so on. SQL is also important for managing and querying databases.Python is considered a high-level language, meaning it's easier to write and read, but it's further from the hardware compared to languages like C or C++. This means you have less control over performance, and in some cases, Python can be slower when executing certain types of code. If you want to learn JavaScript know that there's a lot of memes because it works in a.. strange way :face_with_tears_of_joy:Apart from this, you're surely making an excellent choice wanting to understand programming, I'm too ""at the beginning"", so this is everything I can give to you, hope I helped you brother!",CostRepulsive693,2025-05-23 20:30:52,11,learnprogramming,t3_1ktsh09,False,

To be entirely honest the best advice I can really give you is, ""just allow yourself to get into it"". If you are just discovering it, the journey will take you somewhere. Lua is often used for modding games as I understand it, so you could maybe play around with some of that. There are frameworks for building web applications in Lua.

That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t also be reading up on design patterns, data structures, language details, and algorithms. It just means that you do need to put that stuff into practice. You need to make mistakes and learn from them. Write something bad, and then go back and refactor it now that you know better. It’s a slow, iterative process. You should absolutely pick up source control, ideally, as you noted, git. You don’t need to be a wizard. Just get good enough that you’re not bricking your repo and losing progress all the time. Just absolute everyone uses it, and if they’re not, they’re still using source control, so the ideas are still good to know about. C++ can be tough for people. Between pointers, dependencies, templates, (Pre)Build Systems, and more, it’s not the easiest language. If it’s what you want to use though, you’ve really gotta just put your head down and learn enough to get cracking on some small to medium sized projects and get comfortable with some basic dependency management. Just in general, you’ll need to start thinking about writing code if your classes aren’t doing it. I was never a competitive programmer, nor did I do a ton of the puzzle or algorithm sites. My school was team project focused, and was self driven. So I was working on projects for 8 semesters. Often in between as well since they’d carry over. And I’d have side projects to learn a thing that I might bring back into the main project. I’d learn stuff alongside friends who were struggling with a topic over the summer (it’s how I started with the basics of Vulkan after it released in 2016, though, I’ve not evolved much beyond a beginner in graphics haha). I found projects worked for me. If you want something driven, give the puzzle and algorithm sites a try. But I think you should try to build out a few small projects that interest you.

The tools are changing continuously, don't get hung up on the tools themselves.Whether you are in the right field of study is something you must determine. Are you interested in it? Do you enjoy the challenges it provides? Do you see an opportunity to expand your skills and make meaningful contributions to projects or the field as a whole after getting your bachelor degree? Have you identified what subset of the discipline you are most interested in pursuing?You need to be motivated, interested, and willing to make mistakes and learn from them.

That can lead to code that's inefficient, or it can lead to not being able to understand why your code isn't working.Note that CS programs tend to teach very little about tools, frameworks, and libraries that are currently used in industry.

mtfkp21,"There are a lot of different engineering disciplines, all of them have their own ""take"" on programming.Of course the basics that you mention are shared: data structures, algorithms, stats, linear algebra, discrete math, etc are pretty much university year 1 and 2 kind of stuff for almost all technical disciplines. You need all that as a basis for advanced learning.However, where it differs is in how programming is used. I come from the angle of a computer engineering and robotics/mechatronics dropout.In CS you have a lot of focus on how to think about computation and the nature of the algorithm. Stuff like Big O / algorithmic efficiency, memory efficiency, information theory, a lot of Claude Shannon's foundational works, also cryptography. And of course, in the 4th year, operating systems, compilers, databases, consensus algorithms, network programming (which is a totally different kind of beast).In contrast, in Engineering, you will not need any of those things I mentioned in the CS paragraph.Computation in engineering, from a mechanical engineering perspective, is more about modeling, simulating physical properties/materials, extremely large scale numerical simulations (I think only the theoretical and experimental physicists deal with larger numbers) (aside: IEEE floating point is a mind bender!). Almost all of mechanical engineering programming challenges are safety related, as in if the program crashes or miscalculates, people die and processes explode or buildings come down or bridges collapse. So there is a lot of focus on ""tried-and-true"" methods of programming - no ""seat of the pants"" stuff there.The best C programming teacher I ever had was a mechanical engineer, and almost all of his programming experience comes from programming the feedback loop that controls a large scale blast furnace at smelters - the program uses measurements from various sensors, and then controls the smelting process. He drilled safety issues (error check, bounds check, input sanitisation, improper casting, huge possibility of improper pointer usage, saturation vs wraparound on overflow, pair programming, code review, using static analysis tools, etc) into every single lecture, because if the program crashes or miscalculates, thousands of litres of molten metal would spill and destroy the plant.Some of our homework assignments in C contain a magnitude more error checking and recovery code than actual executable code - of course this is not realistic for programming in the workforce, but his point of view is that no one else will teach defensive programming after we get out of his class, so might as well make us do it over and over again as homework until it's drilled into our brains. The evaluation criteria for this kind of assignment is him and the TA trying to hack/crash/exploit the program (for example, one easy trick is for them to give some unexpected inputs and seeing how your program deals with that, which is a basic form of fuzzing). They write up their report for you, and if you fix the issues they give the mark back.Mechatronics folks usually deal with real-time circuitry and need to complete evaluation loops within a pre-determined amount of time. Think bipedal robots that need to respond when it is about to fall - how does a robot recover from that situation? Things like aerospace engineering also fall into this category: how does a programmer create a ""fly-by-wire"" airplane program so it can correct and adjust pitch/yaw/roll, etc. within time and physical limits.In these use cases, recursion and dynamic memory allocation, both mainstays of CS oriented programming, is forbidden.Some Electrical Engineers programming to do DSP (digital signal processing) - where you take in a massive amount of data and you filter stuff out - DSP programming is kind of like creating filters and sieves out of computer programs - it sounds glamorous but it's actually quite a bit of grunt work. I think one of the exercises is like - take this huge sample of RF random noise and filter it until you can hear the satellite transmission downlink. It's like using programming to find needle in a haystack.I don't know what the chemical engineers need from their programmers, but I'd assume it's also about simulation, chaotic/stochastic processes.As you can tell, Computer science is primarily concerned with the nature of computing, and engineers use programming to work with the real world.The real world is incredibly messy and our math doesn't always work. That, added to the incredibly strict safety tolerances makes engineering programming a really niche job - I personally don't think you can be a great aeronautics real-time programmer and a good database programmer at the same time.As for your last question: are you into physical processes (blowing things up, making lights turn on and off, melting aluminum and using a mold to cast wheels, etc) or are you into computing, calculating, storing and searching information?It's perfectly ok to be into both - just keep in mind that there are these 2 ""ways of thinking"" when it comes to programming.The last bit of info is that in the real workforce, we work in teams: everyone brings a bit of their own ""special sauce"" to the team and that's how everything in the world is built/done.Even though the ""lone programmer"" is a trope in TV/media, that almost never happens in real life.If you become a programmer, you *will be working within a team* - so one of the most vital skills over everything else, is learning how to work with people who are different from you: they have different skillsets, different communication methods, may speak different languages, etc. That's probably the most critical skill out of everything: learning to work with other people.Hope this little overview helps and good luck!",barkingcat,2025-05-21 06:38:06,3,learnprogramming,t3_1krouk0,False,

mt3wx9i,"Based on your username, you seem Indian. I am unfamiliar with the word ""placement"", but it would probably help others if you mentioned you're from India so you get replies from those in India, otherwise, you tend to get an American or European perspective.I think it all depends on how well you know a programming language and DSA. There are two kinds of people (more than that, of course). There are those who want to learn a few key skills and be done with it, with a guarantee they won't have to learn anything more. I call this the ""barista"" type. You can't learn to make lattes and cappuccinos right away, but once you do, you're set. There's not a whole lot more to learn.Then, there are those that like to learn new things. It's this type that tends to do better as a programmer. I'm sure there are some jobs that don't require you to get past a certain point, e.g., there are still Cobol jobs and Cobol programmers, and that isn't changing so rapidly. But for the most part, you'll likely have to learn something new. For example, I was programming in Java a lot, but if I were to do AI programming, I'd likely have to switch to Python.Sorry there aren't any clear cut answers. If you ask ""If I do X, will Y happen"", the answer is, it depends on how you do X. That is, it depends on how much you master a programming language.To delve into this just a bit deeper, there are two aspects to mastering a programming language.The first has to do with learning the language, which means syntax/semantics of stuff like assignment statements, arrays, functions, classes, etc. It also means getting familiar with popular libraries. You may also have to learn a build tool. More recent languages tend to assume you're building a bigger program with multiple files.The other part--and some would argue the more important part is to learn to think algorithmically. That is, how do you solve a problem. That part can depend on skills outside of programming. For example, if you are trying to trying to simulate gravity for a physics engine to be used in a video game, then you need to know some physics. You have to express the physics as code.Just because you program, you may lack the expertise in what the program is about. Then, there is a kind of vague goal of trying to organize your code well.

mt3yxfh,"Just my 2 cents:In regards to languages, just be comfortable enough with one language to solve all kinds of problems. To be comfortable in that language, start using it to solve DSA questions.Also, be comfortable in one OOP language and another multi-paradigm language. So for your case, C++ and Python will do.For DSAs, my advice is to pick Python because it's the easiest way to learn DSAs without worrying about the complexity of the language. When it comes to interviews, they will allow you to pick the language you are comfortable with. And Python will always be there as an option.It's possible you just didn't like the web dev course by Harry. So try out another learning material. Or if nothing works, then it just means you don't like web dev.In regards to the question in the post, if you can solve DSA questions, then you are halfway there.

mt9tcex,"I was in 9th grade in 1988 and loved programming, I wanted to be a programmer, but everyone talked about that in a few years, programmers wouldn't be necessary due to something called CASE-tools, where business-types could simply draw networks of rules in some fancy program, and that would then create the code needed. Programming jobs would only be for the handful of people making these CASE-tools.So I went into hardware instead. And then the web happened, and all the CASE-tools for making mainframe business-programs were shoved to one side, because now everyone had to build something new. In the late 90s everyone talked about programming being replaced by drawing UML-diagrams and then emailing them to India or other countries with cheaper labour, and they would then do the actual programming.Then languages like Python began to become popular, and everyone talked about programming not being just for programmers anymore, because now everyone could learn to program, and there would be no more need for dedicated programmers.Then a lot of low-code and no-code tools became popular, and everyone talked about that soon there wouldn't be more need for programmers.In the late 2010s everyone began talking about how everything was already built, and in the future there wouldn't be more need for programmers, since most of the jobs would be simple adjustments to existing frameworks.And now, in the mid 2020s, everyone is talking about how in the future there won't be need for programmers, because some tool will handle everything for us. The problem with those tools, as amazing as they all are, is that they can only solve ""yesterdays problems"". As soon as some new technology, or a new business-problem, or a new oppertunity comes along, they aren't up to the job, and programmers have to step in.So go ahead and focus on your interests - if you enjoy learning, programming, robotics, AI or whatever, you'll become good at it, and it will help you learn more stuff!

I think learning ""the hard way"" like this is quite good but autocomplete/suggestions make getting the syntax right a lot easier.A few tips/useful sites:* [MDM ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)\- this should be the first place you look things up, its THE reference and is well written, easy to understand and has good examples * [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/guides/) \- I've linked to the guides section, whilst there's some advanced stuff here their guides/cheat sheets for flexbox and, lengths and media queries are always useful* [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/elements) \- Firefox has similar, use the one you like. I've linked to the ""element"" section which helps answer the question ""why doesn't this thing do the thing I thought it should"". On free code camp when doing the test projects you can click the button at the top right to open the preview in a new window, this will mean the dev tools for that window don't show the code editors which can be confusing.* [BEM](https://getbem.com/naming/) \- At some point you'll start building more complex things and have a convention for how to give things names consistently helps keep your CSS readable and reusable. There are other conventions but I like this one.* [CSS Variables/Why frameworks are good](https://coreframework.com/) \- Free code camp introduces variables super late which can build bad habits. As a general rule you never want hard coded values in any code, anywhere. It makes code hard to read and hard to modify in the future. Defining things like font sizes, colour palettes, spacing and border radiuses upfront makes everything a lot easier down the line.

mu5ufnh,"Well, no, but also yes.CSS isn't confusing at all, it is, especially with changes made the last three-five years, a very well structured language to express how you'd like the design and layout of your HTML-document to look.However, most programmers suck at visual design, at understanding what looks good, what the rules are, what things are called, and how to plan or even talk about the design of a document. They often prefer some pre-baked incantations that they can just throw at the page, so it will look like every other page out there. Which is probably why Bootstrap became so popular in the first place, and why Tailwind is so popular now.CSS is very, very, very different from HTML and JavaScript - HTML is a structure, it is easy to see if one element is before, after, inside or outside another. And JavaScript mostly is a list of lines, all being executed one after another, so that's also pretty easy to understand. But in CSS there isn't really any structure, just a bunch of rules that more or less all apply at the same time.Some parts of CSS has to do the the individual elements, how they look, how much space they take up, or where they are in relation to other elements. Other parts of CSS has to do with the layout, how an element layouts other elements inside of it. Yet other parts of CSS has to do with how an element is layouted by the parent. And you don't really write the rules, you just set some values on some properties that is used by some algorithms. So it is a bit like programming where you can only change the values of variables - difficult.I think that this recent video from Kevin Powell: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-95kJ0eyzQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-95kJ0eyzQ) gives a good introduction to understanding how to understand CSS :)",peterlinddk,2025-05-25 12:36:11,2,learnprogramming,t3_1kuyfqt,False,

mtkoz0x,"Some people have suggested a compressed file system. That’s an option, but I think your approach is still better due to portability and forwards compatibility given your use case and the business intent I’m assuming from your post. A compressed file system is typically linked to its OS family and soft linked to its specific filesystem version. Every OS maintainer starts out with the intent to honor the contract of every feature of every filesystem they ever made, but they typically get sketchier and sketchier as the specific filesystem gets older and older. Meanwhile, zip and a few of its brethren have been portable across all operating systems for years and you can simply move a file from one machine on one os to another generally without any functionality issue. Zip also contains built in CRC protection in the file which although not the most modern has been sufficient since its creation. The standard open source ‘zip/unzip’ available on Linux and macOS have long contained the same ‘test’ command that pkzip first introduced. Ie - unzip -t file.zip verifies all the CRCs of the files and the redundant copies of the metadata. In actuality it’s probably just checking the metadata, decompressing all the files in memory and comparing them with the CRCs. That verifies the files without taking any additional file storage. See if you can figure out how to directly trigger the ‘-t’ functionality via your library. Or alternatively just decompress them into the null device which accomplishes about the same. There are still some theoretical gaps in the integrity of this system though. If the original zip run received bad data or the data was corrupted while in memory than the files in the zip will be corrupt even though they verify. You should definitely be doing this if you care enough on a machine with ECC ram. Disk errors at just the wrong time could also cause problems in the chain that go unnoticed. In the ideal case you would have your own verifiable CRC produced at the very start of the chain where the source files were. Then you have something to check against anywhere in the chain without needing to go back and compare against the original files. For example if you produced a sha256 hash of each file at the source machine you could then check against that hash anywhere in the chain.",xilvar,2025-05-22 00:46:27,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ks61v4,False,
mtkqihe,"For your first question, just create a checksum before compressing the folder. Then decompress it and check the decompressed file against the checksum. If it's good, you can be sure the file compressed correctly.You should also create a checksum for the compressed file as well. That way you can verify the integrity of the compressed file whenever it's transferred somewhere.Ideally your system works like this.1. System identifies project file to be archived on the working server2. System generates checksum for project file/folder4. System verifies the checksum against the project file (redundant check, just to be sure)5. System compresses project file into archive file6. System decompresses archive file into decompressed file7. System checks the decompressed file against the checksum to verify compression worked properly. (This checksum can be discarded now, since most compression algorithms have internal checksums. You could keep it if you want, just don't confuse it with the checksum for the archive file.)8. System generates checksum for the archive file9. System verifies the checksum against the archive file (again, redundant check)10. System transfers the archive file to the archive server along with the checksum11. System verifies the transferred archive file against the checksum12. System deletes project file and archive file on the working serverIf a verification check fails at any point, you just repeat the steps after the previous successful verification.As for other compression tools, gzip and bzip have better compression ratios that zip. They're standard tools that are widely supported, so you shouldn't have any issues working with them.There are other compression tools that offer minor improvements to compression ratio or speed, but are less popular, so unless you really *need* that extra file space they're probably not worth using.Finally, I see that you mention the archive is on a raid disk which is good, but I just want to encourage following the 3-2-1 rule for backups if you aren't already.

Plus if you like programming, it's a great hobby that you can use to build things you want/like, or create entrepreneurial ventures with. If AI takes over, there wont be money in it, but there wont be money in almost anything at that point, so you're best off still learning what you enjoy and hoping those in positions of power are smart enough to see the violence coming and giving people a basic living wage paid for by the AI and the rich, then we can spend our free time coding whatever we want for fun.",floopsyDoodle,2025-05-20 23:26:14,62,cscareerquestions,t3_1krj6jc,False,

Every ten or so people you add to an organization, the dynamic will change rapidly and you'll need to retune the operations. This is before the complexity of market strategy and building an MVP to sell.Do try organizing! But keep it small and sustainable. As an independent founder coming from layoffs, you probably don't have *any* meaningful ""runway"" to fail and bleed out money until the core business solidifies.

Imagine all the time you spend coding is instead spent reading tax documents and crunching numbers in Excel.

Just like with software engineering, this really depends on your company, team, and role. Furthermore, work hours are consistently brutal across the entire industry during tax season; expect 80-100 hours a week in the first quarter and 60+ during the extension period. My WLB as a SWE is significantly better than all the accountants I know.Lastly, accounting is just as vulnerable to being replaced by AI as our own, which you probably don’t realize because you don’t spend time in those circles and/or they don’t complain about it as much as we do.

In fact, many companies assumed CS grads could not code and that it was something they would learn on the job. Before Chat GPT everyone was solving their homework problems by google-fu'ing their way through Stack Overflow. Before Stack Overflow there were message boards (that are still going and have answers that go all the way back to the 90s).Today the tools are much better than they were 20 years ago much less just 5 years ago.

mu21g2q,"Speaking from a meta perspective, as someone who’s been working as an MLE for 3-4 years now. Companies want the perceived benefits of ML without investing into it. Their expectation vs reality is different. Obviously all executives think that throwing an LLM backend into a clean UI is sufficient for an AI-powered product, but it’s not. Even a “GPT wrapper” requires significant amount of information retrieval, validation, logging and operational signal collection, etc to not have generic AI slop polluting their product, data, and their image. Even if you don’t train an LLM from scratch (which is what most uninformed executives think ML is), there is significant overhead in solely serving the LLM for your specific use cases. That’s why AI startups, despite being ridiculous and “just a GPT wrapper” still have a legitimate case for a product. Those “other processes” are extremely nontrivial. Most companies are not even willing to invest into a “GPT wrapper”.Now consider something one step further upstream. Let’s say you want to train custom models (not necessarily LLM’s, but SSD’s, classifiers, methods of statistical inference, etc). Maybe you want to power a recommendation system or intelligent search, or you want to automate classification of support issues, etc. This requires ETL pipelines to take raw data and transform them. But this requires your web infrastructure to have instrumentation for real-time analytics and collection of usage behaviors. My point is, delivering machine learning into product is an organizational effort. Starts from the top-down. That’s why the golden data trio of titles: machine learning engineer, data scientist, data engineer, will never be as prevalent as a SWE or analysts in numbers. You could have VERY knowledgeable and talented MLE, DS, DE, but if your org isn’t willing to be data driven from the top-down, these functions will not drive any value, to no fault of these people. A company not collecting data and expecting these functions to succeed is like telling a SWE to build software for a company, but not giving them any servers to deploy on or having no critical infrastructure: CI/CD, networking, security, etc. TLDR; The number of openings for MLE, DS, DE are low because most companies are unwilling to invest into data, and even less willing to invest into ML infra and the upkeep required for industry-specific R&D.",ToastandSpaceJam,2025-05-24 19:24:39,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1kscroh,False,

mtl6h20,"I doubt handling 10s of millions of users is the typical dev experience, but it’s not wildly uncommon. Also, scale is not always just about human users - it’s not hard to imagine an application that has to make hundreds or thousands of calls just to service a single request, that is also a form of scale. Especially in the age of AI agents, this is becoming fairly routine. Alternatively, imagine some cloud storage solution like DropBox which one day might be asked to upload/download a 100 KB file and the next day asked to upload/download a 1 TB file. That is an enormous range of potential payload sizes which itself is another form of scale and brings its own unique challenges.So “scale” comes in many different flavors. But to your specific question, …> are people who have handled scale actually more skilled?… the answer is emphatically “yes”.Anyone can write a basic CRUD app that is functional, where “functional” simply means it doesn’t break. But to optimize an application for high throughput, low latency, and fault tolerance at large scale? That typically requires years of experience to understand the tradeoffs and foresee bottlenecks before they throttle you.Depending on your subfield, handling traffic at scale may also require not simply writing performant code but also using specialized tooling that you’d have no reason to learn at lower scale.So yes, developing at scale requires significant skills beyond what your run-of-the-mill dev will bring to the table.",synthphreak,2025-05-22 02:28:40,60,cscareerquestions,t3_1ksf1yd,False,

The fact that you are getting on-sites makes me think it's going better for you than you may feel. A lot of people aren't getting call backs or past a first interview. I imagine the big issues is that you are probably going to be in a junior, or at best, a mid level development position and those are already rare nowadays. I can imagine it would be hard to land a senior position when you don't have proper dev experience. Is there a reason why you haven't tried to pivot to a team lead/management role already? I know that doesn't get you into development, but it could potentially be a smart career move for someone at your level of expertise. From the development side, I do work with someone who switched from sales to dev later in life ( like maybe mid 40s ). He did a bootcamp, but the thing that helped him start getting interviews was contributing to open source projects. They helped him have a commit history he could point to in github and show he was able to work with other developers and follow a bit of a process on a large scale project. He's great and brings a lot to our team and also has a lot of work experience that most of the team doesn't, which is a plus. I think the biggest issue is finding a team that matches your skillset.Starting out the best position is the one you can get, but you might be at a place in life where you can't take on just any job. You are probably making bigger considerations around time commitments, location, pay, ect.. which might be limiting you a bit. If you have flexibility on any of those, you might be able to expand your search and find something. Another option could be to lean harder into your support experience. I'm in the process of transitioning a more support heavy development position. We will have a dedicated support team that will be fully focused on development support. I don't have any hiring capacity for this year unfortunately since it's a very new thing, but I'd be interested in candidates with a heavier support background. Most developers are not interested in doing support, especially when it's something they have to do with some frequency. They want to build and refine features. So, being the person who is both good and support and happy to do it could set you apart if you find the right position/company. Wish I had even better advise.

I know you previously mentioned Java/Kotlin and Android dev. Something to consider is whether you want to work in that field, or if you are applying only because you feel strongest in it.Game dev is an entirely different beast. Personally, I'm into game dev myself because I learn almost exclusively from doing. I don't work in game dev. I don't publish games. I build them (and plenty of other things) to scratch that curiosity itch to learn while keeping it interesting (for example, I couldn't care less about yet another fucking library that's going viral that everyone is raving about in X language for Y framework--I'm not on the bleeding edge and it is not my niche).TL;DR: do it, if you're interested. The only downside is opportunity cost. Honestly ask yourself: what else would you be doing if not learning some game dev? Everything has an opportunity cost. Grinding leetcode has it. Learning tons of frameworks have it. But it doesn't hurt to spend a month on something to figure out if you're genuinely interested in it.

mtubap3,"I can empathise with you on some level. I'm also a SWE that works at big4 and constantly feel like i'm lost or not knowledgable enough. Early on, I also felt that I didn't get much mentorship and was just thrown into the deep end, asked to implement feature X, enhancement Y, or bugfix Z, in a huge codebase, with little guidance. Though, now I feel quite fortunate because I ended up learning a lot from those early experiences, a lot more than I think most devs early in their careers would.I also have felt the same way with AI, especially when it's crunch time and I need to really accelerate my output. Something that has helped me is treating it more like a search engine to find information I need, but I write the almost all the code myself. I really try to understand what it's telling me and will cross reference with other resources as well. This makes it so I really understand and know that I can backup the code I have written if i'm questioned during a PR. I also maintain a large personal document of just general CS concepts and fundementals; whenever I learn something new from AI (and confirmed it's correct), i'll add it to this document. So I kind of force myself to constantly learn and understand what i'm doing, while still reaping the benefit of AI.If you have been doing alright so far and it sounds like you spend a lot of time trying to improve outside of work, I feel like your feeling of being totally lost may largely be imposter syndrome. Sure AI can generate a lot of code, but you would still be reading and understanding it to ensure it is applicable for your situation and actually works. So I think you probably know more than you think. I also believe that completely cutting AI out would not be beneficial in the long term, because using it is a skill in itself, and is likely to just continue to get more important. Otherwise, it sounds like you're doing all the right things. Keep working on personal projects, use and learn technologies that interest you and that are in demand, and continue to challenge yourself with Leetcodes. You're still a grad (i'm assuming), you're not going to know everything straightaway and there will always be plenty more for you to learn.

mtw4tp4,"OP, listen to this advice. Don’t ask chat gpt how to write something for you. Try reading the documentation or looking at other code in the repo that does something similar and figure out why and how it works. After you write it, then ask chat gpt what it thinks or how it works but keep in mind it’s a probabilistic model so it could be wrong. Always double check with the documentation or look up articles by vetted sources that have written about the same piece of technology. It’ll give you way more insight.Technology is a huge field and there are so many layers as well as tools. I remember being a fresh new grad and even though I learned about the different components in computer systems and how memory is evicted out of ram and how different networking protocols handled communication. Getting my first internship all of that was so abstracted from me by the tools we were using that I felt like I had no idea why things were written the way they were or why we used certain tools.Take time to ask questions and learn the answers to those questions. Take notes and study them. Slowly it all starts coming together and years later you know exactly how the service or app you’re working on is leveraging the framework and language you’re using and working together with the os on the server or computer it runs on to do the things that it is doing. I will say this. I was overwhelmed at the beginning. I think most people are. I really enjoyed being able to build something by just writing some code. But it was extremely frustrating at times and sometimes I wondered if I was in the wrong profession. It took me finding out it was really rewarding knowing so much of how things worked to find passion in my career and stick with it.",ladidadi82,2025-05-23 19:48:32,2,cscareerquestions,t1_mtubap3,False,

The issue people don't wanna accept is that entry level **requires past experience** the same way an junior level doctor or lawyer requries past experience. ##ExamplesLike for web dev, just do freelance contracts or programs like Dev for good. Not that hard to make a portfolio if you really liked it.

Go to utest.com, get a few tests done and get paid for it and after 2 years you'd be overqualified for Jr roles.

mu4eho9,"No internship will pigeonhole you - it’s like 3 months of basic, practical experience that any company will look favorably on. People often switch domains even after years of working in one. You’re way too early in your career, and an internship is way too short a term, to worry about being “pigeonholed.”That said, there are ethical implications that companies won’t hold against you but that you should personally be comfortable with.

If you have moral qualms, those are perfectly valid and a totally reasonable reason not to take the job, but if your only concern is what it looks like long term you won't have any issues. I work at a company that is filled with ex-Palantir FDEs and they are unbelievably sharp and every time we hire one they come in and make an impact almost immediately.",rhcp512,2025-05-25 04:28:19,11,cscareerquestions,t3_1kutyp2,False,
