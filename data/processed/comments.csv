There was another logging interface configured, but stdout was missing from there as well. The only option to see the error message was to rerun the step again directly on Airflow through SSH.

You'll never be able to truly answer how many unique customers, suppliers, or products you have. That uniqueness is required for the denominator of your KPIs at an enterprise level. Yea I'm sure it's not needed at an operational level but that's not the level that your execs and ultimately your board is looking for.If you acquire your competitor and say you both share the same supplier but have different supply terms which are more favorable to the company you acquired then you would be smart to use that contract going forward. You will get to that answer sooner with MDM.MDM helps us get in front of these types of data challenges. Yes the tooling is bloated, expensive, and hard to implement and maintain. Regardless, the need will always be there. Another easy example, what if your customers are subsidiaries of other companies. How does Finance calculate the consolidate line of credit if it doesn't know or manage those relationships in the systems.

If that master data is wrong it could put the whole migration and implementation in jeopardy causing millions in damages.

nlgugf7,"A few of the other comments hit reasons why you would do partitioning, but there's a common underlying mechanism for it.Partitioning allows you to do isolated operations on a lake table, so that you can limit an operation that works on 'all' the data to only work on a single partition, or allow multiple otherwise conflicting operations to run concurrently on different partitions, or both.Z-Ordering inherently adjusts the ordering of data across files so that file skipping mechanics work better. It Has to be able to rewrite all of the data in scope so that the ordering can work properly, so it would necessarily rewrite all the data. That would conflict with concurrent merge/update/delete operations, as at the time of finishing the ZOrder you would revert the rewritten data. However, if you run ZOrder on a single partition, then you can still merge/update/delete data in other partitions.The same goes for performing merge operations -- if you can isolate them to a single partition then the system can know for certain that you could not have possibly rewritten data outside that partition, so you can have concurrent merges working on different partitions.But that's all you really need it for now. You might add it for `is_active` on an SCD2 table because you will generally fundamentally only be updating current data and frequently only querying it, but you wouldn't be trying to optimise tables with partitioning.

Instead of physically co-locate files to nested folders (partitions) it just mark in a metadata that ""this parquet file is related to cluster (partition) X"" in a corresponding metadata JSON-file.

If your clustering keys change, then the files do need to be rewritten. (Edit: to benefit from the new clustering. But Databricks actually allows keeping old files with a previous clustering, see reply.)Please let me know if you have a source stating otherwise or if I misunderstood your comment.The difference between liquid clustering and simple clustering, is that liquid clustering is dynamic based on the access pattern statistics. If your access pattern is shifting, the optimizer will decide at some point that it is worth it to rewrite some files to reduce cost. This dynamic aspect is great, but it may also create new unexpected costs.

In larger orgs it's also a great way to enforce standardisation of calculations like KPIs: without a semantic layer Sue from finance might have a retention rate calculation different from Bob from HR's version, and when the C-suite see two different numbers for the ""same"" thing they either pick on based on whether Bob or Sue has the better reputation, or distrust them both entirely. If Bob and Sue are dragging and dropping a measure from the same model that doesn't happen. And if Bob and Sue both think their one is best, then there can be a process for working out which one becomes the single source of truth instead of them going off into their silo and doing their own thing.Organisationally it sits at a good place too, in that it can be a product of a central data team to enable business unit-adjacent analysts and BI teams to get straight into their value-add (engineers do the engineering, business users do the questioning, presenting and interpretation) .

We've been working on improving JSON in ClickHouse as well.We released our native type last year, and just recently did a big update (https://clickhouse.com/blog/json-data-type-gets-even-better). We originally designed it so that you could pick (or let CH pick) about 1000 paths to store as native columns, and then pack the rest into a shared part file. It worked really well, but as more people used it, we found that a lot of people have A LOT of JSON paths. Either huge objects, or just huge variance between objects, which results in tens of thousands of paths. At which point you have many thousands of paths being bundled into the shared parts, and losing much of the efficiency (i.e. trying to aggregate a field that is packed into shared parts was slower and used a lot of memory compared to a real col).We redesigned it so that we can essentially do hierarchical indexing of buckets of shared parts - the post above explains how it works in detail. We managed to get some pretty impressive gains - about 58x faster when querying paths in shared parts, and using 3300x less memory, when you have over 10k unique paths.It's a pretty interesting area to work on as not many OLAP DBS handle JSON very elegantly, typically you just flatten it which is pretty annoying and brittle.",sdairs_ch,2025-10-25 08:00:48,10,dataengineering,t3_1of1xxl,False,

Method for ingestion varies by source, but the end result is the same.

I recommend putting thought into how you want to structure your transformation layers in dbt, and then just try to stay consistent. Dbt has their own recs on how to structure, and that's more or less what we do (staging, intermediate, and marts): https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview- analytics: some sort of viz or BI tool that references the cleaned data marts exclusively.

nksyivu,"Having a clean ETL process that updates non-prod environments with appropriately tokenized/masked copies of production data on a recurring basis should be considered just as critical a piece of infrastructure as having proper CI/CD pipelines and automated test frameworks.It starts with identifying sensitive fields in production data. They should all already be identified and catalogued someplace, as part of a data security framework. If they're not, that's a problem in and of itself. You need to know where the PII actually exists, and ideally section it off into separate, higher-security datastores. Less sensitive datastores should only store identifiers to the records in the secure datastores that contain the actual PII. This step alone can dramatically simplify the process of keeping things secure, and can make it safer to allow production access for developers to debug issues. It's rare that a bug involves needing to know actual PII, even in production.Once you know which datastores/fields contain PII, you can set up automated ETL pipelines to mask or tokenize them during the process of being copied into non-prod environments.A good practice is to have (at least) two non-prod environments: development and QA/staging. The QA environment should be automatically overwritten with a fresh, sanitized copy of production data, on a regular basis. The development environment should have finer-grained controls for overwrites, so as not to erase work-in-progress changes that developers have made to those datasets.

nkxk6br,"I've tried and seen a couple of approaches, usually starting with using open-source [Cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos) to orchestrate dbt Core projects so you can see each dbt model/seed/test as an Airflow task in the DAG for additional visibility and to see the dbt docs in the Airflow UI (side note: this feature will be back for Airflow 3.1 with Cosmos 1.11 that should come out next month).The next ""level"" is to use Asset (in Airflow 3.x) / Dataset (in Airflow 2.x) scheduling for cross-DAG dependencies. That way the Asset graph (exists in 2.x and 3.x but imho is much easier to navigate in 3.x) serves as a proxy-lineage graph. Side note tip if you need both, runs based on time and upstream DAG dependencies, there is a combined [AssetOrTimeSchedule](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-datasets#combined-asset-and-time-based-scheduling).From there, yes, some people implement custom solutions, often based on dependency information gathered from the Airflow API or use the OSS OpenLineage integration to get ""true"" lineage and then visualize it with Marquez. How well this works highly depends on the operators and hooks you use, if they already support lineage extraction (there is a [list of supported classes](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-openlineage/stable/supported_classes.html)) or if you need to add extractors to your own custom operators. Inlets and outlets (so Assets again) are also evaluated by this integration.If you want an out-of-the-box solution there are paid products like [Astro Observe](https://www.astronomer.io/product/observe) which is based on OpenLineage and reads in that information to create a lineage graph with additional fancy features like SLA definition, alerts, cross-deployment lineage etc. There is also a list of potential up and downstream impacts in case of failures. The upside is minimal setup needed and managed service support.Disclaimer: I work at Astronomer :) and a lot of the above was inspired by [this blog post](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/the-road-to-reliability-implementing-pipeline-observability) (and the webinar linked at the bottom of it) from our internal data team.

nlqbbcf,"I think in your situation I would go for it, at least for an initial smaller proof of concept since you already have the account set up and already other teams in the org that have experience (that is often underrated being able to bug coworkers for help).The orchestration does sound very doable no matter which of the 3 orchestrators you mentioned you use. If you go with Airflow I'd recommend looking into [DAG Factory](https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/) (or creating your own), it is an open source package that abstracts the Python for the Airflow pipelines behind YAML, it is especially useful for simple and repetitive pipelines. I've also seen setups were almost all of the Airflow code was abstracted away by one or two engineers and the analysts only wrote SQL (an OSS example here is [gusty](https://github.com/pipeline-tools/gusty)). Might be a way to help the drag and drop team members to slowly start to see the beauty of code-based abstractions and pipelines, once they see that can just fill in a few values in a template instead of clicking around when adding a new source etc.Also if you ever end up hating one of the GCP tools you can still switch them out against another tool and move towards a hybrid setup later.I haven't used data transfer service/dataform before so can't speak to those vs Fivetran/dbt.

If you want to look into Airflow we have a lot of beginner resources like the [learn guides](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/intro-to-airflow) or [Marc Lamberti's academy course ](https://academy.astronomer.io/path/airflow-101)that are relevant no matter where you run Airflow. :)",TJaniF,2025-10-27 22:51:50,10,dataengineering,t3_1ohrt4e,False,

nlisgpa,"1. ClickHouse is great to run analytics on very large immutable data (super fast because of the vectorized engine, sparse index etc), I'd only use it for that and only if your data is actually very large (or you anticipate it to be in a reasonable time frame) and move the SCD and model layers into a proper OLAP db. So: raw, very large and will never change in ClickHouse, anything aggregated or that needs to be updated ever in Postgres/BQ/Snowflake etc. But honestly for a first PoC if your data isnt that big, which I assume based on the current CSV/SharePoint/PowerBI combination, you can also skip ClickHouse for now.2. Sorry no first hand experience with PowerBI+ClickHouse. From what I've heard it works fine for basic dashboards but complex joins are not fun with that combo.3. I'm biased here since I work for Astronomer so I have a lot of Airflow and only very little Prefect experience. I'd recommend spinning up a small dev environment of both and creating some mock pipelines to see which fits your needs better. For small projects it's often the case that several orchestrators can do the job and the decision is made more based on personal preference. Some tips for Airflow: * Use the Astro CLI to spin up a local dev env in containers to try it out (its free and does not need a sign up). * If you are combining Airflow with dbt you have to use [Cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos) (ok, technically you don't *have* to but it is really the best way!). It is an OSS package that lets you render dbt projects and dbt docs in the Airflow UI. * You said your ingest is pulling from REST APIs using Python: you can use the `task`decorator in Airflow to turn any Python function into an Airflow task, thats probably the fastest way. I think Prefect has a similar decorator too. So with either tool hopefully you can reuse a lot of your existing code there. * If you end up passing data between tasks that is more than just small jsons in Airflow, for example larger pandas dataframes, you'll want to store that data in a blob storage. This used to take a bit of setup but about 1.5 years ago a class was added in the Common IO provider package that is very quick to set up via env vars ([a tutorial](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/custom-xcom-backends-tutorial)). * PSA: top level code in Airflow is executed every time the file is parsed, so don't connect to your db in top level code (i.e. outside of tasks).4. If there is a good way to do SCD with ClickHouse I have not found it yet. There is [ReplacingMergeTree](https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/replacing-merge-tree), which I haven't tried myself but generally, yes, that is definitely a good reason to have the modeling layers somewhere else.",TJaniF,2025-10-26 18:51:14,2,dataengineering,t3_1ogop8w,False,

That might sound like an expensive, bureaucratic thing to say, but even when you ignore Data Governance, you're still performing a form of governance.So, before asking yourself questions on good data quality, ask yourself: what does good data governance look like? How do I make sure we are efficient, effective, self-learning, have decision-support structures, remain lawful and above all else: have clear accountability? Who decides? Who decides who decides?Then ask yourself: what about the security of my data? How do I balance integrity, confidentiality and availability? What does integrity mean to this organisation? An accountancy has different requirements than a gaming startup.Once you have that setup, you can begin to ask yourself some questions about data quality, and this is a big balancing act between different data quality dimensions:* Accuracy* Credibility or reputation.* Confidence* Availability* Usability* Fit for purpose* Representational Consistency* Timeliness* Completeness* etc.As you will see, only a limited amount of these dimensions can be validated using so called 'data quality tools'.

nl1wukm,"There is a reason that the vast majority of data science projects never make it to production. You're experiencing it. Your approach sounds more like an Agile approach. Start by building the MVP (minimally viable product) THEN add features and improvements. Build with the intent that things will get bolted on. They are doing a classic waterfall approach. Deliver the final product all at once. So in this method, building in certain features first might be more efficient to get to the final deadline. Agile is faster, more flexible, and some variation of it is the new modern standard. Waterfall is good for building something with core features that are extremely well defined. Of course, there's the other option that they are just building what they want to build whether it is needed or not. With data scientists, you can't rule that out. Here's the catch, every data scientist I have ever met HATES Agile. I suspect it is because in academia, you design your entire experiment, make your hypothesis, do your research, THEN do the experiments THEN publish your results. To them, Agile is following a poor practice of finding something 80% correct with the end goal of getting something better in the next round. Plus, if they are building a gradient boosting regression with specific variables now, the 90% correct version may require completely different variables with a Random Forest Regression. In other words, a complete rebuild. Data engineers can add features much more organically. I'm not saying that the Data Scientists are right. There is a very good reason while Agile has dominated tech, and there is a reason Data Science projects never get anywhere. Understand where they are coming from, but ultimately, you're more likely than them to be following best practice.",BoringGuy0108,2025-10-24 00:25:33,5,dataengineering,t3_1oeh29i,False,
nl8km9l,"I guess it depends on what you mean by features. If you mean selecting what variables go I to a model, yeah, you figure that out first. Typically data scientists work in a sandbox environment when they model. If you’re talking delivery, then I assume you are building data pipelines? They need to figure out what model works before they can tell you what data they need and how they need it. It’s a lot of exploratory work. When I worked on an agile data science team, we just wanted access to copies of raw prod data from different sources while we figured out approximately what worked. (Honestly, even if it would work.) Training can involve significant amounts of data. If it was something large and complex, like a simulation, this might take weeks. At review we usually had draft models to talk through with business and often changed or added data as a result. We didn’t get involved with engineering until we had a good idea of what data we needed and how we needed it first (and where we were putting it). If business needed something faster for a particular reason, we’d just refreshed our working draft. (They usually had access.) “Productionizing” something like that as we worked would have been wildly expensive and time consuming. We had conflict with one of the engineering teams at one point because they thought it was inappropriate to give us access to data until we could tell them exactly what we need. Then they would decide how to model it, spend time modeling for us, and it wouldn’t be modeled in a way that worked, the back and forth arguments took forever. (No, six months of data isn’t enough. No, the most recent value replacing the old value doesn’t suffice. Actually, we needed those variables you deleted, etc.) It was a nightmare. They considered us “non-technical” as just told us we didn’t understand best practices. No idea if this applies to you. Hopefully not. But you might ask them their reasoning. Data science is not a software dev discipline and follows a different life cycle than the standard SDLC. I have seen multiple issues with tech people over my career who could not wrap their heads around this.

The beauty of Cucumber/Gherkin us that the human readable phraseology plays well with auditors and business users. It helps build trust in what we produce.Ruff and SQLFluff enforce code style. If I didn't need the DBT plugin I would look at SQRuff in preference to SQLFluff.For DBT we publish the output of DBT Docs to cloud blob storage so clients can download it into whatever internal websites suit them. Again, interactive data lineage comforts auditors and people who query business data.In the past I've used products such as Redgate SQLDoc and Innovasys DocumentX to document databases. As the company I was with went with a plethora of other databases I ended up writing my own version. For any tabular DB my app needed a DB connection and a folder to hold that DB's equivalent of queries whose output was a defined contract. Again, this comforts the auditors.Code quality tools such as SonarQube, Sonarlint are useful. In JetBrains PyCharm there us a ""Problems"" tab that provides code improvement suggestions. I've found these to be useful. I think VS Code has some useful extensions that do something similar.JavaDoc is over 30 years old, most languages have an equivalent. Its only as good as the human content put in, but as a mechanically solved autodocumentation facility, its up to you to avoid shooting yourself in both feet....then reloading and shooting both kneecaps etc.I do a lot of work with AWS. I've found that their APIs, for the products I use, need a lot of calls as an API call answers a question but doesn't always provide the info to feed directly into a related question. Using Mermaid markup allows the relationships between various cloud artefacts to be autogenerated. I'm crap at graphics so Mermaid is about my limit. Again, a diagram comforts auditors. A comforted auditor is a comforted management team.Data testing can be DBT Test, Soda and more specific queries. Its easy enough to generate AWS cloudwatch metrics from the results of a query. From AWS Cloudwatch metrics, its easy ti generate AWS Cloudwatch alarms. An example would be average expected sales +- 1.64 standard deviations as the acceptable range, anything outside of that range needs investigation.In all honesty, the tooling is not the important thing.

Hence, you can see my concern about potential challenges about different points of time due to unexpected failed or delayed ETL jobs, and ensuring to write an artifact to the fact for data quality purposes. I don’t need to expose this to my end uses (who are restricted to views on top of my table) but I would put in in the physical table for quality/explainability. Also, I’m only concerned with the explainability part now (best practice design). Obviously, the more important part is the proactive portion of who you programmatically ensure all combined data is from the same point of time. For example, you can break the metric up into regions of the world (NA, EMEA, APAC) to ensure it’s computed relevant to their time zones, you can adjust your “subqueries” to enforce timeboxes, or time travel / time restrictions to ensure they are all consistent, or you might do some sort of staging tables that can be “frozen” (for example frequent loading upstream but frozen into daily buckets, etc.). I’m sure there are a few good options.Again, I’m starting with “hey they this is very complicated since ETL doesn’t always work as intended and error free” so how do I assure quality given the many challenges. Thanks again - it’s is a great link, very helpful and exactly what i was asking for.Edit: the blog post called out something I forgot to mention that’s pretty critical. The subsets of data are all aggregated, so what’s included/missing from the aggregation is very important. For example, if we are calculating MetricValue = Inventory on hand [region | material | day] - goods issue [region | material | day ] + projected sales [ region | material | calendar day] —> and each of these are very volatile. The different businesses in different regions of the world will change their sales forecasts through out the day (especially as we near quarter/year end, or other business target dates), inventory changes drastically, and goods issue (reduction of inventory) is very dynamic. So, if I’m after a daily level, as in what’s my EMEA inventory for material 111 on 10/23/25, this value could be very different if my subquery executes at 1am vs. 4am vs. 7am. Where as in a transactional fact table, i would simply be adding rows (ie: additional sales invoices to a sales fact table) and the differences are easily understood - I’m summarizing inventory per day, so the differences in values due to timing are a mystery. I like that the blog post is pointing this out as a challenge in the “monster query” which aggregates results into a “common grain” (which is exactly what I’m doing here).",rotr0102,2025-10-25 15:27:12,2,dataengineering,t1_nl9swgv,True,

What helped us in ClickHouse: use ReplacingMergeTree with a version (updatedat) for idempotent upserts and late-arriving fixes; resolve surrogate keys via ClickHouse dictionaries so facts can map to dimension IDs without heavy joins at write time. Put tenantid first in ORDER BY and partition by month (toYYYYMM(ts)) for fast pruning and easy drop/backfill per tenant-month. For custom fields, store a Map for long tail, but promote high-usage keys into real columns; add bloom filter indexes on common filters and a soft\_delete flag with TTL DELETE to keep storage sane. Row policies work well for tenant isolation if you expose direct SQL. Tinybird is great for serving pre-aggregates, but keep ClickHouse as the source of truth and rebuild from staging when mappings change.

nl5ibtn,"I think that code readability has a lot to do with one's experience with the particular paradigm being used, as well as one's understanding of the abstractions and the underlying platform.Sorry for the essay - hope it makes sense for someone out there :)I teach intro-level Java-Programming as well as Spring programming, and it is interesting to see how different students grow into the different paradigms at wildly different paces.Understanding **imperative code is easy for everyone**, first line does something, then second line does something else, then the third line does another thing. The hardest part is learning that when you write `int weeks = days / 7;` on line 14, and then change the number of `days` on line 20, the value of `weeks` doesn't change along with it. But you get used to it, and learn to read code.Then comes **procedural** code, with loops and functions/methods (we ignore the objects at first), and it gets a bit harder to understand that the loop does the same thing over and over, but with the values changing - so now changing a value on line 20 **DOES** impact the calculation on line 14, if they are inside the same loop. Or a function behaves differently from time to time, because it depends on a global variable, whose value might have changed since the last call ...Then you move into **object oriented** code, where objects ask each other to do stuff - but it still mostly reads like procedural code, where a single thread of execution goes through methods living in different objects - you get used to having to jump around in different files, but most of the time you can still follow along. The hardest part is knowing when the objects are instantiated, and who ""owns"" the reference to them - but other than that you begin to abstract away the actual program flow, unless you really need it.But you begin using frameworks, and suddenly you don't see all the code - you have objects that extend existing objects, who then call methods in your object. You don't know exactly when or why your own methods are called, you just get CVS-receipt-length style stack-dumps when something fails, and you sit ""outside"" the code, looking in, trying to understand what might be happening around your own code - mostly you are guessing or using information from other people also guessing.It becomes very hard to follow, even for experienced programmersAnd then you move to Spring, which is **aspect oriented** programming, where you don't even write, nor see all the code, but only add annotations and interfaces, and then some magic entity behind the curtain reads your code, and changes it! Sometimes before compiling, sometimes after! And you have no idea how your code is being used, who uses it, what for, or when. You just hand code to the monster, and it does something - now it is literally impossible to follow what is going on, and you need to know what the platform does, what the framework does, how it uses your classes and methods, and why it uses them in the way it does ... And you either have to read through 35 years of accumulated specifications, or watch days of indian youtubers explain it, still somewhat on the surface-level ...So to answer your question, **yes**!

nl6kufl,"I'm in a similar boat, but I happened to figure that problem out as an undergrad. You're probably ahead of me in skill and prospects. **Work on skills related to finding a job:**Set a block of time, every day after work, for applying and upskilling. No exceptions, even if it's as little as 30min for one and 30min for the other. Every time you feel like you're not skilled enough (which may be true), remember that people less skilled than us ARE getting jobs.Figure out why. Are they applying in novel ways? Do they have really good interviewing skills? Are they personable? Did they do x, y, and z? Improve yourself based on your findings. There are A LOT of unique ways to get hired while being less skilled. At the very least, you can improve your interviewing skills by failing at them and learning what to learn. Don't be afraid to look for more technical, but still retail-adjacent/low-level roles as a start. Don't allow yourself to settle for this either - keep searching and improving your process. I'd also try doing Neetcode 150 as well. Spend 15-30minutes failing on one question, watch the solution to the video, and then learn why the solution works (you can use AI as a mentor, not a solution solver). Rinse-repeat. Don't worry about ""not knowing the answers."" Even experienced developers struggle on optimizing Easy's.So, 30 minutes of self-study, 30min of applying (even ""knowing"" you'll fail), and a bit of LC-style learning when you're bored. .**Work on your technical skills:**There are just as many paths forward in this as there is on the above. My advice as a beginner? Figure out what domains you liked during your studies, research what it takes to get into them, and then follow an online roadmap learning those resources. Don't have a preferred domain?Then either read some books related to learning how to program, ones that are heavy on coding along and building things, follow a bootcamp, or go straight into ""github project-based learning"" repo and start building with your preferred languages. Focus on your preferred languages and up your skills.I recommend that path the most.At the end of the day, school primed us to be very good at intaking new information and thinking like a computer, so now you have to learn how to be a craftsmen, building new projects and applying your theory. Too overwhelming? The Odin Project is a free online boot camp that will essentially take you from 0 to the very minimum skills of a junior full-stack developer. You'll learn how to research, use version control, and build projects. This will solidify your programming foundation, especially if you go a layer or two deep when using the additional resources/reading books.Don't forget to keep applying. When you're done with Foundations, you're not going to be ""cracked out junior"" level, but you'll be ""meh, *maybe* I can teach him the rest"" level. If you haven't been applying due to being an imposter, you want a job or what? At least start at this point. The more you improve at learning to program, the workflow for it, the rigor it takes, etc, the better you can pivot to other domains of programming. This is just one method of trying to open that door.You are free to learn whatever else (project-based building in your preferred domain, reading books about programming, following tutorials on building a game, etc) as long as you complete that block of time for applications (or learning novel ways of getting a job) and dedicated self-study (this example being The Odin Project).It's important to have fun during it all and not try to speed run yourself into burnout.

We do get project requests related to that and at least half of them ask for applied magic.- Databases is steady and boring and a bit frustrating. 99% of what people need from databases can be taught in a simple SQL course, the rest comes up if you either need to scale a high performance setup for 100000 users or when the new manager Timmey suggests we move all our data into a MongoDB on his notebook because he can scale with kubernetes or something like that.

It could be generative AI, ML, or complex but important topics, but also things that are completely irrelevant to today's world or the job market. Similarly, other cybersecurity categories will likely include theory, encryption, encryption algorithms, and more, but there's a good chance they won't include what everyone expects—hacking or active intrusion prevention. Web can also encompass anything, perhaps focusing more on network administration or web application development (more or less latest technologies, languages). Depending on how the university keeps up with the times, databases might have a well-developed foundation, but they might also include cloud computing, Azure, data warehousing, Big Data, and more.Based on what these specializations contain, you can make a more informed decision, and we can recommend one over the other. Of course, it's also important what you're interested in, what you've done, and what you felt good about.

You already know how to program, too. That doesn't change much. Neither does computer architecture or networking principles. Same for OS design and for parsers/compilers (the purple dragon book is still likely going to be the book you read for compilers and that was written 40 years ago).What you want to do at your stage is to continue passing your math and engineering classes because those are extremely important if you want to do anything with CS that doesn't involve basic software engineering. And the reason for that is going to be that the math classes you take will likely gate what upper division electives you can take. Go through your course catalog and look at the electives for your major. THOSE are going to lead to high-level, interesting stuff that *does* require a college education. For example, machine learning as a college junior or senior is severely more intensive than what you're going to experience through online tutorials aimed at people who don't have a CS background.The important thing is that a lot of interesting stuff that you can learn as a CS major *isn't necessarily CS.* If you want to learn about simulation, you might end up looking at stuff for civil engineers (and realize that you need to take more physics). If you want to learn more about data science, you might end up looking at economics and might need to take way more philosophy.

You can create a little temporary one for local testing, but if you want it to actually serve traffic on a domain name, it needs a real, trusted certificate.

The forwarding can happen through HTTP calls, but in modern data centers you may also encounter request forwarding through other protocols that are more suited like gRPC. Reverse proxy servers can also handle load balancing, i.e. if the same application is deployed multiple times behind the reverse proxy the reverse proxy can choose the application with the lowest load as the forward target so that no server becomes overly burdened.Reverse proxy servers can perform so called ""TLS termination"", where the reverse proxy handles the TLS handshake (and is aware of the TLS private keys that are used to prove service authenticity). This effectively strips the TLS functionality from the requests so that an application can focus purely on providing functionality, while the secure connection responsibility remains with the reverse proxy. However it is also possible (and encouraged) to encrypt a HTTP / gRPC connection that gets established within a data-center from the reverse proxy to the application server with TLS.

So most of the time there will be master, major, and patch. There can be two major branches, though it's not common. When we release a patch we merge it into the major, so that doesn't get cluttered.When a developer starts working in something, they branch from, usually, the patch branch. When they're happy they submit a pull request so someone else can review it, then merge once approved.This makes it very easy to keep things organized.

She'd made some really fun stuff in Scratch, with graphics she drew herself, but there's quite a bit more to programming than dragging little boxes around.

I could list a bunch of stuff I believe are important to know, but more than likely, miss quite a few in the process.A more broad answer is that the fact that you are aware of gaps in your knowledge is a great place to start! If you find yourself unaware of why an implementation is done the way it is - investigate it! Many of the frameworks you're using are likely Open Source, and likely developed in the open, with open issues, RFCs, etc. that describe exactly the sort of information you're missing.Now I don't know your skill level, so I don't know if you are well adept in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP, etc. But I would add that you should know what the frameworks you're using are doing for you. If it is a frontend UI framework - your first question should be ""Why am I using this?"", ""What problem is this framework solving for me?"" If your answer is ""because this guide tells me to"", then that's an issue.Understanding basic design patterns is also something I consider to be quite important. Sadly I think many traditional methods of showcasing these patterns are quite poor in terms of teaching the way one can internalize the patterns and use them - even if programming in a different language than the one being used to show examples in, and even if the implementation details differ to the way the patterns are shown.So, to summarize, my take is that the fact you're asking questions is half the way to progressing, now you just need to look for the answers. Mastering all of this is a craft, and it is ever evolving. But if you want to look past the frameworks as ""the stuff you learn"" and get to ""I use them to solve specific problems"", you need to be painfully aware of exactly what those problems are. This is also the only way you will ever gain a proper understanding of when to switch to a different framework. Remember this industry moves fast, most of the frameworks in use now either didn't exist or were quite new 10 years ago, and going back 10 more year will yield the same result. But knowing all of the fundamentals, as well as how and why the frameworks evolved as they did - that will always be relevant.",kastermester,2025-10-24 08:57:18,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oef5jb,False,

Spend as much time on a whiteboard as in any particular software, talking to a client, breaking down what functionality needs to be delivered, etc. For an app, you're going to spend a lot more time in something like Figma - or, hell, PowerPoint - than you will in an IDE to start off.People aren't as likely to have a full design of everything these days as they were back twenty years ago - deliver prototypes to the client fast, correct as you go is more common - but still you're going to spend at least a little bit of time figuring out what the app needs to *do* before you start writing code.So, like, a process I might recommend to someone new might be:\* Figure out your major requirements, produce some GUI mockups.\* Figure out what data you need to store and maybe make an ERD (entity relationship diagram)\* Sketch out the parts of the system - what's in the app, what's in the backend? What information do they need to communicate? What tech stacks will they use?\* Once you've got that all figured, write the smallest sliver of one part of it that can possibly be tested.\* Then write another small sliver that connects to the first one you created, see if they work together.\* They probably won't work together, so rewrite as needed.\* Repeat until you have a big enough chunk of functionality you can show/demo to see if it actually meets your requirements.\* Revise your requirements as needed, write more tiny pieces of functionality, test them with everything else, rewrite, repeat.Anyways, don't be afraid of scrapping code and starting over.

nkufb3l,"Not building Apps, but PC programs and Web-apps. Mostly small scale and/or personal projects right now, but I have experience with medium sized project (50 devs, over 1k active users, < tens of millions of datapoints)There is not one perfect order. This is the first decision you will have to make: Where do you start, and what project style do you go with.Since I am currently building a one man project, I can give you the order of operations as I did it:1. Rough outline: What is my project? Why would people care? What problem does it solve? What solutions are already available? Who are the potential users?2. Feature list: Itemized list of all features it should have. For each Feature I wrote down for whom it is useful, and what I need to to technically to get it to work. (Networking, database, things like that)3. Feature details: I then added something similar to user stories to my features: Basically, short descriptions of how a user would interact with it, and what they would expect to happen/see. On my whiteboard, I then drew a lot of boxes, denoting my features, and connected them with arrows: ""Feature A needs Feature B"", or ""Feature C leads to Feature D""4. I took everything I've built up to this point, and made UI mockups. First ""wireframes"" with a pen and paper, to roughly block out what could go where. then I made a single page in detail, to decide on a style for my UI. With those two in hand I went to some potential users, and used them to ""test"" my idea. I put the papers in front of them and asked them to perform a task (and I ended each test session by letting them choose a few tasks themselves) This resulted in me changing quite a few of my designs and intended workflows. It is good to catch errors as early and cheaply as possible. Changing the blockout version of a site costs a few hours in drawing, changing a coded version would take days or weeks.5. Then I sat down with my new UI and double checked, that all planned features are present, and that all parts of the UI are part of a planned feature. If not, I adjusted either side until I was happy. Then I used my feature List to plan my tech stack (yes, I did it this late in the game) Now I knew everything I wanted my (web)app to do and what it needed to do. So I chose rust(leptos) frontend, rust(axum) backend and postgresQL as my database. (shocker)6. With my new tech stack in hand, I made some rough diagrams of the architecture of the front and backend, something like a UML diagram, but much less formal. (because I am alone, as long as I can guarantee that I understand it, it's fine, and I have been using the same ""almost-UML"" since year 2 of university) I also mapped out the DB, but in excruciating detail, every nullable field, every relationship. Then I double checked again, that every feature, both in the UI and my docs, is present in my database.7. Then I started implementing a vertical slice: Meaning a single feature, from the DB to the UI, ""fully"" functional. I took this to even more testers, got feedback and did a final round of adjustments to my UI style plan.8. This is where I am now: I am currently implementing version 1 of my app, in it's entirety. This will be interrupted by testing with real users from time to time, but I am hoping that no major issues will come up, and I am confident that my architecture is strong enough to support refactoring most features.This is not ""the best"" way. But I was bitten by agile too often in the past, so for my free time, I wanted something a little more waterfally. I am certainly not moving as fast as I could, and if I was dependent on external funding, this might not be a path I could afford; but since it's only my spare time, I chose to take the time and try to get it right the first time. If I get it 75% right, I will be more than happy.EDIT: I forgot Step 0: I actually built a prototype. The UI was shit, and I only had 10% of my final featureset, but I wanted to see if the ""demand"" was there. It is.

The data and business logic would be in the 'M' (model) of an MVC architecture, while the presentation logic would be in the 'V' (view).Try to think about how easy it would be to swap the components within one of those layers for other components with minimal impact on the rest of the app. The fewer changes you have to make to interfaces between layers, the more decoupled they are.> Can someone please breakdown their typical workflow, do you start with back-end? ground level framework stuff, and then work your way up to re-usable shared features that can nest into full components later?If you imagine your architectural layers as being stacked one on top of the other, with the data layer at the bottom and the presentation at the top, then my approach is to design the architecture from the top down, then again from the bottom up, then finally once more from the top down.I start from the top because that's where the user lives, and it's the user experience that will drive the app. There's always a bit of tension between the the best implementation for the UI and the best implementation for the data, and that tension has to be resolved somewhere in the middle (e.g. at the API); so once you've established your data models from the perspective of the user, it helps to look at the system again from the perspective of the models, make sure you've established the best way store and query those models, then see how your UI will interact with those models. With your new understanding of how the data will be modelled, you might find a better design for the UI, or at least refine how your UI interacts with the models.",marrsd,2025-10-23 10:37:25,1,learnprogramming,t3_1odj3hg,False,

nlskwrd,"I'll just echo what others have said. If you already know the basics of writing code, find a problem you think is small enough that you can complete it, and then do it. I would strongly advice to NOT find random tutorials, walkthroughs etc. to help you with this. The main skills you want to accomplish solving these problems goes (IMO) something like this:1. Creative thinking: How should I even tackle this problem? When I think of ""create a program that does X, Y, Z"" - which subproblems does X, Y and Z actually consist of. This is a skill that you cannot really read your way towards, you have to DO it. If you find yourself stuck it is of course alright to look for solutions to subproblems, but again I would avoid copy/pasting code, look for general ideas you can apply to the problem solving at hand. 2. Just experience writing and debugging code. This is another area where reading the answers just don't help. You need to learn the error messages of whatever tool you're using and how they relate to problems in your code. This is probably the most frustrating part of all of this, as sometimes it can take hours only to realise it was some small silly thing that was wrong. But just to give an example of what I think about here (I don't know if this is still the case or not), but back in the day whenever reading error messages, regarding syntax, from PHP, usually the error was on the line above the one mentioned in the error message. Figuring out stuff like this, finding shortcuts for yourself in how to debug your code and general issues will enable you to write code for yourself. 3. You need some experience designing systems, as you become more and more skilled your systems will become bigger and probably more complex - and likely also more messy. I cannot remember how many years I wrote code before I was able to look back at code from just a year prior without thinking it was total crap. Nobody expects a junior to create beautiful architectured code, but you need to have experienced this epiphany of ""I wrote this, and it's trash, I should have done so and so"".Of course reading about code, be it design patterns, or something else entirely is also good. But you need to ensure that actually writing, debugging, testing code is the main part of what you spend your time on. I would suggest only reading for an explicit aim in solving something you are currently working on for the foreseeable future. It is very easy to fall into the trap of reading instead of doing and then thinking that you're becoming better book by book.

nlszwh6,"I remember that. I like Qt Creator and Godot for letting me drag stuff around. But I do not like to work on other people's projects in those things.There are a few fundamental tradeoffs here:The code is the truth. Whatever the wysiwyg editor makes must translate to code. Whatever the code says must be presentable by the wysiwyg editor. This usually breaks down as soon as you do something with the code that the wysiwyg editor can not handle, like some custom widget for example. To make that work you have to write extra code just to make the wysiwyg editor compatible with your code again.On the flip side a lot of the frontend code has structure that the wysiwyg editor can not show. DOM has a box model that doesn't allow you to simply drag/drop a button anywhere. The only way to do that is to position it with absolute. You wouldn't do that because it breaks responsiveness with different view-ports. Instead you would work with padding, margins, grid layouts etc to get the desired effect - but the wysiwyg cannot show that. It can only hint at that.This in turn usually leads to people who're used only to the wysiwyg editor to forget about the underlying structure. There's plenty of precedent for that. LaTeX for example is about code representing structured text and styles to render headlines differently than normal text, Microsoft Word simply allows you to make text large and bold to emulate a heading. But the loss of structure also means you can't do the other stuff LaTeX can do like creating content listings and reducing page breaks immediately after headings. Designers who create mockups in Figma _can_ do really great work, or they can simply slap some shapes there and call it a day. But since the code will be the truth eventually, someone has to translate those shapes into the structure anyway.Lastly, the people who work with code all day have a different problem than the people who rely mainly on wysiwyg editors. Graphical user interfaces are about discoverability of features and a quick preview of the final product. Material pipelines in Blender for example work very well as boxes connected with wires. Code has about information density, and is easier to work with. No graphical tool can fit as much information on a screen as well written text. Copy and pasting text works between tons of editors, but copy and pasting graphical elements only works in the same tool. You can check text into version control and get diffs or even move detection, that doesn't work for graphical elements unless it compiles to text first.",aanzeijar,2025-10-28 10:33:19,2,learnprogramming,t3_1oi54ny,False,

Then it's not as straightforward, but very possible and quite easy to figure out where the data is coming that you actually want to search using your browser's dev tools. Say you're visiting funerals.com or whatever, but the site actually fetches its data from funerals.com/funerals?start=2025-10-24&end=2525-10-25 and populates the website dynamically.Now you have the API (application programming interface) endpoint and you can just fetch that data instead of the whole website.Once you have that working, you can look into cronjobs or scheduled tasks, if you're on windows, to make your script run automatically at specified times and then look into notifications.

I start by explaining the idea of what I want to do and what I might need to make it. Brief 4-5 lines as an intro to the project2) Aims and Objectives. Here I detail exactly what I want and what it needs to be a success. This help keep things on track and prevent scope creep as I can always focus on what I really need and the real objectives in the background. 3) Plan. First through rundown of how I think I’ll build it. You don’t need to be exact on every detail but figure out what you’re going to need. Login section, landing page, diff options, processing input for ‘x’ or ‘y’ and how it’s done/what the out put should be. 4) Components. List out the big bits you need to do. Parts that need to be put together with key functions and features. It’s to track that plan you did earlier and figure out what needs to be done at a glance. 5) Variables Functions libraries and Header files. List out all the variable you’re using and why you use them, do the same for function. Very basic ones can just be named with type, you don’t need an explanation but if you won’t know at first glance what it does write it out. What are we importing from this library. Why did we make that header file and what’s in it/how does it work. Keep updating as you move along6) Working journal. This one might branch into a different file depending on the size of the project. Start the project, write out what you need to do first and what you’re planning to work on. I usually put the date in but that’s just for me to be able to look back over it. Every day I start by bringing unfinished tasks forward and writing out the next set of tasks I need to finish. Copy across what you’re doing and what’s not working and the final version when it is. Anything important or interesting I need to note for later goes in here. “Had to scrap an entire section and restart it”, throw that in here and explain why. At the end of the session I list out what I did today and what I need to do on the next session (cuts back 10-15 min of figuring out where to start when you sit down next time). 7) Closing Brief. I usually move this up after the objective section once I’m finished. How did the project go? Did you achieve your goals? What was difficult how did you get around it? What would you like to improve further? And finally are you happy with the finished product? 8) Lessons learned, at the end of the file, where did you go wrong and what do you know now about doing “x”, “y” or “z” for next time. .Read Me file:After the project I’ll make the read me file. 1) Update the Concept, Aims, Components and Brief so I have a concise document that anyone I share the project with will be able to understand what’s going on and why it’s built this way. 2) Features:Detail what the project takes in and what the intended out puts should be. If it’s an API detail the call and expected output if it’s a web app follow a trace of how the user progresses through the app. Think of it as a guide on how someone else should use the application. 3) Components:List out the key functions and methods, how they work and how you’ve used them. No need for major details just let people know why it’s important and what you were thinking with it. 4) Closing Statement:Detail what you achieved in making this application. What needs more work and whether you intend to come back and work on anything else. .It’s a good habit to start tracking your projects as you go along even just for your own notes. When you look back at this in 6 months or 2 years are you going to know what you were thinking on April 3rd when you need to fix/plan around a similar issue in the future. The notes.txt file is just for me and I usually put it in the gitignore. It’s helped out in interviews when I was asked to walk through some of my work I’ll pull up my notes file and can quickly find key details on what I was doing and how I did it. I’ve shared my screen to show some of the details or pulled up A specific part of my journal where I figured out a problem. Really helps to have actual example of what you did and how you processed the problem before finding the solution. You can also then say “Well I know about this library now that fixes this for me but I could build it myself again if I needed to”. Very small concept projects or feature test I don’t do this out.

nlvebq6,"First of all, please don't write 12=3. Twelve is not equal to three. What you mean is f(12) = 3 and you need to figure out how to implement that function ""f"". So, there is this function f and when you use different inputs, you get different outputs.|i|f(i)||:-|:-||1|1||12|3||123|6||1234|10||12345|15||and so on||That means there's a function ""g"" that also returns f(i) but you instead only insert the last digit of ""i"". f(123) = g(3) = 6 f(1234) = g(4) = 10 and so onlet's say that ""g"" takes ""n"". So, i = 123, n = 3, and the result is 6.As you explained, it is n+1 more than g(2). In this case n is 2 and 2+1 is the 3 from above. The last number to add is just ""n"". However, there's a trick. More on that later.You could use recursion here, but that's not necessary. But just for fun:g(4) = 4 + g(3) Or more generally (for natural numbers): g(1) = 1 g(n) = n + g(n-1)Now it's just simple maths. I hope you like maths.g(n) = n + g(n-1) g(n) = n + (n-1) + g(n-2)g(n) = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + g(n-3) If n is 4 then g(n-3) = 1 g(4) = 4 + (4-1) + (4-2) + g(4-3) = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1OK, so far it checks out. But that didn't help. So let's so some more analysis:1 12 123 1234 12345That looks like a triangle. So, it's like a right-angled triangle with a side length of 5. Duplicate and flip it:1 54321 12 4321 123 321 1234 21 12345 15 rows with 6 digits. f(5) = 5\*6=30 But we copied the triangle, so f(5) = 30/2 = 15It works with",vegan_antitheist,2025-10-28 18:26:59,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oifme5,False,

nlthjqi,"I mean, this just sounds like a random selection of buzzwords to me. You should always start with the question: What are my requirements? Otherwise, if you just spam ""corporate tech stack"" things, you will end up like this: [https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) (yes, the joke is 10 years old, and still relevant today)Just as comments to your list: 1. all of this seems okay and important, for most java/spring backends2. Why? I mean, microservices CAN be great, but they always increase complexity, both to develop and to deploy. If you can't give enough good reasons as to why you need microservices, a monolith might be better. 3. I don't know what you mean by ""completely""? It is probably not necessary to learn postgresql ""completely"" (that would take a loooong time), because in all seriousness: your app will most likely not need 100% of all possible performance out of your database. Even if everything you write is 10x slower than possible, it will still be more than fast enough in reality. 4. Monolith is simpler, Microservices scale differently and can do a clean separation of concerns. Monolith should be your default!5. afaik you can just deploy docker images to kubernetes, no? My understanding is, that kubernetes is just a more fancy way of managing deployed images, and stuff, but I am not very experienced in deployment. 6. Again, why do you need this? Ci/Cd sounds good on paper, but especially the CD part adds a lot of complexity to your deployment phase. If you can't articulate, why, default to a normal, manual deployment whenever you think a release is ready. 7. Cloud is just an invisible server. You can get a VPS for very cheap, which doesn't run the risk of increasing your cloud bill into the stratosphere, if you use too many CPU cycles. Start there. As with CI/CD and Kubernetes, this is really not a developer issue. It's a deployment and DevOps issue. At small scales, you can do it yourself, but you really don't need a lot of complexity, and when you are working at a company, there will be a separate position for this. 8. This is legitimately the most important point on your list for a developer, and there is no single correct answer. As with all design decisions, there are a lot of possible tradeoffs. While I don't have a good book for that handy, I would suggest reading up on your favourite API Design (REST for example), because much ink has probably been spilled about that topic. Also: experience. Just build some APIs and see what works, and what gives you more issues in the long run, when you try to refactor a new feature for example. 9. So, this is complicated: Most backend system have a proper event system / observer pattern thing going, like flask or axum both have pretty good signals internally. As long as you build a monolith, this is really good and should definitaly be used. Kafka is just a way to send signals over multiple microservices, which CAN be useful, or it can just add more unnecessary complexity! As with everything else that adds complexity, start with the assumption, that you should not use kafka, unless you can articulate why you need it!",Beregolas,2025-10-28 12:41:22,5,learnprogramming,t3_1oi7s46,False,

Knowing everyting else is just a bonus, but I can look up how certain commands work, or how I send a message over kafka: I don't need to know this by heart to be a senior!The way to learn this is probably just practice. You can practice by coding, and by doing stuff, that helps you switch abstraction levels (which you can also learn best by coding imo). The important thing is: no one can have an accurate mental model of 10k lines of code, and that is pretty tame as far as big codebases go. In the last corporate project I worked on, we had 3 main (and several smaller) microservices with about 30k-60k loc each. So instead of memorizing files, I learned the structure of the project. When I was asked, where to find a feature, I could then think through it logically. This only works, if your project is internally consistent, so if you have every piece of code placed correctly. For example, we had all models in a folder, all endpoints in a folder, with subfolders for very large collections of endpoints, all validation code was together, all signals where in a single folder, and so on. At that point, it's just like following a map: ""Okay, you want to know about the bookmarking function for an article.

You're not learning how to USE the language, and they're not teaching you problem solving skills. Your programming classes give you some context for your other classes - computation theory, DSA, applied mathematics... It also gives you some exposure - this is the job, staring at a screen, walls of text, arbitrary decisions, bastard bugs. Is this something you want to do all day, every day, for the next 45 years?When you graduate, your education didn't finish, it only just begun. You don't pop out an expert. The end of college is only the beginning of the rest of your life. WE KNOW you don't know shit. THAT is why we hire junior developers - not because you're cheap, not because we couldn't afford a senior, but because juniors tend to multiply the force of a senior, because we can mold you into what you need to be successful here.I'll bet when you're done with this semester you couldn't actually tell me what OOP even is or adequately demonstrate it. It's not a judgement on you - all programming and college courses are saturated with dogmas and traditions. They call it an OOP course but don't actually teach it, typically because your professors don't actually know, either.So when you graduate, your programming experience isn't terribly relevant. C++, Python... What I need to know is how you think, if you can learn and adapt. Can I mold you into the person I need here to solve our problems? Ostensibly, the answer is ""yes"", so the major difference between you and another candidate is not what you ""know"", but the aptitude you both demonstrate. Obviously I'm going to hire the one with the greater potential, insofar as my hiring process can deduce. We don't have great tools for this - your GPA is SOMETHING but only tells a particular kind of story. It can mean you can learn a lot and make connections, or it can mean you can memorize the material long enough to ace a test. So GPA alone isn't enough. Your personality also counts for something - can I see myself working with you for the next 5 years? Are you going to mesh well with the personality of the team? You don't have to be smarter than the other guy to be the better fit.Once you get hired here, we'll teach you what you need to know to be successful. So don't sweat it. If you're hired, it means you're good enough, you've got the right stuff, and that we want to build you up and see you succeed. We know that's going to take time.Watch out for puppy mills - places that want junior graduates to also paradoxically have 3-5 years experience. That's not junior, that's not entry level. Also, if a company doesn't hire you - they're doing you a favor. Often it's because it's not a good fit - and that there is a TWO-WAY street. You DO NOT want to work for a place you don't fit in, that kind of misery WILL take years off your life.So focus on your fundamentals, your problem solving skills, and your joy of the craft. A good GPA won't hurt, either. Very quickly, the programming language fades away, and becomes a tool, a means to an end - you won't even see the code anymore.

It's switching your tools to revisit a concept you're comfortable with. Your issue isn't needing a new language or framework, but to continue down a singular path, even when it gets difficult. That will expose your weaknesses. Only then can you see them for what they are and improve upon them. I'm a beginner, so I don't have any meaningful advice regarding what to do next, though. .Perhaps search up ""github (insert text here)"" repos that can help you get more project experience. Things like ""project based learning, how to build x, app ideas, beginner projects, intermediate projects.""As you go through them, think of how you'd do things differently and do it. Think of an idea or two you can add, and attempt it. Think of how you'd add a new feature once you're done and get to starting. Don't copy line by line, but actually learn as you're interacting with them. if you can't do anything but copy line by line, then pause at certain points and see if you can recreate everything from scratch up to that point. If you can't remember, keep going through it until you can memorize it and understand why things are happening the way they are. Then, see if you can make small changes at this point.Get familiar with how they break down these big and difficult topics, then try to do so yourself with your own ideas. The moment you hit a roadblock trying to break it down, don't run away from it. Instead, confront it. What's the issue? Is it still too hard to code when you broke it down? You can't think of any other way to break it down or even start to break an idea down?That's a sign you need to research how others break down their ideas. Usually, when that wall is hit, it's a sign of a lack of knowledge on the subject. You can watch videos, read articles, check out docs, or follow a tutorial or lesson on that specific thing. Then, when you know enough about it, break it down more. When you break those things down but hit an early wall, repeat the process. Do this enough times until you get to a stage where you can build something yourself (or can follow a tutorial to build that sub idea).

There's not really a great use case for VLAs compared to just using `calloc(3)` when you need a dynamically allocated array of `N` items each `M` bytes large. There's not usually a significant amount of memory overhead for declaring an array of 100 ints if we know we need fewer. This can change if you start doing embedded development, but it's generally fine to have unused array space. Save worrying about memory usage and efficiency for after you're comfortable writing code in the language.2. Yeah, pointers are where things get tricky for most learners. You use them all the time in python and other languages without thinking though, like when you pass an instance of an object to a function, or use `self` in methods. C just doesn't hide those sorts of implementation details, so you have to learn them to be productive, otherwise you won't be able to solve certain problems efficiently.3. K&R may be technically outdated, but if you get the 2nd edition on ANSI C (first standardised version), it's still an excellent learning resource. Pointers will still be baffling at first, but once you start messing with them more it should start to make sense.Fun fact: your sort in place function would have to take a pointer argument, as it can't possibly recieve the unsorted array otherwise without it being a global variable. It should have a signature like `int sort_values(int *array, int list_length)` if you want to return a value indicating success/failure/already sorted or `void sort_values(int *array, int list_length)` to simply perform the sorting.

Pay is shitty but would you personally take a job with shitty pay for swe?I was at a private non-tech company in a non-tech city working on safety critical medical devices, think dialysis machines, for 15 years It was my first job at out school in 2006 and I made 42.5K. At the end I was leading teams of 20 SWEs on multi-year cross functional projects making 110K.People will ask, why didn't you leave? The answer was I was never good enough to find another job when I decided to start looking. The problem was my experiences didn't match the YOE or title at other companies.At the end of the day I was working at a non-tech company, their goal was pumping out features and meeting the bare minimum of FDA guidelines, not creating quality code. Lots of things I know tech companies do this company had no interest in doing.I even worked in my free time to develop a prototype of how something like Jenkins could help by running automated tests nightly. When management found out they literally told me ""if you want to work extra on the weekends work on project priorities or don't work on anything at all."" The issue was management didn't care about things I was trying to solve.They were content with the speed of development, which was slow. They were content with how automated testing were run at the whim of people who owned the tests and sometimes issues would be found late in to the process. They were content with all the tech debt, because it wasn't preventing them from meeting their goals of getting FDA approval.At the end of the day they know creating an FDA approved medical device takes a long time and they were confident they could talk away any issues that did not affect patient safety. There were 100's of bugs that did not affect patient safety in the bug tracker, but fixing them was only priority when doctors or patients complained.

When we were in discussions about the new grad class, that project was mentioned often and certainly kept him above the fold. It should be noted that he had to pass the interview solely on technical merits.One side point with this is that he was extremely difficult to work with because of this. He kept mentioning how he had built an app with thousands of users so he knew what he was talking about. We were building a company at petabyte scale with millions of users, so his experience was not particularly applicable. Not saying that you're like this, but it's something to be aware of. It shows that you're a go-getter and good at figuring things out, which are important qualities of a great SWE, but a SWE role at a big company is an entirely different skill set than a successful app builder.On the other side of the coin, I was able to land my first internship through a successful project.

The first movers here, as in any labor struggle, will likely be casualties. Workplaces will -- as has been happening -- retaliate. People will be fired and blacklisted, whole departments shuttered, etc.In the \*absence\* of a broader cultural context around labor consciousness, the lesson these retaliations teach is ""that was a bad move, you can't win"". Whereas in a context of solidarity, it is more acceptable to take personal risks to advance the greater good.

nlfhcby,"Unionizing is a great idea but unfortunately there are problems with this idea that in my opinion this will exacerbate the problem. First and foremost, if software devs unionize then it will give the companies a golden opportunity to push for more AI and outsourcing. Simply because the people here are complaining about work hours, pay but hey over there in this other country we can abuse the living shit out of people and our operating costs are lower.Secondly, software developer position is highly dependent on the thing/service the company is trying to make. For example, a person sitting in pakistan or india can make the same website/app that any person any american software developer can make. Moreover, these people will bend over backwards to adjust to the american demand. Thirdly, unions will demoralize and depress the high salaries one can find in tech companies. Again, for example pilots in air canada are paid bonkers and the union has to constantly fight against the corporation to hold a bargain. Fourthly, the supply of software engineers is slightly higher than the demand at the current moment. This will overall negatively impact the strength of the movement. A new grad software developer doesn't have the leverage to bargain for higher salary because of inexperience.This is however, not the end. If you want, push the law makers and politicians, collective force to lobby the government into taxing the companies which outsource or use more AI. The way I see the current problem in software industry is that, the big players want to cash in on the AI demand, the mid level companies are trying to make a product which will earn them the attention from big companies. The government is only interested in sucking rich peoples' cocks. There is nothing to stand in the way.Other commenter u/dontping mentioned some other pathways, which are viable but they demand more time and effort than the current market is willing to deploy.

If your org can just be eliminated or you can easily be replaced, and everything else will stay standing without you, then you have no job security. If you are directly driving the company's financials, no one else can run your machine, and everyone else that is important to the business likes you and will be pissed and follow you if you are fired, then you have near-infinite job security.

It's inevitable that there will be some bad projects out there, either in tech talent of the team, bad product vision, or operational politics, only some of which the manager can control. The last director I knew who left not on his own accord was fired (or you know, replaced, 'left to pursue other opportunities' or whatever) was fired because his project went against architectural guidelines which led to risks that the business was unable to accept.It's also expensive to lay off directors, and VPs especially.

Both fields have their pros and cons, for me tech was more what I wanted to do and had a lot less cons.As far as electrical goes the pros are you will always have a job, you don’t need to worry about being replaced by Ai, you aren’t getting laid off and not finding a job (there are layoffs, more so in residential if the economy has a downturn but there are other jobs you can get quickly still). The pay is also good state dependent, I made about 70k year 1, year 2 I was close to 6 figures, and the next several years I was ~120-200k depending on overtime and how much I wanted to work.The negatives: you often get shit work days (weekends, nights), poor pto, work holidays, work in hazardous environments, it’s hard on your body, and you work with people who HR would have a meltdown if they heard for 5 minutes (gay jokes, teasing you, political talk, stuff some aren’t comfortable with I didn’t mind but I’ve seen several people quit a week or 2 in over it). I’d recommend industrial if you go the path. It’s more dangerous as you work with big stuff but you keep plants running like you can work for a refinery, brewery, stuff like that.

And while reducing cost is always a concern for a contracted workforce, generally in product companies, the thought process is a bit long-term.Usually, any decent boss would focus their energy on three things: a. Hiring good people (with good skills and high ownership), b. Getting them excited about the domain and deepening their engagement in the company business by growing them, nurturing them to be a team player, finally, c. Weeding out the bad apples - hopefully fast.In a long-term play, a few days, weeks, sometimes months of lean periods do pop up, and that’s the opportunity to clean house (reduce tech debt, refactor, cross-learn from other modules, do hackathons, and have fun, etc). And good bosses keep their own backlog of these things ready for these low periods.Tech work is not as transactional as some other careers. The value generated by good engineers compounds with time as they improve their skills and understand the domain better. 'Keep them busy - no matter what' attitude usually leads to a sub-optimal outcome.So no, bosses don’t look for ways to cut their teams as soon as they run into a low patch.This doesn’t apply to situations like contracting, a dying/loss-making company, bad performers, over-hiring (which happened right after COVID), and teams run by bad management/bosses.",eRajsh,2025-10-23 09:07:28,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1odxic5,False,

Practically no company will support this permanently.I sometimes do and see people do something else: You start your day at the beginning of the work hours, check in and be available but do not actively work. When somebody needs to reach you, you respond. If you have a meeting you join. Then when it’s 2, you start actively working. After official work hours end you continue working until 10, but tone the communication down and stop answering to people who want to reach out, until next day.

When you look on social media, or listen to others, you're only hearing about the top developers, you don't hear about Jim who spends his days doing the grunt work that allows the top developers to have the time to do what they do. You don't need to be genius to be a great developer, you just need to build and listen/learn from your colleagues every step of the way. And maybe in 10-15 years you'll be a top developer, or maybe you'll prefer work life balance and just be a regular developer like the vast majority of us are. >What are some directions I should chase? https://roadmap.sh/machine-learningLearn from those who came before and follow their path, or make your own path, but you'll have to learn the same basic things so following other people's paths is generally more efficient.Also, as someone else mentioned, you will almost certainly need to learn leetcode questions. Don't panic they're easier than most people think. The easy level questions shoudln't be too hard, go through 20-30 of them to see what sorts of questions you'll be asked. But before moving to medium or hard, first learn DS/A. Data Structures and Algorithms is what Leetcode is there to test (not entirely, but basically). Most jobs will almost never need it, but really complex problems solved at scale (think Google Map's directions handling hundreds of millions of requests a minute) do, so Google started using these questions to test their recruits and the rest of the industry couldn't be bothered to make their own interviews, so now we all have to answer them. This youtube channel has some great lessons on how DSA/Leetcode all works:https://www.youtube.com/@mycodeschoolThey don't cover every element of DSA but do cover the most common. Either watch a video, then go to neetcode.io and practice the questions related to that video, or get a question on neetcode.io, look at the answers, then go find the videos that cover the answers and watch the video and then learn how and why the answers work. Sorry if that's unclear, my point is don't sit and try to ""learn"" how to answer leetcode questiosn on your own, lots of them are not ""intuitive"" and you will only get annoyed. It's much simpler to understand the question, then find the answer soemone else already fine tuned and learn that. If you want to fix a car, you don't just go smashing on things and see what happens, you get the manual. For leetcode, DSA and neetcode.io togehter, are your manual. And no, you don't need to pay for neetcode.io for it to be incredibly useful, you get better organization if you pay, but it's all still very usable for free. Though I will say, its' a pretty useful site, so I did end up paying, but I actually got the lifetime membership after I got my job and had some money coming it.

Sometimes just having a toolkit of techniques can make a big difference in those overwhelming moments.

nl3aos6,"It's a matter of picking your battles. In my experience ""clean code"" is very much in the eye of the beholder and is more a matter of whether the author and the reader are on the same page rather than any objective superiority of any particular method of coding. Just like any other sort of writing. There are of course some general principles that tend to make things better, and it is certainly possible to make *horribly unclear* code, but past a certain point a lot of it really is a matter of taste.So essentially a person who has strong opinions about specific details of how code should be written is similar to a person who thinks their preferred genre of music is superior to others, or otherwise thinks their taste is superior -- they are wrong, but it's going to be very difficult to convince them of that, and the more persuasive you are the more they will probably dig in and get pissed at you.So you'll need to decide which things *you* care about and which things you don't. If you don't actually care about something, just go along with what they want and smile and nod anytime they try to justify it, content that they're trying to justify it to themselves as much as to you.If you do care, really think again about whether you actually do care. Lots of people don't actually care about things they fight for but rather let ego get tied up in it and are instead fighting over ego. Try to avoid that if possible. So really think about whether you genuinely do care.And if you genuinely do, try to act in good faith. Explain what you think, then invite them to explain what they think and walk you through their thought process and be genuinely open to it. They might actually have good reasons, and so *you* should be open to changing *your* mind. But inviting them to explain will both make them feel like they are valued (which is important to them if they have strong opinions about how the code should be written) and also let them talk themselves out of ideas that are bad (like, if you explain a good idea and ask them to explain theirs, they will have a hard time denying yours is better if they actually have to explain it, and because it is them talking it through and deciding they will be more likely to compromise than if you order them to).Inviting them to explain also gets both of you on the same side -- rather than arguing you are instead both looking at the same problem and talking about it as a thing separate from yourselves. And that change in perspective is helpful -- it makes them feel less like *they* are being devalued if their ideas aren't used.In my experience, most workers do ultimately want to get along and do good stuff, and if you can diffuse their defense mechanisms and avoid getting defensive yourself you can usually find a common ground.But if a person truly is an asshole and can't be reasoned with and truly is my way or the high way, and you really do care about the thing they're digging in on, your best bet is probably to try to go around them. Build support for others / get others to validate your view. After all, if the person is an asshole to you then they have probably been an asshole to others as well, and so you probably will find support.

The first is to find a job at a company that has a relaxed WLB. That's hard to do on command, at any company, in any role. Historically the best option has been government work, which right now is more volatile than it has been in the past. When I've seen this work out for people in the private sector, the situation is usually that they got hired into a ""boring"" company that doesn't pay particularly well, and they stayed long enough that they're performing well and worth more in the market vs. their current job so therefore they have the leverage to push for a great WLB. This isn't your situation. So if you can find a company like this, great!

As you scale you gain more leverage to incentivize companies/clients to implement their own pre-processing (or provide as a paid service) to gain access to your tool.

It's pretty ergonomic and it makes it so invalidly using the API is a compiler error rather than a runtime error.

Nothing about design patterns makes you're code A) correct or B) performant, and most the time you end up taking what was a really simple problem and making it wayyyyy over engineered and over abstracted. The worst is when people go to build out something and they start with a design pattern in mind that they want to use and the first implementation is driven by that pattern, rather than the actual problem that needs to get solved. Outside of stuff prescribed by a frameworks, starting with a pattern is a terrible idea, you have no idea what functioning code will look like and even worse, you have no idea if a pattern is even necessary for what you are trying to accomplish. Depending on what patterns you are even using, you may actually be affecting the compilers ability to optimize the instruction set because it can't reason about the amount of misdirection you have introduced into the code.I'm not saying there is never a use case for design patterns, but more often than not, if you just keep it simple and straight forward, your life will be easier.

nlizfst,"You’re not a fraud. You got a CS degree and that is a testament to your knowledge and ability to learn and grow in this field.I don’t know what companies are looking for with respect to new grads these days. It used to be the case that companies hired knowing you had zero experience but the capacity to learn and grow into the role. These days, since there’s so many new grad applicants, the bar for hiring has been raised and so you’ll need to improve your resume to get interviews and improve your interview skills to increase the odds of performing well.Think of it as levels in a game, you'll want to focus your energy on one level at a time (more or less). Since you're not landing interviews, this the first level to pass. Get constant feedback on your resume. You should be iterating on it — share it with friends or redditors to get feedback, make improvements, and send it out to companies (job boards, networking, etc). If you get callbacks, this means your resume is good enough. If not, keep doing that iterative feedback loop until you do. Once you feel you're landing interviews a bit more consistently, then you'll need to focus on the interview rounds. I don't really know what that entails for new grads, but you seem to be on the right track. Practicing leetcode as a way to prove your understanding of DSA is good. Working on personal projects is also good. Keep track of what problems you encounter and what you did to solve them, and be able to communicate that. They don't expect you to be an expert, just want to know how you think and tackle problems. It's great that you're focusing on infra and LLM projects btw. There's no right or wrong path here, the field is too broad so it's best to do what you're interested in because enjoyment is a crucial recipe for making progress and preventing burnout. It's better to have some depth here rather than shallow breadth. It really sucks that this is the market you’re graduating into, but you’re definitely not a fraud, and you're definitely not alone in this experience. Do what you need to sustain a living and be sure to socialize, exercise, and eat well to keep your mental health in good shape too!

A lot of our stuff is internal, so its gonna be new anyway. I think just have a good foundation, and learn on the job is the best. For the job part: If you don't have the job or interview, focus on getting the interview. if you got the interview, focus on passing the interview.Worry about the not knowing things part after you get the job. Not all companies have a good onboarding/ramp-up time for you, but that's not something you can control anyway. Once you get there, find out what you need to know for your team's projects and tech stack. Go from there.I didn't have AI to help me when I started, but I think AI makes it way easier to learn quickly nowadays. Use it to understand the code base. Like if you need to modify a part of something in the codebase, use AI to find where the code is and understand what patterns this codebase use and get suggestions.Need to build something from scratch? Use AI to quickly understand parts of the tech stack you don't understand. Feed it documentation and ask questions. Clarify your understanding, but be skeptical about what it tells you. ask it to confirm, ask it for direct reference sin the documentation if you're unsure.I don't really know what's best for a junior in this era of AI-assisted tools. But my personal opinion is that you use it to augment your learning potential and gain experience. Once you have more experience, perhaps you can use it to vibe code or output tons of code.

nlj368s,"The problem with academic programming in school is that business has an entirely different set of needs, tools and development processes. As a junior-level person, you're not expected to know all that stuff. There are a couple of exceptions to this rule -- startups frequently expect new grads to know as much and be able to perform at the level a senior with full implementation level knowledge of their tech stack in the first week. FAANGs might also have higher expectations and be more unforgiving as well, depending on the FAANG.Larger corporations that aren't FAANG will generally have well established IT groups who can offer a decent level of mentorship. Maybe focus on trying to find a spot at one of those.The more you know in general the better. Being able to set up docker instances and CI/CD pipelines is a pretty good skill to have, even if you don't find devops particularly interesting. You might even want to go look at hashicorp's terraform and tools like that, that allow you to stand up a huge amount of infrastructure with the wave of a hand. I don't particularly care for terraform's configuration, would much rather do it in python, but it's still a pretty neat tool and a good one to have in your toolbox. You are very much building out a toolbox now, and it's good to know the things you have at your disposal.I wouldn't suggest coding directly with AI. There are a couple reasons for that and your instincts are good that if you just blindly copy and paste AI code, you're not really going to learn anything. Poke at the problem a bit and use the AI for inspiration. If it writes code for you, try to read and understand it and possibly even rearrange it a bit. Rather than ""Write some code to do X"", focus on ""How do I do X"" and try to understand the underlying concepts.Also, relax! Back in the 80's when I was getting started, there was already way more to know about this field than any single person could know. Math has been like that since Isaac Newton's day -- before him, one single person could know everything there was to know about math. He gave us the map to an infinite landscape. Programming is similar, an infinite landscape of the mind. Don't try to understand it all at once and accept that there will be things you couldn't have even imagined were out there. Maybe you'll even invent one of them one day!Got a couple of funny stories for you if you care to keep reading.Funny story about relaxing: I decided to learn how to skydive when I was in my early 40's. My instructors kept telling me to relax. And I was all like ""I'M ABOUT TO JUMP OUT OF AN AIRPLANE! I AM NOT GOING TO RELAX!"" A few months later I went to the indoor skydiving wind tunnel and told my instructor I just wanted to mess around today and not focus on learning anything. As soon as I hit the wind I felt my whole body relax and I realized that *I'd never done that before!* And I flew so well that day. And knowing how to relax, my driving (which I'd been doing for ~30 years at that point) immediately improved as well. It took a somewhat extreme experience to get me to that point, and it's something I wish I'd learned much earlier in my life.Funny story about people skills: Empathy is a human superpower. We have the ability to think about what another person might be thinking and feeling and act on how we think they're feeling. Hone that power to a fine edge and it's as close to telepathy as we're gonna get. At some point along the way, I found that while reading code, I could get a sense of how well the programmer who wrote it understood the requirements and even their mood and how they were feeling when they wrote the code. It's weird when it happens.So back in the poker craze of the early 2000s there were a bunch of guys around who'd go to bars and set up tables to run free poker tournaments. They'd arrange to get a small kickback from the bar for each customer they brought in. I got laid off from a company I was working for at the time so I started frequenting these tournaments, as they were free to enter and usually offered a free $30 bar tab to the winner of the tournament. I could pick up one or two of those a week and get one or two halfway decent meals out of them. Playing poker taught me to look at people. I can't read people as well as I can read code, but the first time I knew what a guy's hand was just from watching him while he was thinking about betting, I felt like a sorcerer.So learn what you can about computers, but also learn what you can about yourself and the species you belong to.
