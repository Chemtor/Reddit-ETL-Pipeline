msxfok2,"Ways I would tackle it:1. Denormalized counters in your post record (small scale)You add integer columns like `comments_count`, `likes_count` directly on your posts table.Whenever someone adds or removes a comment (or like), you increment/decrement that column instead of re‑scanning all comments.Most relational databases (Postgres, MySQL) can do an atomic `UPDATE posts SET comments_count = comments_count + 1 WHERE id = ?` cheaply, especially when that column is in memory.This would be my first pick given you can ship this in minutes with zero infrastructure beyond your main database.2. Sharded or distributed counters (mid scale)For “hot” posts with millions of comments/likes - think celebrities, viral content etc., a single counter can become a write hotspot.You break it into N shards: UPDATE comment_counter_shards SET shard_count = shard_count + 1 WHERE post_id = ? AND shard_id = rand_between(1, N)To read the total, you sum over those N shards. N is tuned (often 4–16) so no single row fights over locks.This solution pays off only when your single‑row updates actually become a bottleneck (once you hit sustained write contention). Until then its probably an overkill.3. In‑memory caching (Redis, Memcached, etc.)Maintain the “current” counts in a fast key‑value store. On each write you atomically INCR or DECR the Redis key (e.g. post:123:comments).Feed readers pull from cache, falling back to the database only if the cache miss occurs.Each 1 & 2 solutions could be combined with this method for low-latency reads.I am about to drive - lemme think of other ways, I will edit and add to this post if something else comes up.UPDATE: Some more thoughts:To keep write latency low, counters could update asynchronously (e.g. via a message queue).You accept sub‑second lag in the displayed count in exchange for high throughput (which for non-YMYL stuff like like/comment count is acceptable).Also worth noting, there are specialized data stores with native counters like Cassandra and Bigtable from Google. They support atomic counter columns across distributed nodes, so you offload the complexity of sharding and locking.But if you are at that stage and its your own service, you probably made it and I want your job :)Anyways, its weekend.

This is fairly common though, so the thought of cloning a prod table to dev environment could get you in trouble. Generally speaking though, any transformative logic that needs to be worked out can be done via specially curated files containing essential data points and scenarios within the data. Or you can simply write up a script against prod data so you can ensure your features make sense and then plug that in. Though in my experience the latter is less common.And yes during deployment phase you would ensure that these parameters that point to specific environments would be replaced with the relevant environment that the code has been merged to. Dev -> Test, Test -> Stage, etc… keep in mind though that there are times where dev, test, stg, prod are not simply different schemas in a larger database but are entirely different databases/workspaces themselves and have maintained the same naming convention so sometimes nothing needs to change.

msze1ti,"I'd say that an Inmon approach (at least originally, the man keeps evolving his ideas and publishing new books) compares better as a data architecture, much like a data mesh, more than Kimball (at least when he started, that guy kept on expanding his concepts as well).Inmon's DW design favored more or less 3 data layers:- A raw layer, that started as a landing zone and eventually evolved to an ""operational data store"". Originally is way quite simple, but an ODS was supposed to provide operational level reporting capabilities, with even near real-time if possible (it was quite visionary when proposed in the 90s);- A Data Warehouse layer, which was supposed to have a fully integrated view of the business for analytical purposes. This matched mostly his definition: ""subject-oriented, non-volatile, integrated, time-variant collection of data"". The DW layer is rarely, if ever, accessed by BI tools or end users. It is the single source of truth that feeds the specific databases (next bullet) supporting analytic and decision nerds. As such, it tends to be more normalized (not really full 3NF, but in that direction), as this would make it more reusable for different sets of requirements - including future ones.- Data marts: these are tightly scoped to the needs of specific use cases. For reporting and BI, it's common to model those as Kimball star schemas; for data science, other formats, even files, are possible. For specific reports, it could be a very custom thing.This actually is the source for a medallion architecture, and also became a full data architecture before Kimball came up with the concept of a DW using ""conformed dimensions"". I built quite a few DWs using Inmon's approach, and I can tell you they evolve well and survive a lot. The main challenges are:- Figuring out a good priority for which domains/subjects to build first. It's no use trying to model the whole DW layer before delivering something, but people still try that.- Knowing how to capture a business in its entirety in a data model. Eventually, as you iterate, you'll find inconsistencies, redundancies, things no one thought about, politics, etc. Solving those to one common model is hard; letting them pass reduces the value of the DW layer over time, putting g the entire architecture in check;- Compound effort of having data go through 3 layers (or more) before delivering value. Again, this is people just assuming they have to adopt and build it all before any value is delivered. My approach was to first do a high level business mapping in domains to identify opportunities and prioritize. The first 2-3 deliveries usually had very light landing and a straightforward middle layer model, generating stars was straightforward, fast and cheap. As the platform grew, complexity would be added but not as a burden - it is a way to actually represent the business and deliver higher-level analytics. The kind that needs cross domain analysis, decision and optimization. Doing that on top of starts is incredibly harder (been there, done that).Inmon kept evolving his design, addressing data quality, unstructured data, real-time and others, but he lost importance as the world moved to cloud and Hadoop - even though he published about those and his designs were perfectly applicable there. It's more that everything pre-cloud and pre-agile was sort of left behind by a new generation.Edit:typos",bobbruno,2025-05-18 17:11:04,24,dataengineering,t3_1kpm88w,False,

Inmon is more effort up front to capture the business in 3rd normal form promoting better integrity and consistency for the longer term.

It contains the relevant schemas, SLAs, who’s who, DQ rules, logic rules, etc in one consolidated form. Even better, it’s agreed by all parties that this is what the solution is.

That's what the ""git submodules"" thing makes me believe is going on.My advice: do not do that. Unless you have literally thousands of engineers, **just do a monorepo for Airflow DAGs**. There are few reasons to make it more complicated than that and there are a lot of upsides to the monorepo in terms of how real world projects develop, in addition to just relieving yourself of the deployment headache (which is the #1 reason). Those other reasons are:- a single commit can touch multiple DAGs across multiple projects- projects can share Airflow-level utils- sync dependencies in Airflow runtime- external DAG dependencies- easier to run a local version of the whole instance if your Airflow isn't dependent on CI-specific things to glue things together- less magicSo save yourself the headache and just do the monorepo.From there, deployment is very simple. Every major Airflow deployment method, including the Helm Chart but also MWAA and Astronomer, just mounts the `dags/` folder as a volume, and so deployments that do not introduce new dependencies are as simple as updating the folder.External systems that get called by Airflow can be in their own separate repos, but know where the dividing line is between those systems and Airflow as an orcestrator: KubernetesOperator, CloudRunCreateJobOperator, EcsTaskRunOperator. Yes modifying the `argv` of a container's command requires two commits across two separate repos, but that's not a big deal (cross-DAG commits are way more annoying when they're cross-repo; within-DAG commits being cross-repo is really not that annoying. The monorepo really wants to optimize for that case to be easier).Also, never ever use git submodules.

I argue the opposite (which is how I make friends and influence people), that our system should reject, fix, alert or do something, but bad data should never stop or compromise our warehouse. The main issue I then face is getting people to address rejected entries, or do I bring them in when they will cause aggregate totals to show poor data to management and cause incorrect predictions.

mtlu1ab,"I always say that ""data quality is a people and process challenge masquerading as a technical challenge.""First and foremost you have to understand what the business cares about? Do these issues impact the wider business to warrant resolving this, or does the pain of a couple data engineers suffice (learn to pick and choose your battles).Assuming it's worth solving, you need to follow the chain of events that go from data entry, to ingestion, to landing in your database of interest. Then determine which parts of the chain you control and don't.The areas you don't control are going to be where the real change needs to happen. You need to get out of the safety of code and databases and start talking to the teams to understand their processes and how to incentivize them to change. Not doing this means you will be constantly putting a technical bandaid over garbage data that changes constantly.How have I done this before?In a previous role I was combining sales, product, and customer success time tracking data. Being in B2B SaaS means expansions were a big deal and were managed by CS. I quickly found the time tracking data was awful, and looking at the time stamps of ""tracked time"" and ""time it was entered"" showed that everyone was dumping data at the end of the quarter.How do I get them to improve time tracking (despite doing such is awful)?Well I analyzed the data and saw that some employees were overworked while others didn't have enough hours (imbalanced account assignments). In addition, some accounts were time intensive but low contract size (ie problematic customers). This got the attention of leadership, who gave me two CS staff to work on this project of improving time tracking data.I empowered those two CS staff with data and building a business case, and let them present to the CS org and take all the credit (I don't care that people know its me, I just want good data to make my life easier). Coming from their peers instead of me or leadership was way more powerful too!The driver? If you consistently submit time tracking data, we will ensure you don't waste time on problematic accounts, you will be overworked less, and or have more opportunities for meaningful work as leadership will know how to allocate better.Not a single line of data quality code written... just getting in the weeds of the business and incentivizing people to change their behaviors that help them create better data.",on_the_mark_data,2025-05-22 05:12:14,2,dataengineering,t3_1kouhgg,False,
mstimrz,"There is an old adage of ""be forgiving in your inputs and strict on your outputs."" It's easy to understand but very difficult in practice. The biggest problem I had like this was cleaning addresses around the world. There were about 400 million of them. They were almost always manually input, inconsistent and had tons of dupicates and semi-duplicates. In addition to that fun, the rules that constituted a ""good"" address changed from country to country. The acid test for the US was the addresses in Atlanta, GA. There are dozens of valid variations of Peachtree. Some countries, such as Switzerland, had the individual/company as part of a valid address. This didn't even begin to address misspellings and incorrect abbreviations.It is solvable and straightforward but not easy. You have to use different techniques for different problems in the data set. Sometimes a lookup against existing data is needed. Sometimes it is a correction table. In this case, it required brut force data cleansing using SQL (so I could treat things as sets and get some performance). I was able to run through the entire set in about 25 minutes. Once the bulk of the data was cleansed, I started using the Google mapping API on the front end to validate addresses.

mswmi2c,"A major purpose of a 'landing zone' is that you don't do any processing of the data before storing it, so that you can just immediately store it however you received it and move on. Once you've got your own copy of it, you can rerun any processing on it as much as you like.Nothing going to a landing area should be running for 24 hours, and unless you're directly querying from some tabular source like a database you generally wouldn't be saving directly to a tabular format.You would be aiming for something like storing every individual response (or page, in this case) as you go. If they're large enough, you save them as s3 objects in their own right. If they're small, you send them to something like Kinesis Firehose, which will automatically buffer objects up to 15mins/300MB and then save them out to s3.If you want to track where you are up to, and you are running all this in a single process, you can just have a json object in s3 that you overwrite with the currently active data, so that if something stops or crashes you can pick up from the last request. If you have multiple concurrent processes or it is updating very fast, you can store it all in a tiny DynamoDB against a particular key.---Microbatching ingestion into a single duckdb database sounds off. You replace objects in s3, so every write will be a full rewrite of the file. If you wanted to make data like this available to duckdb for processing, you would be writing append-only to some other file format that duckdb could read.For remote data instances with updates like this, you might use duckdb as the processing engine, but you would be using an open table format like deltalake or iceberg to allow you to do write transactions on the data in a way that is more amenable to the way object storage works.",azirale,2025-05-18 04:31:30,16,dataengineering,t3_1kpaisy,False,

mtam8l4,"I have been here before, where you are now. Where constantly relying on the next person will get you through the day although it completely gimps your progress. Learning from other people is a crutch and always will be. I always thought in my previous career ""well, I'll just learn from this person until I can stand on my own two feet, and everything will be fine"". It never happened. I never improved and ended up hating my job because I became more experienced on paper, but in reality, my knowledge didn't correlate with my experience. And it showed.When it came to DE, I taught myself and found it liberating not feeling like I was stuck, waiting for somebody else to hold my hand all the time. I could just look at a piece of work, play around, get a feel for it and then continue from there. Every time I learnt something new, it stuck much harder because I discovered it myself rather than somebody saying, ""Make sure you sort out XYZ"" before I had time to think about it.On top of that, it's another incentive to go ahead and start building instead of another excuse to sit on social media all day, pushing you into the greatest trap - the illusion of learning.My recommendation is to stop chasing the ideas of other people and develop your own. Knowing what's good and what's bad comes with time. It's really common with beginners that they want to be perfect from the get go, so go out of their way to try and seek knowledge from people who claim to know more. Making mistakes and being imperfect is part of learning.

So I think it could be useful where: \- A: you need to interact with non-technical staff\- B: You need controls (e.g. security, special data processing rules, high complexity) that warrant implementing via code and having that version controlled-- think GDPR compliance on automating marketing data workflows.\- C: The data you are working with relies heavily on 3rd party connections (e.g. CRM data from Hubspot).I'm still exploring, so would love to hear what others are thinking, but I think it's one of the best tools out to build quick AI workflows while having some form of version control and staying on a local machine.",on_the_mark_data,2025-05-23 17:20:30,1,dataengineering,t3_1ktc6so,False,

You can set up error workflows to capture and send errors to a logging service, and also store general execution data in this logging service, but if you have a staff capable of managing this why are we using low code? In my org the people using N8n don't do this.

Do the math for them in your deck in terms of FTE months and stuff.They might not act because of budget or whatever, but you can point to that same thing when they ask for 10 new projects and you barely have your head above water or they complain about general delivery time.When we did our modernization build I insisted on managed services where they made sense to avoid the pitfalls of self hosting open source or whatever because our company has been notoriously bad with giving headcount or paying market value.

SQL will help but data engineering can require experience across a broad scope of systems depending on the role and will require significantly deeper understanding of software engineering best practices. 4. The market (at least where I am) for data engineers is very up and down at the minute. On the whole the salaries are typically much better but the definition of data engineer varies quite a bit between businesses and a lot of business do not see a huge amount of value in data engineering as a practice.

And why do you specify your filter conditions in lambdas? Spark has no way to know what you're doing inside the lambda -- it passes in the entire row so it cannot know what columns are being used, or for what -- so it can't optimise anything. For example, if you had a DataFrame with the tablename, api, and offset cached, then when you chain a proper spark filter off of that it can avoid making API calls for the other tables in the first place, because it can apply the filter earlier in the sequence (as the value never changes). It can't figure that out when you're using rdds and lambdas.Also, it has to serialise every row to python, so python can deserialise it, just so that python can execute a basic equality check. A dataframe filter on spark columns will skip all of that.You should be able to do all of this with dataframes, and it can make various steps easier and more efficient.",azirale,2025-05-24 00:55:09,1,dataengineering,t3_1ktqbov,False,

To completely hand over software development to AI means you are just automating automation, which gives you less control and specificity.That said, for writing difficult algorithms or complex systems, AI may be used for most of that work in the future, the same way that chess engines can outplay humans.The problem with AI coding right now is that it is simply based on large language models, not a formal system such as coding verification. for example, you can task large language models to play chess, but they constantly suggest illegal moves and while they can make some very clever moves, they also make incredibly stupid ones at times as well.AI coding will take off once the machine learning systems are based on rigorous formal descriptions of programming languages, not just general large language models.Right now I would argue the best uses of AI for coding is translating large code bases from one language to another, prototyping of very simple ideas, or embedding an AI system to allow users to prompt the text.The problem is LLMs are very easy to apply to a wide variety of tasks, but LLMs aren't specifically tailored for programming, so just like LLMs are much worse than a chess engine, specifically designed for chess, there will likely be innovations for ai programming that aren't just ""feed this LLM a bunch of code and see what it can do.""LLMs will continue to get better, but even before LLMs people created logical proof systems and formal verification tools that are much more specific to programming.I imagine a scenario where you just write the test cases and then the ai system generates the code and algorithms that can pass those test cases.",Live-Concert6624,2025-05-18 13:51:07,26,learnprogramming,t3_1kpjhc0,False,

This allows you to use an existing passion to help fuel a growing passion— or, more literally, you will be less bored and more curious and driven to experiment and learn, because you have the ability to apply your learnings to something you already enjoy.In my case, I believe this to be true because I picked up JS to write some user scripts that helped me automate some tasks as a customer support worker. This experimentation of using programming to help me make my life easier lead to me learning other languages for other things, but in general having that user script to work on while I was doing customer support allowed me to actively identify and experiment with new features that could make the job easier for me. That experimentation is what made me keep going with coding, because of the instant gratification provided by my new feature making my job easier.Ultimately, if you can think of an every day thing that you do that you deposit a significant amount of time into, if you can find a language that will allow you to effectively “hook into” and augment that interest of yours, you will find it a lot more rewarding and satisfying to write code.Practically speaking, with Java or Python as your two presumptive options, if you’re interested in AI you will have to use Python. On the other hand, I know so many people who have tried python and just given up on coding, while I know so many people who have gotten into Java development because they wanted to write mods for Minecraft— this Java development then blossomed into a career in software development.If you play Minecraft, learn Java. You’ll be able to write mods for the game and play with them and this will help you keep your curiosity and enthusiasm.",I_Lift_for_zyzz,2025-05-20 02:28:47,7,learnprogramming,t3_1kqsuoi,False,

mtkbaec,"Reading a book and writing a book require different neural pathways (in a sense). While not reading books makes it extra difficult to write books.The same roughly goes for code. You have to get used to writing smallish projects (and mediumish projects and then eventually largish projects). The act of writing and debugging (thinking your way out of the maze you are in, tacking bits on an existing solution, rewriting / refactoring code) is how you learn to get better at writing code. Start with something basic. text based calculator for instance. The thing I like to work on with people is a dungeon crawler. a text based game where you walk through a dungeon. it teaches you all sorts of abstractions (whether you prefer OO or not) and it's a good way to write a solution first, then later on realise there is a better way and to have to rip the guts out of your code and write it again but better.look up gameloop (it looks a little like:) public void game() { while (true) { // for keyboard (and non-realtime): Command c = getUserCommand(); c.perform(player, world); // do stuff like ""go north"" or ""pull lever"" world.update(); // have other game objects do their thing. String map = world.render(player); // draw an ascii image of the local map, player gives player position // this isn't a very good game loop per se but it is a rough start. System.out.print(map); } }with something like the above you can practically do anything. for realtime rendering there are changes you need to make, but for a roguelike the above is sufficient. Build just a single room you can walk around in. (a room is for instance a 2d array with wall or non-wall . player position dictates where the player is. have the player move around. write that as code and you can then move on to player colliding with walls, items being located in places. write other mobs, have mobs move around. create doors, pitfalls, have mobs attack or have them calculate field of view (and if they see player they move toward them). all sorts of things.then when you've build a number of these things you'll find it's inefficient. and then you start learning when you rewrite parts to be better/work better for what you want of them.I would stay away from leetcode problems and the like. try to work on something actual.if the above isn't it for you, try doing something that parses an excel sheet or does stuff with sound. or create a small paint program that lets you set pixels. just pick something you actually are interested in because that helps you with thinking of what next to add.",josephblade,2025-05-21 23:27:20,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ks72oe,False,

mszr7v4,"Two points:1. Most of the top software engineers make a ton of money at work and then spend their free time with their families and friends—they don't hang around on Reddit all day typing comments about OOP. Typically it's the jobless, the students, or the juniors with low responsibility at work who have extra time and motivation to hang around on programming forums all day. Exceptions apply of course, but that's the general gist of it.2. Most of the best software out there is written with OOP, Java, C++... Basically with everything that you don't see as being fancy or recommended on Reddit.Can you find a connection between these two points?Could it be that the real seniors who are working on real projects and being paid top money are still using OOP, Java, C++, etc.? Or to be more accurate, they use whatever works the best for the task at hand, whether that's OOP or FP or something else entirely?Meanwhile the ""seniors"" who either 1. haven't quite grasped OOP *yet*, or 2. gave up after they failed once instead of thriving to improve —are the very people who are most active on these forums, trying to justify their opinions to others, religiously hating the most successful and widespread paradigm of all time instead of learning the ups and downs of each approach.So why do these people hate OOP in the first place? Because it's easy to get wrong. It's an insanely potent tool when used right, but it takes years of experience, active studying, experimenting, and trial and error to get right. They've seen horrible inheritance trees based on the ""is-a"" vs ""has-a"" rule, which completely fails if you use it with the English language rather than the physical constructs. Some examples of this going with English are:- Wrong: A football player *is-a* human -> `FootballPlayer extends Human` - Correct: A human *has-a* job or a hobby -> `player.hobby = football`- Wrong: An invisible video-game enemy *is-a* video-game enemy -> `InvisEnemy extends Enemy` - Correct: An enemy character *has-a* opacity -> `enemy.opacity = 0.0`- Wrong: An android phone *is-a* phone -> `Android extends Phone` - Correct: A phone *has-a* operating system -> `phone.os = android`These are just some of the examples where following the English language fails you, and where you should rely on the [Composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance) principle instead. Of course people have taken this too far to the other extereme as well, going as far as erasing all of language support for inheritance and forcing inheritance through composition... which sucks as well.

That said using classes and objects can be good in the right circumstanses.OOP can also be bad for speed optimizationd. It have a tendency to create arrays of pointers to structs/objects.

Your family wants you to do well, and you want to do well for their sake, but pushing yourself into a corner won't help with that. Focus on what you're doing, not anyone else. Finish your masters. Put effort into looking for a job, but understand there's no guarantee so don't punish yourself if you're having trouble. If getting a job was easy, or guaranteed, everyone would be following the same path. That path doesn't exist. Just do your best, play your cards as well as you can, and hope like the rest of us.

Working for money is an experience just like learning a new tech. - If you can't, try to survive. Everything is about to be turned upside down anyway (IMO). - Nothing is forever. Falling behind and pulling back ahead again are natural in the rat race of life. - Relax. As much as is possible.

mtn3yxx,"I've been programming for 8 years, and honestly, this feels like one of the toughest times to be a developer — even my boss, who’s been in the industry for 20 years, agrees. The engineering world is in a bit of a strange place right now. With the rise of AI and a shaky global economy, tech jobs have become harder to find. But I do believe this will shift in time.One big challenge is that many people involved in hiring aren’t developers themselves. They're often finance-driven decision-makers who don’t fully understand the nuances of engineering work. That can make things frustrating — especially when the hiring process includes unrealistic coding challenges that don't reflect real-world development.These days, there’s a dangerous expectation that every dev needs to be ""elite."" The truth is, tech moves fast, and everyone has different strengths. Some are more technical, others better at architecture or communication. The role of a developer is evolving — communication, collaboration, and adaptability are becoming just as important as coding skills. The era of working in isolation, coding for hours without interruption, is mostly gone.Still, there *will* be jobs. The industry is in transition, and once it stabilizes, opportunities will open up again. Try not to stress about being “mediocre” — imposter syndrome is incredibly common, even among experienced developers. I’ve been doing this for years and still feel it at times, but I’ve learned that most people do.At the end of the day, software development is about solving problems and moving data — it doesn’t have to be overcomplicated. Many tools and frameworks have added unnecessary layers, but the core principles remain the same.So hang in there. Keep learning, stay curious, and don’t compare yourself to others.

Form POSTs specifically predate CORS and developers have always been allowed to submit a form to another domain by simply creating `<form action=""bank.com/...` HTML and either tricking the user into clicking the submit button or submitting automatically with JS. This wouldn't allow an attacker to see the response to a cross-domain form post, but it would allow you to make the cross-domain form post.

I would say “the bank is telling the browser which URLs _it expects_ to receive calls from.”The key enforcement here is performed by the browser, the user agent. CORS was invented to make browser-based apps more trustworthy. We want the browser to not be susceptible to attacks in which scripts from random origins can persuade the browser (and the user) to send user data to some untrusted place, or to do some action on behalf of the user, without letting the user know. But the browser can’t do that all by itself. So it asks the origin “hey which sites are you expecting to get calls from?” And then the browser enforces that; it _pre-empts_ outbound calls that are counter to that “policy”. This does not “protect” the server. The server is still responsible for enforcing validation, authentication, access control. Only “good” browsers enforce CORS; if you use a browser from “Bob’s discount web browser emporium”, then it may not do CORS correctly. And, any slightly savvy person can turn CORS off in the browser. Because it’s voluntary and easily disabled on the browser, it cannot be considered an effective mechanism to protect the server. The server must consider all inbound requests to be untrusted until they are authenticated and authorized. If bank.com has an endpoint like /sendmoney, bank.com needs to make sure that inbound calls to that endpoint are bonafide. CORS doesn’t help. CORS enforcement in the browser protects _the user_. But the server side helps the browser perform that enforcement. Btw CORS actually goes beyond preventing outbound calls that violate the origin policy. Suppose the browser allows an outbound post call. The origin performs the work and then sent back a response. The browser can also remove response headers in that response before the app gets the information, if those headers are not on the “expose” list.",AyeMatey,2025-05-24 01:31:22,1,learnprogramming,t1_mtxl5qg,False,

Also LeetCode and that type of programming doesn't really translate to real world projects. The best way to get better is by doing simple projects at first, and add complexity over time. For instance, I used to be a trainer for cyber developers in the C programming language. We used to start them off by having them build a simple calculator. What they didn't know is that we weren't really grading how well they could add and subtract numbers, but rather how secure their code was. Can I break it, or exploit it in some way? Are they checking for underflow and overflow? After a couple failed submissions they would finally catch on and understand what they needed to do to pass the tests. Next would be FileCalc, which is okay do the same thing, but all the equations are stored in files, and I want you to give me a file of all the solutions. Again we'd test them by giving them bad files to see if they were doing proper error handling and such. Then there was ThreadCalc, which was okay now do everything using a thread pool. And NetCalc, okay now do ThreadCalc but over a network.If they could do all of that we figured they had learned enough to be on the team and contribute. But it takes time. You do most of your learning through failing, not succeeding. So take everything you're doing right now and understand that it's hard and that's okay.

mtugqo2,"Good answers here, so I won't reiterate what has already been said, only mention that it was common to distinguish between ""programs"" and ""scripts"", where you could write a script inside another program, like Excel, and make it manipulate the objects that already existed in that environment.But if you wanted to run your code outside of that other program (it will always run inside *some* ""program"", like for instance the operating system) then you'd have to write a proper program. The idea was that you could write that in any text-editor you like, and then ""compile"" the source code to a binary program that could be run on its own.I use the past tense, because nowadays the differences are a lot more blurred - you can write programs in languages like Python and JavaScript inside spreadsheets (Google Sheets and Excel supports both, as far as I'm aware), or inside the browser, or custom applications, or you can write code on its own, but then execute it with a runtime. And often this runtime contains a virtual machine, and it is all very complicated, but you usually don't need to know - you just write your program in an IDE and then run it directly in the IDE while working on it, until you are done, and can run it from anywhere on the computer.I recommend getting started with Python - follow a tutorial to help you set everything up, and get something working.

Before we evaluate, we must be able to analyze.3. Before we analyze, we must be able to apply knowledge/skills.4. Before we apply, we must understand what we do and why we do it.5. Before understanding, we must be able to recall accurately.Things slipping through your mind is a signal that the foundations aren’t strong enough, and frankly this is an iterating process of discovery whenever you try new things.Be patient and start slow.Start by mirroring the stupid simple stuff until you are able to recall facts and the basics.Then practice explaining the ideas or concepts behind what you are doing. Also, predict and test experiments to facilitate assimilation; e.g. what would happen if I DO or DONT DO something? What if it’s slightly different?Progress into applying your knowledge into solving simple and complex problems. A simple problem is one where you directly apply some knowledge. A complex one is where you first need to decompose into smaller problems, then build up to the bigger more general solution.When you are comfortable with those, the next cognitive level is analysis. Draw connections among ideas, compare them against others.After that you’ll be able to confidently evaluate options and alternatives and justify your decisions (and if proven wrong, then you’re still learning more).Finally, after all that, you’ll become able to synthesize all that knowledge and skills with fluency so that most of your efforts are focused on designing and creating solutions.Practicing the basics, over and over, will naturally put you in a position to apply what you learned and eventually reach mastery.This framework can help you charter your learning journey—yet the key remains being patient and consistent.",Ordinary_Peach_4964,2025-05-18 02:34:01,3,learnprogramming,t3_1kp4oln,False,

My family got a home PC and this helped, but I still needed to write out all my answers for tests.2. My short term memory was found to be lacking. This frustrated my parents because if I wasn't actively listening to them when they told me to do something I would literally not remember what they said, or often not even remember we had a conversation. Of course the way around this was they had to make sure they had my full attention before telling me to do something.3. There might have been other stuff, but I don't remember.

I did poorly in History and English where there is a lot of memorization.I am now the lead programming architect at my company. If people have bugs they can't solve, they come to me. If people don't know how to write something, they come to me. If there is a bug anywhere in our code base, I can fix it, not because I remember exactly what that code does, but I understand how that code should work.When programming people start off learning the language, which is needed. The only way you are going to remember the language is by using it, by writing programs.

You keep doing that until those tasks are small enough that you can logically perform them in a programming language....any programming language. The language is just a way to tell the computer what it needs to do and there are many ways to do that.

msyotb0,"Learning programming shouldn’t be about memorization. Programming is the one discipline where it’s actually encouraged to rely on the internet as much as you want since it would be impractical for us to remember every little detail about every language and library we use, and most programming languages and libraries have extensive documentation online.Once you are past learning the fundamental structures of code (data types, variables, conditionals, loops, functions, etc.) everything you want to do with code is just a few well-constructed google searches away. Learning to code is as much about learning how to do efficient research as it is about learning actual coding.I will say, having short term memory just emphasizes the need for good coding practices even more, which many beginners tend to neglect. Good coding is all about foresight, and sacrificing time in the present to save you work in the future. Make sure you take the time to write yourself clear and helpful comments at every step of the way while coding and whenever you see multiple ways of writing some code, choose the way that is easiest to read; this will save you so much mental strain down the road. You should be able to tell generally what a piece of code does just by looking at it for a few seconds, even if it’s like you’ve never seen it before.You’ll also learn there are ways of structuring your code such that you don’t have to remember how the whole system works all at once in order to understand one piece of it.

mtfkp21,"There are a lot of different engineering disciplines, all of them have their own ""take"" on programming.Of course the basics that you mention are shared: data structures, algorithms, stats, linear algebra, discrete math, etc are pretty much university year 1 and 2 kind of stuff for almost all technical disciplines. You need all that as a basis for advanced learning.However, where it differs is in how programming is used. I come from the angle of a computer engineering and robotics/mechatronics dropout.In CS you have a lot of focus on how to think about computation and the nature of the algorithm. Stuff like Big O / algorithmic efficiency, memory efficiency, information theory, a lot of Claude Shannon's foundational works, also cryptography. And of course, in the 4th year, operating systems, compilers, databases, consensus algorithms, network programming (which is a totally different kind of beast).In contrast, in Engineering, you will not need any of those things I mentioned in the CS paragraph.Computation in engineering, from a mechanical engineering perspective, is more about modeling, simulating physical properties/materials, extremely large scale numerical simulations (I think only the theoretical and experimental physicists deal with larger numbers) (aside: IEEE floating point is a mind bender!). Almost all of mechanical engineering programming challenges are safety related, as in if the program crashes or miscalculates, people die and processes explode or buildings come down or bridges collapse. So there is a lot of focus on ""tried-and-true"" methods of programming - no ""seat of the pants"" stuff there.The best C programming teacher I ever had was a mechanical engineer, and almost all of his programming experience comes from programming the feedback loop that controls a large scale blast furnace at smelters - the program uses measurements from various sensors, and then controls the smelting process. He drilled safety issues (error check, bounds check, input sanitisation, improper casting, huge possibility of improper pointer usage, saturation vs wraparound on overflow, pair programming, code review, using static analysis tools, etc) into every single lecture, because if the program crashes or miscalculates, thousands of litres of molten metal would spill and destroy the plant.Some of our homework assignments in C contain a magnitude more error checking and recovery code than actual executable code - of course this is not realistic for programming in the workforce, but his point of view is that no one else will teach defensive programming after we get out of his class, so might as well make us do it over and over again as homework until it's drilled into our brains. The evaluation criteria for this kind of assignment is him and the TA trying to hack/crash/exploit the program (for example, one easy trick is for them to give some unexpected inputs and seeing how your program deals with that, which is a basic form of fuzzing). They write up their report for you, and if you fix the issues they give the mark back.Mechatronics folks usually deal with real-time circuitry and need to complete evaluation loops within a pre-determined amount of time. Think bipedal robots that need to respond when it is about to fall - how does a robot recover from that situation? Things like aerospace engineering also fall into this category: how does a programmer create a ""fly-by-wire"" airplane program so it can correct and adjust pitch/yaw/roll, etc. within time and physical limits.In these use cases, recursion and dynamic memory allocation, both mainstays of CS oriented programming, is forbidden.Some Electrical Engineers programming to do DSP (digital signal processing) - where you take in a massive amount of data and you filter stuff out - DSP programming is kind of like creating filters and sieves out of computer programs - it sounds glamorous but it's actually quite a bit of grunt work. I think one of the exercises is like - take this huge sample of RF random noise and filter it until you can hear the satellite transmission downlink. It's like using programming to find needle in a haystack.I don't know what the chemical engineers need from their programmers, but I'd assume it's also about simulation, chaotic/stochastic processes.As you can tell, Computer science is primarily concerned with the nature of computing, and engineers use programming to work with the real world.The real world is incredibly messy and our math doesn't always work. That, added to the incredibly strict safety tolerances makes engineering programming a really niche job - I personally don't think you can be a great aeronautics real-time programmer and a good database programmer at the same time.As for your last question: are you into physical processes (blowing things up, making lights turn on and off, melting aluminum and using a mold to cast wheels, etc) or are you into computing, calculating, storing and searching information?It's perfectly ok to be into both - just keep in mind that there are these 2 ""ways of thinking"" when it comes to programming.The last bit of info is that in the real workforce, we work in teams: everyone brings a bit of their own ""special sauce"" to the team and that's how everything in the world is built/done.Even though the ""lone programmer"" is a trope in TV/media, that almost never happens in real life.If you become a programmer, you *will be working within a team* - so one of the most vital skills over everything else, is learning how to work with people who are different from you: they have different skillsets, different communication methods, may speak different languages, etc. That's probably the most critical skill out of everything: learning to work with other people.Hope this little overview helps and good luck!",barkingcat,2025-05-21 06:38:06,3,learnprogramming,t3_1krouk0,False,

So if you like them, you don’t know enough Vim, and you should go learn the other 90%.

mtwd7ys,"I can give you some advice, brother. What you should learn really depends on what you want to do with programming. Try answering these two questions:1. What kind of job or project do you want to do?2. What skills or technologies are commonly used in that field?I'm not too confident when it comes to frameworks, so I won't go into that. But based on my personal experience, here are a few examples of different paths you could take. Still, I highly encourage you to do your own research and explore further:1. If you want to make video games, it's useful to learn C++ and C#, along with engines like Unreal Engine (C++) or Unity (C#). C++ is a lower-level language, which gives you more control over performance, but it's harder to learn. C# is widely used in Unity and also good for building desktop GUIs.2. If you'd like to make websites, you'll need HTML and CSS to structure and style web pages, and JavaScript to make them interactive.3. Lastly, if you want to work as a data scientist or in the AI field, Python is the go-to language. Learn libraries like pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and so on. SQL is also important for managing and querying databases.Python is considered a high-level language, meaning it's easier to write and read, but it's further from the hardware compared to languages like C or C++. This means you have less control over performance, and in some cases, Python can be slower when executing certain types of code. If you want to learn JavaScript know that there's a lot of memes because it works in a.. strange way :face_with_tears_of_joy:Apart from this, you're surely making an excellent choice wanting to understand programming, I'm too ""at the beginning"", so this is everything I can give to you, hope I helped you brother!",CostRepulsive693,2025-05-23 20:30:52,7,learnprogramming,t3_1ktsh09,False,

To be entirely honest the best advice I can really give you is, ""just allow yourself to get into it"". If you are just discovering it, the journey will take you somewhere. Lua is often used for modding games as I understand it, so you could maybe play around with some of that. There are frameworks for building web applications in Lua.

My personal 'prime directive' advice is simply, ""just pick something you would like to try to make and start trying to make it!"". When somebody crosses fields like this I always suggest mining their knowledge of their other field to see if there are any ideas you can think of that might be useful. It doesn't have to make you a billionaire, it doesn't have to even ever get used, it just needs to give you an idea to focus on, so you can use programming as a means to an end.... that's what you'll be expected to do if you work in the field and strangely it is also where you learn the most.

That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t also be reading up on design patterns, data structures, language details, and algorithms. It just means that you do need to put that stuff into practice. You need to make mistakes and learn from them. Write something bad, and then go back and refactor it now that you know better. It’s a slow, iterative process. You should absolutely pick up source control, ideally, as you noted, git. You don’t need to be a wizard. Just get good enough that you’re not bricking your repo and losing progress all the time. Just absolute everyone uses it, and if they’re not, they’re still using source control, so the ideas are still good to know about. C++ can be tough for people. Between pointers, dependencies, templates, (Pre)Build Systems, and more, it’s not the easiest language. If it’s what you want to use though, you’ve really gotta just put your head down and learn enough to get cracking on some small to medium sized projects and get comfortable with some basic dependency management. Just in general, you’ll need to start thinking about writing code if your classes aren’t doing it. I was never a competitive programmer, nor did I do a ton of the puzzle or algorithm sites. My school was team project focused, and was self driven. So I was working on projects for 8 semesters. Often in between as well since they’d carry over. And I’d have side projects to learn a thing that I might bring back into the main project. I’d learn stuff alongside friends who were struggling with a topic over the summer (it’s how I started with the basics of Vulkan after it released in 2016, though, I’ve not evolved much beyond a beginner in graphics haha). I found projects worked for me. If you want something driven, give the puzzle and algorithm sites a try. But I think you should try to build out a few small projects that interest you.

I am unfamiliar with the word ""placement"", but it would probably help others if you mentioned you're from India so you get replies from those in India, otherwise, you tend to get an American or European perspective.I think it all depends on how well you know a programming language and DSA. There are two kinds of people (more than that, of course). There are those who want to learn a few key skills and be done with it, with a guarantee they won't have to learn anything more. I call this the ""barista"" type. You can't learn to make lattes and cappuccinos right away, but once you do, you're set. There's not a whole lot more to learn.Then, there are those that like to learn new things. It's this type that tends to do better as a programmer. I'm sure there are some jobs that don't require you to get past a certain point, e.g., there are still Cobol jobs and Cobol programmers, and that isn't changing so rapidly. But for the most part, you'll likely have to learn something new. For example, I was programming in Java a lot, but if I were to do AI programming, I'd likely have to switch to Python.Sorry there aren't any clear cut answers. If you ask ""If I do X, will Y happen"", the answer is, it depends on how you do X. That is, it depends on how much you master a programming language.To delve into this just a bit deeper, there are two aspects to mastering a programming language.The first has to do with learning the language, which means syntax/semantics of stuff like assignment statements, arrays, functions, classes, etc. It also means getting familiar with popular libraries. You may also have to learn a build tool. More recent languages tend to assume you're building a bigger program with multiple files.The other part--and some would argue the more important part is to learn to think algorithmically. That is, how do you solve a problem. That part can depend on skills outside of programming. For example, if you are trying to trying to simulate gravity for a physics engine to be used in a video game, then you need to know some physics. You have to express the physics as code.Just because you program, you may lack the expertise in what the program is about. Then, there is a kind of vague goal of trying to organize your code well.

mt3ybpc,"I like to think of the whole computing field as an ETL pipeline, from the high level programming languages all the way down to the transistors. The languages are just a neat abstraction to enable you to do complex data manipulation and DSA is the most efficient ways we know on how to store and process said data by efficiently using the underlying hardware. That said to find a placement you’d ideally want to know ahead of time as to which industry you are interested in as all of them try to solve different issues and have different tooling to do so. I would also like to add that code is just a tool and your job primarily isn’t to write code but to be able to digest business requirements/problems and then turn them into solutions using software and hardware which makes knowing and understanding your industry of choice paramount.For broad understanding I would highly recommend grounding your knowledge in lower level language like C/C++ (great for understanding the foundations of software) and a higher level language like python(useful for speed of delivery) as with this base you would be able to quickly and easily pick up any other language as needed.All languages also have their own specific abstractions to make a specific problem easier like frameworks and libraries which is in itself is a rabbit hole, some devs only specialise in these for example, react, Django, Spring Boot, .Net core and so on.Here’s what stacks you’ll most likely find on the market:Web dev Corporate = C#/Java, will stay like this for a long time due to how deeply embedded these ecosystems are in big corporations.Web dev Startup = python/node.js, free and stable with immense community support great for quick development cycles and MVP buildsSystems = C/C++ as most of the time you’d be working closer to hardware or require a lot of performanceDevOps = shell and scripting, python YAMLData = python/R and SQL",modelcroissant,2025-05-19 12:14:59,1,learnprogramming,t3_1kq975w,False,
mt3yxfh,"Just my 2 cents:In regards to languages, just be comfortable enough with one language to solve all kinds of problems. To be comfortable in that language, start using it to solve DSA questions.Also, be comfortable in one OOP language and another multi-paradigm language. So for your case, C++ and Python will do.For DSAs, my advice is to pick Python because it's the easiest way to learn DSAs without worrying about the complexity of the language. When it comes to interviews, they will allow you to pick the language you are comfortable with. And Python will always be there as an option.It's possible you just didn't like the web dev course by Harry. So try out another learning material.

There are options that are supposedly easier to use, but it only matters for more complex GUIs.If you'd rather use a web browser, the standard library also has `http.server`, which can easily serve static files including HTML pages or it can do old-school CGI scripts (which don't necessarily have to be written in Python, but can be. Yes, they can't handle load, but you'll only have one client.) You'd use the localhost loopback to put the client and server on the same device. If it's OK to do everything in-browser, you could write everything in Brython and use standard HTML forms and JavaScript APIs. Making the client and server communicate is not that much harder. You'd do custom handlers. GUIs usually have at least two threads anyway, so you'll have to do something like this regardless. It might be slightly easier to install Bottle at that point, but the standard library can do it.There's Gooey which automatically converts command-line applications into GUIs. It's pretty easy to use. That still has to be the workflow you want though.Since you're doing you a budget tracker, you could customize [PySpread](https://pyspread.gitlab.io/).

Programming jobs would only be for the handful of people making these CASE-tools.So I went into hardware instead. And then the web happened, and all the CASE-tools for making mainframe business-programs were shoved to one side, because now everyone had to build something new. In the late 90s everyone talked about programming being replaced by drawing UML-diagrams and then emailing them to India or other countries with cheaper labour, and they would then do the actual programming.Then languages like Python began to become popular, and everyone talked about programming not being just for programmers anymore, because now everyone could learn to program, and there would be no more need for dedicated programmers.Then a lot of low-code and no-code tools became popular, and everyone talked about that soon there wouldn't be more need for programmers.In the late 2010s everyone began talking about how everything was already built, and in the future there wouldn't be more need for programmers, since most of the jobs would be simple adjustments to existing frameworks.And now, in the mid 2020s, everyone is talking about how in the future there won't be need for programmers, because some tool will handle everything for us. The problem with those tools, as amazing as they all are, is that they can only solve ""yesterdays problems"".

This modular approach is a common practice in web development.While it's true that having multiple CSS files can lead to additional HTTP requests, which might slightly affect load times, the trade-off is often worth it for the improved organization and maintainability.

People like us... well , oftentimes we are just exploring everything that comes to mind.Don't feel bad quitting if it doesn't speaks to youThis goes a bit beyond your question, but...I think we kind of operate through resonance.And resonance can be fleeting, unpredictable.I know all too well how frustrating it can be to feel like you can’t steer your life the way you intended, like you’re restarting over and over, and nothing really sticks.Truth is, I’m only now starting to gather and make sense of things after 40 years of possibly doing just a little of everything.But you know… this is how we are.We can either keep fighting ourselves, or start using this for what it’s worthSo, aside from the hack of “make it rewarding"", keep this in mind: we’re nonlinear learners.Back in school, I could weave a web of interdisciplinary connections so dense it would stun people. But I couldn’t remember a single date or place to save my life. My memory just picked what to keep on its own terms.Sound familiar?That’s the point: we struggle when we try to force ourselves into linear paths.We operate differently. And that difference needs to be acknowledged, not treated like a flaw.Maybe i should add this.I'm not saying quit whenever you feel like it, no problem. I'm saying there are some known methods to cope with adhd, and a personalized reward system is one of them. Gamification too.I'm saying, abandon guilt and feeling of being wrong. Abandon frustration.

mtkoz0x,"Some people have suggested a compressed file system. That’s an option, but I think your approach is still better due to portability and forwards compatibility given your use case and the business intent I’m assuming from your post. A compressed file system is typically linked to its OS family and soft linked to its specific filesystem version. Every OS maintainer starts out with the intent to honor the contract of every feature of every filesystem they ever made, but they typically get sketchier and sketchier as the specific filesystem gets older and older. Meanwhile, zip and a few of its brethren have been portable across all operating systems for years and you can simply move a file from one machine on one os to another generally without any functionality issue. Zip also contains built in CRC protection in the file which although not the most modern has been sufficient since its creation. The standard open source ‘zip/unzip’ available on Linux and macOS have long contained the same ‘test’ command that pkzip first introduced. Ie - unzip -t file.zip verifies all the CRCs of the files and the redundant copies of the metadata. In actuality it’s probably just checking the metadata, decompressing all the files in memory and comparing them with the CRCs. That verifies the files without taking any additional file storage. See if you can figure out how to directly trigger the ‘-t’ functionality via your library. Or alternatively just decompress them into the null device which accomplishes about the same. There are still some theoretical gaps in the integrity of this system though. If the original zip run received bad data or the data was corrupted while in memory than the files in the zip will be corrupt even though they verify. You should definitely be doing this if you care enough on a machine with ECC ram. Disk errors at just the wrong time could also cause problems in the chain that go unnoticed. In the ideal case you would have your own verifiable CRC produced at the very start of the chain where the source files were. Then you have something to check against anywhere in the chain without needing to go back and compare against the original files. For example if you produced a sha256 hash of each file at the source machine you could then check against that hash anywhere in the chain.",xilvar,2025-05-22 00:46:27,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ks61v4,False,
mtkqihe,"For your first question, just create a checksum before compressing the folder. Then decompress it and check the decompressed file against the checksum. If it's good, you can be sure the file compressed correctly.You should also create a checksum for the compressed file as well. That way you can verify the integrity of the compressed file whenever it's transferred somewhere.Ideally your system works like this.1. System identifies project file to be archived on the working server2. System generates checksum for project file/folder4. System verifies the checksum against the project file (redundant check, just to be sure)5. System compresses project file into archive file6. System decompresses archive file into decompressed file7. System checks the decompressed file against the checksum to verify compression worked properly. (This checksum can be discarded now, since most compression algorithms have internal checksums. You could keep it if you want, just don't confuse it with the checksum for the archive file.)8. System generates checksum for the archive file9. System verifies the checksum against the archive file (again, redundant check)10. System transfers the archive file to the archive server along with the checksum11. System verifies the transferred archive file against the checksum12. System deletes project file and archive file on the working serverIf a verification check fails at any point, you just repeat the steps after the previous successful verification.As for other compression tools, gzip and bzip have better compression ratios that zip. They're standard tools that are widely supported, so you shouldn't have any issues working with them.There are other compression tools that offer minor improvements to compression ratio or speed, but are less popular, so unless you really *need* that extra file space they're probably not worth using.Finally, I see that you mention the archive is on a raid disk which is good, but I just want to encourage following the 3-2-1 rule for backups if you aren't already. If these files are critical enough to warrant all this work, the least you can do is pay a bit extra for offsite storage to ensure you can recover if the archive server blows up.

msx56r0,"I derive my architecture from first principles.1. The smallest unit of code is a function. Classes, modules, folders, packages, microservices, clusters are just different ways of organizing functions. The bad architect (let's call them John) looks towards options higher up in that list, when putting a bunch of files into a well-named folder would be just as clean.2. Functions with side-effects need special attention: A pure function will rarely cause scalability issues, a function that upserts into a database will. Learning to segregate side effects is a skill that takes a lifetime to learn, but it really helps if you don't have to use @Transcational 8 times during a HTTP request's execution. The other day I sped up a messy procedure by 500% just by moving all db lookups to one place and parallelizing them, John would have held architecture meetings for the next half year to make the service with 20 monthly users ""multi-instance ready"" instead of identifying the bottleneck.3. Bounded-everything. To know how much scale you need, know how many resources you need. That's easy when you write code that needs a fixed amount of RAM, or that runs in a fixed amount of time. John does `database.readAll()` until one day the server crashes, and he gets pat on the back when he fixes the issue after a two-day outage.

There's always been a bottleneck at juniors as juniors don't make money for companies, they cost money. Companies train juniors so that they can become seniors later and the number of seniors wont go down (causing senior salaries to spike), but now lots of companies are betting on AI becoming the new Seniors of the future so many have stopped investing in creating seniors out of juniors. I""d say this is incredily short sighted, especially considering the limitations AI is still showing with complex architecture and languages/frameworks/libraries/etc that change more often then the AI models are updated. But I may be naive on that.>Will this subside, and is a CS degree becoming less worth it?Depends what happens with AI. Either it will wipe out most development jobs and we'll all be screwed, or it wont and we'll all keep working. There's no way to know because there's no way to know what the AI will be capable of next year, let alone five years down the road.If I had to bet, I'd bet on it taking 5-10 years and then AI will be wiping out most jobs, and either societies will have some form of UBI, or societies will be devolving into violence and anger at the rich.CS degrees are already becoming worth less (not worthless) as our salaries are dropping over the past 3 years, but that doesn't mean people shouldn't learn CS, it's still a good job and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. Plus if you like programming, it's a great hobby that you can use to build things you want/like, or create entrepreneurial ventures with. If AI takes over, there wont be money in it, but there wont be money in almost anything at that point, so you're best off still learning what you enjoy and hoping those in positions of power are smart enough to see the violence coming and giving people a basic living wage paid for by the AI and the rich, then we can spend our free time coding whatever we want for fun.",floopsyDoodle,2025-05-20 23:26:14,59,cscareerquestions,t3_1krj6jc,False,

msrwkws,"Investors want profit, which is revenue minus costs. Software needs developers, which are expensive. The big promise of AI is to drastically slash software development costs. There are a couple of ways for doing that:* By allowing less skilled folks to create good-enough software without having to pay experienced developers. Here, AI tools compete with the low-code/no-code industry. Nothing new.* By making good developers more productive. This is where AI-based code completion comes in.* By having the AI system independently solve high-level tasks. This is the dream of “agentic AI”.It doesn't matter for AI companies if there will be fewer mid-skilled developers buying their subscriptions. A client company wants to get some amount of software development done. In theory, it can achieve this by some mix of humans and AI tools. Choosing some amount of AI is an economic win-win situation if AI-productivity is more cost-effective than human-productivity. But this means the price cap of an AI tool subscription isn't hundreds of dollars per month, but whatever it would cost to hire another human developer. And good developers are quite expensive.Now the neat thing for AI companies is that they don't have to realize these productivity gains themselves. They just have to convince other businesses that there *could* be productivity gains using these tools, that everyone else is doing it, and that your investors will start asking questions if you don't also jump on the hype train.In a gold rush, sell shovels.The problem here is that AI tools aren't cost-effective (yet). They are generally not cost-effective for users due to quite uneven quality, and they're not sold at-cost by the tool providers, because GPUs are so dang expensive. Currently, the field is propelled by the belief that the economics will work out soon:trade_mark:.Personally, I'm fairly relaxed about this. AI-written code is generally well below my skill-level (especially when taking architecture and design concerns into account), and I don't see a plausible path for AI to catch up. Ever-bigger models with ever-larger context windows cost exponentially more, which could mean that the productivity:cost break-even point for high-skill activities like software development is never reached before the tool providers go bankrupt. There are also systematic problems, like software projects having a lot of implicit and oral context that is not available to an LLM.AI is probably here to stay, but software developers are some of the last folks who have to worry about this.",latkde,2025-05-17 10:56:23,133,cscareerquestions,t3_1kopoca,False,

It's like an intern that's overly confident, speaks in a way that's trustworthy and sounds competent, *and* he just took a bunch of acid and is hallucinating half the time, and isn't testing their own work and just submitting shit on blind faith that it works.We actually had a couple training sessions recently at my company from a guy at Microsoft regarding Copilot. One thing he continuously emphasized is that it's a *copilot*. We are still the pilots. He himself said that the most dangerous thing about Copilot, and the biggest disasters he's seen, are people that trust it. Copilot is a tool that can help us quickly get through mundane tasks. It is not a resource that can be used to blindly generate code we ship to production. *The creators* are telling us that it should not be used for blind code generation. That's telling.A funny thing about those trainings that I noticed is that the instructor himself struggled a lot during all his demos because the AI wouldn't co-operate, and he had to live debug why things weren't working the way he wanted. It's very telling when a *live demo to a major customer* goes haywire.I use AI the exact same way I use StackOverflow. It's a tool to get me information, or get quick answers to mundane tasks. It's *not* something I just copy/paste. It *augments* my abilities, it doesn't generate my code.

mstr5k1,"I had a fun observation recently.Working with Claude Code, I started out slow getting it to review and understand that structure of the codebase I'm working on, it run and analysis and report back things like ""The project is well, structured and cleanly coded adheres to best principles,"" kind of comments.Then I'd coach it through, tell to analyze a specific pattern being used in the project (for example the exception handling pattern in use) and point it a feature that had the pattern fully and correctly implemented and tell it ""Feature A shows the exemplar for this pattern, analyze the implementation carefully. Now apply the exemplar pattern to feature B,""And it would do a good job of correctly implementing the pattern and saved a substantial amount of time. It'd get things wrong here and there and always needed a clean up, but overall it did about as well as a decent intern.And then I started giving a little more latitude. I wrote out a requirements document for a new feature, got it to analyze the code base again, feed it the requirements document and worked through it with it.It did a reasonable job of putting together code that met the requirements. I did catch it trying to cheat on the unit tests, very badly. Something it definitely learnt from the unit tests in its training data. It did hallucinate a few things and left some half implemented code it had started and then deserted lying around. The worst thing I caught it doing was going of and off and making changes to completely unrelated code that would've broken things.But overall, it's output was mediocre AF. It was messy, convoluted, had nonsensical functions it had added and forgotten about, barely conformed to the patterns required.So next session, I loaded it up and ask it to review the code base, it does so and comes back with ""Areas of the code are well designed and implemented, with clean code and adheres to best practices, but feature XYZ contains numerous errors, technical debt and fails to meet the same stand as the rest of the code"". Feature XYZ was the feature I'd asked it to implement. So at least it was able to identify that it's output was garbage. I did let it have a go at clean up it's mess, but it just made it worse to the point I had to roll back all the changes fir the session and then went and cleaned it up myself. So no time was saved that day.So lesson here is, just like with juniors, if you give it a well crafted exemplar to learn from, it'll do an acceptable job of implementing code  based on that. But, just like with juniors, if you give it a requirements document and turn it loose on a new feature, it'll get the job mostly done, but it'll be ugly as all hell and need a fair bit of work to get it over the line.But where the junior wins out is in when you send the work back, show them the exemplar and get them to rework things, the junior won't usually make things worse.",Venotron,2025-05-17 17:45:18,7,cscareerquestions,t3_1koxpk4,False,

The fact that you are getting on-sites makes me think it's going better for you than you may feel. A lot of people aren't getting call backs or past a first interview. I imagine the big issues is that you are probably going to be in a junior, or at best, a mid level development position and those are already rare nowadays. I can imagine it would be hard to land a senior position when you don't have proper dev experience. Is there a reason why you haven't tried to pivot to a team lead/management role already? I know that doesn't get you into development, but it could potentially be a smart career move for someone at your level of expertise. From the development side, I do work with someone who switched from sales to dev later in life ( like maybe mid 40s ). He did a bootcamp, but the thing that helped him start getting interviews was contributing to open source projects. They helped him have a commit history he could point to in github and show he was able to work with other developers and follow a bit of a process on a large scale project. He's great and brings a lot to our team and also has a lot of work experience that most of the team doesn't, which is a plus. I think the biggest issue is finding a team that matches your skillset.Starting out the best position is the one you can get, but you might be at a place in life where you can't take on just any job. You are probably making bigger considerations around time commitments, location, pay, ect.. which might be limiting you a bit. If you have flexibility on any of those, you might be able to expand your search and find something. Another option could be to lean harder into your support experience. I'm in the process of transitioning a more support heavy development position. We will have a dedicated support team that will be fully focused on development support. I don't have any hiring capacity for this year unfortunately since it's a very new thing, but I'd be interested in candidates with a heavier support background. Most developers are not interested in doing support, especially when it's something they have to do with some frequency. They want to build and refine features. So, being the person who is both good and support and happy to do it could set you apart if you find the right position/company. Wish I had even better advise.

Probably not.It *could* tangentially help you by way of building skills you might otherwise not use and strengthening fundamentals like DS&A. Self learning is always a skill to keep as strong as possible, too.But everything has an opportunity cost. What field do you want to work in? What stacks (if any)? I know you previously mentioned Java/Kotlin and Android dev. Something to consider is whether you want to work in that field, or if you are applying only because you feel strongest in it.Game dev is an entirely different beast. Personally, I'm into game dev myself because I learn almost exclusively from doing. I don't work in game dev. I don't publish games. I build them (and plenty of other things) to scratch that curiosity itch to learn while keeping it interesting (for example, I couldn't care less about yet another fucking library that's going viral that everyone is raving about in X language for Y framework--I'm not on the bleeding edge and it is not my niche).TL;DR: do it, if you're interested. The only downside is opportunity cost. Honestly ask yourself: what else would you be doing if not learning some game dev? Everything has an opportunity cost. Grinding leetcode has it. Learning tons of frameworks have it. But it doesn't hurt to spend a month on something to figure out if you're genuinely interested in it. Edit: and you'll probably get lots of conflicting answers here. Were I interviewing you, I'd be **very** interested in your hypothetical game dev journey because of my own interest.

While here, I've worked on a wide array of different projects, even though I started in an embedded systems role. Through multiple management decisions, my team and I have worked on many projects outside of our domain, to the point where it looks like I'm completely lying on my resume. When I began, I was working primarily in Android development where I would work in Java and some additional Python scripts for automation. Then I worked on another project where I was mainly doing Python and some PowerShell and Bash scripting. After that, I did Python for a while but got exposed to microservice architecture, and found myself working a whole lot with Docker, RabbitMQ, and various other technologies.Afterwards I pivoted again to a new project which was more web-centric, and found myself developing using Java Spring Boot for the backend, and React for our frontend.Another pivot, and I spent quite some time doing Data Science/Analytics for numerous stakeholders; during this time I found myself writing numerous SQL queries, working a lot in Jupyter Notebook in Python, and also dabbling in Machine Learning.My most recent pivot I've been working with Django to build a web service, and again working with microservice architecture, and doing a whole lot of database work again.My transitions have been quite extreme over the last several years, going from embedded systems, to data science/ML, to web development, and so on.

After all the big comapnies got rid of wfh, I've never had a friend struggle for a tech job in Seattle, atlanta, or the bay in the past year even with the recession or they were new grads. ##what does that mean for you?QA, Dev ops, web dev ( just be a freelancer at first to build your portfolio ) all of these can be found at entry level. The issue people don't wanna accept is that entry level **requires past experience** the same way an junior level doctor or lawyer requries past experience. ##ExamplesLike for web dev, just do freelance contracts or programs like Dev for good. Not that hard to make a portfolio if you really liked it. For ML, just work in a univeresity research lab; many of them are paid for every student they take on and your work gets published and used in industry.

Go to utest.com, get a few tests done and get paid for it and after 2 years you'd be overqualified for Jr roles.

Early on, I also felt that I didn't get much mentorship and was just thrown into the deep end, asked to implement feature X, enhancement Y, or bugfix Z, in a huge codebase, with little guidance. Though, now I feel quite fortunate because I ended up learning a lot from those early experiences, a lot more than I think most devs early in their careers would.I also have felt the same way with AI, especially when it's crunch time and I need to really accelerate my output. Something that has helped me is treating it more like a search engine to find information I need, but I write the almost all the code myself. I really try to understand what it's telling me and will cross reference with other resources as well. This makes it so I really understand and know that I can backup the code I have written if i'm questioned during a PR. I also maintain a large personal document of just general CS concepts and fundementals; whenever I learn something new from AI (and confirmed it's correct), i'll add it to this document. So I kind of force myself to constantly learn and understand what i'm doing, while still reaping the benefit of AI.If you have been doing alright so far and it sounds like you spend a lot of time trying to improve outside of work, I feel like your feeling of being totally lost may largely be imposter syndrome. Sure AI can generate a lot of code, but you would still be reading and understanding it to ensure it is applicable for your situation and actually works. So I think you probably know more than you think. I also believe that completely cutting AI out would not be beneficial in the long term, because using it is a skill in itself, and is likely to just continue to get more important. Otherwise, it sounds like you're doing all the right things. Keep working on personal projects, use and learn technologies that interest you and that are in demand, and continue to challenge yourself with Leetcodes.

mtw4tp4,"OP, listen to this advice. Don’t ask chat gpt how to write something for you. Try reading the documentation or looking at other code in the repo that does something similar and figure out why and how it works. After you write it, then ask chat gpt what it thinks or how it works but keep in mind it’s a probabilistic model so it could be wrong. Always double check with the documentation or look up articles by vetted sources that have written about the same piece of technology. It’ll give you way more insight.Technology is a huge field and there are so many layers as well as tools. I remember being a fresh new grad and even though I learned about the different components in computer systems and how memory is evicted out of ram and how different networking protocols handled communication. Getting my first internship all of that was so abstracted from me by the tools we were using that I felt like I had no idea why things were written the way they were or why we used certain tools.Take time to ask questions and learn the answers to those questions. Take notes and study them. Slowly it all starts coming together and years later you know exactly how the service or app you’re working on is leveraging the framework and language you’re using and working together with the os on the server or computer it runs on to do the things that it is doing. I will say this. I was overwhelmed at the beginning. I think most people are. I really enjoyed being able to build something by just writing some code. But it was extremely frustrating at times and sometimes I wondered if I was in the wrong profession. It took me finding out it was really rewarding knowing so much of how things worked to find passion in my career and stick with it.",ladidadi82,2025-05-23 19:48:32,1,cscareerquestions,t1_mtubap3,False,

mtwa4cj,"Data science is hard to break into without a masters or PhD and several years of experience in a data science role, so an offer for a data science role early in your career offers to jump start that process and makes future options easier and salary negotiations easier. If you’re at all interested in Data Science I would strongly consider that offer. If not then I would generally just focus elsewhere - Data Science doesn’t really work as a fallback plan or a 2nd option without a lot of school or a lot of experience. I wouldn’t consider internships unless they build significant skills or significant inroads at a company you want connections with. You’re trying to establish your career at this point so an internship is just a lower paid lower commitment job - it needs to offer enough to balance that out. That leaves the 2 backend offers and the SRE job in consideration if you discard the Data Science role. SRE is a bit more specialized - you won’t build those skills incidentally, it needs to be intentional. It pays well and is in demand, so if you enjoy it it’s not a bad place to focus your efforts. Backend Engineering roles are good general roles and hard to fault, but they don’t build a specific specialty either. Nothing wrong with just building general experience to start though. Id consider the SRE or DS roles if those fields specifically interest you. If a specific niche or field doesn’t feel right then just take a backend role and take the XP for a pivot later. I wouldn’t take the internship unless there’s a serious upside on the other side of it. Don’t take the opportunity for SRE or DS experience for granted though - it’s easier to get it early in your career. Later on you might have to contemplate a salary cut if you’re weighing mid / senior level vs having to step backwards to DS I. It’s hard to apply for DS II / Sr roles without experience in those roles, especially on a Bachelors, so the opportunity to get that experience is valuable if you have it (same for SRE).",Imoa,2025-05-23 20:15:18,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1ktrop2,False,

Most companies do not need in-house cybersecurity roles, let alone of the offensive kind. It's definitely not something you'd do instead of SWE if you just want money.

Which data structures should you use and what algorithm will you use to process your data? Think of the space and time complexity and consider if you can improve that. It helps to write little notes. Only start coding *after* you have your entire solution mapped out. This process can help you identify any utility functions that you can stub out which will help prevent getting confused in a deeply nested loop.

mthlera,"I make sure I leave a confident, yet very self-aware impression on the interviewers.When I am thinking, I prefer to think in silence. However, as I have been an interviewer myself, I know how unproductive this is and the impression this gives. I will therefore tell the interviewer directly: ""I prefer thinking in silence, but I will still do my best to give you an insight into my thought process"". This helps me because I can now take a silence break whenever I feel like it without feeling bad about it. It helps the interviewer know what's going on because I have explicitly communicated it. Other than that, I believe a mindset shift is due here. Let me offer it: interviewer usually wants you to succeed. We want to get a new colleague and stop the interviews and just get back to our day to day job. Very rarely people will use the interview process to bully you and nitpick. And if they do, this is not a place I want to work at. I mean this. I have experienced this, laughed back at the interviewer and hung up the conversation after saying ""thanks, this was enough information for me"". So, the more you communicate with the interviewer (who wants you to succeed), the more they will be able to help you out, throw you a bone here and there if you're struggling or outright tell you ""this is not what I am looking for"". When you start believing this person wants to help you, you'll naturally want to use this leverage. Definitely use it. A final piece of advice would be to ask a lot of questions yourself. Intelligent, directional, intentional questions. This gives you a lot more information to work with, which makes you more confident in what you're doing, which makes you calm down and be able to communicate. It additionally allows you to showcase your maturity while being on the ""offense"", so even if you have some hiccups during the coding, you give yourself better chances.

But down the line, a more senior solutions architect may be pigeon holed into those roles because they cannot prove the same depth of real world experience as someone working as a senior SWE already.This is a massive generalization of course, YMMV.",vansterdam_city,2025-05-18 19:47:47,9,cscareerquestions,t3_1kps3xz,False,
mt07mbm,"Personally I would take the dev job. Solution architect you’re probably going to be traveling a lot and have a lot of deadlines, working directly with customers. To me that sounds like a big pain in the ass, but really up to you.A ten person company is probably not going to be the best from a financial prospective, but a small company will allow you to own a lot of work, which can really boost your experience quickly and setup you up as a strong candidate when you go for job #2. The experience you get from the dev job will be more versatile. It’s easier yo go from dev to solutions architect than the other way around.",Ok_Bathroom_4810,2025-05-18 19:47:00,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1kps3xz,False,
mt1pib6,Solutions architect is generally not an early career role and that feels like something that is either a mislabeled job for what it actually is or something that is set up to fail badly. On top of the short contract I’d probably avoid that one.,HauntingAd5380,2025-05-19 00:57:09,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1kps3xz,False,
mt0rub3,"This is a bit confusing since solution architect is not an entry level role and a typical solution architect will have worked as a dev first for several years before transitioning. I'm sceptical whether a solution architect with no experience could be successful in the role. Any client company would likely also have some questions about why the solution architect is brand new to software.So if I were you I'd definitely choose the developer role. You'll probably enjoy it more as well, since imo the company offering a solution architect role is just setting you up to fail.",Timely_Note_1904,2025-05-18 21:34:56,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1kps3xz,False,
mt08xrc,"This is my preffered choice as well I am guessing. Just as you said, a good software engineer can transition later down the line to a solutions architect role, but the other way around is not that easy. What makes me question the decision is the whole chaos vs structured. Big name on the resume vs unknown name. But in my heart I do know that it's better to work harder now, in chaos basically, to be in a better spot in the future and maybe land a better job.",iamzykeh,2025-05-18 19:54:08,1,cscareerquestions,t1_mt07ric,True,
mt08f49,"I also think the dev job is more suitable to me as it would make a good first ever job. It would be harder to accomodate not having mentors all that stuff with shadowing and so on, but I really think that it would greatly boost my skills and make the second job even better.What I also find a little bit weird and off-putting is that Solution Architects are normally experienced people and there are not many entry-level jobs for this position, so it would basically be dead-end until I gain a vast experience.Also, I don't really know how people will look at my resume when having experience at such a small company haha.",iamzykeh,2025-05-18 19:51:22,1,cscareerquestions,t1_mt07mbm,True,

mt0ie5m,"You are truly right. Being in a smaller company will mean I will have more hands-on work and thus continuously improve my skills.

Can’t speak for all of them, but things did seem a little tense with rumors of another round of layoff and distrust towards leadership.But overall, people are trying to brighten up with Seattle summer + interns onboarding. Work-wise I heard slowed down a little but my friends’ direct managers are being compassionate (team dependent) and trying to make sure their engineers are investing time for their own professional growth.Company overall is great since they give you a lot of perks to keep you healthy and happy.

I cant speak for how it is now but how it was in my project. I worked in a sub-project of Azure so take what I say with a grain of salt as Azure is known where work life balance goes to die. MSFT promotes work life balance and they mean it, but there is a silent agreement to always be available. The team I was, you were compared ot peers and not to your job description. So if your peers were working 10+ hour days. Putting in weekend hours, checking emails, getting in calls at 10 pm consistently, etc. And you were respecting your 40 hour shift. Even if you got your work done, there is no way you will get as much done as your peers and you will be judged by that.
