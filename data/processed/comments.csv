Set up the initial infrastructure as a single prod database that read directly in from sources. No stage, no transformation layer, just source straight into prod. No backups either, and he thought backups were an extra expense we didn't need.2. Stored patient phone numbers and zip codes as numbers, dropping all leading zeroes for about four months' data until he put that into a reporting table and freaked out about why so many rows were wrong.3. After fixing the phone number issue, he decided to use phone numbers as a patient table's primary key, 4. This is my all-time favorite: he put unhashed SSNs in a table that was fed into Tableau, so that all of our practice administrators could see the SSNs of all the patients across all of our practices. *Huge* security issue.5. Lied about a dozen times on a questionnaire about security practices for a data sharing deal the company wanted to do with BCBS.

n9200po,"Well, best case scenario this is a ""make lemonade out of lemons"" scenario, where you take a bad environment with very few factors in your favor (in terms of growing your skills or actually making some impactful changes), and see what you can make of it.

Go sign up for a free Snowflake account ($400 in free credits), go hook it up with your own GitHub, and load up data from SharePoint by just downloading CSV files to your laptop...

This experience was a catalyst for my professional growth.In that role, **PySpark** was our main framework. We used it to build scalable ETL/ELT pipelines capable of processing massive datasets efficiently. For orchestration, we relied on **Apache Airflow**, which was a game-changer for automating and monitoring our data workflows.To manage our code and documentation, we used **GitHub** and **GitLab**. This ensured that our development process was organized, collaborative, and easy to track. For data analysis and validation, I used **Hue** to run queries and visualize data directly on our Hadoop cluster. And for database administration, **DBeaver** was my go-to tool for managing both **MySQL** and **Oracle** environments.This exposure to a modern, integrated tech stack was invaluable. It not only deepened my technical skills but also prepared me for the demands of the current job market.# > Is It a Bad Career Choice to Stay?Yes, in terms of professional growth, it absolutely is.

Think of it this way: a small short-term loss in salary could lead to a much larger long-term gain in earning potential.Given that you're in your early 30s, you have plenty of time to pivot. Use your current low-stress environment to your advantage.

Good engineering managers know that and will mostly expect you to demonstrate that you are proactively learning by asking questions and reaching out to seniors to get help.If you're good at SQL and have some experience with proper software engineering (git), dbt should be easy for you to pick up in a couple of weeks. Just follow their guides and best practices to make sure you use it correctly and in a way that is easy to follow by another dbt user. Snowflake is probably the best hands-off OLAP distributed database, if you're good at SQL, there should be no difficulty.

If it is multi-line, you'll still want to split the files up, but it gets trickier.Next, use whatever tool you're comfortable with to clean up the split files. For this size, you may need to use Spark, but I'd recommend trying something like Polars or DuckDB on a system with a lot of RAM to start. If you need to run this operation often (ie, monthly) it may be worth the time to create the Spark code to clean it up. Depending on the version of SQL Server you're using, you may want to write these files out as parquet to simplify data imports.For insertion into SQL, it depends on exactly what you need to do. If you're simply importing it, I'd use a bulk insert and clean it up from there. Max out the RAM and use SSDs if possible - it will drastically improve the performance.

na1osku,">What level of SQL/Python should I realistically aim for?A really common question and the answer is it completely depends as expectations differ from company to company.

How is something not total shit? It depends on the feedback from your manager and your team as long as it's constructive and makes sense rather than comments like ""I don't like it"".Conceptually, most things you are going to make for a company should have the ambition to reach production, thus, it should be as complete as possible.If it's something only you use personally, then it doesn't matter what it looks like.If it's something somebody else will see or use, it shouldn't be shit.

I'm probably not following what this subreddit would consider to be best practices, but here's what I did:* Built out a Python ETL platform that allows me to generate pipelines using JSON config files. The pipelines ingest Excel files directly from our local network, transform and clean the data, and pop it into an on-prem SQL Server database. My platform is modular and extensible, so I tend to add/update functionality as needed.* I use dev/test/prod environments in the DB but haven't done bronze/silver/gold layers. Monitoring is manual right now (log files!) but I plan to migrate to Prefect and/or implement some Power BI dashboards that consume my logs.* I avoid manually-managed documentation wherever possible, because that will be the first thing to go out of date. Instead, I'm using JSON schemas and GitHub Actions to automatically generate documentation for my config files on push, and docstrings + pdoc + GitHub Actions to do the same for my codebase. Only manually-maintained documentation is the top-level README for the repo.* Power BI is a star for me. Getting the on-prem gateway running was painful, but I've established dev/test/prod environments where I control access. Users can access the dashboards via Teams or, in some cases, export the semantic models to Excel for further analysis. I'm also using PBIB files so I can manage dev in GitHub.In terms of general approach, I would start slow and be responsive. Full-stack data analysis means you're also your own PM, so be sure to communicate well and be able to justify your choices to stakeholders. Figure out your P0 items that are crucial for what you're building and then go build it. As you work on this, you'll naturally identify new concerns and priorities and be able to respond to those. Having a vision for what you want to do will help you build for the future--for example, I want to manage my configs via a website, so I established JSON schema rules that unlocked automated documentation--but your vision should remain flexible.Good luck!(Edit: Formatting)",Tokyohenjin,2025-08-20 10:36:49,3,dataengineering,t3_1mv97xj,False,

Treat S3 as the ""immutable log"", partition by table then ingest date and hour using the Debezium event time ts\_ms, and write Parquet with reasonable file sizes so Redshift can scan fast.In Redshift, instead of the sink, optionally, you can create an external table over staging for cheap ELT, then build a deduped view or table by using row\_number over partition by primary key ordered by ts and the Debezium op so you keep the latest non delete.If you need a current table for BI, schedule a merge from that deduped view into a skinny current table with sort key on the primary key and updated\_at. This avoids constant vacuum churn from doing small upserts, and you still get perf.

They did a lot of the coding in Python for the backend framework and I was working on SQL. My coding time was reduced to about 70%. The other 30% was largely meetings. In July, I got added to a second project. I became the lead on it and the project with the contractor. For the most part, I am now coding about 10% of the day, in meetings answering questions and asking questions about requirements for about 70% of the day, and the remaining 20% is architecture diagrams and code reviews. Except for this week where one of my contractors for my first project is OOO, and I am coding about 50% of this week to backfill him.

n9nwlll,"> the DB team doesn’t want to deal with 400 staging tablesWell tough I'd say. The entire purpose behind RDBMS like Postgres is that it gives you these commands to operate on data locally with all the tooling to make it as efficient as possible because it understands the source and destination table structures.Merge statements would be very generic. You could make a pretty simple jinja template to use as a code generator, just putting the target table name and column names as params. Make that output a procedure definition, and as long as you stick to the pattern that's all you have to write manually. You should be able to automatically scrape all the parameters you need using information_schema -- the whole thing could be a single python script to automatically generate everything.You have your spark insert to a staging table (truncate first if you don't include a partition column), then run the procedure.If they don't want to deal with all of these objects too much, they can have a separate schema to put them in.Ultimately making spark do the work if figuring out what is an insert, update, or delete, is going to be very wasteful in shuffling data back-and-forth, and you're running two sets of compute when it could be one.",azirale,2025-08-20 05:32:32,1,dataengineering,t3_1mult5j,False,

n9dgdf3,"I am biased (been working with ClickHouse at Tinybird for 3+ years now), though I can share some thoughts on the operational side.To me it boils down to community and support. ClickHouse community is strong and growing. The number of contributors and commits to ClickHouse has grown so much over the last 5-10 years. Just look at the contrib chart: [https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse/graphs/contributors) Pinot not so much: [https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/apache/pinot/graphs/contributors) If your main concern is maintenance and operational overhead, to me this is the most important thing. I think the ClickHouse community takes the cake.Personally I also think that CH is just easier to reason about. The SQL is mostly standard with some CH-specific stuff, but if you know SQL you can be productive quickly. For logs specifically, it handles high-volume ingestion really well and the compression is excellent.I don't have as much hands-on experience with Pinot, but from what I understand it can be more complex operationally - more moving pieces to manage. The trade-off is that it's designed more specifically for certain real-time analytics workloads.Since you mentioned you're starting with logs and might move to business metrics later, CH might be the safer bet. It's proven at massive scale (we have customers running trillions of rows) and the operational complexity is manageable. Plus if you're planning to eventually query business metrics alongside logs, having everything in one system can simplify things.What kind of log volumes are you looking at? And do you need real-time ingestion or is near real-time ok?Btw, maybe you'll find this template interesting or useful as a starting point -> [https://www.tinybird.co/templates/logs-explorer-template](https://www.tinybird.co/templates/logs-explorer-template) (if you're worried about operational overhead, maybe Tinybird could be a landing place for you... lmk if you have questions about it.",itty-bitty-birdy-tb,2025-08-18 16:30:07,3,dataengineering,t3_1mrlw9e,False,

Good data engineering benefits from a perspective that plants trees you'll probably not enjoy the shade of. Comment your code with intent, explain the reason why you are doing what you are doing in that moment in documentation and note when you are doing the same thing multiple times. When you first start it is often easy to build something that works initially but is ultimately not going to scale or isn't maintainable. Learning from those times helps you think about the bigger picture and understand the true scope of a given ask. Example: the company is recording things in Excel files and they want you to make some of the data available in a consolidated dashboard. You could just grab the specific data/fields from the files and write them to a database then point a dashboard to it. That would fulfill the request but then in 6 months they realize they want other data from those old Excel files and you need to reprocess them again to get the rest of the data. Whereas if at the start you consider the durability of the files and potential future needs vs. Cost of storage you may have taken everything from those files. Then when the ask for more of the data eventually comes you can provide the data in a fraction of the time and you've ensured that everything is backed up in case some accidentally deletes a source file.",Mrbrightside770,2025-08-22 20:50:45,1,dataengineering,t3_1mxhdi4,False,

Do one pass to get the roster of IDs, store that set, then on each poll diff the set to find new and missing IDs.Here are a few things that worked for me in the past on similar issues: For updates, fetch in batches but avoid refetching everything every time. Keep a raw bronze table of the exact JSON per employee keyed by employee_id plus poll_time and a content_hash. If the hash changed since last poll, mark it changed and upsert into your modeled tables. If an ID disappears from the roster for a few consecutive polls, tombstone it. Add last_fetched_at and last_changed_at in your modeled table, and keep headers like ETag or Last Modified if the API gives them.Start with a tiny script using requests plus a small state store in Postgres (or just a json file), and land raw to object storage or DuckDB. Polling is still fine here, but tier it by heuristics. Recently created or recently changed IDs get polled more often, long lived records get sampled less. Backfill can be a manual trigger, then switch to a low frequency poll.

n9wjhvw,"""Azure Synapse SQL Dedicated and Serverless"", what? You've just used words from different technologies and slapped them together. Fabric offer pretty much nothing that Synapse doesn't - the ""one Lake"" approach is a new feature that dilutes the whole concept of ""single source of truth"". And Fabric doesn't support data flows.Synapse is a solution for enterprise needs, it can be optimised as you'd expect for that level of usage.Fabric is aimed at ""citizen"" developers, e.g. people who operate as individuals and pull reports together from different sources. The one thing fabric genuinely does better than Synapse is allows you to connect to data sources easily. It's not difficult in Synapse, it's just not very intuitive.The easiest way to envision is it: Data Factory does a bunch of legacy operations and support basically everything that on prem does, with no need to rewrite it all. it also offers newer ways of doing things but that's not what makes it useful IMO.Synapse offers true ""PAYG"" data processing which takes the load off your internal systems, and generally will be cheaper than Data Factory but needs a significant rewrite on new technologies (Such as Spark, Python) and a whole new approach to how things are processed. The upside is the power of the servers you can provision is massive, and you only pay for what you use - instead of paying for them 24/7.Fabric offers most of what Synapse does but has a very different interface to Synapse. It also leverages One Lake. The main difference is pricing. In Synapse you need to pay for each resource individually, but in Fabric you pay for ""capacity"" which can range from storage to processing - but it all comes under one payment.The reality is that Synapse is a great product that can operate alongside DF, and both of them utilise each other for specific functions, but Synapse is a whole new world. Fabric is aimed to try and give non technical people ""democratised"" data processing - which is a great idea but functionally is very close to giving someone 15 excel files and hoping they know what they're doing when they copy paste from them all that the data is correct at the end.All of these technologies need a data platform and approach - trying to sell Fabric as ""better"" is just wild. I know MS are pushing it, but having worked with all 3 technologies AND on prem, i can safely say there are more headaches in fabric than the others because it's solving a problem that data engineers didn't need solved.",B1zmark,2025-08-21 14:55:50,0,dataengineering,t1_n9uj8av,False,

n9xw2xi,"As to the first part - no, I'm naming 3 distinct components:* Fabric Warehouse* Azure Synapse Analytics SQL Dedicated Pools* Azure Synapse Analytics SQL Serverless PoolsBelieve it or not, there's one engineering team who built and support all 3.As for the rest - reasonable people can disagree. Yes, you need a data platform in both. But there are genuinely significant improvements in Fabric that aren't in Synapse.Yes, Synapse is a very capable platform. But it's also a challenging platform to use well. Synapse SQL Dedicated Pools make you choose between best performance (storing in its proprietary internal tables) and open formats (external tables). Scaling is offline, and disruptive. And they require a lot of tuning to get good performance out of them. Synapse Serverless SQL pools are better on that front, but have a lot of limitations of their own.I genuinely believe Fabric Warehouse is better than them. It gets rid of that division, and has many, many improvements elsewhere, from provisioning (scaling is online like Synapse Serverless SQL Pools, but faster and more intelligent), query optimization (overhauled and distinct from either Synapse SQL Pool offerings), query execution (improved beyond both previous products), and so on. I have worked on all 3 products, seen the customer experiences on all 3, and that's my honest opinion.Similarly, if you look at Fabric Spark, it has NEE, based on Gluten and Velox, to improve performance and lower costs:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/native-execution-engine-overview?tabs=sparksqlNote that Fabric Spark has a pay as you go billing option:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/autoscale-billing-for-spark-overviewThere have been discussions about expanding that to other workloads where it makes sense, but that's a question for PMs rather than me.Feature development is focused on Fabric these days, so the engines in Fabric will continue to improve further with time. And as I said above, I genuinely believe they're already significantly better than what we have in Synapse. And unfortunately, many of those improvements are not really feasible to bring to Synapse - we had to do very significant rearchitecting to deliver them, and that rearchitecting means it's not really feasible to put the improvements into the older products, they just weren't designed for it. Anyway, you don't have to agree with me, that's fine. This is my personal opinion; that's your personal opinion. Reasonable people can have differences of opinions.Thanks for sharing yours, hope this helps you understand mine a bit better too.",warehouse_goes_vroom,2025-08-21 18:46:59,1,dataengineering,t1_n9wjhvw,False,

It might be interesting to use for reviewing code, but I really don't understand the mindset of those who think it's anywhere near able to replace anyone in this industry.People are turning to AI to solve problems that can and should be solved by actual deterministic, properly thought, and battle-tested frameworks instead, and I think this is wrong in many ways, because at the end of the day it's not deterministic so the same prompt is totally unlikely to generate the same code twice, unless you run the model locally and always provide it with the same seed and prompt sequence, but most people don't even do that. Not only that but as of now AI doesn't even come close to a proficient programmer at any meaningful task as the AI generated code that I've read so far suffered from being extremely verbose, lacking proper structure, and containing lots of useless comments, which considering that we have already been suffering from a huge code quality problem due to businesses making it normal to focus on developer experience instead of user experience for decades, means nothing good for this industry.People using AI to take on tasks that they are not versed in are also hurting themselves, not only by letting it produce potentially crap code whose correctness they can't really verify, but because by letting the AI do it, they are also missing out on potentially insightful learning opportunities. AI might be able to generate lots of code very fast, giving people the impression that they are actually saving time, while in reality the brittle nature of that code couple with nobody really having a deep understanding of the train of thought behind it means that technical debt is accumulating very quickly, leading to whole projects having to be scrapped and rewritten from scratch once the codebase becomes unmanageable.We might also already be witnessing the dawn of a new job title that I would call AI janitor, where some companies vibe code their way to success, the resulting mess becomes totally unmanageable, and they end up having to hire humans to rewrite everything from scratch. I am actually positioning myself to take on this role at some point in the future, by continuing to learn, keeping my brain sharp, and also taking advantage of AI to learn about AI itself and the use cases where it has already largely surpassed human intelligence and can actually be helpful, because honestly when it comes to this technology, I don't think this is the time to relegate myself to the passenger's seat when I can instead take it up to the next level by becoming a pilot.At present, companies are collectively spending 10 times more on AI than they're making back, and that's not to mention our consumption of natural resources, so while it's generating revenue, it requires an insane and totally unsustainable amount of investment to do it. The hope is to eventually come up with a way to build an AGI, but since nobody can really predict the consequences of that, I don't think it's realistic to plan with that scenario in mind, especially when other scenarios like model collapse due to the phenomenon where AI slop in training data makes models significantly more likely to hallucinate are a lot more realistic, so I think it's safe to say that we're collecting betting our future on finding a pegasus unicorn.Lastly, there's also the fact that, at present, AI still lacks human curiosity and drive to try new things, so if most people decide to rely on it, once the investment tap is shut, no new innovation will actually be achieved, including on AI itself, since no new problem-solving paradigms will be attempted as AI is only really able to shuffle combinations of the same old strategies. Therefore in the end AI might replace many jobs in this industry not because it became smarter than us but because we collectively decided to get dumber, and while I don't personally mind this scenario from an economical perspective, because I am positioning myself to not only survive the devastation resulting from the explosion of this hype bubble completely unscathed, but to also thrive by providing a helping hand in the aftermath, I am still concerned about the permanent damage we're doing to the natural resources on our planet which we're still totally dependent on for survival.",Fridux,2025-08-17 08:39:19,8,learnprogramming,t3_1msa43x,False,

There's still room for mathematicians, writers, researchers, mechanics and map creators, and of course software engineers.For people who want to create software, either for money or passion, of course they should learn in-depth knowledge about how software works.

Which happened because digital literacy is so low and the demand for programmers was so high. That's good for those people, but I don't think it could have been a stable dynamic into the future. Now that decent coding AIs are available, people simply don't know what the future will look like. The AI doesn't neatly fit in the corporate structures that have been built about working with a massive number of junior developers, so the industry will change. It is hard to know what skills will be desired for software development 5 years from now, so my suggestion is to maybe not chase the money right now, but definitely chase the passion.But again, ""learning to code"" itself, I would say that everyone should do that, just to understand the very basics of the dozens of computer chips around you every day. (Even the notion that a person today interacts with up to a 100 different programmable computer chips every day is probably weird to many people. If you include internet servers in the mix, the number shoots up to thousands.) The world is still getting more automated every day, and digital illiteracy will eventually became as limiting as normal illiteracy is today.",Unreal_Estate,2025-08-17 08:22:01,4,learnprogramming,t3_1msa43x,False,

You just need to dive into SOMETHING, write code ,make mistakes, and LEARN from them.Also, one thing to learn is one's own personal preferences. There are lots of actually different programming languages in use, but beginners won't even know what the words we use to describe those differences mean, and even when they learn the definitions they won't know what it feels like in practice.We also don't always get to use our favourite languages.

n968mcj,"I teach other academics to program in Python for research, and that ranges from doctoral students to senior academics. I routinely get a laugh out of the “I’m `round(random.normalvariate(27, 2))` years old. Is that too old to learn Python?” questions. Just go for it!On AI, I’ve seen a lot of tech hype over the years, but it seems like the right answer is to try what’s new. LLMs are interesting. Writing serious prose, I dislike pretty much everything I get out of them. But, by having something to react to, I more quickly clarify my own logic and get more done. Code completions are often not great when changing tasks, but they’re often good at making coordinating edits to match the one I just made. Generating longer code ranges from not all that useful (particularly specialized uses or where I have a clear idea of what I want) to massively productive (using a new to me package or things with a lot of boilerplate/structure like dashboards/web frameworks). It’s nuanced and not always predictable, so you experiment and build intuition. Programming is great outside of work, too. I wrote a Python program to help us name our first child and made it (minimally) web-based to help us name our second. My five year old wanted to learn some Python (she saw it in VS Code while we were working on a short book we had an LLM write with her input), so I sat her in front of a terminal interpreter and had her type simple expressions like math and using string methods. The artwork on our walls is all on the same centerline, because I wrote a function to translate picture frame dimensions and the center of the stretched picture wire to a wall location for the hanging hook. I cant count the number of times I’ve whipped up a personal project that analyzes some data or written some abomination of a regex that reformats something mangled into a structured form.One of the amazing things about programming is that failure is frequent and relatively costless. Imagine if you messed up a cooking recipe and could simply edit and reprocess it with no ingredient loss and millisecond cooking time as many times as needed. That’s why diving in is the right approach. You’ll answer your “should I” question quickly, and you may love it.

n9qpkf7,"Well, my situation was a very different time initially: the 1990's. But since you asked... Ya, what surprised me was just how desperate a company was back then, and well into the early 2010's for anyone with programming/admin/networking/tech-support capabilities. Essentially, if you showed any prowess in those 4 areas what-so-ever (and especially if you had cursory basic knowledge of all 4 of them) then wow! Suddenly you became a kind of semi-hero in the work space? A kind of defacto tech support and programmer (even if that wasn't your main job!). ------------------------------The need was so great that... At that point, there's was pretty much nothing you could ever do to get fired! Like ya... I was younger at that time, and foolish, so even though I didn't control my emotions at some point and even yelled back at the senior founding partner of our firm, I still didn't get fired! I kid you not: I even got caught late at night in a rather compromising position with a certain colleague, in which her and I were inappropriately hitting it off... and then... well... hit it off one late night, when wouldn't you know it: that same senior partner came into the office unusually to check something. And kinda freaked, then backed out, and never spoke about it to me! (Ya, if that was today, I would have been long fired multiple times!)------------------------------Anyways... So, I actually got hired by a pretty well known international law firm as a technical writer, since I had done two entirely separate university degrees: one physics, and one English Literature. Ya, I know: that's a strange and weird combo, but those are my 2 loves in life! Despite the fact that unfortunately I'm not all that good in either of them, lol! But the law firm dealt in many aspects related to the sciences and engineering, ranging from patents to immigration of highly talented people, etc... So they needed someone who could read scientific papers, and be semi-decent at writing. (As you can see from the length of this comment, I'm a pretty crazy writer: always constantly writing. Just not anything all that good! But still always writing, and I can type at about 90 to 100 words per minute.) ------------------------------Finally to get to the point, not only did I do technical writing... But if anyone had a problem with their computer in the office, my phone line would light up and ring (if the main tech-guy/admin wasn't there yet in the morning, or was already busy). And then people would approach me to help them automate some tasks. So believe it or not, I would actually use C++ (taping into Win32) combined with a program called ""Autohotkey"" to do scripting and automation! Like who uses C++ of all things, to do quick scripting and automation tasks!? Well apparently that would be me! ------------------------------But ya, I got the job after I graduated with my second degree, and boy was I surprised by me being thrust into that role, and just rapidly utilizing anything I knew to get the job done, even if it wasn't anything close to 100% the correct language or solution model for the problem. Just as long as it worked, mostly glitch free, then nobody gave a flying F what programming language or tool I used to get the job done. And because of that, they never-ever-ever wanted to fire me, even though they had to scold me several times. ------------------------------Fast forward to today, and ya... Times have really changed, mostly for the worse in this field unfortunately. I worry the good old fashioned crazy pure days of fun are behind us now in the tech sector, and companies have turned something great into something of misery...

n9qptu6,"I've been on the other side: interviewing candidates for entry level back-end focused dev positions. Here's my thoughts. Active Github profile (daily commits) - not important. ""Daily commits"" is especially not important, some days you just aren't going to have code worth committing. The important part is _having worked on a project of nontrivial complexity_. You had a problem and you tried to solve it... how did you approach the problem, and why did you choose the solution you did? Talking about the candidate's prior work is very valuable as the person trying to understand if the candidate in front of me might be a good fit. Well-structured and documented programs (Modular & uses Swagger) - maybe of interest, but just having used tools like OpenAPI (which is the name of the spec for what was called ""swagger"" btw) or readthedocs or redoc doesn't actually tell me anything. Remember, I'm trying to figure out your approach to solving engineering problems. Does slapping swagger-ui into a maven project mean you're any more informed about how or why to use such a tool? Not necessarily. Now, if what you developed had an external API with users that needed to know about/test your endpoints, that's something worth asking about. This could dovetail into asking about other tools like Postman. ""Well structured"" is too vague of advice and honestly I'd be wary of anyone preaching this to a new developer. Trying to perfectly architect your work in progress ToDo app is not a good use of time. Get your hands dirty. Learning from mistakes and iterating is the name of the game. Waxing philosophic about how you wanted your first app to scale to thousands of users might be relevant if you're interviewing at Netflix, but anywhere else it's probably just signalling that you didn't really understand when it's appropriate to use the tools at hand, or worse, that you might be the kind of junior dev who needlessly introduces more compexity. Projects - yes, very important. Your plan is simple but if you follow through you will be fine. The only thing that stands out to me is that you don't have concrete examples for your projects. You should pick problem(s) that sounds interesting to you and then just work on them. You will inevitably run into topics that you know nothing about (how do I hook up my server to my database? how do I expose this API endpoint? how do I secure my endpoint behind basic AuthN? if my project is depending on other services, how do I rate limit my service so that I don't get angry emails/IP blocked from those services? is there some way I can process this data more efficiently?). If you are able to work on any actively maintained open source project, you can get some ""real"" dev experience before getting your first job.Here are some of the kinds of basic questions I have in my interview template: * What do you do in your current position (if any)? * What side projects have you worked on? Which languages do you use or which are you learning?* How familiar are you with ? (e.g. Spring, React, etc)* Have you used git or other source control tools? Have you submitted (or reviewed and approved) a pull request before?* Do you know what a unit test is? What do you think is the point of tests?* Walk me through your side project (if any). What was your role, how did the design go, what were any challenges you ran into? What would you have changed?* * Can you talk about a situation where someone disagreed with your recommendation, or vice versa, on an important aspect of a project?",TrumpeterSwann,2025-08-20 16:56:36,31,learnprogramming,t3_1mvh7dx,False,

As you yourself said, it took half an hour even after you Googled for the C functions you needed.I suppose the tip is to know you C string functions. There is a bunch of ways to solve it.

First Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call cannot be the original argument.1. Second Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call must ALWAYS get closer to the base case.The main thing to know is that recursion is mostly overrated. If your problem involves both 1) a tree structure and 2) back tracking, then it's a good candidate for recursion.

But you'd need one stack for the file scanner objects (representing the system's view of the directories you had descended) and another for the data you were building for each directory... and you'd carefully inspect each file object, and push a new file scanner if it was a directory, and carefully handle your end-of-scan issues at each level, popping both stacks... it could get tricky.Now consider doing it with recursion. You imagine the functional interface you want – let's say, a File, and a DataSoFar. Consider your base case – is the File a simple file, not a directory? Great, you're done. Produce your output. Otherwise you need to recurse – okay, it's a directory: update DataSoFar, create a scanner from the File, loop through the scanner and call your function on each of the files. Boom, done. The book-keeping and boundary conditions are handled for you by the program stack, and you stick to familiar function calling and error-handling idioms.The key leap for me is always that imaginative step: *what's the functional interface I wish I could use to solve one step of this problem?* Recursion sometimes allows you to achieve that interface with minimal effort and great clarity.",SubstantialListen921,2025-08-19 15:45:56,3,learnprogramming,t3_1mulhd1,False,

The next time you are building one of your own creations, you have some ideas of what pieces you have and how they could be used, so you disassemble some of your sets, and try to use the pieces in different ways in your own creation. Maybe it'll work, and you have to order more pieces like it - or it won't work and you have to imagine something else.When not building you are sorting your pieces, experimenting with connecting them in different ways, trying out small techniques outside of large projects, and you get ideas for how you also could use those pieces, maybe you even get an idea for a large project using the pieces that way!Also, you follow builders on social media, and talk with other builders, asking for inspiration, looking inside their creations, and you are always learning!When you have an idea for something, but absolute no knowledge of how to build it, you try sketching it, experiment with the pieces you have, will this fit? No, well how about this? Maybe if I turn that one that way?You won't always succeed, and some projects might be abandoned, but you are always learning!

One thing that helps me is using something to keep track of that sort of thing - a folder, a bookmark app, anything where you can drop everything you come across that makes you go ""that's cool/useful/whatever"" but isn't directly related to what you're doing *now*. Without that, a five minute research search can end with me realizing it's 2 am and I've gotten nothing done. As for the rest... it really is just experience, and not feeling bad about the fact that you still need to look stuff up X years in. For example, I've been using PHP for like 20 years and I still have to look up simple functions because I forget the syntax *all the time*. Who cares, though? I know what it does and how it works, not remembering what comes first in a substring isn't the end of the world.For me, at least, becoming a better programmer is less about memorization or always knowing what the right ""piece"" is, and is more about a general understanding and ""feel"" for how things work. You might not know if a specific function exists to do what you want, and it sucks to spend the time working on something only to find out later it was as easy as using a function that already exists, but it's probably going to happen to you more than once - but now you know the function exists and you know how to work without it. Figuring out how to do something, even the most trivial ""I'll never need to do this again"" thing, is never a *bad* thing and will help you grow. Maybe later you'll be learning another language that's similar but it doesn't have an applicable function for what you were doing, and it's not a problem because you know how to do it by hand. This probably isn't the most realistic example, the point is that I try to never look at ""I just did more than I needed to"" as a negative as long as it's not causing you to miss deadlines (and as long as it's not happening constantly).I'm hesitant to push AI as it's really easy to become overly reliant on it, and you should never rely on code AI slings out without vetting it yourself, but if you treat it like a search engine it's certainly a lot easier to say ""I'm trying to do X with Y and am wondering what methods others currently use"" than to try and get the perfect Google search or scroll through docs.It never hurts to join a coding community, either.

It's good to copy once or twice and follow along tutorials to get a baseline, youve got that part down, but you aren't proving you've learned how to build shit by doing that. You need to reframe how you go about this and treat it like learning an actual spoken language. You learn some nouns and verbs (keywords in programming), then you learn some concepts and combine those with your vocabulary (grammar), but you will never be able to speak with just that (speaking = programming).You can pass a Japanese test and technically ""know"" Japanese this way, but you'll never be able to express your own thoughts to a native. In the same way you can't program your own apps. If you want to progress beyond the beginners at your stage and speed up your learning, paradoxically you need to slow down. Pause the ""studying"" and ""learning"" you're doing for now and do the same thing youd do for learning a spoken language. Take what you know and form your own sentences and evaluate where you get lost and what you need to learn more of. Speaking a language = coding a project. Coding is NOT and will not ever be the most difficult part about being a programmer. Coding is hard for beginners and anyone that tells you that coding is the hard part likely does not understand what programming actually is. Build something, and when you finish build something else. Occasionally rebuild something youve already built, maybe add some new tricks youve learned to speed the process up or add features you were unable to the first time.And ""i can't build anything yet"" is not an acceptable answer. Day one of a spoken language course you learn how to say ""hello"", day one of a coding course you learn how to say ""Hello World"". Thats a project in the same way that a simple sentence in Japanese is. It's not impressive, but it is by definition a project. Now add complexity to your app. Can you print ""something besides Hello World? Can you make it print that new phrase 10 times? Can you print out what a user types? Can you make that phrase print 10 times? Can you take in more than one string of user input? If you know how to do those things, you should be able to bang your head against a wall and build a calculator. A little more complicated than ""Hello World"" and takes quite a bit more work, but building it is a lot more feasible than you think. Coding isnt hard. But it takes practice.

Knowledge acquisition doesn’t always require understanding before exposure, often repetitive exposure to things that don’t make sense is the foundation of knowledge. It’s how we all learned to speak. Our brains are actually designed to work this way.So if you are retyping programming basics like loops, syntax, the use of built in methods, turning an array into a map, the elements of a form that go together, and the js methods that move the info from the front end to the back end, the shape of classes and functions, event listeners and their methods, etc… I think that stuff is okay to copy as long as you type it out line by line. It’s hard to tell while you’re doing it, but you are learning things just by transposing them from the screen through your keyboard. You will inevitably miss a symbol or a letter and you’ll have to scan through and figure out what went wrong. This will help you gain deeper understanding. Eventually you see the patterns. Seemingly disconnected confusing things start to become connected and organized. At its heart programming is us training ourselves to be conscious of subconscious steps. Like we never have to think of every individual step of putting on a t-shirt. We just know how to do it. I believe when we program our brain begins to subconsciously understand what is happening which is why (after it clicks) sometimes coding can feel like magic, and why we have to reread and relearn code we wrote two weeks ago.

The point was indeed to maximise exposure to different languages without expecting students to become experts in any of them. We wanted them to come away with “programming mindsets” where they could solve a given junior-level problem with loops, conditionals and functions, and an awareness that different languages have different “quirks” in the syntax for these concepts. For example, all these languages have for loops, but Python has list comprehensions, JavaScript has array methods that take in callback functions, Java has implementations of the List interface…Going further into back end dev, Ruby on Rails defines endpoints as methods on a Controller class, inheriting from the framework’s built-in ActiveController. Java Spring Boot does a similar thing but with decorators, favouring composition over inheritance. Node Express doesn’t have Controller classes/prototypes, instead endpoints are just function properties assigned to an instance of an App object with callbacks to define their behaviour. They all have the concept of endpoints, they all have HTTP verbs and request/response objects, they all push you more or less to an MVC architecture, but very different implementations. Knowing the concept is way more important than knowing only one implementation.When you move to a language you don’t know - say Rust - and you try and implement an endpoint as a Node Express style async function, you’re gonna have a bad time.

I'm not entirely sure on how to do it in the second example.And you can have private variables in classes - which isn't immediately possible with functions.In my view both are ""classes"" in that they define a prototype that every new instance inherits from - and I insist that you can actually draw a class diagram of your React components, even though they don't use the word ""class"".Soooooo, to answer your question: most web developers don't use the `class` keyword regularly, but they do use the concept of *classes* all the time, although maybe more as types or interfaces in TypeScript.",peterlinddk,2025-08-17 07:48:40,2,learnprogramming,t3_1msiro9,False,

In the former days, this was an actual ROM, now it is usually some form of erasable programmable memory, like an EEPROM.The BIOS then has all the code to carry out the POST (Power On Self Test), plus libraries/functionality to talk with the various hardware components, and the code to then start, in case of a PC, the Operating System, of which the boot-loader is stored in a certain place on the hard drive (SSD, nVme, etc) of the computer.In case of the modern UEFI BIOS, this system is usually also stored on the computer's hard drive, but also exists in a storage on the main board so that when you change the hard drive, the computer can still boot.A good start to understand how everything of this plays together is to look into Microcontrollers, like the 8031/8051, Atmel (Arduino) as they are basically the same as a PC minus the operating system.",aqua_regis,2025-08-21 12:50:41,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mw9lc2,False,

OS broadly, web browser narrowly, your favorite game, maybe Lua.> Can you give me examples of where some feature is not implemented in a language because it would directly block another feature? How about [type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system)? How a language lets you define and handle types tends to be a defining feature. It also will impact every aspect of how you develop a program in that language. Choose one, block the other. A strict type system catches errors at compile time, a loose one might only catch some errors at run time. Write your tests accordingly.Along the same lines, [mutablity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object). This is the break point between imperative and declarative. The level to which that can be dictated by the programmer also defines a language.[Function overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading) comes to mind. It's extremely popular, lots of languages do it, and lots don't. There are pros and cons in implementing such a feature. There is implementation complexity but also programmer expectation.Garbage collection? How resources are released is a big deal in all languages. In some languages, all clean up is the responsibility of the programmer. In others, the programmer barely has a say.Virtual machines? Java and .NET, among others, run inside a sandbox. This is good for portability and stability, buy denies access to the OS; you get what the sandbox gives you.Last, but not exhaustively, libraries.

n9hznih,"Personally, I think they're wrong. If there were an objectively best way to write a web application, why would there be so many front ends and backends, especially backend languages? Most of them can do the task. It's just what you like.Think about C++ and Objective-C. Both were attempts to make C object-oriented. Did one stop when they heard about the other? Did C++ win because it was the best for the job? No, C++ won because it was part of AT&T which was a much bigger entity than the folks that developed Objective-C.It's just like natural languages. Is English the best language? Some (who natively speak it) say yes, but it's only because they speak it. Others insist that their language is best. We could learn Esperanto which was a designed language where the ease of learning was a key objective. Yet, it's not popular because people love their own languages, and maybe ease of learning isn't that important. Some people love how complex their language is (or how many feature it has).To get to your second question, there are languages that try to avoid using null, so they have to create Option types (that's one way to do it). This creates a level of mental overhead that those who have never used those types find unimportant, yet others, who think null pointer exceptions are evil and the cause of many errors feel it's justified.Or languages that want to be pure functional have problems with I/O, such as printing, and have to use complex math structures like monads, when everyone else feels printing is really easy, but it's counter to the functional philosophy.Prolog was built to have a backtracking mechanism, and for most, it looks like nothing you'd expect and is hard to get your mind around, and because of that, hard to figure out. Erlang, which was inspired by Prolog, has a syntax that's hard for those used to C-style syntax (which is most popular languages) to understand, partly because it was designed before language designers decided languages should look like C.And was that because C was a great language? No, but it was hugely popular in industry, so to design languages that looked like C was considered beneficial because people were more likely to try out your language if they didn't have to struggle with the syntax as much.Functional languages don't like having state, so they don't have plain old for-loops because the looping variables change values. So, they use functions like: fold, map, filter, zip, etc. to achieve looping capabilities without a looping variable.

n9o8r8o,"Hey, that sounds like a really frustrating way to learn. I've had similar experiences with courses where the instructor seems to contradict themselves, and it definitely slows things down.From my own experience, I'd suggest a couple of resources that are great for getting a solid foundation in PHP:The official PHP Manual (PHP.net): It can be a bit dry, but it's the absolute source of truth. Whenever I was stuck on what a function did or the right way to write something, I'd go there. It's less a tutorial and more of a reference, but it's essential.freeCodeCamp: They have a full, comprehensive PHP course on YouTube that is completely free. It's well-structured and a fantastic alternative to a confusing paid course.As for how long it takes, everyone's different. My biggest piece of advice, based on my own journey, is don't get lost in a forest of theory and code at the start.Just learn the absolute basics—variables, loops, etc.—and then immediately start doing. Try to build something super simple. A huge help for me was using an AI assistant. You can literally tell it, ""Explain this to me like I'm a child,"" and it will break down complex concepts into really simple terms. Use it to guide you as you build your first small project.Once you have some hands-on experience and things start to click, then go back and learn the deeper theory.

Reason being - each language has it's idiosyncracies/hidden gotchas/pitfalls. Most (if not all) of these are usually spelt out in the docs. In fact, several questions people ask on reddit/stackoverflow have their answers lying partially or wholly in the docs.That being said, there are caveats to how much of the docs one needs to read. I've added some context around this further below.>is it necessary to read ALL OF the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?No. It's recommended, but not necessary to read ALL of the documentation. My personal opinion is that you should only read the docs for things you're explicitly working with (though it's always good to go above and beyond).>I ask because documentation often contains a lot of specifications and information that can be overwhelming. I have been advised to read the ""reference manuals"" first, but even that is difficult.I feel you. Docs can be overwhelming especially if you're just starting out / are not familiar with the language. Here's how I do it (may or may not work for you) - I tend to generally only give docs a very surface level read/ avoid them until I'm fairly well versed with the language. Then - once I start doing more complex stuff - I tend to simply use my IDE to read docs for specific things I'm working with.E.g. in Java, if I'm using a class from the core library, I can hit F12 in my IDE to go to the class's source code and read the doc comments directly within that class.I find that this compartmentalizes the doc information to only the specific pieces of info I need for my work.

n9oup1b,"So first a question... If you want to change the rims and tires of your car, do you need to know about the piston compression first? Nope.While you certainly can, it may not be the best way to approach it.Ive been learning since jan, ive been using udemy courses, yt vids, projects and docs. Nowhere could i find a methodology to go through the documentation to find something and honestly its kinda confusing especially with poorly written docs.What i have found to help is to start high level and zoom into specifics as you get a better idea of what to do. Heres a recent example from my side while building a crud app. I want to create and view a blog article so what do i do? Assuming the html forms and express server is already set up. Ok so i need to be able to firstly log the inputs, what does it look like, how do i do that, and if its not in a useable state, how do i transform it. Ok then i need to be able to access the json file and also somehow save to the json file. Ok then lastly to view the article i need to again access the json and somehow display the info somewhere in my html( or in my case ejs template). Again what would happen if the data is not in a useable state? This breaks down all the steps which you can then go looking for your methods. So as an example (im using node and express for the backend) i want to access the json file. So you can google that and read around or go straight to the docs (if you know roughly which module) and then look for various ways to read a json file. And then when you find, ok so in the fs module i have a few methods to choose from, .read().readFile().createReadStream(), so among these methods which one is applicable to my situation. Now you're reading the docs, looking at specifics, comparing methods with a specific goal in mind. You can even test each one to see if it works or not. I have found this to work for me... And yes its very time intensive as compared to just getting the code from AI in 30sec.

n9p77uj,"> However, I am learning Python for specific reasons: Text processing, XML handling, etc. >> […] is it necessary to read all of the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?This sounds like something of an [X-Y problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem). The problem you need to solve is _text processing and XML handling_, but what you're asking about is _fully understanding Python_. These are two different things.Python as a language lets you be productive with only a small understanding of the language itself (that's how I got started with it; I've actually forgotten how or when I started writing Python, at some point I realised that's what I was writing my scripts in, rather than Perl or Bash).In programming, as elsewhere, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. The stuff you write with only a minimal understanding of Python will look awkward to someone more experienced, including yourself some few months from now.Generally what you want is:1. a _good enough_ understanding of the language semantics itself. ""Good enough"" is poorly defined, and varies by language: * A language like Rust will require more investment in learning up front, but deliver very few gotchas down the line * A language like Javascript or PHP will require very little investment in learning up front, but deliver more gotchas down the line * Python is kinda more middle-of-the-road. * For this bit you kinda just gotta read a book, preferably a good one so you don't fall asleep, and do some exercises to get a feel for it.1. A decent understanding of engineering in the language, as in, how do you write long-term maintainable code? * This includes which libraries and external tools you're expected to use. * For Python you kinda have to check /r/Python and other resources, but currently Astral tools like `uv` and `ruff` are good to have in your toolkit, and a typechecker like Microsoft's `pyright` until Astral's `ty` gets to 1.0. * Static analysis, both typechecking and linters, will help you catch weaknesses in your understanding of what you're doing.1. A decent ability to discover relevant information in documentation, especially reading API docs. * Generally searching is better than trying to memorize everything. Your brain can only fit so much information. * Language servers / IDEs can help a lot with discoverability.",syklemil,2025-08-20 12:19:47,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mvau8z,False,

Consider “gathering requirements” this in itself is some documentation you want to create before you start developing. You probably also want to pin down any quality attributes and relevant SLO/SLAs, and a workable architecture or design for your software. Basically you start by producing a pile of documentation that you reference throughout your development, and while developing you may produce documentation about certain methods or functions, or a quirk of a third party system you interact with, and so on, which will help the future developers (likely you) maintain the project. You’ll also want “user facing documentation” that the people who use the software you produce can use to help them get the most out of it or answer questions for them when they stumble across a workflow quirk.Further I consider the value of a SWE to not just be code output, but “knowledge output”, so alongside development or while making architectural decisions or soliciting requirements, or after getting user feedback, they should also be learning things about the domain and ideally producing some documentation that can help the whole team understand the why and how behind certain domain-specific things. Code is almost inherently technical debt, and knowledge is the only thing that lets you pay it down.It sounds like a lot, but all of it can usually fit in an agile sprint or whatever.

PHP backends with modern JS frontends is a killer combo that lots of companies want.The Spring Boot frustration you felt is totally normal.. Java web dev has a steep learning curve compared to Laravel's elegance. Most Java courses do start way too basic which is annoying when you already know how to code.If you really want to explore Java, maybe try building a simple REST API first instead of jumping into Thymeleaf.

For each match, it checks whether the substring of `s2` starting at that point actually equals `s1`The trick is that instead of those steps being implemented directly as loops, they're implemented by calling methods on `std::char_traits`, which in turn call the standard C library functions `memchr` and `memcmp`, respectively.And depending on the platform, those functions in turn can be implemented using highly-optimized assembly code, which is likely faster than anything you would write by hand in C++.

Steve wrote the entire program in 6502 Assembly - on paper - then hand-translated everything in the numeric machine code that then could be loaded on the Apple computers. You can find plenty information on how Steve did it on the internet.When I learnt 8051 Assembly in my degree program we initially also learnt to hand-translate the Mnemonics into machine code and vice versa. Can highly recommend to learn that with simpler CPUs, like the 6502, the Zilog Z-80, or the 8051/8031/8080 series Microcontrollers.Assembly is just a 1:1 translation of machine code and therefore is closest to hardware.",aqua_regis,2025-08-21 09:36:55,5,learnprogramming,t3_1mw5n7i,False,

This avoids coming across like a contrarian and shows you're open to other people's ideas. * admit when you don't know something - no one likes a no it all especially about matters you clearly don't understand. This gives your thoughts and opinions more weight when you do express them.* Use words like ""We"", ""Us"", & ""As a team"", instead of ""you created this bug on this PR"", ""we created this bug, and we missed it during the PR"", ""what if we need to add X functionality?""* form relationships with users (if non public facing software) and stakeholders. If you have a bug you're investigating, just tell the user, this builds more trust and good will. * when debating about designs/patterns/architecture, just don't say ""this isn't good because X, Y, Z"", ask people questions in a way that it will lead them to the conclusion you want them to make. ""Will this work under this use case?"", ""what if the user does X?"", etc. * ask your manager how other folks are doing, ""how is John doing lately? He seems a bit stressed out or anxious"".

n9he2gh,"You're definitely not alone in noticing that — a lot of people have been expressing similar thoughts across different forums and subreddits. The rise in AI-generated content has blurred the lines of authenticity in online discussions. Here are a few reasons why it might *feel* like that:# :brain: Why Posts Might Feel AI-Generated1. **Overly Polished Language** Posts are increasingly written in this weirdly structured, “essay-like” format. People don’t usually talk like that on Reddit — especially in tech circles where tone tends to be blunt, sarcastic, or informal.2. **Generic Advice & Vague Details** A lot of posts give surface-level advice or talk about issues in super broad terms without getting into the gritty technical details — which is common with AI output unless prompted very specifically.3. **Repetitive Phrasing and Templates** You’ll often see similar turns of phrase or story structures across different posts — things like “After X years in the industry, I realized Y” or “Am I the only one who feels Z?” It starts to feel formulaic.4. **Influx of Low-Effort Engagement Farming** Some users (or bots) are using AI to mass-generate posts and comments to farm karma, drive traffic, or build fake authority on niche topics.# :robot: Signs a Post Might Be AI-Generated* Lacks personal anecdotes or uses generic placeholders.* Echoes common sentiments without adding anything new.* Oddly balanced tone: too formal but pretending to be casual, lol.* Uncanny ability to sit on the fence on controversial topics.* Unnatural use of :pile_of_poo: emojis.* Overuse of the em dash (—).# :puzzle_piece: You're Not ""Schizo"" — You're PerceptiveIt’s unsettling, yeah. And it *does* erode trust — not just in content, but in online community culture itself. Part of Reddit’s value used to be real, lived experience and human nuance. If that’s being diluted, it makes total sense to question what you're reading and who's actually behind it.If you're feeling disoriented by all this, it’s not paranoia — it’s pattern recognition.

You could feel that every single crypto asset is bullshit, but even then I’m not sure you could deny that selling services to people who want to use and trade those assets isn’t a real business. I think Pokémon card investing is bullshit, but if someone built a website to facilitate buying and selling of cards and took in real revenue, I’d still call that a real business. And all of those trading venues and lending venues need developers, often to build rather complex products that can’t have much downtime.An area that’s bigger than ever are stablecoins - crypto assets pegged to (generally) the US dollar. The companies that offer these digital assets hold things like US treasuries to back them, so the company can earn revenue off of the interest while also ensuring that each digital dollar can be redeemed for a US dollar. As far as crypto things go, these are probably the most useful. People in countries with volatile currencies and poor banking systems can now receive, hold, send, and earn interest on US dollars with just a phone and an internet connection. They can send them anywhere in the world and be paid from anywhere in the world. And with the crap going on with Steam and itch.io having to block NSFW games because of pressure from credit card companies, I’d argue we actually could really use a digital dollar that’s as free flowing and censorship resistant as a real life physical dollar.

Does it mean I have made enough progress or that I haven't?""I will also say - as a reminder, PIPs are about having the right proof for being able to fire someone for ~~cause~~ a valid reason (thanks comment below for the correction). Its basically saying ""we were very clear about what you needed to do, And you didn't do it so we're firing you"".If they put you on a PIP and then they fire you even if you did everything they asked you to do, then they're opening themselves up to a lawsuit.So I would maybe read up a bit on PIPs and also make sure that if things look shady (i.e., if you're actually doing good at your job but they're trying to fire you for cause when they should instead be laying you off), that you figure out what recourse you have.",dfphd,2025-08-17 17:12:25,15,cscareerquestions,t3_1msuz7y,False,
n97dtce,"PIPs get extended for a variety of reasons, but they all come back to ""we are not able to make a decision right now"". By far, the most common reason is that your manager didn't collect enough supporting data to support firing you, if you choose to sue. For example, you should have gotten a written summary of every 1:1 with your manager since the PIP began. If not, they may want to allow for more time to get better documentation.You don't need documentation to close the PIP without firing you. All your manager has to say is ""u/linkthecat's performance has been acceptable and I want to close the PIP."" Boom, done.The fact that it's extended most likely means that your manager still wants to get rid of you, but HR is blocking it.There are chances that your manager said ""they seem to be improving, but I need more time"". This happens, but it's unusual, simply because PIPs are unpleasant for the manager and they're unlikely to want to extend them. It's also possible that they're waiting to get your replacement. That happens, but it's less likely, simply because it's better to be a little short-handed than to keep a bad performer around.

Apples and oranges.> After over 200 applications to MLE and data scientist positions (even data analyst roles that I’m clearly overqualified for), I’ve only been met with rejection or ghosting.Even before universities had specific graduate programs targeting Data Science / Machine Learning (so before 2019 lets say), it was very challenging to find a position where you fucked with models/charts, tweaked parameters, and performed EDA all day. And this was peak Data Science mania hiring among corporate leadership -- Data Science was the GenAI before GenAI existed from ~2016 through 2019. Sounds great right? Except boy do I know a ***ton*** of people in that space who got laid off between 2020 and 2022 so lets set the nostalgic rose-colored glasses down.> Both of these times, the recruiters have been enthusiastic to hear about my experience, and often praise my resume and my accomplishments.The fundamental challenge for Data Science / Machine Learning roles is an organization will need 1, maybe 2, of that type of skillset for every ~500 run-of-the-mill software engineers that they need to build software products.

I also didn't have to explain things to him multiple times. He would complete things quickly and with the enthusiasm of someone still fresh in the field.Despite me never wanting an intern in the first place I ended up pushing to hire him after the internship ended and after he finished out his last semester in school. He is now with us full time and whenever raise time comes around, I'm asking my boss what if anything I can do to help him get a promotion/raise- the answer is usually nothing, but I want to keep him because he has proven himself to be super valuable to the team and I know that earlier on in your career is when you can make moves to other companies for the biggest jumps in your career. I guess to me what made the difference was that, he learned/improved quickly and was fairly independent. I didn't have to spell out each and every little step like I would to a chatgpt prompt.

n9wpudx,">Quiet quitting / giving 50% on my day job isn’t an option, management is tracking quite literally ever 30 mins of my day.What would happen if you changed the 100% of your day to mean a regular, 8 hour, 9-5 work day?You're not changing it to 50%, you're not quiet quitting. You're establishing professional boundaries and making it clear that your working hours are 9-5, M-F. You'll be working 100% of your working hours.I don't know how cutthrough the consulting scene is, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but that's the advice I normally give to people suffering burnout. People always think in extremes. ""Put up with being miserable working 12 hour days"" vs ""Quit without anything lined up"".In reality there's usually a less extreme option: ""Enforce your professional boundaries, and work 8 hour days, regardless of what's going on around you with the project and management"". And immediately start job searching with all that extra time.The thing about that approach is even if that ruffles feathers, they usually don't fire you right away. They'll heckle you about your performance, they might PIP you, they'll desperately start looking for your replacement, maybe the client will drop you... but all that often takes months. Firing you outright is a much larger impact to the project than letting you work ""normal"" 8 hour days until they hire and train your replacement. It'd be a stupid management decision to react prematurely.So in that time before they fire you... you're job searching *and* collecting a paycheck instead of draining your savings. And the best part of that approach is if they do end up firing you before you line something else up, you're *exactly* where you were about to put yourself voluntarily: Unemployed.That said, at the end of the day quitting without something lined up isn't the end of the world. It's a calculated risk and an expense. If you decide that's worth it, go for it. If even after reducing your workday to 8 hours you're still feeling miserable, then that's likely not going to help, so quitting ASAP may be the best option for you.I'm surprised you lasted 3+ years of 12+ hour days... I would've be gone in month 1. WLB is my #1 priority. I'm a 9-5 employee.

From the company’s perspective, a billable hour is a billable hour, but overtime hours are expensive, so it’d be perfectly reasonable to work with your leadership chain to cut overtime and hire more people instead. If relying on overtime is widespread, you can probably even rally support from coworkers by getting everyone to complain to leadership simultaneously.The time tracking thing doesn’t need to involve micromanaging.

Now I am thinking about scalate this with HR so no other people suffer the same experience from that guy... What I suggest you is always focus on facts-process-communication, usually when they try to create a false sense of bad performance, they do through feelings ""I feel you are making too much questions, you should be more independent"" and then ""I feel you are not asking questions and are confusing about what it needs to be done""...So, just focus in to the facts, I did X because you said Z, what we need to change to improve the process?

Be professional, be cordial, but more than anything cover your ass, document everything, and prepare yourself to play counteroffense so that you can at least make their life difficult.PS: using the specific term ""hostile work environment"" is key because that is HR code for ""I can sue you"". Calling her a bad boss, saying she's mean, toxic, bad at her job, unfair - all of that doesn't matter if HR doesn't think you can get them in trouble. But if they think that - were they to fire you - you might hit them with a lawsuit for wrongful termination and hostile work environment stuff?

Have a fun getaway with the wife/kids (costs range from ""gas money"" to ""whole ass resort package"")2. Work on a house project to completion (costs range from ""$0"" to a ""whole ass deck"")3. Work on a code project to completion (pretend I'm still a developer for a bit)4. Fuck off into the wilderness for a week or twoThen my battery is fully charged, and I'm good to go for several months. When I'm feeling burned out, I use my PTO or talk with my boss to see if it's OK to step away from ""important manager stuff"" to pursue #3 for a little bit. Then I get paid to recharge and didn't need to spend my PTO.Also, >5 months worth of expenses in a savings account at all times.

I don't have a clearance, so I can't speak to the cleared side, but in public trust realm, I have not loved government contracting. There's no one specific thing I can really point to because all of my experiences have been so different. I'll just that that I enjoyed working the private sector and even state government's more.One benefit of working for government contractors though is job is kind of expected, so after you get a few years of experience under your belt, you have lots of opportunities to get a new job with a big pay bump. And if you land in a shithole, you can usually find an exit by just being open to new opportunities on linkedIn.As for the weather, yeah summers can be swampy. DC was literally built on a swamp. It's not the most humid place I've been, but it's close. The other thing is if you are from a place that gets real winter, we have no idea what to do in snow. We talk about snow storms that the midwest would barely register as storms, like hurricanes. A couple of inches of snow at rush hour can cripple our roadways. To be fair, so can rain, and clear skies...basically, whatever the weather, someone infront of you has never seen it before and is freaking out.Driving here is also pretty terrible in general. We collect the world's worst drivers and put them on overcrowded roads. The metro is fine. I used it when I worked in DC. I didn't love it when I had to drive to the Vienna station, pay for parking and then ride into the city. I've never did that math, but I do wonder is I should have just paid for parking downtown. The cost of living is also quite high. Rent and house prices have been obscene since the 90s. Laidoff federal workers choosing to leave might make a difference, but it will be relatively small.On the other hand, the public schools tend to be good, and because we have so many bored government workers around, there are more types of recreation than you would think. The choice of activities I have within an hour of my house is insane. They're all crowded, and none of them are world class, but still, if I want to take up a hobby outside my house, there's some place relatively close where I can go. TL;DR; NoVa is fine.

The culture at the big tech company I’m at now is not like that at all, it’s more like the coworkers are competition and everyone is trying to outwork the next guy.

I feel like it’s all due to the “pip” culture, and I don’t really get why they do it. One final thing I’ll add is even though I work a lot, I still feel like I get plenty of free time.

The compliments were crazy like, Ah you're angel, you're so smart, you're so handsome, etc etc. It was a LOT from different people and honestly I felt like a celebrity there.Japan has a heiarchy of age and mentorship. Japanese call this like a Senpai-Kouhai relationship. Basically they view their job as an older person or mentor to guide you, treat you, and sort of mold you as best they can. It can be weird from a westerner perspective because work time is work time and there's no ""relationship"" besides training you. I personally wouldn't be alarmed by this behavior but I'd still maintain distance. A lot of these type of people are fascinated with having foreign friends. it's largely a selfish relationship for them. I often felt like a token foreigner friend and many girls wanted to date me just for being a foreigner. I sense this guy is the same. The other part of this is that a lot of these people use you as a way to feel some sort of acceptance outside their own culture. Like, oh I have a foreign friend that accepts me, I'm cool out of my own normal societal circumstance. Just be polite and keep saying I can't do X or Y.

Have faith in that if it feels like everything else is failing.Your employability may also be better than you feel.

This would include guarantees about things like how much they’ll work over that 4 year period.You’ll need to make sure that the shareholder agreement outlines what happens if a shareholder becomes a liability.Ideally they offer you a reverse vesting deal as a founder. All your shares vest immediately at the price today and if you leave or lose your shares for some reason the shares that would not be vested at that point are forcibly sold back to the company. Sometimes the company buys them back at a predetermined value (often FMV at the time of issuance) but other times that’s not possible for a number of reasons and you may get a different price if this occurs.Essentially you want guarantees for yourself and from the other shareholders with a significant stake.If their company is only worth $1m today then a 2% stake is only $20k. Thats about $5k/yr or around $5/hr at 20 hours a week. That’s not really worth it as it’s impossible to know what the future may hold.

If your soon to be wife loves her job, you love your city, you're planning on having kids soon, etc... then that will need to take precedence. That might mean that you let Jan come and try to find a job in the meantime and tighten your belt a bit. Once kids come into the mix, you need to think long and hard about where you want to park for a second. Do you have any networks from college days? Is your manager understanding of the situation? If so, I would have a blunt conversation with them and ask them if you can use them as a reference or if they know anyone around the area that's hiring. Anyone you know that might be at a company, possibly hiring? The market is not great right now, and companies know this, so they're pulling whatever bullshit they can for attrition (my company is doing the same thing although maybe a softer version of yours). To answer your question about your current knowledge, you might want to give yourself more credit. I doubt someone goes into a role for 4 years and ""everyone else is doing the work"". Have you received any promotions since starting? If that's the case, then you probably did something to get there. But the fact that you know Kotlin and Java is good, the industry is full of Java roles. So you could shift to Java (or C#... they're similar enough) and see what's out there. At the end of the day, it's business to companies, but personal to you. This stuff can be really hard mentally and emotionally. I can't tell you which path to take, but if it were me, I would first ask yourself if you want to stay in mobile. If so, then focus on learning the rest of the process. Read up your code base, pick up more Kotlin, learn JetPack Composer, etc. If not, then consider a shift into learning more about Java and/or C# then try your luck there.Most importantly, talk to your partner about the move. If they will be happier where you are, then just explain that you'll be tightening belts until you can find something else.

It’s easy to feel like you need to chase every cert or language, but that often leads to burnout without real progress. Instead, reflect on what you enjoyed most from your tech role. Was it the problem solving side of coding, or the precision and detail that comes with testing? If testing was your comfort zone, roles in QA automation or SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) could be a natural pivot. These roles often let you leverage your coding skills while staying close to quality focused work.If you’re craving something new, IT certifications can definitely open doors but you’ll want to be strategic. For example, if you go the cloud route, AWS Solutions Architect Associate or Azure Fundamentals → Administrator can get you noticed quickly. If you lean toward cybersecurity, CompTIA Security+ is a great starting point and pairs well with your testing mindset. The key is to pick one lane, commit, and build a portfolio around it. Whether that’s small projects on GitHub, automation scripts, or even freelance gigs on platforms like Upwork. Freelancing can also be a good bridge though it won’t always be glamorous, but it’s real world experience that helps fill the gap on your resume.If you can structure the next 6–12 months around one clear goal say, “transition into cloud roles” or “move into automation testing” you’ll find it much easier to cut through the fog.

Be able to convince the other side you know everything from ground up and you are a rock star. And sound super organized.>I've never considered idempotency or what a hash ring is or what golden invariants are. I've never thought about CAP theorem, just that available and consistent is good. Requirements get passed to us by product managers, we never make them from a 5 minute conversation with the BA or stakeholder.This is what my friends (senior engineers) at Google told me.""We just use Spanner for everything. For all practical purposes, Spanner is highly available, highly consistent (basically instant so the 'eventual' part is just theory for practical purposes), and infinite scale.""So ya... now, CAP theorem states that in a real world, we have to choose Availability or Consistency as first priority. And that is true. But generally the idea is if you are dealing with money especially in banks, then choose Consistency. Otherwise, basically all the time Availability is fine.In the real world? Unless you work at Amazon/Google scale, you are going to use postgres/mysql anyways. And even at those big tech firms sql databases are used in many teams.As for what kind of databases I worked over so far: postgresql, mysql, mongodb, cassandraAlmost all companies using MongoDB are using MongoDB for no reason than ""it's webscale"" meme. It's tech debt. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs)Use case for Cassandra/DynamoDb is niche overall.Scale? Dude, sql databases have run the world forever. Credit cards before the days of DynamoDB worked everywhere around the world. Everyone was swiping left and right. Big banks hold records of swipes, withdrawals, deposits, etc globally. Those dumb Youtube videos during covid by these juniors trying to gain views about high writes == nosql (kind of true but whatever)? sql databases can when writes are properly batched in theory go over a million insert per second though in reality, let's say 10k insert per second. 10k insert per second is 10\^5 \* 10\^5 sec a day = 10\^10 inserts a day aka 10 billion rows a day.Schemaless? Unless you are dealing with e-commerce, fraud, machine learning, etc., you can shove in your metadata to JSONB on postgresql.ACID vs BASE? DynamoDB supports ACID as well. You can have sql databases have BASE like properties. Especially mysql in which you can change engine.Biggest differences are really nosql databases tend to be LSM tree oriented while sql databases tend to be B tree oriented. But DynamoDB on its sort key is B tree oriented as well.Sharding? SQL can have auto sharding. Though it is true in practice (this part I agree since I have not used auto sharding in my jobs) you do have to worry about sharding on SQL. But like what? A few days a year or two for the team once everythings set up? Ya, nonissue.It's all a clownfest at this point with each databases trying to emulate parts of the other database as well.**System Design Interview crap made more sense back when hardware was limited. Nowadays, we can have Redis instance with over half a terrabyte RAM. Many times, we can just chug the entire useful parts of database to the whole Redis.** Now caching? Lol wait till you learn DynamoDB handles that for you if you are willing to pay extra. DynamoDB comes with caching by a click of a button so you don't need to handle a separate Redis instance.

If you need help then that means you grew so much that it's a successful problem to have.Most people are working at mature firms. A properly run mature firm should have had infra team do all the tooling so product side engineering can just ship.System Design Interview is just another theatre like Leetcode Interview.

For instance, you can use dynamodb for banking related stuff which need ACID transactions. That was not something people thought a decade ago and so forth.Or given time constraints or familiarity or complexity or cost or whatever, you would prefer Y.

I am a fullstack engineer and the biggest trouble I had with personal projects is the designs of my pages. I now can get AI to come up with a theme, a design, a layout, an admin dashboard, a home page and everything for me to use as a basis to build on and bounce my own ideas off.Although I think great design is unbelievably valuable, I think good design is fairly self evident. I mean, I can tell you if a site is well designed - so can my mother. I dont think its difficult for AI to grasp this concept and produce designs for you. Almost all sites have at the very least the same layout; search bar at the top, nav bar top right/left and so on. Beyond this and the small design changes between different sites, I cant see design needing to be done in the way it is now. My team at work no longer needs the amount of designers we have - we got AI to design us a new view based on our existing views and it looked great.The only exception to this (as always there are exceptions) will be exceptional designers in my option. Those designers who come up with new, unique almost game changing designs followed by many. AI wont be able to do this as easily, because AI needs a basis to train on. For example, in the late 2010's we got the gradient design you see on Stripe, with the scrolling animations as you scroll down. I think this design was game changing within the game of design, and so many sites followed this (I dont even know if Stripe were first tbh).I feel like if youre that good, original and can constantly change/push the bar, you'll be fine.

n91tsce,"you should 100% accept. don't make risky decisions in this market, like rejecting a perfectly good offer in hopes of *maybe* getting a better one. if you do get a better offer, you can reevaluate your plan of action then - whether it be negotiating different start/end dates, rejecting the other offer, ending your co-op early, reneging your co-op, etc. all that depends on the specifics of the situation, which is all hypothetical as of now. take what you can get",joliestfille,2025-08-16 18:34:18,10,cscareerquestions,t3_1ms2e22,False,

They had no problem with it or whatsoever. In your official contract, there should be a section about termination, which usually mentions that you can end your contract early by informing them 2 weeks prior of your termination. I don’t think there’s any cons if you perform consistently throughout the term, like I am still in good terms with them and they did mention if they will still take me in future terms.
