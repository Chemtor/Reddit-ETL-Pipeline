I spend 75% of my time writing 1000 line python scripts that are either complex one-off multisystem data pulls or building custom pipelines for merging data from those systems in a deployable way. 10% of my time is spent providing guidance on data systems, admin on our business applications and dev on functions internal to those. 10% is spent doing huge data cleaning jobs (our data is a complete shitshow).

We took Airflow and dbt out of the repo and into their own, and man, we paid a bit of a price - but it was worth the initial velocity.Looking back, it's almost like making the Conway's law work for you: we had a poor, immature organization communication structure in the data engineering team, so mirror that structure in multiple repos.

n83iumi,"I think you are using ""surrogate"" in a different sense than I would consider conventional.If you are constructing your primary key determjnistically from one or more columns, then that is effectively a natural key, you're just doing some of the databases work manually.Surrogate keys are keys which are not derived from the data of the entity. The idea is that they identify the row as a first-class thing in its own right. This is useful if the data model (or your understanding of the data) changes. For example, many things which _should_ be natural keys can end up being non-unique in practice due to dirty data, particularly at a large enough scale.Surrogate primary keys have to be unique, but can't rely on the data from the row to provide that uniqueness, so the guarantee that no two rows have the same key had to come from somewhere else. The basic options to guarantee uniqueness are:- Generate keys randomly and check for duplicates- Generate keys randomly from such a large keyspace that collisions are ""unlikely enough""- Generate keys in some way that is mathematically guaranteed never to generate the same key twiceJust about simplest mathematical approach that is guaranteed never to generate the same output twice is an incrementing integer sequence.

n83v18q,"I'll take MSSQL as the example hereYour question is more related on what makes a clustered index. Per default, the primary key is used as the clustered index, but it does not have to be. Anyway, when I say clustered index, you pretty much can think ""primary key"".I won't go to deep here, but essentially, the clustered index is the physical sorting of the table. If the clustered index is sequential, you add a new row, it gets appended at ""the end"". The number sequence is irrelevant, nobody cares, its only used to ensure the sorting order. If your clustered index is not sequential, the new row needs to get added ""in the middle""That will cause something called page splits. With a page split, the data can not be written where it should be, since the 8kb page at that position is full, so instead a pointer to a new page is written there. When querying the data for that row, the page where it should be is read, pointer to other page is found, other page gets read as well. So it is not good for performance.That's why you quite often see maintainance jobs, that rebuild / reorganize the clustered indexes of the entire database, running during some weekend night or something like that.The reason it is common to have that sequence as an integer is, the size. Int32 is 4 byte. Every non clustered index will reference the clustered index, so having a larger field for the clustered index, will bloat the size of all non clustered indexes, which is again bad for performance, since more data gets written / read / cached.That's the gist of why you often read about and see identity columns as clustered index.Why would you not use that:Now here it gets a bit harder, to not write a small book. The clustered index is your physical data on disk. The more efficient you can look up a value given your data access paths, the faster your queries will execute. On a typical OLTP database, you will see 90%+ read traffic, so read access is very important.Lets say you have 100 million rows in your table, that contains a lets say zip code. Lets also say, you usually query by a filter on that zip code. Something along the lines of WHERE zipCode = @@param1 AND .... In that case, for read access, it would likely be a good idea to create a clustered index, with zip code as the first field (you can create a clustered index containing more than one column). Since the search trough the B+ tree can be more efficient that way.If you had an identity as the clustered index, you would create a non clustered index on the zipCode, which works, but after the relevant data is found in the non clustered index, it will have to be looked up in the clustered index to get the actual data. As long as it was not a covering non clustered index. It also depends on data distribution an the statistics on the table, an index is useless if in that example your data is split between two zip codes.You see what I mean by saying, ""hard to not write a small book"" ?Random Guids should only be used in special cases. Massive concurrent users, where you run into hot spots on the ""last page"" data needs to get written to for example (would be called latch contention on mssql), or distributed systems.The reason for that is, that the data ends up essentially unsorted, which is not good, while also causing the page split problem, which creates the need for regular maintenance tasks.I'll try to give a bit of a TLDR on how you should choose your clustered index :* It should be chosen with intent, it is the most powerful tool for performance optimizing on the data modeling level* It should be narrow (small data size)* it should be selective. Think along the lines of a hash table, you don't benefit from a hashtable much, if you end up with two hash buckets, containing 50 million rows. Still a hash table... but you are far from O(1) in such a case.* sequential ID's can work but don't have to. They are rarely ideal, but are better than nothing* Think about how your data gets accessed, and choose the index to best support most of your workload* At least as a health check, keep an eye on your index fragmentation (there are system views for that on mssql, I'm sure there is something like that on any serious database)* The clustered index does not have to be unique! Sql Server, will append a small row identifier if needed behind the scene. It is not a good idea to append a guid in the datamodel* As a default when creating a table, the primary key gets used as the clustered index, that does not have to be done. It is usually a better idea to have a thought out clustered index, instead of just defaulting to the PK. In cases where the PK is not the clustered index, a non clustered index gets created, to ensure uniqueness of said key.Edit: Jesus Christ that ended up as a blog post pretty much, and I tried to be brief...",svtr,2025-08-11 13:23:26,6,dataengineering,t3_1mnaure,False,
n83lghv,"History: initially the database in the late 80's & early 90's, we only had string or int, and the application had to manage PK & FK keys. So often the PK & FK were text based, and this was slow.Some vendors in the DBase III+ era, Foxpro, started copying the popular Informix & SQL-92 ansi standard, to have a database ""engine"" assign the PK key with an auto increment column of type INT. These early DB engines were only 32 bit of course.They allowed the DB engine to lock the table, assign a PK automatically on INSERT based on last value used, write the record, unlock the table. This was seen as a more secure way, since the engine was assigning the key, not the application. Because of course in a network, you get network errors, and the application would often hang or use an incorrect PK causing duplicates.My early DBA days mid-90's was handling duplicates on micro computers and mini computers (like the VAX). A mini computer used ASCII terminals, so everything ran inside 1 computer with a multi-threaded CPU, why they were huge & expensive.Micro computer decentralized the expensive mini computer, and you could use Wordperfect & Lotus 1-2-3, not just a homegrown ERP/WMS/MES application. So all the micro-computer vendors mid-90's offered auto increment with their SQL db engine because the demand was there, CPUs were only 32 bit, and the GUID() or MD5() functions didn't exist yet.Some companies had to use datetime strings instead, like Wall Street, or the UK-France tunnel car tracking system, because auto increment had reached its limit in transactions count.Was still used for lookup tables, like a string PK for a product table, but category, sub-category, color tables used auto inc for PK.Merging data from various systems was a major PITA (duplicate ID #'s with different data) and by the late 90's the auto inc was being abandonned globally for GUID instead, or a datetime string down to the milisecond 5 digits, I've seen both.Then Lo' & Behold, 64 bit CPUs, and now we have BIGINT with MSSQL 2000 in the year 2000, and auto inc came back with a vengeance because who ever hits the 2\^64-1 limit?I blame Microsoft for bringing Auto Inc back to life when it should have died out in 1999 and the Y2K bug.",SirGreybush,2025-08-11 12:25:32,6,dataengineering,t3_1mnaure,False,

Shallow learning curve, juniors can do senior work with it. Supports parallelism etc, it can scale to faster than the tools you mentioned. Much cheaper than the more expensive tool you mentioned (about 1-2% cost, idk about the other tool)1. you can [pseudonymise](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/customising-pipelines/pseudonymizing_columns) before loading. you can even load to a local duckdb and then [sync](https://dlthub.com/blog/datasets2) to your final destination after transforming if you prefer to hash in sql.2.

So go job hunting.**If you don't necessarily want to go job hunting**, then talk to other people, other teams. Not about your team, but about what they want to do and how you can enable them, if you were on their team. If asked, tell people that you see potential to contribute more to the business and that it would give you an opportunity to grow more as an individual as well.**If you can't leave the team**, then the most important thing to do in my opinion is to avoid burning out. That doesn't mean slow down. That means reallocate your time while keeping up the minimum to the team. Burn out is not defined by the amount of work you do. Burn out is defined by setting expectations and failing to meet those expectations. If you define your expectations around the team, like meeting project deadlines, and those deadlines fail to be met, then you will feel burnt out, even if it's not your fault, because you put in effort and failed to receive positive feedback for your efforts.So, set your own expectations, and set them around things that alight with YOU.

There are actually many files I keep locally for personal experimentation that never make it to the repo, which adds another layer of complexity to manage.What really surprised me workflow-wise is how completely I've switched over to using .parquet for everything. The format is just so practical for handling large volumes of textual data with lots of special characters and edge cases that used to give me headaches with CSV. Now I basically run all my data through nail-parquet and keep adding new functions as I bump into new needs.The subcommands I find myself reaching for constantly are `preview`, `drop`, and `select` \- probably use those three in like 80% of my data exploration sessions.

This could work fine if you stay under any rate limits.

I used Looker Studio at my previous company (small company and also used AWS RDS just like yours) and it works fine with the MySQL connector but it’s obvious how well integrated the BigQuery connectors are. One way to possibly improve performance on the RDS is to create separate schema for a makeshift data warehouse. Populate this schema once a day using stored procedures from your transactional tables.

n8oahgw,"Sorry, contract with employer doesn't allow me to, and she sql produced is snowflake-specific (uses as-of joins) I can describe the steps of the algo, though. you start with a collection of events. To make examples simpler we will assume you only have one entity that produces the events, and all rows (events) represent states of that one entity. If the terminology is confusing, just think that event can be pressing a lever to open a door, and the door being open or cloded is a state. let's say event a (little a) causes state A (big a) to begin. If the entity (e.g. door) already was in state A, then it continues to be in that state. Event b causes state B, etc. For further simplification, we will count time in integer numbers 1,2,5,...,8,12,... . In reality time is usually a date, or timestamp, but anything that is orderable can be used here. So assuming our times and events look like this: \`\`\` 1, a 3, a 4, b 5, b 7, a 9, c \`\`\` We have contiguous repetitions of events a and b, and we have non-contiguous repetition of a (at time 7) What we want to get is a table representing the states and their durations state, start-time, end-time \`\`\` A, 1, 4 B, 4, 7 A, 7, 9 C, 9, Null \`\`\` We kept the non-contiguous repetitions, but ignored the contiguous ones.This is close to our real end-result, so how can we get from there to here?First find all consecutive pairs. More formally - pair each row with the row that has smallest time which is still bigger than this row's time. This can be done with a self-join (or two), join + window functions or as-of join.Get rid of all result rows, where the event is the same, we only want transitions.We'll call this data set Transitions. \`\`\` 3, a, 4, b 5, b, 7, a 7, a, 9, c \`\`\`From transitions we can take the earlier time + event in a separate CTE - these will be our state endings.Yes, endings, even though we thought of them as the earlier ones. Since we listed state transitions - then it follows that the last event representing some state will happen BEFORE the first event in the next state.Also, from transitions, we take the later time + event and call them Beginnings, due to the same reasoning.Eagle eyed reader will have noticed that we are missing the first event of the first state. We should add that to Beginnings (e.g. with a union all)Now that we have beginning and endings of each state we join each beginning with the next consecutive ending (again, smallest time, that is larger / later than that if a particular beginning)the time of beginning is the island start time, time of ending is the island end time. the state, that corresponds to the beginning event is the state of the island.Of course that was a simplified example. In reality, the state is an ensemble of various fields, but these can be hashed into one, or compared one to one.Usually we also deal with more than one entity (think many doors and their corresponding levers), but to accommodate that, you just group your CTEs by the columns that constitute the entity identifier.",Dry-Aioli-6138,2025-08-14 16:15:21,2,dataengineering,t1_n8lcn6x,True,

One of the big ones is that Fabric Warehouse uses Parquet as it's on disk format accessible in OneLake - no more ""best performance or least duplication"" tradeoff.Why wouldn't I blame Fabric for Synapse not seeing much feature development?Well, designs of Synapse Dedicated and Synapse Serverless respectively had limitations that weren't practical to address without a major rearchitecting under the hood. Synapse Dedicated, for example, is the result of over a decade of incremental improvements that did not change its fundamental architecture (APS/PDW was released in 2012); we basically took it as far as it could go. So we had to do some fairly major rearchitecting to make something fundamentally better than that; the result is Fabric. Could we have called it Synapse v2 or something? Maybe. But it still would have been a migration to move to it, so I'm not sure that would have been any better. And marketing isn't my area :D.

While snowflake can handle this, many systems (e.g. BI tools) have severe performance issues with varchar(max) columns.My view is that you need good reasons to move to iceberg, not good reasons to stick with snowflake native - which should be the default option.Also, if you are looking at having multiple engines querying iceberg, the catalog is not going to support enterprise-grade features. For example, if you tag columns for tag-based masking policies in snowflake those tags are not in the catalog available to other engines - so you would still need a separate masking solution in every system.",NW1969,2025-08-09 21:03:02,3,dataengineering,t3_1mlzcv6,False,

Which means that you don’t have to actually load data in Snowflake you just have to query your iceberg table which probably live in your S3 buckets and you pay Snowflake for compute.And as you grow, you might want to do some more transformation in the lake yourself with your own engine and only load final product into snowflake.In the end it depends on what you wanna build and who you want to pay.Snowflake is an amazing tool, but you pay for the amazing features.If you build your lake and transformations yourself that’s a lot of engineering salary to make that happen.I think those question start to make sense when you start getting big, but not before.You can also create your Iceberg tables directly on your Kafka topics to simplify querying data.

Once the data comes in raw file, you can very well do data transformation for reporting and other down stream use cases. Suggesting a lakehouse like Iceberg and ingestion system like OLake majorly because they support schema evolution out of the box.

This is kinda the basis of stuff like Shaw's ""learn `$foo` the hard way"" where part of the point is to hand-type code just for the muscle memory.2. Sometimes you need to give stuff time. As [a blog post about monad tutorials puts it](https://byorgey.wordpress.com/2009/01/12/abstraction-intuition-and-the-monad-tutorial-fallacy/), sometimes you _need_ that week of struggling to get something. That includes staring at clouds, sleeping, taking walks and so on. Part of problem-solving, including programming, is just letting an idea mature in your mind, and taking breaks. Trying to explain it to others, including to rubber ducks (""rubber ducking""), is also a good way of improving understanding.3. Learning more than one programming language, and preferably significantly different programming languages, is good. It's kinda like stereoscopic vision, where you can glimpse a general idea hiding behind two somewhat different implementations.

At my university this is offered as several lower-division classes, but due to the course content and lack of connection to higher abstractions already learned, students often fail to appreciate how important these concepts are to understanding programming intuitively.What made it click for me was simply internalizing that programs are really just two things - data, and transformations on data.

n7tfatc,"I upvoted because I think this is a good discussion, but your post comes off really arrogant. If you were to re-write this, I would phrase it as a question, and not assume you know more about how to teach students than the CS Department of your University. It's good to be curious, it's good to question things, but remember they've likely been doing this a lot longer, and they likely have an answer as to why they choose XYZ first. I have a few thoughts for why they might teach Syntax first. **Easy Victories lead to greater motivation -** Almost invariably, everyone's first program is 'Hello World'. This is a very easy first step that teaches you some basic syntax, the basics of how your IDE work, and the basics of runtime/compiling. If your code doesn't compile, you have a syntax error, that's likely your first bug! And it's easy to solve. This will quickly become trivially easy, but you had to learn it at some point, and if you can see that the basics of coding is no harder than installing a few programs and writing a sentence with good grammar, that might be enough to get a few students who were on the fence to stay in the game. **Most people learn what to do, and then how to do it, then why you do it -** You likely don't have kids, but my daughter is learning to walk and talk right now. She knows 'danger hot' and that the trash cans & toilets are 'Ew'. As she gets older we'll start filling in the gaps of why these things are dangerous & yucky, but it doesn't do us a whole lot of good to tell a one and a half year old about germs because even if she could learn the word, she doesn't know what it means.Bringing this concept back to programming, One of the first apps taught outside of CS degrees is building an API with CRUD operations. The REST routing concepts are pretty much set in stone at this point, and don't require a lot of creativity, so it's pretty easy to give newbies a tutorial and help them through the concepts as they work up the project. **Yes this is eventually going to cause a learning plateau -** So yes when you get into algorithmic thinking, assignment operators, functions that pass a value, etc. you're going to hit a wall. This is not easy stuff and you are going to struggle with this as you rewire your brain. But as you practice, you are going to hit a point where it clicks, and when that happens you're going to be glad you have all of your syntax memorized because it will fall into place easier, rather than having to go back and learn it all at that point.",JanitorOPplznerf,2025-08-09 18:39:03,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mlnc7i,False,

The port is dictating that you can plug any usb cable/device into it and ""something"" happens, at a minimum the device could probably charge. Well the port remains fixed, but the device you plug in could change, it could be a phone, a watch, a controller, a keyboard, etc. Or another analogy is a car, you could probably swap out the engine or the muffler or something, Idk I'm not an expert, but basically you still have a car, it still is this big carriage that can transport itself.In your OOP program, you could for example have an object which is a component that can be responsible for interacting with a database, for example. Let's call it the DBManager. Now, normally your app logic would say ""hey, DBManager, get me the account info for user x"" or something. So that would work as expected, but now you could also for instance write a unit test that says ""ok the app will handle a request, and it will go to the DBManager, but instead we're gonna plug in a fake DBManager which just serves up some canned response, it doesn't have to query a real database"". We just swap out the components in the test only, without having to hack up all the code, and we are able to test our app logic without dealing with the database specifically.This, to me, is the essence of the types of problems OOP is aiming to solve.

One way you could build this (I haven't looked at the Express implementation) is using OOP and the Builder pattern. You could store the chain of behaviour as state on an object, e.g. an array of objects containing callback functions and metadata or similar, and use Builder to repeatedly add to that state at runtime. The mutations happen through those methods mentioned above. Once all the top-level calls have finished, Express has an object that can be given a request to process, and some code associated with the object can dispatch the correct series of calls based on conditional logic over the received request.It contrasts with viewing code and data separately like in other paradigms.

Once code (for short) goes in a specific pipeline, it ends up to the desired location. A pipeline could be created to provide new versions to a test environment, or to a beta version, or to prod. There is no fixed recipe but its frequent to see test/staging/beta/production.The role of the devops is to try and automatise that. So, for instance, when devs deliver a new version of the code, the magic behind happens and the cogs spin until the new version of the application is delivered to the clients.The job is highly technical and highly complex. Depending on the needs, the team can require high technical expertises in multiple different domains (security, kubernetes/dockers, azure/aws/… cloud vendors, …). It can be as simple as being a ""clickops"" (the devops guy goes on a cloud vendor like azure or aws website and clicks/fills forms manually) up to a more fully automated process (also possible with cloud vendors, terraform,…).So, if you wanted to learn visually something about how your devops team functions, you gotta be more precise.But I think management 101 would tell you to learn directly from your team, if good communication is possible.",Merry-Lane,2025-08-11 12:41:55,10,learnprogramming,t3_1mnate2,False,

Honestly there's probably three things I'm forgetting.I've watched the Harvard video and the professor is very good. He makes the class easy and fun. But he's also fast, he assumes his students are Ivy League level and have read the source materials, so he may lose you if you aren't pausing regularly and checking documentation and course materials.As for Python or C++; if this is pre-university, I think Python is PERFECT for you. It'll be much easier and it will set you up well to learn another language and follow along better at Uni. You'll have plenty of time to switch languages over the next four years. Keep in mind C++ may not even be the language your game will be built in. C++ would be for something like Unreal Engine, while C# would be for Unity, and Minecraft was originally in Java. So it's not like you can make any game ever with C++, well you could, but it's not necessarily the best choice.And yes as others have said, make sure you're WRITING code, not just watching videos.",JanitorOPplznerf,2025-08-09 16:52:18,10,learnprogramming,t3_1mltl8b,False,

n7tsz6t,"I think whether Codefinity is worth it really depends on your starting point and learning style. I took Codefinity after dabbling in Python on free platforms like freeCodeCamp and YouTube tutorials, and for me, the biggest value was its structured, hands-on approach. A lot of online courses dump all the theory up front, but Codefinity mixes in small, interactive projects from the start, which kept me engaged and actually helped me remember the concepts better.One thing I noticed compared to something like CS50 is that Codefinity feels more guided and less overwhelming. CS50 is amazing, but it can be intense for beginners because it covers a lot of computer science theory. Codefinity, on the other hand, is more focused on practical Python skills — working with data, building mini-apps, and slowly introducing libraries like Pandas or NumPy in context.It’s true some lessons can feel repetitive if you already know the basics, but for absolute beginners, that repetition actually builds confidence. The quizzes and small coding tasks at the end of each section made it easier for me to track progress. I also liked that they emphasize applying what you learn — I built a simple web scraper and a basic text-based game during the course, which were huge confidence boosters.Price-wise, it’s not the cheapest, but if you compare it to some coding bootcamps or other subscription-based platforms, it’s reasonable — especially if you grab a discount. The key is to actually follow through; no course is “worth it” if you just skim it.If your goal is to move from understanding Python syntax to building your own projects, Codefinity can absolutely help bridge that gap. If you’re already at an intermediate level, you might outgrow it quickly, but you could still benefit from its more advanced project modules.For me, pairing Codefinity with side projects (like Raspberry Pi experiments in robotics) made it much more valuable. If anyone’s wondering “Is Codefinity legit?” — I’d say yes, it’s a solid, beginner-friendly platform for learning Python in a structured, project-focused way.",potty__mouth,2025-08-09 19:57:07,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mlmu16,False,

The lessons are laid out in a way that makes them easy to follow, and the gradual progression from basic concepts to small projects helped me feel more comfortable applying what I learned. I appreciated how each topic had examples that connected to real use cases instead of staying purely theoretical. Some sections did feel slow, especially if you already know the basics, but I think that pace works well for reinforcing ideas. For me, it helped to go over familiar topics because it meant I didn’t have to constantly look things up when working on my own projects. The mini projects were one of the highlights since they gave a sense of accomplishment without being overwhelming. They also made it easier to remember concepts because I could connect them to something I had actually built. I wouldn’t say Codefinity is perfect the interface is simple and the pace might be too slow for advanced learners but for someone who wants structure and consistent practice, it’s effective. I also think combining it with something hands-on, like Raspberry Pi projects, can make a big difference.

Then go through old PRs to make sense of what work has been done before you came along and tried to contribute, and when that is all over, just take on a ticket and start working through it.

Add basic tests, use basic GitHub actions, create a CONTRIBUTING.md. Then create an issue, assign it to yourself. Complete the issue and submit a PR like it's someone else's project. 3. Review your own PR like you're a maintainer and approve it when it looks good. At this point you at least understand the process of contributing to open source, now it's about finding issues you can actually handle.4. Find a small project that has some good first issue tags.

In these contexts, projects and open-source contributions can help, but HR filters simply will block applications without formal education.In contrast, startups, scale-ups and smaller companies often prioritize skills, portfolio projects and interview performance over formal credentials.Many US tech companies (see Google, IBM, Apple) do have officially dropped strict degree requirements, though competition means degrees still give an advantage. Also countries with high demand for developers will sometimes hire based on bootcamp training or self-taught experience.If you look globally, there’s a shift toward skills-based hiring in tech. Portfolios, GitHub contributions and competitive programming results (from LeetCode, HackerRank) can open doors. Networking and referrals indeed do often bypass degree filters.Without a degree, you will need a strong portfolio, relevant certifications, and networking to compete. In markets with “degree fever” (as one commenter called it), getting past automated HR filters is harder. In more flexible markets, you can get hired without a degree, with proof of skills and good interview performance.But even with a degree and relevant certifications, you will still have to prove that you have been able to apply the knowledge and expertise you acquired, combined with quantifying the use and profit your work has. Nobody will give you a high paying job just for waving with degrees and certain alone. Amassing a ton of certs without any real work done and lacking a strong focus will also do the opposite, making you look like a “qualifications hoarder”.",American_Streamer,2025-08-12 03:45:34,2,learnprogramming,t1_n87p1ct,False,

I would start big projects and stop because it almost felt like a chore even though CS is my passion, the reason was because they were simply too big of a project for my own head. So what did I do? I broke the big projects down into manageable components and started building each component one by one. I treated each component as its own project and it was much more manageable that way to finish them and enjoy building something. For example, ive been developing a game engine for the past couple of years so i split it into multiple components.

Each of your 4 sections has a very different width, it just looks off-putting. Make some kind of a wrapper and make sure all sections fit and take up as much space in it. OR you could embrase the chaos and do something unique, but you wont be doing that with a typical SPA with 4 vertical sections, if you want to be unique, change up the layout entirely- I get the idea of having one section on a screen, but that doesnt really work well for bigger resolutions. Responsiveness doesnt just mean that nothing breaks and overflows, it needs to be proportional and usable on all devices- As cool as the nav is, it suffers from poor UX, because its highly unclear what it is, and once you click on it to figure out, at that point you dont even need it. One thing that came to my mind is putting it vertical on the left side for example. That way you can show the section names on hover, and keep your original design. - Same UX applies to your technologies. Always write in words what the technologies are. This helps searchability and makes it clear for people who do not know what a whale with boxes on it or an elephant mean.- 2/3 of your listed projets require login (or something adjacent), no one is gonna do it.

Often at the beginning it's not clear what should be spelled out explicitly, vs what's built into the OS, vs what's built into the language, vs what you should import a package for. You'll build familiarity and comfort with this over time. For example, I used to TA an operating system lab where everything was written in C. It was PAINFUL for most students to internalize that all file IO would be handled by system calls, or that the computer knows what folder it should be referring to by referencing the file system relative to the folder the console or executable was launched from. This is, in some sense, the point of hello world. ""Oh wow, I wrote 4 lines of code and computer somehow knew to interface with my keyboard and monitor (not to mention the hardware of the computer itself). How is that even possible?"" If you spend long enough writing code, you will internalize the reasons why this is possible in a way that will have made it seem obvious in retrospect. But it wasn't, and it isn't, and you could spend an arbitrary amount of time learning more details if you really wanted to. Your goal for now should at least be to get to the point where you build up an expectation for what will be abstracted away for you and what you need to explicitly write into your code.You also mentioned some discomfort with dictionaries.

I'm not trying to sound like a smartass or anything, but sometimes the most simple route can be the best! You can learn stuff like design patterns and algorithms and stuff, but if you feel like you are too heavily reliant on AI I'd suggest trying to make a simple project (like a sudoku or a simple calculator ) and just turn off copilot or anything of the likes and just start googling (the AI from Google also doesn't count) learning to use documentation and efficient research helps a lot for becoming a better programmer especially if you try to dissect your problem in smaller bites and start to get hang of how you could figure out problems by pure logic it will then only make you stronger in coding when you do allow yourself to use AI. But practising is the best medicine imo. You seem like a smart individual but don't get yourself twisted over achieving stuff like becoming a 10x developer, I'm guessing a part of having that amount of skill is also part of just loving to code and doing it a lot (of course there are cases of people who just inhale knowledge and have such a robust logical mind that it comes easy to them but that is besides the point) and if you can think of the logic how to tackle problems during coding before even touching your keyboard then you're on the right track (not a must but is nice) coding is just logical thinking.

If someone just wanted to vibe code their way into software that's going to be riddled with problems that's probably a different story.Assuming AI is going to reach the point where it's actually useful at scale then you'll want to be in a position where you can still read, debug, and modify whatever code the various models you use will output.At the moment AI isn't really a net benefit for a lot of companies or projects that are rather large, but realistically with the amount of investment they've seen they likely will be. To clarify a bit, they're decent at writing a number of things, but I've also seen them do a number of dumb things that cost more time than they've saved.The other rather significant problem is that while you can use them to build a number of things by piecing things together it starts to fail when you have to debug even relatively small programs. Even if you've all the features enabled to have it try to analyze, run, and test a program it will still often fail somewhere. Though it will completely confidently proclaim that what it wrote it works properly when it definitely doesn't. I've seen this just trying to get it write unit tests for things that are only mildly complicated. Other times the project is just too big to fit in the context window. A bit of an anecdote here, but I still find it humorous seeing certain models try to run code (not written using Python) in a Python interpreter even when you explicitly told it not to.I expect we'll see a shift from monolithic to more microservice based programs to help meet AI in the middle, but we're not there across the industry today.",Serenity867,2025-08-14 21:17:17,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mqda0b,False,

Create tight feedback loops. Run your code often.2. When experimenting or debugging, create hypothesis and then systematically test them3. Write more documentation, learn to tell the difference between good documentation and bad documentation.To create tight feedback loops, you need to have a very short time between when you've written a bit of code, and find out if it's working or not. There are a lot of good strategies for this, and you can mix and match them according to your needs. A few I like are: Static types, tell you a lot of information about your program's correctness at compile time. REPL driven development, run snippets of code in a REPL to get immediate feedback on whether they're working as you're developing more complex systems. Good testing practices, writing tests as you work let you run the test suite as a very good way to get fast feedback on your code. When coding, I start to get nervous if I've gone more than a few minutes without running some of the code I'm writing.For creating hypothesis, I see way too many new developers just randomly change things whenever they get stuck. If you can't clearly communicate why you think the change will fix a problem, or what the expected result of a change is, that's a sign you need to take a step back and do some thinking / learning. It takes discipline, but forming explicit hypotheses and then testing them drives you to actually understand the how and why of your code.Writing good documentation doesn't mean just adding comments to your code, but thinking about how other users of your functions / classes / projects will use them, and giving them all the necessary information to be successful. This means beginner guides, project overviews, as well as function / class level documentation.

There were a few milestones I do remember, though: First, when I learned to focus on projects over practice, programming started to come much more naturally to me. Second, when I learned the concepts of software engineering, I started to view programming as an end rather than some thing on its own (when it became a medium for a story like English in your analogy).It was a continuous process, but I can't really quantify how skilled I was at the time, because I wasn't doing the same thing enough to compare over time.To go into domains a little:The process will be different for every domain, as programming is just means to an end. This means learning how to learn is a step in its own. You're probably best just looking for an online community of software engineers with experience and asking there (forums, discords, etc), or just Googling it and hoping you find results. Examples:Banking and financial processing are extremely heavy on the security, regulations, and infrastructure side of things, so that's where most of your research/investment goes- under the hood I'd imagine most banks etc use very similar software, all just making secure API calls to one-another. Your learning resources are going to be regulations and industry insights to the current norms. Your only hope to breaking into the market is probably innovation (doing something known, just cheaper or higher quality).Comparatively, something like game development would be the opposite. You're creating a lot of unique systems; usually without significant regard for standards/security. I.e. outside of specific cases, there's not really one preferred solution.

That thing could knock my eyeballs out. I wasn't using my brain for anything at the time, so I would get up in the middle of the night and spend a couple hours playing around with it. Eventually I started writing code in Amiga Basic. Then I realized that Basic sucked, and I bought an Amiga C compiler, and eventually a debugger. Then it occurred to me that with these newfound skills, I might be able to stop delivering furniture. Actually... I delivered some desks to a warehouse in Phoenix where they were working on the first really successful map program for PCs. Can't remember what it was called. I tried to make an appointment to deliver some more desks the next day, and one of the guys there said in sort of a lofty, sophisticated voice, ""I shouldn't be disturbed tomorrow, I'll be writing code."" That was one of the coolest things I had ever heard.So at that point I wanted to be a real programmer. I started applying for jobs. Nothing happened. Then I thought ""Maybe if I SEND these people my code..."" It was a stupid idea, but it got me a couple of interviews. I went to the first interview, but they were already mad at me because I hadn't put enough postage on my printout. The second time I sent code out I put plenty of postage on it, and they hired me for Customer Support because the code I sent was event-driven UI, and that's where they were going. No more moving furniture.So after a week of doing Customer Support, I went and told the guy in charge of programming department, ""Hey, I found a bug in the code."" And he literally said, ""Well, fix it."" So I fixed it. And then I just jumped in the deep end. Eventually they put me in the programming dept, but didn't replace me in Customer Support. So I just kept doing both jobs. After a year or so, they hired somebody for Customer Support and started giving me raises. Really, that company was a terrific place to Be All You Could Be. I just wish I had realized that. Because after 10 years, I quit, looking for something better. I didn't realize that there were WAY worse places I could be. Had to learn the hard way.I doubt that this story can help you. Things are different now. Back then, there was a terrible shortage of programmers. Now it's a glut. Also, I could do wonders with copy of Petzold's Programming Windows, a DOS 4.0 manual, and some DB stuff.

It was used in famous systems like the Apple II series, the Commodore ViC20, C64, C128 (where also a Zilog Z-80 CPU was used along), and even in NES systems. It is a well documented architecture with plenty available Assemblers, Disassemblers, emulators, tutorials/courses, etc.So, if you don't have a particular goal in mind, and maybe want to dive a little into retro computing, then, the 6502 architecture is the way to go.I started with the Zilog Z-80 CPU as this was the architecture my home computer used way back in the 1980s. Also wasn't too difficult to get into.Another option would be, if you are interested in microcontrollers, embedded programming, to go with the Intel 8031/8051/8080 CPU architecture, which somewhat is the predecessor of the Intel 8086 CPU.

n8bs0gj,"Nand2Tetris is basically a survey of CMPE, covering hardware through compilers and operating systems (which brings it back around to CS). If you want a better understanding of digital logic and how it's used to assemble a functioning computer, it's a good course and fairly easy to follow in a self-study manner. And it's a survey, you'll want to follow it up with actual compiler, OS, or computer architecture courses afterward but you'll have a better foundation to start them.SICP is a CS textbook that kind of tackles things from the other direction, though also gets to the point of building a compiler for a simulated register machine. It does not really get down into the hardware logic quite like Nand2Tetris does. If you want a better conceptual understanding of how software is evaluated, SICP is a good course. It's important to keep in mind it's context though, it was intended for first year students at MIT who would also be taking (or have taken) courses in calculus, physics, and EE topics so many of the examples and exercises relate back to that. Section 3.5 Streams (which also introduces the concepts of promises and implements them) has examples of using streams for simulations of electric circuits, for instance. They don't always explain the math that they expect students to know, so you may need to devise some of your own exercises or go and study a bit outside SICP to progress on all the exercises.On that last point, SICP is somewhat less self-contained because of the context it was intended for, but is still a very good textbook overall.

The classes are big and cover a lot of ground. Don't waste too much time reading things that do not directly relate to the exact thing you're dealing with. No point in distracting yourself with other details of a class.If you're not sure how to apply the class in actual software, just google 'Qt QWhateverClass example'.

n8jes53,"Two communities on Reddit to check out:- r/programminglanguages- r/compilers (I just saw you also posted there)Regarding languages, someone asked a similar question on another forum I frequent recently and my answer there is the same here:The language mostly doesn't matter. You can build a compiler in pretty much any language. The advantage *some* languages have are with respect to:1. Parsing libraries or tools like parser generators.2. Backend support if you don't want to implement code generation yourself. LLVM is a pretty popular one to use, and you'll want language bindings to it in whatever language you use so that may limit you.But, if you're building the full compiler, just use a language you know, or a language you want to learn. I've written compilers and interpreters in C, Java, SML, Scheme (Racket, but 99% the Scheme subset), C++, Python, and toyed with it in Rust.A feature that is very helpful is good support for pattern matching (present in Rust, Swift, SML, OCaml, Haskell, and a number of others). But it's not strictly *required*, your code will just be more verbose without it.For a beginner friendly path, I haven't worked all the way through it but I like the premise and what I've read in Nora Sandler's _Writing a C Compiler_. But it's not the only path out there. The reason I like it for beginners is it breaks up a common pattern in compilers courses and other textbooks.Compilers have a natural structure: parser -> analyzer -> optimizers -> code generationA lot of books and courses have you focus on the parser, then the analyzer, then the optimizers (possibly skipped), and then code generation. If your parser doesn't handle the full language, your analyzer will be wrong, and your code generation will be wrong. Sandler's book (inspired by a paper by Ghuloum) takes an iterative approach which starts with essentially the simplest C program and then grows both what's parsed and what can be generated with each chapter. The first compiler can only compile this: int main() { return 42; }Then with each chapter the parser, analyzer, and code generator gets increasingly complex and supports more and more C features.Jeremy Siek has a pair of books, both called _Essentials of Compilation_, that, depending on which you read, uses Python to compile a Python-like language or Racket for a Scheme/Racket-like language. Both his books are free, but they do tie you more to the specific language the book covers which is why I Sandler's book comes out ahead for me as a recommendation. Sandler's book is roughly the same structure but your implementation language is up to you. Use JS if you want, the tests are all C programs and whether they execute correctly.If you want to build an interpreter, *Crafting Interpreters* by Nystrom is a pretty popular recommendation and free. A book I like, but isn't free (legally) is *Essentials of Programming Languages* but it also uses Scheme or Racket, though you could follow along in a language of your choice with some effort.",rabuf,2025-08-13 21:12:40,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mp7qe5,False,

I can use it to improve code and get help when I am looking for what I need to change to achieve a specific behavior (take THAT, CSS!). It is not perfect, but so far it was useful in my work with Angular and NestJS.This is also supported by the availability of systems with a lot of shared memory.

n7sfi04,"I agree with some of your points, but I'll slightly disagree with you on a few things.AI is a factor in the job market, but not what is being pushed. AI isn't replacing entire industries, but companies are so worried about missing out, they are throwing tons of money at it (and likely getting very little return). So, AI is a distraction, but it's drawing lots of investment that could be spent elsewhere like employee salary and investment in non-AI projects. A lot of professional services companies are trying to become AI gurus, because that's what clients are currently looking for. That's part of why I think it's a bubble that has to pop eventually. I've seen lots of non-technical consultants opening up small AI consulting companies, becoming heads of AI practices (mostly sales and management roles), and so many people going nuts on LinkedIn. One or two people who I've worked with in the past, I trust some of what they are posting. Most of the people are just trying to become business world influencers. There are certainly other factors contributing to the poor job market.One thing that feels unique is the current US administration. It seems to be actively trying to destroy the job market. I'll be blunt, I think there are a lot of unqualified people in the current administration, and I'm not sure what their main motivators outside of personal wealth are. They want to lower interest rates. Well, a weak job market will help with that. And they are actively firing thousands of federal employees, killing grants, and all sorts of other actions putting people out of work. But they don't want people to think the job market is weak, because ""Republicans are supposed to be good for the economy."" We'll have to see what long-term impact it has and how long it takes to recover. Other countries are also dealing with inflation, but it feels like the US is dealing with inflation and a bunch of other things. I'm no economist, but I've read a few people argue the tariff policy reminds them of the time before the Great Depression. So, things might get really bad and ""it's different this time."" Or, this is a spot where I can be in the camp that predicted things incorrectly, which has happened plenty of times. I was originally in the camp that the job market would turn around in a year or two in 2022. Thinking back to working during the dotcom bubble, it might have taken 4 years or so for a recovery. But the government was trying to improve things. Now, it feels like the exact opposite.

Pair that with the huge cultural changes affecting large parts of the industry and this is definitely a pivot point for tech, if not totally unprecedented.The more important point is that the number of junior roles in the tech industry has crashed in a way that, historically, it never has, and that specifically may be due to (misplaced) confidence that AI can improve the productivity of mid- and senior-level workers to a degree that means junior employees are no longer necessary.

n8fad81,"Companies will always make the bold claims that will sell their product. Having worked in tech for my entire career since 2009 (banks, big tech, startups, scale-ups), I can see why a lot of businesses really want it to be true:\- Many regular non-tech businesses (think banks, insurance companies, etc) really suck at delivering software projects, most of their initiatives either outright fail, or go massively over-budget. They also have big consultancies (like Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, E&Y, etc) charging them massive fees for embedded software development squads - mainly because they themselves can't properly deliver.\- Many business people still think in the mindset of build vs run for how the world works. i.e I spend time and money to build something (with a team specialising in building), then I get to run it (without the builders). Think of something like building a house or an apartment block - after the house is complete you don't need structural engineers, electricians and carpenters hanging around on full-time salaries - they leave, you don't need them anymore. This is how a lot of people expect the world to work for most things, but its not really the case with software products / platforms. There is a real desire from many businesses to have it become this way. For example, if I'm a successful apparel retailer like Nike / Adidas - my business would be way more profitable if I only had to really fork out software development costs during major projects / uplifts. In the absence of those types of projects it would be way better to not have software development salaries bloating operational expenses, and would be able to deliver way better returns to shareholders.On the above points, I want to make it clear that I'm mainly talking about companies where you don't really think of them as a tech company, but because of how important web/mobile/digital channels are these days almost every company has had to build software out of pure necessity. If you think of companies like Nike, Walmart, Nespresso, banks, insurance companies, etc - you don't intuitively think of them as a tech company, yet over the past decade(s) software development salaries/costs have become a big part of their operational expenses, and how they operate in general.

This is coming from someone who is a senior engineer and got here much faster than other engineers with 3-4x my experience haha.There is usually a misconception that ""being a senior"" means you need to be this 10X coder or your technical skills need to be at a different level. That is false.In my experience, for being a senior, one needs to hone in on their non-technical skills - how they build trust, how they build alignment, how they lead efforts, etc. For that a different skillset is required, which imo is absolutely crucial if you want to start getting that recognition, and eventually get promoted.

Or maybe AI will let them be halfway useful to someone, as they bridge the role more towards PM and req analysis.The regular juniors... the usual experience with interns/juniors is* They just sit there waiting for you to tell them what to do.* They need clear instructions on what to do* They just focus on getting something out that works, not thinking of maintainability, testing, scaling, etc.* Try to sneak in their favorite language, library, framework when you aren't watching* Always push for a rebuild from scratch rather than understanding the code.All of the above is replicated by LLMs. The regular and senior SDEs aren't necessarily better coders, we are just more proactive about what to do, suggesting improvements, watch for the above and know when to do each, ensure things are mantainable, thi k of broader picture etc.None of these are difficult, but is hard to explain and normally something you learn by experience. A junior who quickly learns the above and acts more grown up will do well ""overseeing"" LLM coders. How to upskill people like that is a difficult question. One of the most useful classes in my university ended up being our software engineering class where we went through more ""BS"" type stuff like requirements, project planning, etc and built a big project as a class. Universities might need to dedicate another semester to that type of classes including LLM coding as part of building something large and making changesOf course, the next couple of years are going to be rough as companies try to upskill their current juniors, drying up the need for new juniors. Ideally what would happen is that any efficiency improvements would result in more projects so the labor market would be the same, but we're in this in between where that hasn't materialized, so companies are hedging their bets and holding off hiring until they know if there are efficiency improvements and more projects can be put in their 2026 plans and/or how their HR budgets change.",ZenEngineer,2025-08-08 18:01:56,33,cscareerquestions,t3_1ml190k,False,

I was warned that my performance was down, I wrote an email response explaining that I was no longer going to be doing free overtime.

I would keep logs, he would keep complaining, he would call me with passive aggressive advice to help me out, asking if the best use of my time really was to go and see Slayer that weekend or try to catch up with my work, citing all my colleagues who were so bent out of shape that they were declaring all their work being done in the 37 hour work week. I refused to do it.Eventually, I was put on a PIP. Long story short, I failed, so I was asked to attend an HR interview citing my suitability for the role and discussion of continued employment.

Job posting requirements are usually a wish list for the perfect candidate and should be treated as such. The person hired almost never meets all the requirements.That said, yeah, if you’re self taught or even a bootcamp grad the market is not going to be a kind place for you right now. Part of a good hiring process is about reducing risk. Generally, for entry level positions, candidates with CS degrees are stronger hires than non-CS degree candidates. There’s still strong candidates in both groups, but their tend to be fewer really terrible candidates who have a CS degree since many of them were flushed out in college.Right now there’s a lot of candidates with CS degrees looking for jobs, so most companies don’t have a ton of incentive to look in that more risky pool of candidates.As someone who broke into the industry over a decade ago with no degree, I really do wish I had something better to tell you, but honestly, that’s just where the market is at right now.The best advice I can give you is:- Dont let the CS degree requirement in a job posting deter you from applying. If you feel like you can do the job and you meet 60%-70% of the requirements, just apply. Realize it’s a long shot and don’t get your hopes up, but it doesn’t hurt to shoot off a resume. You never know.- You need to focus on getting your foot in the door anywhere. Focus on smaller companies that aren’t “tech” companies. You need to get a job on your resume that says “developer”, “software engineer”, or something like that. Remember what I said earlier about risk? If you can show that someone else paid you for a year to be a developer, that tells other companies that, on some level, you can do the job, which reduces risk. Again, I realize you’re probably applying to just about anything you can, but I want to emphasize that if your goal is really to break into the industry then you should prioritize getting experience in the field on your resume above all else.",Drugba,2025-08-12 03:28:09,15,cscareerquestions,t3_1mnx0jd,False,

Maybe the goals aren't to get to ""the next levels"", but you'll need to have goals nevertheless. Doesn't mean they need to force you to write 15 SMART goals with metrics and everything, but still.Companies that do career ladders well will have a concept of ""career role"" or ""terminal"" role. That's the place you need to get to if you want to stay there forever. At most companies that do this, that's a mid to high senior level.That means that until you are at that mid to high senior, a part of your job is to get better until you are. That means goals and progress. If you don't want to do that, you're out.Once you get to the terminal level, things get a bit more nuanced. You no longer need to work toward your next promotion. You can say ""I'll be a senior my entire life"". If you're ok with that and won't complain if all you get are cost of living adjustments, and never get to Staff/Principal, that's fine. But you still need to have goals and move forward. Why? Skill inflation. Someone who was a high senior in 2010 isn't the same as someone in 2020. The world changes, technologies change, there's more resources, like AI. So the bar is continually raising. To stay at the same ""level"" as everyone else relatively, you have to keep growing, else you're going backward. That's why there's some level of age discrimination: when you're young you're kind of at the bar by default because you didn't have time to regress. But as you get older, if you don't keep up, you fall behind. And a lot of people do.The goals you set are there to make sure you stay at the bar. As a mid to high senior your job is more than just taking a ticket and executing, too. You'll be tasked with doing project work, collaboration, etc, and those become goals too, in addition to learning, coaching, and various other responsibilities at that level.But if you want to come in at work, look at Jira/Linear, pick the ticket at the top of the queue, write the code, open a pull request, pick the next ticket, and repeat until its time to go home...

Keep in mind you can accept *and* continue looking.I recommend against negotiating if this is your only offer.Also worth considering:The company may have a few candidates they are interested in, of whom you are their first pick. If aren't willing to accept the $80k but their number 2 candidate is, they may not increase their offer to land you. It depends on whether the company thinks $10k-$20k is worth their #1 vs candidate over their #2In today's tech world, there are lots of entry level candidates and few entry level jobs. It is a buyer's market right now for new grads (you, the candidate, are selling).Lastly, imo, $80k starting now vs $100k starting in 3 months is likely going to come out pretty even in the long run. Two reasons for this:1 - After 1 year, the $80k/yr earned you $80k. After waiting 3 months to land a $100k/yr job, you'll earn 9 months of the $100k/yr job with is $67k. After 2 years: it's $160k vs $166k.2 - The sooner you reach the ~2 year mark, the sooner you can look for a new job and make a very large pay increase without being seen as a job hopper, changing too quickly and having little loyalty.It may even take longer than 3 months to land a $100k job.My advice, accept and optionally keep interviewing.",chesterjosiah,2025-08-11 17:27:57,11,cscareerquestions,t3_1mndksr,False,

You're only just over a year in.Obviously you just can't 'wait' to get better and something has to change because people have been noticing. One thing i think this is evidence of is you may be hyper-focused on 'requirements' vs just putting yourself in the shoes of a normal user. And what i think that kinda means is, forget about work and the requirements of the task for a moment, and just use the app like you would any normal mobile app or like you would visit any website in your leisure time. What things do you notice? Or maybe you aren't thinking about these things when you're browsing the internet because you don't want your experience to feel like work.This is how I got better at form UX and really tightening up my code before review. In my casual use of the internet I come across forms all the time, and i think about how annoying ABC is because its clunky, or why XYZ is so frustrating to use because it doesn't respond how i would expect a modern form should. I take those real human feelings and use that when I code forms. A great real-life example is how annoying government web forms are because if you mess up you have to start over; how dated the UX feels and functions when you have to fill out all your HR paperwork online for a new job. How annoying and inconsistent the experience is when applying for jobs holy shit! hhahhaAnd so what that translates to on the job is ""I just know how I want to feel when I use a form"" and in my effort to achieve that UX i just happen to check most if not all the acceptance criteria.

n7n486w,"First, stop worrying about wasting time. Time invested up-front trying to figure out what you like will unlock a lifetime of enjoyment. Second, feel lost but don’t stay lost. I don’t know a single person who made it anywhere worthwhile who hasn’t felt absolutely and hopelessly lost at some point in their life. But if you sit in your own mess you’ll get nowhere so don’t underestimate the power of starting small to try and figure stuff out.Third, who cares? And I don’t mean this in a condescending way. But more like, so there’s other students who do better, so there’s people ahead of you, so there are millions of calculator apps or whatever, but frankly who cares? Unless you’re trying to become a billionaire with your first app (which is a wild delusion for most folks at some point) your thought process is wrong on this. You need to crawl, then walk, then run. Which means build the things others have made, at least you have guides. Build off of those if you want, I promise you some guy on stack overflow 9 years ago has answers for what you’re stuck on. Personal projects are about learning what you enjoy doing. To that effect who cares what others have done, if you enjoy doing it go for it. I promise doing what you enjoy will push you that 10-20% above based on motivation alone.Fourth, just start. Whatever it is, just start. Internships, coffee chats, mock interviews, career counseling through your college. Just start. Analysis paralysis is very real. The only way past it is to make some decision even if it end up being suboptimal. You need to break the tie.Fifth, discipline. I hate it, most people hate it. But the phrase “hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard” still rings true. Whatever you choose to do, stick through it. If you’re an international student I’m sure that alone comes with a fair amount of discipline. Being thousands of miles away and still doing what you’re supposed to do everyday. It doesn’t matter if you join leadership or be an IC. You need consistency and discipline to see results.Lastly, I’ll say is, while learning to keep going is important, learning when to pivot is even more important. Note I didn’t say quit. Pivoting is just redirecting your energy to what makes more sense for you and your interests. You have limited time and limited energy, you can’t do everything heck even Superman can’t. So you need to learn to prioritize and pivot.For right now, rest assured that 2 years is a drop in the ocean for a potential pivot to a rewarding 40-45 year career. You’re not a lost cause, you’re just young. I promise you everyone is as confused as you are. Just start something small even if everyone has done it and stay out of your head so you can keep marching forwards with whatever pivot you choose in your life.",styada,2025-08-08 18:03:12,15,cscareerquestions,t3_1ml0zcj,False,

The best projects, imo, are ones that solve an actual problem or serve an actual purpose in your day-to-day life. It shows that you're always thinking about how you can harness CS to improve some pain point, and you take action to do so. You can start off with something really simple, since you're pretty new to the field. Maybe kind of overdone, but a pomodoro timer is an example of a potential project - someone thought, ""I wish there was a way I could time my study sessions to maximize productivity,"" and then took action and coded something up to do it. The more unique and personal this idea is to you, the better. Lastly, something important to note is that you likely won't get all the knowledge you need in your classes.

When you're a freshman it's harder, they mostly go for sophomores and juniors since they're closer to grad and thus return the company's investment quicker.If you're a freshman now, it sets a pretty good schedule for you. If you can't get an internship, which is usually the case, you spend the first year working on projects for the resume, and then use that for internships the next two years, and try to get a return offer after grad from one of those. When you're a sophomore, set yourself a fixed (# of apps) daily goal, even if small, and start.As for the projects themselves, I can't tell you what to make, but I'd started with a website with three.js. It was fun to write thanks to Three, it lightly dabbled in the process of hosting it etc., and it resulted in something permanent online, which imo is more satisfying than a local terminal program unless that serves a real use. Even better if you do something with even a small amount of users, so you can get started on databases.If you want to go more hardware/embedded CS, look into making an RC with as many functional systems you can put into it. I made one last year that I remotely (from the library lmao) attended some in person courses with and had classmates charge it in the room. Very transferable to swe? Not really, realistically. But it made me get to know many people and boomed my enthusiasm, and you really need that.TLDR don't care about my experiences: For your projects I'd recommend trying to solve a real problem but realistically, people usually fail to find something like that, you just need to start with anything to fill the resume and get the habit going.",2016KiaRio,2025-08-10 23:06:03,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1mmw6du,False,
n80rdo6,"Welcome to an awesome field! I also did C++ in high school xDAs for projects, there are a few things you can do now that you're comfortable with the basics:1. Expand on uni projects, especially those you find interesting. You're already doing them, you can work on them further and put 'em on GitHub.2. Think of whatever CS topic you enjoy or think you might enjoy (gaming, data analysis, web development) and/or real-life topic (history, finance, music, medical) and make something related. Doesn't matter if it's overdone (web shop, library record keeping) or novel, do something you'll like :)3. Don't go too big, you'll burn yourself out.4. On a similar note as 3, don't worry about perfection. Make something perfectable first.5. Use Git with all of your projects (publishable or not), get in the habit of writing good commit messages, and push everything to GitHub (and/or GitLab, if you want). These are greay habits for later. I think only 20% of my repos are public.Don't worry about publishing a project. Play around, take tutorials, make dumb scripts, and write whatever code comes to mind. Maybe some of it will be interesting enough for you to work on it further and take public.You can also try Advent of Code for code challenges similar to what you know (algorithms, data structures), with more flexibility than LeetCode/CodeWars. You can make your solutions public too (not the inputs!).You're very young and have tons of time to find your niche(s), so experiment early and cheaply.Things to keep in mind:- Try learning testing (unit testing especially) early, it's insanely useful and highly required in industry.- As mentioned, use Git with all of your projects.- Don't let LLMs like ChatGPT write for you. Especially this early, your skills will stagnate. This includes BOTH code and regular text (comments, commit messages, README files).- Do use ChatGPT to learn what you don't know, but also read documentation. Both are very useful skills.- Write a Readme for all of your projects (not right away, but over time). Markdown and documentation are both very useful in industry, and for those repositories you make public, READMEs are super important (arguably more so than the code).Don't overwork yourself into early burnout. Work on what you enjoy (and obviously your actual uni work), and if something is good enough, feel free to make it public. But until then, explore as many areas of CS as you can (embedded, low-level, programming language theory, AI (many subfields here), web development (front and back), operations/devops & Cloud (maybe a bit later), desktop applications (like your console apps), etc.).There's no deadline for this, do it in your own time :)",CaporalDxl,2025-08-10 23:07:52,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1mmw6du,False,

The business problems you deal with at a large enterprise are pretty unique and require you to build bespoke solutions.

You could say something like, I think I work slower then other people in the organization because I close an average of 5 tickets each day or hour or whatever. What do you think I should be my average? Tell your manager what you do to make sure your work is done to a high standard (you double check your work before you close them or maybe you spend additional time with clients,etc). Ask your manager for feedback about your work and be willing to change. Try not to be defensive if your manager gives you honest feedback or make excuses.

Why would the previous manager expect you to be awake or even wake up for his call? I never had this issue before but this time I work remotely for an APAC team and there are many cultural differences in terms of working hours etc. I could handle it the first two years as I usually don't mind working extra hours and the people were generally nice, even though there were a lot of issues like cultural differences, no other woman in the whole department etc. Last year my ex manager got promoted so another guy took his place and I ve been reporting to this new guy. The situation is exactly like yours. Continuously moving targets to always make me feel inadequate, never praising any kind of work I do even though the previous manager and my manager 's manager were giving me very good reviews etc. He is exactly like your current manager, giving no clear expectations, no clear communication and always saying that I should have thought of XYZ from the start. I don't mind feedback and I actually implement a lot of his technical feedback. It's the continuous subtle accusation about lack of professionalism, carelessness etc. there were many times that I was the only one looking at prod issues, I would resolve them, put a summary in public channels of what was the issue and how i resolved it, and then instead of getting a "" good job for figuring this out"", I would have to explain to him why did it take me 2 hours to resolve for example instead of 1. But what REALLY pisses me off is that he doesn't practice what he preaches about professionalism. He will release stuff without testing, release stuff without updating the database to be on the same version etc. But no one tells him anything because the rest of them are nice people. Anyway there is not much we can do. I actually did go to my previous manager and asked him if I could report back to him. I didn't go into details about my current manager though, I tried to avoid all the extra drama. I just want to get out of this situation. He said yes and he would request for the change. So I guess it helped having someone higher up that I had worked with in the past and he knows me already. But it's been a few weeks and nothing has happened. Maybe he didn't think it was urgent. I think we are hiring now and he might want to give him new direct reports from the new hire before changing me back to him, I don't know. I will ask again and probably this time I will be more specific about what the issue is, because I can't keep asking without giving concrete reasons.

I graduated in CS this year and I've felt like my degree (even before I got it) opened doors for me, but then again, I didn't go the SWE route. I intended to be a programmer when I first enrolled in CS back in 2019, but after my freshman year I realized that coding for a living wasn't for me- just as a hobby. I stayed in school because I was more than halfway done with my bachelor's and I didn't want all of that money to go to waste. In my junior year, I applied to an IT internship and I ended up getting it. I continued to work in IT for 2 years, got my bachelors (with my minor being in IT), and now I'm a Network Engineer making $60,000. Even before I got promoted to engineer, I got offers to do tech sales and even got to do some traveling for it. I would've not gotten those opportunities if my anticipated degree wasn't listed in my resume.However, someone else's experience may be different from mine- maybe they've worked unpaid internships and now they can't get hired anywhere. I don't want to invalidate anyone's experiences, but please understand that there's a whole set of variables that impact the job market for everyone- as it is different in every city, and country especially.

If so, you’ll need to honestly explore your thinking behind that expectation and adjust accordingly. “Expectations are premeditated resentments” - this applies to your career, job, education, professional relationships, everything. If you go into it determined to get something specific out of it, you’re probably going to be disappointed.
