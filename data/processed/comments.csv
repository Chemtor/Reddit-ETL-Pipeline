But you can be displaced by the perception that one is “good enough.”I think the arguments on both sides of the LLM table are misplaced.Every conversation online about AI replacing humans is centered around looking at it from an individualistic perspective. But that’s not how labor works in the workplace.Essentially, both of the below statements can be true:- AI can’t be a drop-in replacement for Data Engineering- I, as a Data Engineer, can be replaced with AI.If a company begins using LLMs to perform tasks that are repetitive/boilerplate/specific to the strengths of the LLM, and that work makes up a X% of the labor of their data engineering department, allowing for more time from each individual data engineer to perform more work suited for the human DE, then justification for keeping ALL of the original labor isn’t there - assuming the same amount of work is being done.When looking at this from the macroeconomic scale, yes the usage of LLMs to increase productivity in the workplace - whether by agentic automation or simply by using it as a quicker and more efficient task-oriented search engine, WILL have an effect on the number of jobs available in DE and very well could lead to YOU being replaced by an AI, while not replacing all DEs.At any rate, I generally agree with your points on side-stepping being labeled for replacement by embracing and becoming the expert in the business with LLMs usage.

That's pretty straight forward. A data warehouse is just a very, very large database. There are two different database areas, operational and analytic. They are characterised by the SLAs you have on the data. Smaller databases are normally used for operational because you need fast response times. In analytic, the response times aren't normally as critical but they handle quite a bit more data; much of it historic. In a perfect world, if you could do both with the same system, you would. The problem is the cost to do them all in one. Of course, these are gross oversimplifications but it gets the idea across. In addition to the database component, the surrounding data ecosystems are different but they have many commonalities.Data Lake and Lakehouse are both marketing BS. Nothing more. The same is true of ""medalion architecture."" It is an attemp to make the standard three tier (staging, core, semantic) into to something different by giving it a new coat of paint. Someone noticed that you can store quite a bit of extra ""stuff"" in the staging layer beyond what the database needs. Of course, the marketing folks thought that needed a new name. I think we are at the point now where we just keep adding buzzwords to the names. It's like a technical pin the tail on the donkey. The latest is ""now with more AI!.""

Think Scott Alexander, Noah Smith, Nate Silver. Or go read Wolf Street. MUCH more intuitive than any business dashboard I've ever looked at.But the flip side of that is: when are dashboards appropriate? Should all analysis just be ad-hoc and narrative-driven? My intuition is that you should curate a very small, simple set of business-wide KPIs and put them on an internal website and have them update reliably a few times a day. For anything more strategic or involved, where there is a key decision to be made, you need analysts to put on the researcher hat and go do the analysis (hopefully with a nice clean data model that the DEs have set up).

Mostly, I was transforming and consolidating data using on prem tools to automate our processes. After that, I took a BI manager role with our data science team (data science was initially part of BI at my company). Spent a year there until a big reorganization occurred. We moved to the cloud, data science became its own thing, a data engineering team got stood up. I initially moved with data science, but it was clear my skills did not mesh well except for the data engineering, but they wanted to move all DE work over to the DE team eventually. I took that opportunity after just over a year in that position. On day 1 with the DE team, we were building stop gap solutions. I spent that time getting really good with pyspark. I already had a large background with pandas, so pyspark was very easy to figure out. From there, we had consultants build our long term data platform while the full timers worked on ad hoc requests to keep the business moving and start making a name for our team. During this time, I learned I was really good at programming business logic and transformations. I was not nearly as good at ingestion or tools outside of databricks. Eventually our SAAS integration started, and I was working directly with consultants. I was well out of my depth, but I learned the process pretty quickly, patched some early holes in my technical knowledge, and got rolling. I learned that I was really good at functional programming, but pretty bad at DevOps and way out of my league in OOP. Now, I'm working on a project to rebuild our data platform to one easier to maintain, more flexible, and moves data faster. I'm focusing more on architecture, but making sure that these new consultants are training my team and me every step of the way. My manager assigned me as lead for this project.

Not a bad idea in theory, but I’m skeptical it can fully replicate everything Spark does (or do it in quite the same way).Snowpark still feels a bit clunky to me in some areas, especially when working with unstructured data.

n5z6y9f,"Hi Guys, Snowflake employee here & just wanted chime in with a bit more info on this topic so you guys are clear what the new feature is and what it is not.Previously, we had 2 main methods for Spark users to interact with or leverage Snowflake vectorized engine.1. Snowpark Dataframes: These were close to PySpark APIs but (not exact). Initially (2,3 years ago) they were limited in coverage but as of now, do cover most of PySpark functions so if you tried it before, experience is much different now. Because Snowpark was not exactly as PySpark, it did require about 10% code refactoring so some migration effort was necessary. Benefit of Snowpark dataframes was that they were not held back by OSS PySpark Functions so you had access to Snowflake specific ML & AI functions and the newest features. Snowpark Dataframes allowed you to leverage 100% Snowflake Serverless Compute engines for SQL, Python, Java & Scala UDFs.2. Snowflake Spark Connector: This was meant to connect existing Spark clusters to Snowflake to read, transform & write data to/from Snowflake. Driver has some optimization where some of the aggr functions could be performed in Snowflake before delivering the data to Spark cluster but the Spark Compute Clusters did bulk of the work where Snowflake was input and/or output for the data.The new Apache Spark Connect from Snowpark combines best of both worlds Apache Spark code that developers love & use for Data Engineering & ML and Snowpark which gives access to serverless vectorized engine for SQL, Python, java & Scala jobs.Recent innovation from Spark Connect from OSS Spark community was the catalyst that Snowflake was waiting for to integrate OSS Spark in to Snowflake ecosystem the right way.This means you can now run your existing Spark jobs with 0 code changes on Snowflake compute which comes with many added benefits such as unified security & governance, performance, auditability & simplicity as compute is serverless and requires little to no optimization or maintenance.How it works is that the OSS Spark sends the job details to Snowflake, Snowflake generates a new execution plan based on the original details that can run on Snowflake Vectorized Engine (SQL, Python UDFs & etc.) sot he original code remains the same but where & how it executes in back are different.Our initial focus for Public Preview was majority of the customer use cases that we have seen which are Data Engineering & ML workloads that use SQL, Dataframes & UDFs. We are actively working on collecting feedback and build support for other new Spark features supported by the OSS Spark Connect project so definitely would love any feedback that you guys have to take to our PMs.I understand this may not be the right fit for every Spark team. If your team enjoys tweaking Spark params & cluster configs to get every ounce of performance out of clusters then this solution may not be a good fit. However, if the team enjoys Spark code and has a ton of existing pipelines but would rather spend their time building & deploying new projects vs. optimizing & maintaining cluster, it will be a great benefit. Especially if Snowflake is the downstream analytics layer as it would eliminate any Export & Import jobs(time & cost) between Spark & Snowflake environments. The main goal is to meet developers where they are by offering ways for them to leverage advances Snowflake capabilities by offering them different means to work with Snowflake in their preferred language and coding frameworks.If you guys give it a try and have inputs don't hesitate the reach out and let us know feedback.The good, bad & the ugly.",Mr_Nickster_,2025-07-30 13:40:22,27,dataengineering,t3_1md072b,False,

More like $5k/year tops. Here was my approach:* Sources: AWS Aurora Postgres database, various APIs, potentially Netsuite down the road* Destination: Timescale (now TigerData) database hosted using Timescale Cloud but linked to our VPC via VPC peering -- **this is where the bulk of our budget is going**.* Tech stack: * Pulumi TypeScript to build infrastructure in AWS to support the open source version of the orchestrator, mostly using ECS Fargate for the containers and leveraging existing networking infrastructure * Dagster OSS as the orchestration (went back and forth between this and Prefect before landing on Dagster) * Sling as the core extract and load software to sync data from Postgres to Timescale * dbt core running within the Dagster framework to apply transformations on new data in Timescale * Python scripts orchestrated by Dagster to get data from APIs. Originally wanted to try dltHub but ended up just writing my own scripts using requests (probably not ideal) * Monitoring/notifications via Slack app integration (originally was using [ntfy.sh](http://ntfy.sh) for quick and dirty SNS topic-like notifications, getting Slack approval was challenging) * Dockerized local development using the pre-built Timescale and Postgres Docker images + the same custom Dockerfile I use for Dagster production deployments to keep things as simple as possible.Data is synced from Postgres every 4 hours and daily for the APIs as that's essentially all that's required by our business. The Postgres sync with Sling runs incrementally and is complete in about 20 minutes, which is not optimized by any means but is sufficient for our purposes. For context, our entire source database was only about 330GB and I wasn't replicating the entire thing.Writing YAML for Sling and later for dbt was a huge time slog for 100+ source tables; I leveraged an AI tool (Claude) to help generate a lot of that code after manually building some of the transformation models myself. Bonus to this is it was the generated YAML was pretty consistent for common columns like `created_at` or `_sling_loaded_at` audit columns.I am the lone developer and maintainer of this project -- most people on my team are unaware that I'm even working on a project like this, let alone what its purpose might be. It has been a wild and frustrating ride at times without many others to turn to for help, but it's been a great learning experience as well. Throughout the development, I tried to stress simplicity, modularity, and ease of maintenance as much as possible. Once a larger team becomes available to support something like this, you can make different decisions like moving your data replication tasks to something like Fivetran or using a real data warehouse like Snowflake (again, budget constraints for us).~~Best of luck to you!~~ Edit: I reread the question and realized this is hypothetical but best of luck if this is ever you in the future all the same!

Iot has changed, when it first started it simple scalar data like temperature and there was only a couple of things going on. These days there are much higher expectations on what the devices need to do. They expect always on at the edge monitoring of complex sensors and it takes a fundamental change in the org to get that done.

First came BI developers/ETL engineers, they built warehouses and reports so analysts could do their work. Later, data analysts became more self-serve and focused on interpreting the past. Then data science took off, using that historical data to predict the future.Both analysts and scientists quickly ran into the same problem: clean, reliable, well-structured data was hard to come by. That’s when the modern data engineer role emerged, not just to build infra, but to make data usable at scale.Early DE work was infra-heavy, but as platforms matured (Databricks, GCP, Azure, Snowflake), more of the plumbing became automated. That doesn’t mean the job is going away, it means the focus shifts. You spend less time reinventing connectors and clusters, more time on things like modeling, scalability, governance, security, cost optimization, and integrating multiple data sources into a coherent system.This is also where analytics engineers come in, they work closer to the business, doing a lot of SQL/dbt modeling and BI integration.

A transaction is intended to be a single large block of rows. To wit contention is intended to be low.Taken together, that you think iceberg is a transactional database is your main problem. The design desire of iceberg is to be able to have atomic writes to disk from ephemeral stateless writers for the purpose of retaining and accessing large amounts of data for long periods of time. Any alternative not involving optimistic concurrency necessarily involves a single stateful system that needs to be on for as long as the data needs to be accessible which is absurdly dumb and massively expensive. The only reason databases and database servers exist is to literally provide a lock. To the degree you can avoid locks you can cut massive cost by making the computer independent of the retention process.

n6m1my6,"The author continues their absolutely-detached-from-reality rant against Iceberg. They've essentially looked at a sledgehammer and decided that it is 'not a serious tool' because it requires more effort, is more unwieldy, and lacks a claw compared to a regular hammer.The article indicates it is a 21 minute read, so I'm going to be somewhat brief here, but essentially other than various truisms the entire thing can be broken down. The article is also quite sarcastic and derogatory, which gives me the impression that the author is more interested in puffing themselves up than earnestly engaging with the problem space.I'll pick a few things that are emblematic of the disconnect between the author's basis for criticism and what iceberg is actually for.---> It also means that the overhead of each file is large (in the order of 1KB).Iceberg (and DeltaLake/Hudi, I'll not mention again) is intended for storing many gigabytes to terabytes and petabytes of data in a given 'table' -- a few KB of overhead is going to be less than 0.001% of the data you're actually reading or writing. You'll likely have more overhead within the parquet files themselves if they've been split relatively small, and your choice of compression algorithm is going to have orders of magnitude more impact.> Putting the burden on the clientThe entire point of the base layer of 'lakehouse' implementations is to decouple storage from the compute. That is: *there is no server* to even consider to be 'putting the burden on the client'. You may as well complain that trains have to run on rails.> If clients need to write manifest lists that point at all Manifest Files - we have already leaked the location of every single S3 file worth stealingThe path to an S3 file is not sensitive data, it is protected through access control to the bucket. You may as well complain that clients connecting to databases leaks the IP of the database.Iceberg is not intended to solve row-level security for you in the same way that parquet does not solve row level security. It simply isn't in the scope of what it is trying to solve, because it isn't seeking to replace a database.> Did we not learn in CS 101 that if you need O(n) operations to append to a list, you are probably doing something wrong?This section completely ignores something that the author *should* know quite well, that sometimes you exchange processing time for space consumption. For metadata files the repeated data is utterly insignificant compared to all the other reads and writes that are happening, but because we're dealing with remote storage accessed over a network then when reading it is much more efficient to retrieve a single larger block of data than make many individual requests.In fact the author later whinges that a query has to do sequential 2 metadata reads to locate the parquet files it needs - so they *do* understand the benefit of compacting data together, but they just choose to ignore that in this instance so that they can heap more derision on Iceberg.> Optimistic Concurrency - Why it does not work! ... is there ever a point to optimistic concurrency control? ... In Iceberg, two concurrent writes to a table will ALWAYS be in conflict A section in which the author almost realises they may be lacking some perspective, but plows on ahead anyway.First of all, Iceberg is considered about the overall efficiency for readers and writers that are operating in completely isolated processing environments, and when writing data they are going to be writing a *lot* of data and it may take a relatively long time (seconds to minutes). A complete pessimistic lock would prevent concurrent non-conflicting writes, which means you could only ever effectively have one writer to a table, which would be an unnecessary restricting if you have pure-append ingestion processes, and pure-append ingestion processes are very common in lake/lakehouse implementations.And yes, you can have non-conflicting *data* writes even if the metadata writes are conflicting, but as I've mentioned in here the metadata is insignificant compared to the data in intended use cases. Getting a writer to rewrite even a 1MB metadata file is a significantly better tradeoff than having them sit idle for many seconds to minutes, when their compute runtime is costing you money. And that's if they even get a conflict - subsecond timings on completion of concurrent writes is pretty rare for the intended use cases.> ""Tables grow large by being written to, they grow really large by being written to frequently"".Complete bullshit. My largest tables are either full snapshots taken periodically from sources, or they use streaming ingestion with buffered writes. In fact streaming ingestion is directly a use-case for optimistic concurrency - each partition can have a separate writer and they can all write data concurrently and commit periodically.> Did I mention that 1000 commits/sec is a pathetic number if you are appending rows to table?Absolutely unhinged criticism. The target format is parquet and the default row group size for writers is on the order of 100k to 1M rows. To hit a required 1k commits/sec you'd be looking at ingesting >100M rows/sec and 100GB/sec of *compressed* data while having each individual parquet file be committed one-by-one with a thousand independent writing processes.What you would *actually* do is have a partitioned writer that has 1000 concurrent parquet writes, and it commits once per second. The author is just *inventing* problems.> Intermezzo: Iceberg REALLY does not want to be a databaseThen why are you critiquing it like it is one?This is ridiculous.

n64m0wc,"Depends on your team size and data size I would say.The “right” approach is to have data loaded to s3 before redshift. But most company won’t ever do anything with this. But it allow your to grow, avoid potential vendor locking, reduce DW cost by doing preaggregation yourself before loading it in redshift, etc, etc. But all of this requires a lot of effort? Which might be slowing you down to achieving you company goals. If you have a big enough data team it make sense, if you are pretty small the loading directly to redshift is very appealing.You’ll always have the possibility to offload the data from redshift to s3 in the futur if that’s needed but you won’t shoot yourself in the foot and not deliver anything for the first 6 months.In terms of pricing, you are analyzing storage cost which shouldn’t be a factor imo. Yes storage is way cheaper in s3. But the size of data you have in SAP isn’t probably not that big. You need to define that first. For example I don’t see a world where you have a terabyte of data to load from SAP to redshift. A terabyte of text files is a LOT of data for things that are entered manually or mostly in SAP. Now let’s say you have a terabyte of data because your company has a lot there (which you probably don’t) then having the storage cost in redshift would be something are 25$ per month for the hole data set. Our conversation here cost more than that. Depending on type of s3 storage you might save a lot but storage is negligible for small datasets.The real DW cost is compute, and that needs to be considered. I know the business wants SAP and ALL other sources, but you should chunk this a lot so you endup delivering things in small chunks. Everyone wants everything yesterday but that’s not how things work. Start with SAP but not all, the most relevant concepts because there’s probably a lot of tables there to sync, clean, transform to make the data usable. The goal of you DW is to make data usable but also to get a single source of truth. If you just load raw data in and let business build dashboard on top of the raw data I can tell you this is going to be a mess in 2 months. Start small, get the table requirements that allow you to clean the data, make the data available, then repeat.To go back on pricing, if for example you think that you have A LOT of data multiple terabytes. And that the storage cost will be around 1000$ a month because you have 40 terabytes to load and that can be an issue, then I can assure you, you won’t like the Fivetran Bill. If you need to think about the storage cost, then you need to rearchitect this because Fivetran is not the option you are looking for. It’s very good to load data quickly. It gets insanely expensive when you start to really use it. Most companies won’t have issue with fivetran cost because most company don’t have a lot of data.Good luck",Commercial_Dig2401,2025-07-31 07:58:28,3,dataengineering,t3_1mdsm5n,False,

See correct config to save processing and make it write faster, as no retention period. You may also apply clustering rules here.Then I would ask, do you really need redshift? I know it exists and basically how it works but never worked since I mostly only move data from staging area to silver and gold areas in S3, using again Delta/iceberg, leaving data with dimensional modeling as needed by business.I generally use Databricks/snowflake to process it,but so far I know, you can also use Glue for it.Delta/iceberg have acid properties/time travel/and others that can be selected and designed as your need, replicating redshift pros.If it is enough, you totally save redshift costs, and got a simpler arch in only one place.

But for now, we use only 50-60 tables, it’s just that we don’t know what tables will we use exactly in the future based on the use cases. For now the size of the data is very less like max 50gb worth 10 years of data.For this much data, direct redshift would be ideal. But considering the future, if data size increases, it will be a problem. Although data honestly wouldn’t spike much. Coming to your point where if redshift is even needed: yes I feel so because we currently have tableau connected directly to sap where the devs created views which consume a lot of compute making dashboards slow. If we use s3 tables, we will have to use Athena for querying and connect that to tableau, and we have a lot of complex queries/views built on top. I don’t think it’s a good solution to use Athena as our query engine.And I am the only DE here so it will be difficult for me to write code for every table and it’s upsert logic if it lands in s3 first.

n5vge5x,"I’ve been on a very similar path, so let me share what I wish I’d done differently.Early on, I spent a lot of time on PySpark and Pandas. They’re powerful tools, but for most of my early projects, SQL could have solved 90% of my problems faster and more cleanly. SQL is easier to debug, easier to optimize, and much more universal across platforms. If I could go back, I’d master SQL-based transformation first before diving deep into dataframe libraries.That’s why, instead of jumping straight into Docker/Airflow, I’d start with a SQL-centric transformation tool like dbt (or Bruin, which also lets you run Python and handle ingestion). This will teach you the fundamentals of data modeling and pipeline design without the operational complexity of containers and schedulers. Since you already use Tableau, learning the “one step before the dashboard” will make the whole puzzle click.Another big lesson: don’t get lost in technical rabbit holes. The fastest way to grow is to chase the highest-impact business problems, things that save your team time, increase accuracy, or unlock new capabilities. If you focus there, you’ll naturally pick up the right technical skills along the way.Also, don’t work in isolation. Get your code reviewed, and review others’ work. You’ll learn more from those reviews than from most courses.If I were mapping a path for you, it’d be:1. Master SQL + data modeling (dbt/Bruin/SQLMesh)2. Add Python tasks in the pipeline only when needed3. Develop a tool in Streamlit and deploy it for the use of business team4. Develop an ML model, and deploy it.You’ll hit Docker and Airflow eventually, but starting with modeling skills will make everything else much easier.",PolicyDecent,2025-07-29 22:02:20,6,dataengineering,t3_1mcnpnr,False,

n6lxih5,"A REST API is a pull-based request/response interface (kinda like using HTTP to query a database). My understanding is that Pulsar is a push-based publish-subscribe model (like if you subscribed to someone’s Substack email newsletter). You therefore need a translation interface to perform the pull from the API and then publish it in the appropriate stream or message queue format to Pulsar. You may need something similar between Pulsar and Ceph as well; I’m not familiar enough with Pulsar to say. Unless your API fetcher has the ability to also write to object storage, your first point of storage appears to be the post-Pulsar Ceph so would be there. Ideally you want to create that archive copy as close to the source as possible, so it’s determining where the storage opportunities are in your flow. I’ve not heard of Aerospike before but a quick skim doesn’t look like it’s for this requirement. I asked about the role as it sounded like you were scoped to design the solution, which engineers tend to get a bit twitchy about PMs/POs doing :grinning_face_with_sweat:.

So I can speed up my productivity too, you know.I tried using AIs to handle basic tasks for me when everyone started saying that AI would ruin programmers' lives and produce outdated, broken, and bug-ridden code. Yeah, it might be faster because some parts are already done and just need tweaking, but that works for small scripts since they are simple and easy to track and fix. However, it's impossible for an AI to create a full app exactly as you want because you can't specify all the details. There will always be things you do through pure automation simply because you're used to coding.Last time I asked an AI to write a server.js to run express, and it just didn’t work. I had to write everything again lol (by writing everything again, I mean going to my GitHub and copying and pasting my last server.js, which was also copy-pasted from my previous project).So no, AI does not destroy programming. There are no AI writing apps on demand, you could use something like Copilot, but it won't make a big difference unless you're doing repetitive coding. And if you are doing that, you're probably coding in the wrong way.People also talk about AI replacing artists, but artists are still working because AI can do some things to represent your ideas. However, it will never capture everything the way you want because your ideas need a brain with empathy to understand what you truly mean and what you want to do it as you wish. An AI can only replicate what you do, and all the details you don't provide, the AI will just do whatever it wants.You can tell an artist, ""I want my character to be like Jhon Wick,"" and they will take your ideas and adapt them to fit Jhon Wick vibes, while an AI will probably do Jhon Wick and just add some wonky details on top of it.",Inmortia,2025-07-30 01:01:10,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mcatjd,False,

n5xkbfr,"Honestly, there is no such thing as a ""programmer's mindset"". That's a myth and a general excuse for people too lazy to invest the necessary effort, discipline, persistence, diligence, and work to learn.There are things that can make learning easier, such as being a logically inclined person, but even that can be improved and learned.I am a firm believer that most (not all) people can actually learn programming to a certain degree. They won't all be able to reach a professional level, but they can definitely learn it.After all, programming is just creating and translating steps to solve a problem in such a way that the computer can execute these steps.We humans solve problems all day long, just we mostly don't even notice it as it is intrinsic. We work in steps every single second of the day, but we don't realize it.Learning programming is learning to consciously devise steps, to utilize our intrinsic ability to think in steps consciously.Most new learners focus way too much on the *code*, on the *implementation* in a *programming language*, which is only the last part of the process. Sure, it is absolutely necessary to learn a *programming language*, but after all this is just very limited vocabulary and very simple grammar.The real part of programming happens way before the code. It is the process of analyzing, breaking apart problems/tasks and solving them in sequences of discrete steps (again, a skill that we generally are intrinsically good with) that *then* can be *implemented* in any programming language.Here is also the problem with most tutorials and with many, even high quality courses: they focus too much on the code and too little on the design, on guiding the learner to devise the solutions.When I started out with programming, there were no tutorials. There was no internet. There were barely any knowledgeable people in my (rural) area. It was way back in the first half of the 1980s in the advent of the ""home computers"" (Commodore ViC20, C64, BBC micro, Acorn, Amstrad CPC-464, etc.). All I had was the BASIC (programming language) manual that came with my computer and a lot of curiosity. A bit later, we had some ""programming"" lessons (in double quotes because it was more a joke than anything serious) at school - one lesson per week where 8 people were crammed around 4 Apple II Europlus computers where we initially learnt AppleSoft Basic and later UCSD Pascal. Our teacher made us draw flow charts before we were even allowed anywhere near the computer. This seriously helped. Using a visual representation of the steps to solve our tasks made us think more about the actual steps than about their *implementation* in a programming language.Flow charts, Nassi-Shneiderman charts, bulleted lists, pseudo-code, all of these help and are somewhat underrepresented in modern computer learning. If people started out learning these for short time, they would learn much easier and much faster as most learners don't fail at the *languages*, but fail on *programming*.The above is also the reason Harvard chose to start with *Scratch* for their famous CS50 course. It is a visual programming language (in the style of Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams) that lets the learners focus on the *algorithm* on the *steps* instead of on an actual *programming language* with its keywords and grammar. Yes, Scratch comes across as childish because after all it was designed by the MIT to teach young kids programming, but that is actually the biggest advantage of it. Way too many people dismiss Scratch as childish and useless, yet, had they invested a couple hours with it, they would have seen its value.Way too many posts here are in the tone of ""I've learnt programming language X, Y, and Z, but still cannot program"". Why? Because they all focused on the wrong thing. They focused on the *implementation*, on the *end product*, on the completed car, instead of focusing on the *design process, the considerations, the decisions* that ultimately *lead* to the *implementations*.Similarly, way too many people claim ""they can *read and understand* code, but not *write* it"". Similarly, just because one can *read and understand* novels it doesn't automatically enable them to *write* meaningful, comprehensive, fully developed ones.Then, we have the ""I've watched X tutorials, read Y books, but cannot program"" people. Yes, sure, you know the theory, but you have never applied your skills in practice. This is like sitting in the desert and watching countless Olympic Splash Diving videos and reading all about it. Unless you get wet and actually do it, everything will just be plain theory and you will fail miserably in practice.Practice is the key. Even a step further: independent practice. It's not *copying* tutorial code after tutorial code. It's sitting down, thinking about something to program and starting working on it, without tutorials, without AI (don't get me started on that for learners), only with one's own work.There is nothing wrong with tutorials for a *certain use case*, e.g. for small, detailed, specific parts where one is unsure, but not for entire projects, e.g. the typical ""how to build X in language Y"" ones. If you need something special, e.g. ""how to work with SQLite tables in Python sqlite3"" or something alike, tutorials, blogs, etc. are perfectly fine.Too many people fall into *tutorial hell* because they don't dare to just simply start working on their own. They are afraid of not achieving their goals, they are afraid of failure, which is the completely wrong mindset for programming. Failure is an important part of learning. It is *gained experience*. It is equally important to know how not to do something as how to do something.Then, we have the ""do projects"" people who think that projects need to be huge, complex beasts and that instantly get discouraged by that thought. Again, wrong mentality. Every single program, no matter how small, is a project. One can only grow with their projects. People need to start small and simple and then work their way up to gradually larger and more complex projects.Then, we have the people who despair because they see the huge amount that is there to learn and only look at the summit, at the vast mountain of learning ahead of them instead of looking at the *path* ahead. One does not climb a mountain by just focusing on the summit. One climbs a mountain by looking at the path ahead and taking one step after the other.Then, we have the ones who declare ""programming isn't for me"" after investing mere *hours* (couple days/weeks) without much effort. Learning programming takes effort and doesn't come natural.*Fast tracking* in programming doesn't work (it actually doesn't work in any trained skill). There is no 0 to 100 in no time. Learning anything is a marathon, not a sprint. Slow and steady wins the race.> Recommend any books, courses, etc. that helped you most.Here is a knack. The most helpful books have actually fairly little to do with *programming*. They are about the *design*, the steps before the actual programs.The typical recommendations for this are:+ ""Think Like A Programmer"" by V.

n6d477z,"Is your challenge that you don't know how to break problems down into smaller bits in general, or you don't know how to apply that to programming?If it's the former, a good start is to forget about coding entirely to begin with and think about something in the real world, such as a recipe (e.g. spag bol)At its most basic, you put some cooked bolognaise sauce on some cooked spaghetti. But to be of any use to anyone, you'll need to break both of those down into separate smaller problems - how to make bolognaise sauce and how to cook spaghetti. The spaghetti is fairly easy (assuming you're using dried) - boil some water, add salt, add the spaghetti and cook for 10 mins. That's a reusable little skill on its own that can be used with loads of dishes, and at some point could be switched out for a version where you make the spaghetti from scratch, without affecting the other part of the recipe - the sauce.For the bolognaise itself , it's a bit more complicated - fry the onion, brown the meat, add the herbs and tomato sauce etc. Again, each of those steps can be broken down into smaller ones. E.g. the onion - how to dice it and how to correctly cook it is a stand alone set of skills that, like cooking pasta, will be something you'll do in loads of recipes.What's any of this got to do with coding, you may ask. Those smaller steps - cooking the pasta, slicing the onion etc - are small reusable (and potentially replaceable) steps that are the equivalent of how you'd break down your code into reusable functions, and they all roll up into that top level overall recipe/application.",prof_hobart,2025-08-01 15:17:32,3,learnprogramming,t3_1mertal,False,

n6fg6bw,"Well, to play pong you need1) A window2) 2 vertical lines ('paddles') at either side of the screen3) A circle ('ball')4) The dot needs to bounce between the two lines.5) Both the player, and the computer need to move a paddle each.Making a window is pretty easy if you know how to set up a viewport. You can draw rectangles & circles simply as well. If you're coding in OOP you can even make those classes. Since there's movement, and things are updating, you'll likely need a core game loop - easy enough to track. We can then break things down further: To make collisions, you need to know when a ball collides with a paddle. To know that, you need to know1) The Ball's position 2) The Ball's direction (it shouldn't collide if it's not travelling toward the paddle)3) The Paddle's position (should be mostly static horizontally speaking)4) The Paddle's direction (either left or right)So when the ball's at a point where it could collide with a paddle, check if that paddle overlaps with the ball, and if the ball is travelling toward it. If so, calculate the reflection angle of the ball, apply that to the ball - maybe keep track of the paddle's travel speed and factor that in somehow. If the ball isn't colliding with anything, just let it travel on - adding the sine & cos of its direction to its position values (scaled by speed). Then we gotta add the player in. Let them control the left paddle with their W & S keys, or Up & Down, or their mouse, either way. If they move them (i.e. keep track of the last position of the mouse, and check whether it moves between updates), apply the movement to the paddle vertically (not horizontally) and scale that by how fast you want the paddle to move.For the computer, either create some decision tree (like, if the current ball direction would cause you to miss, move toward it.

For example, if you've never worked with interactive graphics, then you'll be stuck at that point, having to learn what to do.Another challenge is how pong deals with the angles that the ""ball"" bounces. Is this something realistic or is there some pseudo-physics going on? It does seem to roughly obey angle of incidence equals angle of reflection. In other words, figuring out the dynamic behavior is hard.I'd probably try something like Snake where you don't have to deal with those kinds of physics.I think, as people break some of these problems down, they still wouldn't be able to code it up.

There's just people trying to think of programming in a productive way.

n5njnrs,"You have to remember that these terms and design patterns were formed during programming's adolescence. At the time these words were coined, Fortran and COBOL were the dominant programming languages, and they were extremely barebones compared to the modern versions of those languages. It's hard to fathom just how much we take for granted with modern programming languages today.In terms of encapsulation, folks were mostly just proposing what we now think of as modules or classes. Basically, the idea boils down to creating public facing APIs that do not expose their inner variables. I like [this source](https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/01-objects/02-encapsulation/) which quotes from some of the originators of OOP-- Dave Parnas and Alan Kay. > Parnas and his peers pushed for not just hiding the data, but also how the data was manipulated. By hiding these implementation details, they could prevent programmers who were used to the globally accessible variables of early programming languages from looking into our code and using a variable that we might change in the future.Barbara Liskov is another big name in the OOP world, and [she covers encapsulation in this fantastic paper](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/barbara-liskov/data-abstraction-and-hierarchy.pdf)> For abstraction to work, implementations must be encapsulated. If an implementation is encapsulated, then no other module can depend on its implementation details. Encapsulation guarantees that modules can be implemented and reimplemented independently; it is related to the principle of “information hiding” advocated by Parnas [15].Those three formed the basis of all modern OOP concepts. They are the definitive sources. I think much of the confusion comes from the second wave of folks who implemented the popular languages and who each definitely went their own way. Because their languages are so popular, their opinions are almost equally valid despite the fact that they all disagree with each other on minor things.- Bjarne Stroustrup- James Gosling- Brad Cox- Bertrand MeyerAs a side note, when discussing design patterns, there are a few definitive sources:- [Design Patterns](https://www.javier8a.com/itc/bd1/articulo.pdf) by the Gang of Four- Pattern Oriented Software Architecture, most notably volumes [one](https://daneshjavaji.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sznikak_jegyzet_pattern-oriented-sa_vol1.pdf) and [two](https://archive.org/details/patternorienteds0000unse_u5t3)- [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZoranLi/Books1/master/Patterns%20of%20Enterprise%20Application%20Architecture.pdf)However, most of those were written over twenty years ago, so [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/) is a good resource for putting these concepts into a modern context.",jessepence,2025-07-28 18:28:05,5,learnprogramming,t3_1mbmoz8,False,

n63o7r7,"Your steps and understanding of the software development process aren't quite accurate. The way I'd classify the steps, in general terms, is: 1. You download an *SDK* (software development kit)2. You write your code3. You compile/package it (or not, depending on the language)First off, what you're downloading is not the language, as that is more of an abstract concept, it's software that uses the language to build software. That can include an interpreter (e.g. with Python), a compiler (c), a runtime (java), and other tools such as a debugger.Writing your code is what you do with e.g. pycharm, but you can do that with anything. At the end of the day, what only matters is the content of the files, so whether you write it with pycharm, notepad, visual studio, or Morse code doesn't matter (it matters to you of course, not to the machine).And then there's what you're actually inquiring about. This steps is what depends most on the technology you're using. With Python, there isn't really anything more to do: you write your scripts, ...and that's it. You just run them and that's your software. That makes it easy and convenient, but not very user friendly which is one reason why you generally don't use python (directly) for user facing applications. For java, the final step is compiling into jar files, or an exe that will use the jar. That's already what you're doing when testing it while writing the code. The only difference is you might be including or removing some stuff from the final binary that you ship to users. Similarly for other compiled languages such as c and c++, it's the same story. The only difference is, you have to compile for each configuration (architecture, os, etc.), but don't need the user to download a runtime. Then for web stuff like JavaScript, it's a bit more complex since you have to host the website on the internet if you want people to access it. But here it's actually the most similar to what you were describing: you do use a software that brings your software to life, the browser! It's a bit similar to Java's runtime but way more involved I hope this kind of makes sense? It's hard to explain without knowing what you know and understand but hopefully I gave a somewhat clear picture of how it works. And don't worry about not understanding all of it, the world of software is vast and complex and developing software is as much about writing the code than it is about the final steps of deployment!",SpacewaIker,2025-07-31 03:20:22,17,learnprogramming,t3_1mdqhqz,False,

There isn't a single answer for every type of thing you want to build.In general if you want to build an app that you want others to be able to use, here are the most popular options:1. Make a website. It will cost you $10/year for your own domain name like Grumpy\_Gremlin49.com, and $5 - 10/month to host the website. You'll need to learn some HTML and CSS to design the content, but most of the logic can be implemented in Python. The best part about the web is that it's the easiest for end users - they just type in your url and they're immediately using your app.2. Make a mobile app. For iOS it costs $99 to become a developer. You either make an iOS or Android only app using the special languages and frameworks designed for that, or you use a cross-platform framework designed to let you build an app once. There's a framework for making mobile apps with Python (Kivy) but it's not very professional. You upload your app to the play store / app store and then users can download it and use it.3. Make a desktop app. You can do that with Python. The main problem is getting it to users. You'd need a website to distribute it (see #1), and browsers and virus scanners will try to stop users from installing and running it. This is a fine solution for sending to a friend or making an internal app for a business, but these days making a good cross-platform desktop app for end users is a real pain. If you want to make an app for the Mac or Microsoft app stores, that does solve the virus scanner problem but it limits what your app is allowed to do.So your next step is to pick one.

This is to ensure that, when running in production mode/env, things continue to work. These steps will include a task that's referred to as packaging. One of the mechanisms to do this is to containerize your application so that all system dependencies are bundled into the container (Docker is one of the easiest containerization tools; if you want, you should research Docker and Dockerfile).After the above packaging step (the usual artifact at the end of this stage is a deployable unit, in this case called a ""container image""), you will need to then research how/where to host your application. If you are targetting running this code in the cloud (say AWS for eg), you will then need to research and decide whether you want to use Elastic Container Service (ECS) or a kubernetes-based solution. If going with ECS, most of the infrastructure-provisioning will already be taken care of - you will simply sign up for an AWS account, and then configure what tier you want to choose (depending on how heavy your application is and also depending on volume of users). Then comes the actual deployment. I have skipped some steps like unit testing, CI builds, connection to a database, security (both runtime/dynamic scans and static scans). Depending on your comfort level and (I assume) your aim to get to a full-fledged application, you will need to research these as well. Ofc, if your application needs a UI, and assuming your python code is simply exposing API endpoints, you will then need to research react / angular / nextjs / vuejs / etc (javascript frameworks) that will be used to build the UI for your application.

n67xr3o,"Changing a language is kind of dangerous. Imagine a language changed every 3 years. You write a bunch of code this year. Three years from now, they change it, and now your code is broken. Does that seem reasonable? Many beginners feel code changes and they want to learn the latest, not realizing, using the same argument, that in a few years, they'd have to learn something new because the current stuff ""became obsolete"".Of course, 20 years is a long time, but languages that last time often change without breaking.For example, Java has come out with new versions over the past 30+ years. Still, in principle, code written back then would still run now. The biggest changes occurred roughly 20 years ago when generics were introduced. Yes, there are a some other features that came out, but if you stuck mostly to that technology, you'd still be decently fine in Java. You'd only add to that knowledge instead of throwing it away.Keep in mind that code tends to stay around for long periods of time. Code can last 20 years or even longer. If you had to rewrite that code just to keep it up-to-date, that would be crazy amounts of unnecessary work. Beginners think new code is written all the time. They hear Rust is big, so they think millions of lines of Java code are tossed out, and they rewrite it all, not realizing how hard it is to rewrite code. If it took years to write, it takes years to rewrite.Now, there are things that have gotten old, but mostly in web technology. Even so, some still hangs around. I thought PHP went away 20 years ago. It's still around. People still use it because web sites were written 20 years ago. Sure, everyone tells you to learn React or something newer.There was a posted months ago that wanted to learn Carbon, Google's answer to C++. It's not even been released, had no compiler that was available, and is still (for all I know) in limbo today. If they just learned C or Java, they'd be in better shape.Also, many programmers learn more than one language, so even if you never use C again, learning to program translates (somewhat) to learning new languages, so it's not wasted time even if you think it is wasted time.

Apply your own thought process. You don't need to understand a programming language or concept to understand the logic behind the topics you are thinking about. Lock yourself in a room and think about the problem from the base case.For example, why do you need a temp variable to store values when swapping in an array? Well, imagine you are organizing a stack of books. You want to move the one in the 5th position to the 3rd position in the stack. So aks yourself, what do you do? You have some options! First, you could pick them up in your hands and move them to where you want them. Or second, you could pick one up, lets say the 2nd one, and shove it in after the 5th book, shoving every other book after it down, then take the 5th book and put it back where the 2nd book was. Or visa versa.So which option is better? It's a lot harder to move a bunch of books after the 5th book just to shove that 2nd book in there. So lets pick them up and swap instead.You pick up book 2, pick up book 5, and swap them. Ok, so if you wanted to do that on a computer, what's different? Well, you used your hand to store the books temporarily, so it's clear you have to put them somewhere when you swap. But actually, we can do better! Because in a computer things don't physically exist and it's all information, we can just pick one of them up, and copy the other into it's place. Now you can ask yourself, what would happen if I didn't pick up that book before copying over it? Well you'd no longer know what the book was, right? You'd lose all the content, all the pages, the title, everything about that book would have been replaced by the book you just copied into its place. This is the thought process you have to apply to *any problem* you don't understand. Stand with the fundamentals. This actually has a name; ""principles first approach"". This is what I employ to most problems. As you gain more experience, you will start to see parallels and abstractions, and shortcuts you can take with the ""base case"".For example, now that you know you need to store a variable temporarily, and you are asked how to swap elements in a binary tree, or rotate it, you can start your base case at the fact that you'll need at least one temporary variable.Best of luck \~",yodog5,2025-08-01 16:37:05,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mf0jc4,False,

That's like start-up territory.I've done a lot of new hire interviews... And while ever company is free to do whatever they want, in the three companies I've hired for, they all viewed portfolios the same way. It's mostly just talking point to bring up during the interview. It's not a huge deal, in the general case.Lots of applicants will have the same degree and a good GPA but, amazingly, some really will be awful at actually producing code. In the old days, whiteboard/quiz type questions were how we tried to see if someone really could code, but then everyone just started studying specifically for the type of questions that would be asked. I'm really not going to spend more than five minutes looking at a git repo or even a live website or whatever because there are just too many applicants and plenty of applicants are just going to clone somebody else's open source project. It's just something I would ask you about in the interview. I would expect you to be mildly passionate about it, because it's your project, and I would expect you to be able to speak intelligently about how you built it, on a technical level. Counter-intuitively an amazing project can be a reason we don't hire you.If we hire you, we would ask you to sign a non-compete and claim ownership of everything you develop. These contracts weren't always enforceable, and it might be different in your location, but the company wants you to give up your project and work full time on whatever they care about. If your project is so good, so impressive, so huge, that we think in 6 or 12 months it might take off and you would quit to pursue it, you would be a high risk hire. We want the applicant who will stick around for a handful of years. Only twice have I witnessed this. The first was a guy who clearly wanted to develop games. He had an indie game he was in love with and basically admitted he just wanted to make games but had run out of money. The other guy quit his full time job to launch his own app, wrote the app, and didn't sell as many copies as he thought. He was looking for a job but he was clearly super passionate about his app and wanted to keep working and focusing on it. As a person, and a developer who has my own side projects, I get it.

n69rey1,"Github is a hub for 'git' repositories. Each GitHub user can create a folder (called repository) it contains source code (just textual files for code) for software they're developing. The purpose of ""git"" system is to efficiently store each version of file changes that the user made, to save that change the users make ""commits"" with an optional textual message describing what edits/changes they made. The commits have date time stamp, author name and email address. To not dox your GitHub registration email address in your commits history, there's a setting to generate no-reply garbage email address. Users can add repository to their favourites by clicking a ""star"", there's a counter of how many users added the repository to their ""stars"", so it acts like popularity indicator. There's a so called branches in repositories, there's a main branch called ""main"" or classically ""master"". Users can ""fork"" a repository, it copies a repository to their own collection of repositories and after the forking the repository points to the original one with ""remotes"", it's an url of a git repository. You can make changes to this local version of a repository you just forked and then you proceed to make a commit describing what you just changed, then you create a ""pull request"". It's request that's sent to the ""remote"" repository to approve a ""pull"" from your commit, it means getting those chances to his repository. You can turn your GitHub repository into a visitable web site with GitHub Pages. It servers your web site through a link like this: https://.github.io// It can only respond with a content of your files without dynamic functionality like databases and scripting languages. The git is a program that you can use locally on your computer to version your software (or anything else) projects. It creates a folder in your repository named .git (that's hidden in non-Windows operating systems) where it stores file changes and everything about git project. If you don't want some files/folders to be uploaded to remote repo, you can define them in .gitignore file. You can make git repo locally and then upload it to a GitHub (or other git repo hosting websites) GitHub adds more features to the git repositories than it's supported by a git itself, so it's recommended to manage a repo in a GitHub website.

Git is a particular version control software that is very popular. Github is a place where you can store repositories online so that it's not just only on your computer. (To understand the difference, I've heard ""Git is to GitHub as Porn is to PornHub."" Meaning that porn exists outside pornhub, it's just one place to keep it, which is what makes it analagous.)\> And is there a way to bookmark and or like a repository just like you would like a Facebook post or something on Instagram?Github has stars, ""watch"" toggles, forks, and you can just use any standard way you'd bookmark a webpage too of course.\> Could someone just give me a short synopsis of some of the terminology used on the site?If you learn git separately from github, then I think most of the terms you'll understand.The specialized terms are things like a ""pull request"" which wouldn't make sense on just your own computer, but that is you submiting code for someone elses' project and, well, requesting that they pull it into their project. That could be bug fixes or feature implementations or documentation or anything else that makes sense for the project that the original author/maintainer might be interested in. There's also all kinds of options for automatically testing or building, or project management, etc. Frankly no one uses every feature, just the features relevant to their own workflow.\> I want to use it more but I just don’t understand any of the different things you can do.Most of the things it can do won't make sense without knowing git.\> Just to give you an idea, I didn’t build my PC just because I didn’t want to mess it up.Entirely understandable (although maybe I'm more reckless than you since I'm currently trying to fix my GPU with a soldering iron lol), and actually tangentially related to one of the problems version control/git aims to solve. By using git you can keep a history of all the versions of a file with a little note about what changed. That means if something gets messed up, you can maybe not ""easily"" but relatively easily go back to a version where everything in the file/project was in a good state and move on from there rather than hopiing you kept your ""known\_good\_backup\_file.py"" actually unmodified.\> main features someone like me who is not a programmer would need to know to work my way around it.Honestly as a non-programmer probably the main thing to do would be to submit ""issues"" for projects you use that you would notice a bug or miissing feature or whatever in. The exact way to do that varies for every project since everyone has their own preferences, but in general it's appreciated to get feedback from people actually using the tools you make.\> I have used a couple posts to my benefit but each time had someone walk me through setting it up and after that, didn’t have to revisit it so it’s all a foreign language to me.Unfortunately git is just weird, and it takes a little bit of time forcing yourself to use it to get used to it. Ultimately there's like 5-10 common commands but there's way more than that in the tool so it's more intimidatting than it needs to be. Some non-programmers like book authors sometimes appreciate the ""time travel"" ability that it gives them, so it's possible that even without writing code that there's something youd' appreciate using version control for which would help you build up a little more of a habit of using git.",DrShocker,2025-08-01 04:30:56,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mehk37,False,

Great comments are for tricky bits, and to explain the ""why"" behind the code.",SharkSymphony,2025-07-28 06:28:13,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mb7lsi,False,
n5kb8er,"It is relatively easy to write code that the computer understands. The computer doesn't really care about how many variables you use.It is much more tricky to write code other humans can understand. This doesn't really matter in this toy problem, but becomes quite important in larger or longer-term projects.For humans, giving names to things matters. It can be worth pulling outoart of a computation and assigning it to a variable *just to give it a name*. In this sense, variable names and function names serve a similar purpose to comments, but names are easier to keep up to date as the code evolves.Here is how I as a very experienced programmer would refactor that code if this were a production problem (untested): import re import sys EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS = { "":)"": "":slightly_smiling_face:"", "":("": "":slightly_frowning_face:"", } EMOTICONS_PATTERN = re.compile(""|"".join(re.escape(e) for e in EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS) def _emojify(text: str) -> str: # see https://stackoverflow.com/a/2400577 return EMOTICONS_PATTERN.sub( lambda m: EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS[m[0]], text, ) def main(): for line in sys.stdin: print(_emojify(line)) if __name__ == ""__main__"": main()There are a couple of fundamental differences that you might find distracting – using a replacement table instead of `str.replace()`, or transforming all input instead of prompting for a single line. The regex related stuff is a fixed pattern for applying multiple replacements to the same string.But for the purpose of this discussion important observations are:* I think `_emojify()` is a better name than `convert()`. Converting *what*?* I decided against introducing additional local variables. They don't seem to add anything. In particular, naming a value just to immediately return it doesn't tend to provide much useful information to readers.* No comments like ""get input"". Comments are useful for providing information that's not visible in the code. If an `input()` function is called, I can already see that we're obtaining input. The thing that would benefit from a more detailed comment in my version would be the regex stuff, as this is highly non-obvious for people who don't already know this pattern.

The function could just be: def convert(user_input): return user_input.replace("":)"", "":slightly_smiling_face:"").replace("":("", "":slightly_frowning_face:"")but then the reader would have to read all the code to understand what is being returned.Also, I personally prefer to always store the result in a variable before returning or printing it - it helps with debugging, because I can print or inspect the variable, use it in if-statements and so on. The only thing I don't like about your solution 2 is the naming of the variable `final_answer` \- it isn't an answer to anything, and it also doesn't seem very final.

n5krflo,"I don't know what's up with some of these answers. If they don't make sense to you, don't worry, it isn't you.Reusing a variable name is OK here. What you have to watch out for is* ""scope"" - the contexts that a name lives in, within a module/function etc., and* functions that change values, vs. return values.In Python, when you assign a new value to the name ""user\_input"", that is scoped in this case to the whole function. In a larger function body, you might have loops etc., and you can negligently change a name that elsewhere you've been assuming represents its original value. It's OK here, it could be a really bad move in another context. You know, like old school guys like me will use 'i' for an index counter, and then use it again in another loop inside that, and that of course is not going to work right.For the change/return thing ... Somewhat miscategorized as such, because what we have here is a function return. But from an object method. The .replace.replace thing Harvard handed you here, you have to decide what you think about that. It's vaguely familiar as if imported from a ""functional programming"" model, and I think Python programmers commonly get some jollies from doing things like that. But it's a little less transparent what's going on in an OOP object.method model and I personally don't get the attraction. I might split that up into separate assignments to user\_input\*. Consider how that would relate to your question - would you want to reuse user\_input, or have a trail of new identifiers - user\_input, user\_input\_with\_happy, user\_input\_with\_happy\_and\_sad ...?

n5g3dac,"Senior dev from the UK very familiar with UK academic system here.Your 'interesting academic route' isn't at all novel, in fact it's very common. I know plenty of people in the field who did CS and SWE, and similar. It's barely a specialisation really. You will most probably discover that Software Engineering and Cloud Computing undergrad degrees share some kind of ""common first year"" with straight Computer Science degrees and about 10 other ""degree pathways"" at your university, to ensure everyone has the basic knowledge required to move on. After that period, at the beginning of each year, you'll get asked to choose some modules in addition to the core modules totalling the credits for the year. This is the ""specialisation"" aspect. Different degree pathways are just different module choices each subsequent year, which is why many universities allow you to switch between degrees before you get to modules that are only available on certain pathways (essentially change your degree title and pick other modules).Whether or not you will be ahead or behind your peers depends not solely on your degree pathway, but also on how well the *contents* (what you study) aligns with what you would like to do for work. You don't mention this (even though it should be the biggest factor in your decision) but assuming you want to be a Software Engineer, neither CS nor SWE will give you a large advantage over the other, and the module choices available are likely to be very similar. I've never personally met a Software Engineer with a Cloud Computing degree, but this doesn't mean much, as much of the content is likely to be very relevant.You won't save any time, they're the same length. Feel free to skip any work experience years if you're confident in your ability to land a job. Use your best judgement.Note also that employers rarely care deeply about the exact degree title. ""Computer Science or similar relevant degree"" is common to see on job ads. They do often (not always) care that you get a 2:1/2:2 or above. Nobody regards 3rd well. I'll add from personal experience that I've had certain professional opportunities that were only open to people with 1st at undergrad, a full decade *after* getting the degree. You don't know what the future holds so make the most of it. I'm glad I did and richer for it. If you look at how your university calculates your final classification there's often an alternative formula that counts your first year marks (they award you the best mark using all formulas typically), so don't believe any nonsense like ""first year doesn't count"" etc. It might, depending on specifics.Edit to add: **A-levels are not 'instead of' a degree.** **No employer is going to pay much attention to your A-levels alone, and having an undergrad degree is preferred but not a hard requirement, to directly answer the title question.** You just need to take the A-levels that meet the requirements for university courses you're looking at.

You're not necessarily missing out on much if you take initiative on your own to round out the foundational theory you'd typically get in a general CS degree. Just make sure the specialization you’re picking doesn’t lock you in too tightly.

n68498q,"I professionally work on large codebase (~50+ million lines of code) containing a mix of backend and frontend code. We pretty much exclusively use plain-old dependency injection and do not quite use the service locator pattern.This is partly due to the architecture of our codebase, which is a monorepo containing a bunch of microservices. That is, we have one giant repo where all code lives, and the code contains several thousand smaller programs that are managed by different teams and deployed independently at cadences picked by the owning team. (The monorepo + microservice approach makes it easier for each team to move independently while still making it easy to share + reuse + mass-refactor code, etc.)Given this setup, having a central registry is not hugely useful because:1. If we create just one 'registry library' that everybody adds their thing to, it ends up introducing a major bottleneck to builds and tests. When we make a code change, our build system + CI pipeline tries building and testing only code that ends up depending on that code change in some way; having a single common module that nearly every microservice takes a dep on would add an unnecessary bottleneck.2. You don't really get much benefit out of having every single microservice create their own registry and register deps. If you're going through the hassle of this, you may as well just pass in those dependencies directly into your code and skip setting up the intermediary registry.Beyond this though, I personally think service locators are inferior to plain-old-code and dependency injection because:1. Having the dependencies be statically encoded in the source code instead of created dynamically via some magic framework makes it easier for IDEs and static analysis tools to determine where exactly different snippets of code are being used, programmatically update the code, more intelligently pick which tests must be run given certain code changes, perform type checking, etc. So, the less dynamic/runtime wiring we can have, the better.2. It also makes unit testing easier -- there's nothing simpler then just calling a plain-old-function or instantiating a plain-old-class. The less ceremony you can have, the better.3. Arguably service locators make it a little too easy to add new deps. Code that takes a large number of deps is usually a sign of poorly-designed code -- it should be broken up into smaller, better compartmentalized components. So, having a little bit of friction here seems like a pro, not a con.All that said, it's true that these microservices need a way to communicate with each other -- need some sort of [service discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_discovery). This has less to do with code architecture and more to do with the reality that these microservices need to run on a fleet of many thousands of hosts, and so need a way of discovering which IP address any particular microservice replica is serving from at any given time.To do this, we have microservices register their IP address in a system that's pretty similar to DNS; downstream microservices need to hard-code the specific service address and perform a lookup to talk to other microservices they take a dep on.In fairness, the actual code to do all of the above can end up feeling pretty similar to the service locator pattern in practice -- it's just that instead of registering a pointer, we register IP addresses. So, I suppose we do use a variant of this pattern in practice.> are multithreadedI think multi-threadness is irrelevant here. If your code is multi-threaded, your deps need to be thread-safe, no matter how they're passed around.",michael0x2a,2025-07-31 19:56:57,3,learnprogramming,t3_1me3q0l,False,

Because a service locator provides that. Just as an example with my context, I use service locators in game development to provide convenient access to main systems (audio, saving, scene loading). I don’t care about testing or have concerns with multi threading so it doesn’t factor into my decision. I use DI extensively in many other scenarios where I need to be explicit on my inputs.

n68aump,"n general, you should use dependency injection instead of a service locator. However, there are situations where a service locator makes sense..like when you’re dealing with a mix of scoped services, singletons, and transient dependencies. In those cases, you often need to manage the dependencies manually with a service locator, in the sense you control their lifetimes but still use the container to initialize them.",yubario,2025-07-31 20:28:07,2,learnprogramming,t3_1me3q0l,False,
n6eyzvj,"Dependency injection has some pros over the service locator pattern:1. **No hidden dependencies!** \- You know exactly what dependencies an object has just by looking at its constructor, and what dependencies a method has just by looking at its parameter list. You don't have to read through all the implementation details, or figure out through trial-and-error, what services need to be registered in your service locator for things to not break at runtime. If all required dependencies are explicitly listed as constructor and method parameters, the compiler makes it basically impossible to try and construct an object or execute a method without having everything in the right place for it to work (at least if the services passed to the client themselves also use dependency injection, etc.).2. **Safer async initialization** \- If a service returned from a service locator requires some sort of asynchronous initialization before all its methods are ready to be used, then it could easily lead to a situation where a client forgets to check some IsReady property before calling some method, resulting in bugs. Or even if the service is explicitly registered as wrapped inside a promise object, then all clients need the additional complexity of handling waiting for the service to become ready, and unwrapping it. With dependency injection you can naturally always just wait for all services to be fully ready before you even initialize the client and pass them to its constructor. Thus all clients' code can remain very simple and focused, and the asynchronous nature of a few services don't end up spreading around the code base, and causing the whole APIs of all their clients to also become asynchronous in nature.3. **Better support for multiple services of the same type** \- with dependency injection, you can easily at any time pass completely different services to separate instances of the same client type. You can pass a default logger to most of them, but pass a more verbose logger to that one instance that you want to debug more closely right now. If you use a global service locator, then you might just be completely stuck with all instances of a client class being stuck using the same services at any given time. Or even if you use multiple separate service locators, it'll still probably be much way more complicated to swap the service of one client instance in some particular context - potentially even requiring some substantial architectural changes to pull it off.4. **Clients don't have to worry about lifetime management** \- if a client pulls out a service from a service locator, how do they know if they should dispose of it once they no longer need it? Did they get a transient service, or is it a singleton shared between multiple instances? Does the service locator have to return some other information besides the requested service, so that this can be resolved? Do clients just always have to return all services to the service locator, just in case? With dependency injection all the complexity of lifetime management is pulled out from all the many clients in your codebase, and can be centralized into a smaller number of composition roots, where the lifetimes of all the different services is probably more clear.5. **Clear initialization order** \- if services are initialized lazily by a service locator, in whatever order they're requested by clients, then their initialization order can become an unknowable, unpredictable black box, where the order of initialization can change drastically due to small changes in the implementation details of clients. This can potentially lead to random spooky-action-at-a-distance bugs, where a small change to some object causes a chain effect, resulting in some event being raised before some service has had time to subscribe to it, causing things to silently break. With (pure) dependency injection the initialization order is super clear, and doesn't just suddenly change ""by itself"" without you being aware of what has happened.",sisus_co,2025-08-01 20:40:55,1,learnprogramming,t3_1me3q0l,False,

There are two approaches. The first is polling, which is fine if updates can be delayed by a bit. iPhone email polls. The second is the CometD protocol which keeps a long lived socket open between client and server that closes after either a three minute timeout or when a “push” update is returned. This is inefficient in terms of open tcp sockets for the server and cannot massively scale but can support client counts in the thousands or tens of thousands.If you control the servers, you would allow inbound connections to the database and secure that point using a firewall and likely a vpn for an internal server. You would also strictly authenticate connections including restricting senders to known ip ranges.

n5xfzlr,"The whole industry has been feeding on its own grift for a while now.Ever tried explaining SCRUM to someone who doesn't work in tech? They'll look at you like you take the short bus to the office.The average software engineer now applies to over 400 job postings for every interview. And many of those interviews are what, 6 rounds? No other industry comes close to that. And it's not an imbalance of supply and demand. It's a hiring practices problem.Don't even get me start on leetcode. Yes, I know it's supposed to weed out the fakers so the company doesn't end up with a bunch of devs who can't code their way out of a paper bag. And yet those same companies still end up developing massive piles of overcomplicated crapware. Almost like the devs aren't the bottleneck. Also, senior devs can spot the fakers a mile away.And now with the vibe coding. I'm seriously considering starting a new service that just fixes the messes people make with their vibe coded apps. I bet I'd make bank by advertising it with a bunch of LinkedIn posts saying how the service will ""take their vibe code to the next level"". Cannot wait for that bubble to burst.Thing is, it wasn't like this even 10 years ago. These are all problems the tech industry has created for itself.Now for the fun part. To people outside the industry, your skills are like magic. And it's not even the complicated CS stuff.Do you have any idea how many small businesses out there are paying marketing agencies to do SEO for them, yet they don't even have access to their own traffic data? And the agencies make up excuses because really they're just Wordpress shops that can't get their tracking pixels hooked up to Salesforce correctly so the data is useless and they can't say that part out loud.The reason so many people are talking about AI (aside from the grifters and enterprise salespeople) is because they want to be able to do the things you can do. They want their tech to work the way they think it should, yet every time they talk to a dev shop about it they end up talking about nonsense like user stories and sprint timelines.It took me way too many years to figure this out. The kicker was when I was working as consultant and somehow ended up on a small side project that was basically setting up a SquareSpace site for a local business. Our sales guy managed to bill it out at $150/hour. For a SquareSpace site. My techie brain thought this was a drastic overcharge because I thought the whole point of SquareSpace was that you didn't have to hire someone to do it for you. But for that local business that sold old muscle car parts, SquareSpace was over their head and it was worth $150/hour to have me do it for them.Eventually I got fed up building the umpteenth enterprise iOS app so I quit working with companies that do anything enterprise-y at all. It's too soul sucking.And you know what? Turns out it's not so hard to sell my skills to non-tech companies. What I think is easy is what they think is magic. That's a win-win.They don't buy unit tests (not that I want to write them), but they're game for anything that helps their sales funnel.My advice for anyone burning out in the tech industry is this. You probably see your skills and dedication to quality as an investment for a company. They probably see you as a cost center. So next time you get stressed by the nonsense, start thinking about how to apply what you know in ways that would help non-tech companies. Think outside the box. Then do the hard part and reach out to a few of them. You might be surprised at what you learn and end up with a whole new perspective on how all this really works.If nothing else, the experience will certainly help you write better Upwork proposals.",Comfortable-Tart7734,2025-07-30 05:18:29,31,cscareerquestions,t3_1mcop22,False,

Those things don't matter on the job, and they don't matter in the interview. It's the problem solving they care about. Usually interviewers make it clear you can ask them syntax questions like that, or other nudges AI-as-a-tool would normally help you with.

n5l79ou,"A lot of potential for misinformation and speculation here, so will chime in as someone that has worked in contracting for 8 years.During economic uncertainty, contracting firms really start to struggle. A really successful small firm could die in a month if they were to lose two contracts back-to-back. For the huge companies, any sign of work slowing will often result in teams being let go. They're usually done silently, but in this case it's likely to be more noteworthy because layoffs and offshoring are popular right now. From a business perspective it's good, because it makes you look efficient. After all, if everyone else is doing it, it's fine, right...It's also worth noting that in contracting firms, a LOT of people might be classed as technical/service staff when their job is essentially a PM or AM role, basically tracking work, making sure the client is happy, etc.Finally, this is my own personal perspective on contracting, but the idea that a contracting firm will have any advancements in AI is utterly laughable. It's not even a skill issue, but one where work will need to be billed to a client, and there's no fucking way that TCS is billing someone for the time taken to mess around with AI issues. Contracting firms often believe that they're at the forefront of technology, but my experience of subcontracting for TCS was arguing with a PM because I had written unit tests and they viewed it as ""unnecessary work we will not pay for"". When I pushed back, their response was ""well, it should work first time"". It's an environment of shortcuts, and while they probably love the idea of AI doing dev work, it'll end in tears without any shadow of a doubt.",EnderMB,2025-07-28 11:08:54,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1mb7cxe,False,

AI as a whole has gone from being research-dominated to production-dominated.For example, in the past developing a tailored model and infrastructure for a specific NLP task required significant R&D effort. These days it's much more often about fine-tuning a foundation model and getting that model into deployment. You want someone with strong academic knowledge about AI/ML, sure, but you also want people who can make things reliable and ship products on time. If someone can do both, that's ideal.With regards to the NLP example, the Quanta podcast recently had a good episode titled [""When ChatGPT Broke an Entire Field""](https://open.spotify.com/episode/22Q9bVUucdeSK3LDXicjwx?si=-Dpeunr5S6OtUTX4vr-6Kg&context=spotify%3Aplaylist%3A37i9dQZF1FgnTBfUlzkeKt) (based on [this magazine article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/when-chatgpt-broke-an-entire-field-an-oral-history-20250430/)).

n5u9y2w,"50-70 applications per day seems like not a lot of bang for your buck. I'd focus in more on specific roles using specific skillsets, then have templated, tailored resumes for those roles. Right now, your resume seems a little scattershot. As an example of what I mean, in your language skills section you have Java listed first, which tells me you'd be most comfortable in Java, but none of your projects or experience mention Java anywhere, so I don't have much to go off of regarding how skilled you actually are in Java other than current coursework from mthree, which doesn't tell me much.I was in a similar boat as a new grad, and it took me 10 months to get a job (2 months after graduating). I would have 2-3 resume's with the same or similar information, just re-ordered to fit the job description. Is the job a front-end position using React and TypeScript? You better believe I'm putting that first on the resume. If the job is enterprise Java, then Java, Spring, JUnit are all going to bubble up to the top. Normally I'd suggest having a cover letter too, but it just so happened that all my callbacks came from applications with no cover letter, so your mileage may vary. Last thing I will absolutely recommend is to **bold** the **relevant skills** in your **experience** and **personal projects**. So things like **TypeScript, Tailwind, etc.** should be bolded. HR people don't have a lot of time to sift through applications, so the easier you make it for them to find the technologies they need to see the better. Don't go too crazy with it though. If around 15% of the text in your bullet points are bolded, I'd say that's good. That's just the path I took though, there's other ways to go about this. My job hunt was from November 2024 to this month and took about 300 applications sent total , but I got the best results most recently when I was only sending 2-3 applications out per day to places I was 100% sure wanted new grads with little to no experience. I'd also like to know what your application-to-interview ratio is. For me and the people around me, it was normal to get 1 interview for every 50 applications or so. If you're not hitting that (or anywhere close to that I'm guessing) then you might be applying to places too liberally. That's all I've got! Good luck, going that long without a job is rough. P.S. if your personal projects fall on the gaps in your employment, it might be worth putting the timeframes you worked on the projects.

I think here's where you can be a bit ambiguous and say you worked in a software developer capacity but not specify or limit yourself to their perception.\- Maybe I'm just dumb but I basically don't understand what any of the projects under Key System Implementations do at first glance. Recruiters with even less technical experience and patience, might glaze over it or hit the reject button when looking for buzzwords. I'd either try to simplify the language or concepts of what you actually delivered or just tailor this section to specific types of jobs (like how in these projects you used Python etc. to deliver).\- Probably remove the EE degree in progress as it's not really relevant or use it in your EE-only resume.\- The undergrad teaching assistant role sounds like fluff, and no employer really cares about how many assignments you graded etc. you should probably write something along the lines of what you taught and areas of focus you excelled at teaching like red-black trees or something etc. Or try and take a look at other undergraduate TAs on Linkedin or something and see what they wrote. To me, at least it seems very ""I want a TA job.""Last point is you probably want to tailor your resume to each of those roles you listed that you're applying for.

And even if AI does automate most human labor, licensed Engineers still have state granted authority to sign off on safety critical projects (this matters more in an age with powerful AI, because powerful means dangerous).

It is relatively easy to fuck around for 4 years and walk out with a degree. But if you limp your way through a STEM degree without fully internalizing the content and setting aside time for relevant clubs and student associations, you're not getting much more than debt out of school.There are plenty of things you can do in the mean-time if you want to focus on being young for a little while.2) Only go into a major you actually have some passion for. Engineering is a lifelong grind. You need to always be learning new things, taking classes, and skilling up. A lot of people in software burn out or decay because it's too draining to grind something you hate.3) The most important thing your college gives you access to is not the degree. It is professional work experience through internships and co-ops. Your entire college career should be centered around securing as much work experience as possible as early as possible.

Learn what they do. You will eventually save someone from a million dollar mistake because you will have awareness of things that no one else does. Make people like you and see you as useful. You will get many more opportunities that way.\- Learn your tools and technology stack deeply. In the AI era it's more important than ever. It just takes a few books.

It does help to make your resume look a bit nicer and might get you a slightly higher role and pay off the bat, but to me it's not worth 2 years of missing out on experience to do for an extra 5k-10k in pay you would've just likely had if you started to work. The key really is if you can get a job to pay for your masters degree. So in summary, it's not worth the MSCS unless you get someone to pay it for you or if you can escape paying minimal and not having to get loans. I had my job pay it for me and I grinded for 2 years as a part-time student and only had to pay 5k out of pocket those 2 years. But I also did summer courses as well to finish on time. As for your leetcode grind. I am not someone who really thinks you need to ""grind"" leetcode to get a job. You can and might be good at it to land the job, the problem is that many people think they can just grind it and dont care to learn the ins and outs of what they are doing. So they basically are hoping to get a similar question where they can think ""omg that's leetcode question #100 or similar to it, i just need a map"". But they dont care to learn why they need the map, or if there's a slightly different approach they could take. I have been in the job market twice in my career, never had to grind leetcode and I got into two big tech companies (one of them a Mag7 company) by just following a google DSA guide I will link below. It has videos from cracking the coding interview author that explain DSA very well. Also links free leetcode study guides with example questions to practice on. Companies dont care if you get the questions right, they only care if you know what you are doing and explain your thought process well in the questions. I got both those jobs and didnt do 100% well on the questions. A few times I got stuck but because I explained my thought process well they liked my approach. They know you wont get it 100% off the bat, they just want to know where your heads at. So for me i like to say ""hey i think I can possibly use a map here because of XYZ possibly a set"" and then I try it. I also go step by step. So usually the first thing I tackle is the return cases. I.e. if I am doing a array traversal the first thing I write is the return case if array is empty. It sounds dumb, but they appreciate when you tackle the small things first that could easily be forgotten. Also it's one of those things of once you start coding your nerves go down even if it's a simple lin. Then at the end I write test cases and try to go through multiple different cases (empty array, edge cases, etc). If any of them come out wrong, then I quickly refactor.Google DSA link is: [https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/)",Broad-Cranberry-9050,2025-07-28 18:19:39,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1mbmvot,False,

I wasnt just taking his word as the god given truth. Now in my second job, I could never figure out the hostile dev. He had no people skills that I could crack. In a lot of ways I compare him to Michael Jordan. He was the guy that knew everything of the project. He produced in his sleep. He didnt mind working 12 hour days. He told managers how to do their job. I fhe didnt like your work ethic, he didnt want to work with you. And I think he realzied early on he didnt like my work ethic (Im more of a9-5 guy). I worked with him on a major project he had created and it went terribly. I kept finding erors and had to change my design like 20 times because each time I came up with a design, another problem would come up. Then he gave my manager a list of his complaints of me. My manager kind of walked on eggshells for him tbh. I will admit some was fair, but others just seemed unfair. The biggest one I remember that I felt was unfair was that my manager said that I have too many commits in my MRs. That happened once and it was because the design changed so much. I fought it but my manager even 6 months later was still using that against me. I ended up getting fired. I dont blame that dev but it defintelty felt like the beginning of the end when I wasnt on his good side.",Broad-Cranberry-9050,2025-07-29 17:25:04,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1mce6wv,False,

n5v3kse,"So, I’m a senior and we’ve dealt with devs and senior devs like this on my last few teams. Sometimes they do this to cover their own mistakes using a highly visible chat. Sometimes they are completely clueless people that don’t understand that using a wide audience chat is not how you deal with things.So, we’ve fixed this a few ways. First step is to document every single time they call you out on a wide audience chat of any kind. If this person does this to others, probably should document that as well. The more records you have the better. Screenshots are also preferred.Second step is to let your manager know that you don’t appreciate being put on blast by this other dev in a company wide chat especially when they you’re not at fault for the issue. Include your record of every time they call you out specifically and what the actual issue was that had to be resolved. Ask your manager how this should be handled. The wrong answer is “nothing”. We had to do a meeting where all the devs agreed to not individually name people even in our team only chat for issues. Senior Devs can ping people directly and handle it not in a chat.Third step is if this behavior continues and your management doesn’t do anything, notify HR with your documentation. Make sure you have save this documentation somewhere you have access to in case they retaliate (manager, HR, senior dev).On most of my teams, we never had to get past step 2. Only once did we have someone get to step 3 and HR talked to the offending dev and manager. Behavior stopped for a few months and then started up again. In that case, the guy was gone in like 48 hours after he started again because he started blaming people who weren’t on our team or didn’t work on the project with issues.",Enabling_Turtle,2025-07-29 20:58:59,0,cscareerquestions,t3_1mce6wv,False,

Follow your interests too but with intention. If you're curious about DevOps, play with CI/CD pipelines.

n5x5t9y,"You need to learn how to code on a team, and usually the best place to do that is product teams that are PM driven and essentially feature factories. I'm not sure what infra you are working on, but when I took an infra job, I ultimately left because I was frustrated with the shit code we wrote and the lack of any sort of real development work. I did all sorts of stuff with cloudflare tunnels, DNS migrations, and dealt with TLS certs, plus on call. The work I really wanted to do, on the database engine, was just not a priority for us, compared to cloud operations.I've seen juniors and new grads do well on infra teams, so it's definitely possible, but all things career progression depend on how much you excel in your roll, and the opportunities your org has to promote you. I'd say that's equally true as a junior engineer trying to make senior in 5 years, as it is for a senior trying to make staff and looking for projects with company wide impact, at least under the system of stack ranking that will average on the organization level.I basically left infra to go back to product, and am trying to make staff now as a team lead. There's no shortage of impactful projects, especially if you can step up and be a leader. I am hesitant to think one domain mints more staff engineers than another, and I'm staring down a company wide rollout of our project for next year, so that hasn't been the case with me.In my experience, the biggest factor is just what you want to do. I tried infra, didn't like it, so went back to product. If you like infra, do it, the amount of work is pretty much insane, and when you don't like it, you'll really struggle to outcompete the equally smart people who do.

n6a5vay,"I landed on an infra/platform team as a new grad at a f500 household name fintech. I was misled and thought I'd be doing mobile, it was a miscommunication during the team matching process. I've been on the team for 3 years. To be honest, it has been pretty miserable, and I actually think it has hindered my career.My team is very top heavy, its all senior and staff engineers. We maintain the service mesh, the problems are all pretty abstract and challenging and require a serious knowledge of the *entire* system, and every item we own is a tier0 critical service meaning zero room for failure. It requires both breadth and depth of knowledge. So finding junior-appropriate tasks was really difficult for the first couple of years. Most of our time is spent putting out fires and handling incidents, and dealing with horizontal asks. The work is hard and the on-call toil is extremely stressful, the work life balance is bad, and the work is simply not fun. It is more of a devops/sre role than SWE, and I am not actually building or creating anything, the work is not fulfilling. I expressed some concern to management that I was not writing enough code and was missing out on vital early-career experiences to hone the basics, but everybody always changed the conversation to tell me how lucky I was to have the opportunity to learn system design and get exposure to kubernetes (sound familiar, OP?). Unsurprisingly, when I finally decided I wanted to switch teams, I was told that I couldn't because I don't have enough experience writing code and other managers want to see evidence that I have worked on substantial projects with object oriented languages. So at my company, I am basically stuck. I worry that if I look for a job elsewhere using another stack, they will think I don't have the skills they are looking for (or that I will land the job anyway and then struggle to ramp up). I do not want to work in similar roles in the future. Going from devops back to SWE is hard - so choose carefully.I think that infra/devops is something that people tend to do when they get tired of app development and are seeking more complex challenges. Some people really just enjoy this type of work, as well, but my experience is they tend to embody the negative stereotype of misanthropic back-end developers, more-so than regular SWEs. That is anecdotal, admittedly. I also think that having a background in regular SWE work will help somebody do better with devops once they eventually get there - it is hard to maintain a platform for service owners to develop microservices on top of, when I have never really done it myself. I do not believe in the idea of ""take on something extremely challenging as a beginner, and rise to the occasion"". Science has shown that this is not the most ideal pedagogical approach. It is like weight lifting: give me a 300lb weight, and no matter how long you let me try, I won't ever get strong enough to lift it. Give me multiple plates and let me progressively try heavier ones, and I will eventually get to the heavier ones.This is just my experience. I struggled to find mentorship and that is a big part of it. The team is constantly busy with high-severity urgent incidents, nobody wants to make time to answer questions and help me. It's been a really shitty experience and I burned out very quickly.tldr: I advise against it, but in this labor market, it may be wise take what you can get.",asteroidtube,2025-08-01 02:36:56,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1mcwau7,False,

Sometimes the skill is also in realizing that they've asked the wrong question and proposing an alternate question with a more useful answer.Unless you've very recently answered the same question for someone else, or the question is related to the work you were doing moments before the conversation began, being able to give a deep, accurate, off the cuff answer is not expected. Give the best answer you can in the moment, be clear that it's a preliminary answer, tell the person you'll get back to them with a more complete answer soon, and then follow through on that promise as quickly as possible, e.g. via email or chat. (In my position, the real challenge is having time to follow up on question A before I get questions B, C, and D coming in...)The other senior engineers you see answering questions off the cuff are either answering about their current work, or giving a rehearsed answer to a common question, or (worst case) bluffing about how complete/correct their answer is.
