Analytics focused pipelines and business logic (more advanced dbt models such as mrr models). Technical overlap with the data engineers and business logic overlap with the analysts. Not so much focused on optimal usage of compute and so on but more focused on business.Data analyst -> data modelling in dbt to the specifications of the analytics engineers and data engineers and most importantly of course: analytics. The analysts in our company also write similar models to the analytics engineers but usually with less of a focus on complex models and more of a focus on analyses. Though that can vary on a need by need basis.The data engineer never does analytics or visualisations and neither does the analytics engineer. However, all are required to work with git and dbt. We also require knowledge in these technologies for analysts but most analysts would no know how to set up a dbt project or how to structure it. That's not their focus. But they still need to understand dbt well enough to create models and run tests, for example.Data engineering is definitely still viable. Basically, they are the people that keep the data sphere clean from a technical point of view and most knowledgable when it comes to setting up infrastructure (the analysts will never set up a dockerized dagster ec2 instance to orchestrate pipelines, neither will the analytics engineers, at least no in our company). And everything downstream hinges on that technical ability. For example: I, as a data engineer, run around the dwh and pick up queries to optimise. I can often reduce runtime from something like 1 hour to 2 minutes by configuring materialisation and implementing proper requirements for partition pruning (snowflake).

Objectively speaking, a DL/DLH offers the most flexibility and range of technologies. Many services, cloud providers, and other stacks will work natively with open formats in a DL/DLH. So you can always leverage or pivot different technologies. And it’s a lot more forgiving in an architecture choice. You can mix and match lots of different stacks on the same data if desired. When talking with customers and users, this is typically the place we start for the above reasons. DWH on RDBMS or similar technologies are usually proprietary formats. Like SQL, Oracle, Snowflake, etc. Assuming you are not leveraging newer features to store in open formats. That isn’t meant to discourage or trash DWH it’s just you need to understand the goals of the platform, requirements, and how users consume and develop to see what would be best. For example, the above about DL/DLH are objectively better at transformation engines and scalability. However, if your users eat and breathe TSQL, and refuse to learn anything else.

This allows for much more flexibility in the schema definition.Second, dataframely provides a bunch of features that patito does not currently implement:* Support for composite primary keys* Validation across groups of rows (i.e. grouping by one or more columns, ensure that the _group_ satisfies a condition)* Validation of interdependent data frames with a common primary key (dataframely introduces the concept of a ""Collection"" here: invalid data in one data frame can then also remove rows from another data frame)* ""Soft-validation"" via `filter` which allows to partition data frames into rows that satisfy the schema and rows that don't* Structured info about failures that can be used e.g. for more debugging or advanced logging* Integration of the schema with external tools (e.g. export to SQL schemas)* Automatic data generation for unit testing, both for individual data frames and collections (in this case, dataframely takes care of generating rows with common primary keys to allow rows to be joined)",borchero,2025-04-18 09:54:33,4,dataengineering,t1_mnqcsrw,True,

Sure, spark sql can work as a general query engine, but it wasnt really designed for that.There’s some differences under the hood, particularly around how spark executes in stages, and uses more I/O steps than Trino.Essentially, for ad-hoc queries that change frequently, or you rerun things to change and shape results, Trino will nearly always be more performant. You can make some tweaks with a spark application (and then run it interactively to try and do the same), but tbh, Trino’s entire design, really, is for extremely fast reads on object storage datalakes.Spark is better places for wide ranging transformations, that are potentially more complex in nature. A good example here is the fault tolerance nature of spark, which matters way more in big batch pipelines, than analytical ad hoc queries. Sure, data loss and the task fails, just re fire the query. In a pipeline, you cant manually do that if its all running automated. Again, different horses for different courses in my opinion.I see it a bit like:Spark was a natural successor to Hive, for better big data transformation.Trino was a successor for something like Impala, as a faster query engine over datalakes",Some_Grapefruit_2120,2025-04-19 11:17:44,13,dataengineering,t3_1k2tgbe,False,

A zoo of tools is indeed something one wants to avoid but at the same time forcing all your work through one tool just for the sake of having only one tool forces you into compromises that are not worth it against the benefit of the smaller stack Spark also works well as a “just in case” tool instead of the general go to thing depending on your platform.

For example, I’d like to get notified (e.g., via email) when a sensor value crosses a certain threshold, so I can keep an eye on whether the sensors are functioning properly.In that case, I might need to look into the data around that event, but most of the time I wouldn’t be constantly querying the live data. The system doesn’t need to be real-time either – near real-time is absolutely fine. On average, I might just visualize a handful of values per day unless there’s an issue.What is important, though, is that I’ll download each day’s data as a file for later analysis. I plan to convert the raw data into an MDF format with a daily job and then process it elsewhere. So everything I store, I will at least once download.That said, it’s really hard to estimate how often I’ll query or access the data, since that heavily depends on whether problems occur or not.",Shot-Fisherman-7890,2025-04-17 16:12:21,2,dataengineering,t3_1k1etqr,True,

The result was that they now have an AI chat interface where users can ask super abstract questions, like *“Which municipality had the most new companies in 2024?”* or *“Tell me about this specific person and all the companies they’re involved in”* — and it just works.

mnxgrw2,"I've done it before but generally I recommend against bidirectional syncs when transitioning from one storage to another because it's so easy to mess up: the system becomes very eventually consistent, one stream can have higher lag than another one, and you might have infinite circular updates if both streams rely on CDC and you sync same table(s) by accident. Tooling in this case is probably irrelevant - you just need careful engineering and separation of groups of tables that are being synced. Typically migrations are handled by modifying writers which temporarily write to both DBs. I'd probably stay away from Kafka/other queues because they will increase your synchronization lag. I can probably say more if you provide more details. What maximum latency are you looking for? I'm looking at a similar setup in production right now (MySQL -> PostgreSQL) and I see that under load P95 latency (time of write in destination minus time of creation of item in source) is about 850 ms.

The image is tagged in a way that separates my teams images from others and also provides info about GitHub repo, branch, developer, team, etc3. Using airflow we trigger that docker image into a containers in our test environment. The image is triggered on Kubernetes using our internal api tools and airflow action.4. The code is now tested through the running container on the test environment. If there are issues, the code is fixed and the above process is triggered again5. The test environment is a mirror image of the prod environment so we monitor the behaviour of the pipeline, check logs, analyse observablity metrics on datadog to ensure that the pipeline works as per expectations6. To test the data, we have an testing module which acts as a defence layer named lighthouse. Lighthouse automates running test sql scripts on our spark dataframe. The queries are written in a way that negative issues can generate rows. If all tests pass, the dataframe is ready to be written in data lake.7. In the data lake, we do another round of adhoc testing to double check if everything works well8. Once done, a PR is raised and the code is merged into the main branch. This triggers another github action workflow that updates the production docker image of our data pipeline.9. The same image is triggered via our production airflow. Since we already have tested on test environment, it’s just the same code running on production so we are mostly sure that it would run.10. The final dataset on production as scheduled data check and alerts using collibra. This helps us getting issues beforehand and fixing it.11.

People like to think if they can touch their server or hug their storage, it is better than hosting it in the cloud. It just isn't true. There are more controls in the cloud for access control and security than I have seen in anyone's data center and I have seen many Fortune 100 companies data centers. Starting from physical security to data in flight & at rest to designs clouds are almost always able to be more secure. The issues come with knowledge and implementation. This is the same no matter the location.I have secured data in cloud providers where not even the CSP can get to them and they remain very performant. It just takes a bit of creativity on your part.From an architectural standpoint, splitting your analytic workload across a wide area network is a bad idea. The physics just work against you. The bandwidth between on-premises and cloud is never enough. Consider bouncing a 1TB table at one location against a 1TB table at a different location. Even with tricks like predicate pushdown and column reduction, you will still end up moving quite a bit of data to compare/join the tables. That has to happen over a WAN instead of an internal bus.

mn3t969,"Some hard-won advice on this topic: 1. Have a good working relationship with your manager. Build trust. This will ensure they _actually hear you_ when you ask to take on opportunities to push yourself. Pushing yourself without this trust can cause your manager to view you as self-sabotaging (causing delays, ""biting off more than they can chew""), which makes everything harder. 2. Identify the developers on your team (or close to your team, this includes DevOps, architects, and even senior QA) who actually care about the quality of their work. Like someone else in this thread said, many people work in software simply because of the pay. Sometimes the ""this is just a job"" people are very talented engineers, but it's not as likely. When you find the people who really care, pair with them on your work, go to them with questions, etc. 3. Don't waste time, but ask questions when you can. In particular, if someone more experienced than you has work you can look at (e.g. in a pull request), and their implementation doesn't line up with how you would have approached the problem, ask them (politely/when it's convenient) to help you understand why they chose their approach vs your ""obvious"" approach. A major strength of more senior engineers is their ability to perceive/understand complicating factors, with nuance (see the last sentence in #4). A word of warning here... don't ask endless follow-up questions/don't get really in the weeds on every little thing. You run the risk of being seen as overly pedantic, nitpicking, or wasting time (for the pull request example, keep in mind that often the PR is only a final ""does this make sense to everyone?"" check before merging new code. So a developer might not appreciate having long conversations on every PR. For this reason, having a conversation or DMing them is often better than leaving a vague question as a PR comment). 4. Get involved in the design process as _early_ as possible. If you have the opportunity to sit-in on a meeting with an architect/dev lead while they design a new feature/project/service, _do it_. You won't be able to contribute (probably), and that is fine. But especially if these people are the ones you identified in #2, watching them work through a complex problem from the beginning will be a great learning experience. A big part of having engineering expertise is knowing what's important vs what is not important to the actual business requirement(s) (especially as it relates to the existing constraints of your application), not just knowing the ins and outs of your language/framework. 5. Talk to your coworkers about the work and build up your reputation as someone who cares. When you discover cool language features or software development practices, bring them up with people (""I found this cool HN article the other day talking about , do we use that here?""). Then, when other devs are working on something new, they'll think ""I bet /u/Spiritual_Donkey_521 would love to hear about this.""

mnx51jd,"*This is long, feel free to TLDR and move on.*Here's the problem with interviewing programmers. Most of us work with a large codebase that can take quite sometime to learn and work with, partly due to its size, partly due to its organization, and partly due to knowing what the program does. Consider a tax program. How long would it take for you to learn the various tax codes used to determine how much taxes you owe? OK, maybe if the software was well-designed, that part would be isolated to areas where tax experts could work on that logic.But in many other situations, as part of building the software (or, more likely, maintaining it), the programmer becomes the de facto expert.If I'm interviewing you, I can't have you look at our production software. Let's skip past the fact that it might be proprietary. Simply put, in an hour interview, you can't learn enough to absorb even a fraction of the details (which is often why people feel completely insecure when they're hired and have to deal with software that they don't understand).In the past, sometimes the key was graduating from a top university. If you went to Stanford and could answer basic questions, then that degree could get you hired. The reputation of the university was enough. It was also common to ask people brainteasers (I'll give you one in a moment). It was thought if someone was intelligent enough to solve brainteasers, they would be good coders. Turns out, not so true. Some people love and are good at brainteasers (for example, I liked brainteasers) and this can make such people feel perfectly qualified. After a while, the so-called FAANG companies realized brainteasers didn't really help.The technical questions that were often asked in interviews were often confined to intro courses up to data structures and algorithms. That's because the typical CS major takes a bunch of optional electives in their 3rd and 4th years (in the US). You can't assume a person knows SQL or neural networks or undecidability or even NP completeness (at least, proofs of such problems).They'd ask basic coding questions, instead.But with leetcode, they can ask similar kinds of questions that rely on data structures and algorithms. These problems are self-contained, and more importantly, can be programmed without learning much and done in around 100 lines or less.This is clearly not the kind of programming most people do which is why you're not so good at it. This skill is kind of important, but it's like learning knife skills and being able to chop something quickly. Maybe a working chef needs this skill. Maybe it's nice if a home chef has this skill. But you can make a great dish without this skill. It's a nice to have that may come in useful in certain situations.You can do a simple search `how to solve leetcode problems`. There's even a leetcode subreddit /r/leetcode. There's a YouTube channel called neetcode where the guy tells you strategies to solve leetcode style questions. It's popular enough that there are lots of resources out there.These questions have become today's brainteasers. They share similar qualities, but they are also unrelated to most typical programming.Finally, I mentioned a brainteaser, so here is a common one.> You have eight seemingly identical balls. One ball out of the eight is heavier than the other seven identical balls. Your goal: find the heavier ball. Your tool: you have a scale that tells you three pieces of information: the left side is heavier than the right side; the right side is heavier than the left; the two sides have equal weight.> Next piece of information: If I put an uneven number of balls on either side, say, 2 balls on one scale and 1 ball on the other scale, then the side that has more balls is *always* heavier.> One restriction. Each time you use the scale, I will charge you money. You want to save as much money as possible. What's the fewest number of weighings you need to find the heavier ball? And, tell me how to find it?The other kind has to do with estimation or weird mental puzzles. * How many gas stations exist in the US?* If a commercial plane had its wheels on super treadmills that could go very fast, but the plane stood still (just as a runner on a treadmill doesn't go anywhere), does the plane lift off? Explain your answer.Sorry for the long reply.

mmwvpnr,"This is a great question.The short answer is that they do easy tricks, like replacing a multiplication by 0. They don't do many for complex tricks because analyzing the number to see if the trick applies would take longer than just computing the answer.So how fast can a modern processor ""grind everything out"" for something like an integer multiplication?The important thing to understand is that it's hard-coded in circuitry. It doesn't have to execute a bunch of steps to multiply, one at a time - the circuits are right there in the chip and they parallelize as much as possible.That said, multiplication is not instantaneous. On a modern processor you can expect it to take 3 - 5 clock cycles, whereas something like addition can be done in 1 clock cycle.So, it is worth checking for some really easy tricks like multiplying by 1 or 0. Maybe multiplying by 2 even. Those checks are simple enough that the processor can detect them when decoding the instruction and shift it to another instruction, and that's exactly what's done.But, there are a lot of ""tricks"" that humans use to save time that wouldn't make sense for computer processors, because they can just ""grind out"" the answer faster than checking it.In general when you write code in a language like C or Python, the compiler/interpreter does some easy optimizations, and then your processor does some easy optimizations. Neither of them are likely to do tricky optimizations - they're usually just not worth the cost.There are specialized mathematical programming environments, like Mathematica, where using number theory and other advanced tricks are possible.",dmazzoni,2025-04-13 15:55:37,8,learnprogramming,t3_1jya33j,False,

So if you add 01 and 01 you get 10, if you add 10 and 01 you get 11. So you can look at this as a truth table. For the first bit if you have:0 + 0 = 0 1 + 0 = 1 0 + 1 = 1 1 + 1 = 0 (with a carry)Electrically this is a xor circuit. If they are both 0 or 1 the first bit of the sum is 0, if the are different values then the first bit of the sum is 1. Now for the second bit of the sum you have the logic:If there is no carry from the first bit, xor the second bits. If there is a carry then you now have the truth table:0 + 0 = 1 0 + 1 = 0 (with a carry) 1 + 0 = 0 (with a carry) 1 + 1 = 1 (with a carry)Remember that there is carry you have an additional 1 coming it. This truth table is a xor and a not. Now you can add in the logic for the 3rd bit and so on.You might want to read: [https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb\_7.html](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb_7.html) which appears to give a good description of a binary adder.As for shifting instead of multiplications all I can answer is probably not. This is because it would increase the time to do most of the multiplications, because now you have a first step of checking if only 1 bit is set on one of the numbers then do a shift, otherwise continue with the multiplication. That check is only going to help rarely, and the check does take time.Now with a computer the compiler might notice that you are always multiplying a number by a constant like 16 and insert a shift instruction into the output rather than doing a multiplication. But that means you are always multiplying some number not known at compile time by a constant that is a power of 2. Most compilers will actually do all the math it can during compile time so if you have it calculate x \* (1 + 3) / 2 then the compiler might look at that say oh, you want really want to just multiple by 2, oh that is a power of 16, you just want to shift by one, rather than making the computer always add 1 + 3 multiple that by the input value then divide by 2.",pixel293,2025-04-13 15:51:29,8,learnprogramming,t3_1jya33j,False,
mmwx5qh,"I would call floating point arithmatic by itself a 'trick'. By limiting the amount of data a number can have your precision is always limited, but almost always sufficient for a lot of cases. If you want things more precise you have to throw more memory and cpu at it. Depending on the amount of bytes you throw at it you get accuracy to around 3, 7, 15 or 34 significant numbers.But my favorite is the square root trick in a games: The distance between two points is Square root of (dX\^2+dY\^2+dZ\^2) (according to some greek guy).But square roots are very expensive. So when trying to sort by distance developers will just skip the square root and find the smallest dX\^2+dY\^2+dZ\^2.Other than that: compilers will do all kinds to tricks to reduce complexity, which is done with optimisation loops.e.g. constant folding. If you write const a = 10+20, the compiler will just make it const a = 30. Other tricks are loop unrolling (make a for loop into seperate statements if it's a known low number of iterations), and algebraic simplication.",keesbeemsterkaas,2025-04-13 16:03:03,2,learnprogramming,t3_1jya33j,False,

mnlwjpq,"Game developer is a lofty goal, but a worthwhile one. The game developers I know got to where they are now by -- wait for it -- writing games. Come up with a game idea. It doesn't matter how simple, or whether it has been used before. The first games I wrote were: A top down racing game similar to Rally-X. A top down shooter similar to 1942. A pong game with powerups. A pong game played on an elliptical playing field where both players could move around the entire ellipse and the ball changed colour when you hit it (so you lost points if the ball went out of the ellipse when it was your colour).These were all simple games, and some of them never got finished, but it taught me a lot about how to build things, and projects like these helped me land my first job as a graphics dev.For school, make sure you pass. Go to office hours. Find other students you can study with. There were times during my university days when I locked myself in my room for 2-3 days. No computer. Just a textbook and some paper. I read the textbook and took notes by hand. Then I read the textbook again and took more notes. Then I copied my notes and cleaned them up. Then I copied them and cleaned them up again, until I was at the point where I could probably write them out again without looking at the textbook. I did whatever it took to learn the material.It will take time. Find time every day to put some effort into it, even if it is only ten minutes. After I had three kids, I wondered how I would ever be able to learn something new again. Then I realized that even ten minutes a day adds up to \~60 hours per year. The first year I realized that, I taught myself how to play the guitar just by spending 10 minutes a day practicing. Then piano the next year, then flute the year after that.The point I'm trying to make is that it will take effort and time, but you can do it, and it will be worth it in the end.

Don't rely on it to spoon feed you the information because it's been proven that this negatively effects your ability to find the information alone, but having it rephrase your knowledge can help with your thinking of it, and, importantly, give you keywords to help your real searching, which you should always be doing outside of AI.",mellow_cellow,2025-04-17 19:46:21,3,learnprogramming,t3_1k1fr54,False,

UML Diagrams will be very useful in the long run as they tell you all the functions you need to program with. Here's an example structure: \------------------------------------------------ | Class Name | \------------------------------------------------ | Variables in the Constructor | \------------------------------------------------ | Functions in the Class | \------------------------------------------------3. Think of the Language as Python, but instead of tabs, you use curly braces {}. You also must not forget to add the include for the scanner. The scanner is like the iostream C++ library. It provides functions used to take in input. Make sure to reference the scanner by using Scanner scannerName = new Scanner(System.in); So those are my tips.

You don't have to memorize all the algorithms, just skim to know what's there and use as a reference. * Ask for textbook recommendations.* Learn to use a debugger early. * Model what the computer is doing in your head. * Guess what should happen each step. When you're surprised, fix your mental model.* Make your feedback loops as tight as possible. * Do tiny experiments to fix your mental model when you're surprised. * Iteratively make incremental changes and test them as quickly as possible. (If it takes a lot of time and work to get your program into the right state to test something, you're doing it wrong. Make it more interactive or add shortcuts to get there faster.)* Try writing the tests first. * Then try mutation testing. It will teach you to write more testable code.* Learn Git. * Learn how to interactively rebase * Make small incremental commits when your tests pass. * Tests need to pass at every commit. (You can do a WIP commit to save your work and amend it later, but only one at a time per branch.) * Learn to use bisect when you forgot to test something. * Write a paragraph explaining the rationale in your commit message. * Learn how to search commit messages, blame, log, and reflog.* Learn what others consider ""code smells"" and how refactoring can fix them.* Learn to use a linter. * Try turning on one rule at a time, and drop the useless ones.* Read a style guide for your language. Stick to one style, or write your own.

Per the definition of big-O, that would mean that there exists some positive integers M and c₀ where c^(k+1) ≤ Mc^k for all c ≥ c₀.We can simplify this inequality by dividing both sides by c^k to give us c ≤ M. (Note that we don't have to worry about accidentally dividing by zero, since we can safely assume all variables are positive, per the definition of Big-O and our constraint on c₀).But, this inequality c ≤ M results in a contradiction: c can grow forever, so clearly cannot remain less then our constant M.

Here, **O(c\*(k+1)) = O(c\*k + c)**. Here, **c\*k > c ie c\*k** will be **asymptotically bigger** than **c ,** because c,k are variables and nonetheless will be positive, and since in Big-O, we care about the dominant term, therefore it will be **equal** to **O(c\*k**). An example can be c = 10 and k = 10. c\*k = 10\*10 = 100. c \* (k+1) = 10 \* 11 = 110, which is asymptotically equal. However, for the other case ie **O(c\^k) Vs O(c \^(k+1))** ; here **O(c\^(k+1)) = O(c \* c \^ k)**. However , c is a variable and **not** a constant. Therefore, **c\^(k+1)** is **not** asymptotically same as **c\^k**. Therefore, **O(c\^k)** and **O(c \^(k+1))** are **not equal.** An example can be c = 10 and k = 4 . c\^k = 10\^4 and c\^(k+1) = 10\^5 ; a **10 times** increase in the running time**.** This is my interpretation , I could be wrong as well. Please correct if my approach is wrong. (Also, note that though c,k are input variables, when we use them in Big O , it is expected that they are large positive values, because we care about the asymptotic growth as the input size gets large. So all inputs are expected to grow larger and larger. For people who are not familiar with the word 'asymptotic', in general it means that how fast the running time will grow when input size increases. Take two functions : n\^2 and n , where n is the input. For some duration, n\^2 and n will run in parallel, but as n increases, n\^2 will grow rapidly compared to n , then we say that n\^2 is asympototically larger than n. )",Glass-Captain4335,2025-04-14 19:07:17,6,learnprogramming,t3_1jz1oep,False,

mmy5t6k,"Well, this takes a rudimentary understanding of generative AI, especially image generation. Unless you have a reasonably powerful Nvidia GPU it can be a bit challenging but I can sum it up for you. Get comfy ui and watch a few quick tutorials about it. Then learn about something called ""IP adapter"". Basically, it allows you to take an image and upload it to comfy UI to create images based on the likeness of the uploaded image.The models you use are open free to download from within the comfy UI GUI. Most people use stable diffusion, but if you have a really powerful GPUs like 4090/3090 you can use Flux. Or, if you're looking for something specific (stylistic artistic styles) you can check out civitai.com (huggingface for image generation). You can find a wide variety of LoRAs (sort of like really fine tuned mini models) for exactly what you're looking for. After typing this out, I would probably avoid going too deep down this rabbit hole if you only have 15 days. As for the video generation, I don't have a lot of experience with video generation models, but diffusion generative AI (video generation) is very similar to image generation as far as I know. So, I imagine there are models that exist that can operate with IP adapter etc. However, image generation is very computationally expensive and video generation just takes it to another level. If you don't have access to powerful GPUs, look into some of the virtual machine services. They are fairly cheap, maybe a couple dollars per hour or find a way to use a free Google Collab for compute. Then, just spool up python and create a gradio web UI for the user to do all of this connected through API.

mmv96ln,"Hashing on the client side is insecure, you really need to do it on the server.The point of hashing is that if I have the hashed password I can't derive the original password from it. So if user data is leaked I still can't use it.If the client hashes the password then I would be able to login with a leaked hash so hashing is pointless.With regards to your own staff, you should segregate access so that people can see only the data they need to do their job. Some people will be admins that can see the password hashes but again they can't get the passwords from those, and they have the power to change the password anyway.Side note, hashing is not encryption, it's one way only.",ConfidentCollege5653,2025-04-13 08:49:29,25,learnprogramming,t3_1jy2cla,False,
mmv95mw,"Here are some good answers about hashing client side vs server side: [https://superuser.com/questions/1675013/for-websites-is-your-passwords-hash-computed-on-the-client-or-the-server-side](https://superuser.com/questions/1675013/for-websites-is-your-passwords-hash-computed-on-the-client-or-the-server-side)It is generally seen as *less* secure to hash client side. It's absolutely easy to modify data sent by a client. If an attacker gets access to a database with the hashed passwords, they could just make a dummy client just directly send each hashed password and get access to every single account. If the hashing is done server-side and an attacker gets access to the database, the hashed passwords are useless since they don't know people's original passwords which will be put through the hash. If you really really are worried you can hash both client side and server side using two completely separate cryptographically secure hashing systems. However this doesn't add very much security - if a hacker compromises an individual's password they can still run the hash, or if they compromise the hash they can just send it directly as a dummy client. The only thing you're protecting is a potential client trust (e.g. what if they're storing the passwords in plaintext?). However regulations state that you can't store or print the passwords anywhere and any trustworthy company does not do this, just receiving the password as regular text, hashing to store/check, and immediately forgetting the text.",Spare-Plum,2025-04-13 08:49:10,9,learnprogramming,t3_1jy2cla,False,
mmyu9f7,"Thank you all for clarifying this for me! I'm hashing server side then, as many of you pointed out it's safer. Few things, though: \- The system I have in place in my schematics has three parts: Clients, Private Nodes (Personal servers), and a Supernode (Global server). \- Each server has a global identifier (to report to supernode and truly identify each user) and a local identifier to keep each user's identity hidden. Only time an admin gets to access serverside data is when a user is banned/suspended (because in this enviroment it means you either put the server's security at risk or repeatedly violated TOS/Server TOS) and the data is needed for the administrators (namely the owner of the server, for other purposes there is a separate security role called moderators, whom get lots less info for the exact reasons some of you pointed out) to debug what exactly did you break. My best guess was to save the password as the hash to prevent the server from knowing the exact password. \- I'm not in the US, so my laws aren't the same, but this was a big oversight in my part and I'd like to apologize for it. Still, all shared info in that regard has been useful, so for that I thank you all.For one final question, though: If the server does not know the password, how do I actually check password veracity?

Role Based Access Control is your friend here. Passwords could also be stored in a separate database with very restricted access. \- access to sensitive data - this highly depends on what kind of data we're talking about and where you are operating since local laws and regulations apply.

mmveo0w,"Server-side hashed passwords aren't going to reveal any information as long as the password isn't stored. For ""who can see data they don't need to"", it's largely industry based and based on legal restrictions on who can see what data. Though it's ideal that developers only get access to the information they need to test and debug their code, this isn't always necessary. Adding a bunch of restrictions will make it harder for the developers for a slight amount of added trust.For HIPAA compliance developers may see patient records and information to debug stuff and work on code and features, but the data that they see cannot contain personally identifiable information like name/email address/phone number/home address. Since there are also people working on the login portion and might need to see this information, there's a separation or ""iron curtain"" in place where the people who work with systems that handle personally identifiable information cannot have access to medical records or information. Other industries just make you ""promise really really hard"" under the consequence of huge lawsuits and financial repercussions. Like if you're working at a bank you might get information that Apple is executing an order to sell $1 billion of USD over the course of 3 days, or even non-public information about acquisitions and mergers. Not everyone has access to this information at the bank however, just the people working on the computer systems or on the deals. A person could potentially abuse this and frontrun their own trades or hand the information off to a relative. However IMO the stakes are too high to do this in nearly every case, and everyone that has access to this non-public information has a restriction on buying individual stocks, commodities contracts, or large amounts of any currency without explicit approval from compliance.I don't know about the realm of modern laws for social media, but I do know at one point in time there was a creepy Facebook employee that was using their position and access to data stalk a user. Since then Facebook has added additional restrictions on the amount of information granted to developers, and getting more information about someone specific had to be run through a compliance team to ensure it was for debugging/programming reasons.The one place where this material non-public information restriction does not exist, unfortunately, is for the US congress. They are given zero restrictions on stocks or products they can purchase or sell, and a huge ass 45 day window to report trades. It's concerning especially considering the amount of non-public information they deal with. Like if a congressperson knows that there is a huge deal in the works for a car manufacturer, they may buy the stock with no restriction, and only have to report the trade way after the deal has gone through and the stock has made significant gains.",Spare-Plum,2025-04-13 09:49:40,2,learnprogramming,t1_mmvcb8i,False,

It's an odd pick for an intern; usually you want somebody with partial experience so the intern mentor doesn't need to spend time covering the basics.Did the company know this when they hired you + ask you to go through some training program? Or was this more of a hybrid internship, where you applied some of your other skills in in addition to programming? What were their expectations?TBH my first instinct here was that the company did not set you up for success by hiring you at such an early stage in your career.> I made mistakes, of course,but no one really explained what I was doing wrong or how I could do better.

Or alternatively, maybe they're disengaging because they need to focus on their own work now, or are burnt out themselves with teaching and mentoring? It's a bit hard to say.> Lately, I’ve been thinking that maybe I should try working at a smaller company—somewhere with a slower pace, less pressure, and where I might actually be able to learn and breathe.Usually an internship has a concrete end date; I'd try sticking it out until then. If yours does not, then I'm not quite sure what's going on tbh.Other things to try:- Quit to focus on your schoolwork. Find another internship next summer.- Add your current internship to your resume; use it to help you find an internship at a different but similarly well-regarded company.- Ask if you can transfer to a different team.

mnlx6a0,"Oh dear, that's a rabbit hole, actually that's rabbit holes all the way down. Where do we start and where do we end.Let's start near the top, and cover the upper level bit.When you fire up your web browser, you basically get a blank canvas.You type in the Domain Name of the website and hit go/enter.That domain name is then looked up using a name resolution system called DNS (rabbit hole one) to get it to resolve to an address. This is very similar to you looking up your friend Bob in the contacts list on your phone, since names are easier than numbers.The browser then sends a request to the server(s) residing at the address it got to download your web page. (Another rabbit hole here). This is done using the HTTP protocol (more rabbit hole), the web page is then likely to be created using HTML as the markup language (more rabbit holes). The HTML might inform the browser it needs additional bits which require additional requests to the server or even other servers. These include things like stylesheets (CSS) to make things look pretty, code (JavaScript), pictures (PNG, GIF, JPEG, etc), videos (MPEG4, etc), sound/music (MP3, WAV, etc), and others.After the first HTML page is downloaded the browser will start to render the page and all the content and the code may start to be executed. The code might do nothing until you interact with the page, or it might send a request to a server for some dynamic data, which would be another HTTP request to some server somewhere.Each HTTP request might involve a different server which we don't have the address for yet, so that would be another set of DNS requests to look up those addresses.That's the near top level of how a website works with your web browser. Your next question might be how all these abbreviations, protocols, and the like work and how they all work together and for that we have a variety of central standards that specify how these work so everyone that needs to can implement their own. The majority of these are what are called RFCs (requests for comment) managed by the IETF (internet engineering task force) and we also have the w3c (world wide web consortium) and a few other organizations/groups made up of industry specialists like IANA (they're more involved in the DNS side).We have a generic model for a lot of this called the OSI model, and that allows us to navigate the rabbit holes and find the occasional breathable pocket.Hope that helps, Wikipedia has a lot of the extra information you might want to learn about, but beware of the rabbit holes (they're everywhere).",dariusbiggs,2025-04-17 16:22:45,3,learnprogramming,t3_1k1bjaf,False,

mnkswo3,"You might be jumping a bit ahead of yourself here... Here's a brief rundown of how this all works:Your PC has a network card. That NIC uses some black magic to establish itself as a given IP on your local network, let's assign it as 192.168.1.20.Any traffic on your network will be able to talk to your network card using that address, and if your computer talks to anything else on your network then the recipient will see it got a package from that address.One such device on your network is a router, which is also connected to your ISP's network.When your computer tries to make a request to something not on your local network, say.... 8.8.8.8, then it asks the router if it knows how to get to 8.8.8.8. The router then asks the ISP, the ISP knows and then tells the router which tells the computer, the computer then sends the packet to the router to give to the ISP to give to 8.8.8.8.A similar process works for resolving domain names to server IPs.So when you go to google.com, your browser asks your network card to ask your router to ask your ISP if that's possible. It is, and a request is sent to whatever address that google.com resolves to, ""Give me your home page.""Google's server receives that request and after some processing sends back an HTML file, and probably a css and a JavaScript file. So an HTML file comes from Google to your ISP to your router to your network card to your browser, and a web page renders. Then your browser also executed the JavaScript that got sent and applies the css, not necessarily in that order. The JavaScript can then phone home by asking the browser to ask the card to ask the router to ask the ISP to give a message to Google, and so the cycle continues.TL;DR: By the time you get a webpage, a connection to the server has already been made at least once. The browser handles most of the details of connecting.

With machine learning, we're seeing a lot more interest in really, really low precision because it still works ""pretty dern good"" for big fuzzy matrix multiplies. So you'll see FP16, FP8, BFLOAT16, and other variants. But those are mostly confined to GPU tensor computing, not general purpose processing. For 99.X% of general purpose applications, the hardware is super super fast and you don't care that much about precision. If you do care, you should probably be using fixed point.A good way to think of floating point is as a fraction between powers of 2. So for numbers between 32 and 64, you get 32 \* 1.XXXX. That [1.XXX](http://1.XXX) fraction is the ""mantissa"" and the power of two is the ""exponent"". The number of bits in the mantissa gives you your precision. It's very precise near zero, and it gets a lot less precise for really big numbers. You can simulate any arbitrary precision you want in software though by just storing all the mantissa bits and simulating the floating point operations with fixed point.Another interesting bit is that for machine learning, they do care a lot about the buildup of errors from layers and layers of floating point. They normally fix that by normalizing the output to be between 0 and 1 at each layer rather than messing with the precision of the multiplications.",shifty_lifty_doodah,2025-04-19 20:59:18,2,learnprogramming,t3_1k2yfn4,False,

If they **haven't** done the hard work for you, and you have to learn to parse the file formats yourself, that's an extra layer of difficulty.Don't let me put you off the idea, but if you're new to programming, I'd strongly recommend looking into some simpler projects first!

You start filling buckets when knob - bucket <= 0 (positive knob delays the start, negative knob does not affect the beginning) You stop filling buckets when 7 + knob - bucket >= 0 is false (negative knob cuts off the end, positive knob does not affect it)In total you would want to increment each time and round to the nearest int, and only fill buckets when knob - bucket = 0",Spare-Plum,2025-04-17 06:34:46,1,learnprogramming,t3_1jzcyi8,False,
mn5j0yr,"A very simple solution would be this (I will illustrate the function for smaller and fewer numbers, but it generalizes to your 8 bit use case.):Let `p` be the value of your rotation knob.

At p=30 you reach the default case, where x can fall in any bin. At p=60, every x will fall in the last bin.Edit: Selected bigger numbers for clarity. This is probably not exactly what you want, because this is a rather uneven distribution for values of p that ate not 0, 30 or 60.",3-stroke-engine,2025-04-15 00:13:58,1,learnprogramming,t3_1jzcyi8,False,

mn5g9mm,"As you go from 0% to 25% the chances become distributed at the lowest values, where 'return 0' still has the highest likelihood, and when you reach 50%, everything has an equal chance. As you go past the halfway point, the 'return 7' becomes the most likely until you reach 100% at which 'return 7' happens 100% of the time. I almost think of it like holding a cylinder full of liquid on its side and tilting it to one side or the other. If the cylinder is flat, the liquid is evenly distributed, if it's tilted slightly it begins accumulating on one side, more with a greater angle. My thinking was that it was an 8 bit value being compared to give a finer granularity in determining the greater than or less than values.In practical application it's for a self-generating musical sequencer, like an algorithmic player piano, to determine the length of a musical step (analogous to how long a piano key is held down). If you turn the knob all the way to the left, the musical notes generated by the sequencer will only be one musical step long. If it's all the way to the right, it will only generate 8-step-long notes. If it's a quarter of the way, it will produce mostly one step notes, with some two step notes, less three step notes, even less four step notes, etc. Hope that makes sense!",myweirdotheraccount,2025-04-14 23:57:36,2,learnprogramming,t1_mn5dorb,True,

As `p` goes to ~~infinity zero~~ infinity, the lower bins will smoothly decrease in volume. The upper bins will firstly increase in volume but then also decrease until every bin except the last one has zero volume.Edit: You don't need `pow(10, p)` you always need to add a factor of 30 (the highest border): `pow(10, p) * 30`.

mmvkvp7,"I really admire that you're diving into HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Python at 54—your passion and diverse background are definite strengths. That said, I want to be as candid as possible:Freelancing in programming typically comes after years of experience in the industry. While there's no formal barrier to entry beyond setting up a profile on a freelancing platform, this low threshold means you're competing against a vast pool of skilled coders—many with years of experience, advanced degrees, and robust portfolios filled with positive client reviews. Back in the mid-2010s, there was a surplus of tech needs, and companies were more willing to take on individuals with bootcamp training or certifications in lieu of real experience because the talent pool was scarce. In today's market, the situation has reversed—tech is high-paying and attractive, leading to a surplus of highly experienced, often laid-off programmers. Most companies have their pick of talent, whether hiring full-time employees or freelancers, so they have little incentive to take a chance on entry-level coders or invest time and money into training someone without a proven track record. It's not impossible by any means, but it will take several people willing to ""give you a chance."" Until you build up those client experience reviews, finding freelance gigs will be especially challenging. It's the classic chicken-and-egg scenario: you need a job to gain experience, but you need experience to get the job.The alternative—landing an entry-level programmer role remotely—is almost completely out of the picture. Remote positions nowadays are typically reserved for those who already have a strong background because the market for remote roles is fiercely competitive. The COVID era, where remote work was the norm, is rapidly fading; everyone wants to work from home, but few get to. In many parts of the world, especially in regions like the U.S. (at least where I'm writing), remote experienced freelance or full-time programmers are still a thing—but entry-level remote roles are virtually non-existent. Even on-site roles face fierce competition. I'm not sure how things shake out in places like Albania or wider Europe, but the trend is similar: only highly experienced folks, often bolstered by a flood of laid-off talent, get those remote opportunities.On top of that, generative AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are changing the game. These tools can handle many of the routine tasks that junior developers used to do—completing boilerplate code and similar work much faster than a human. As a result, the real value in programming today isn't just about writing code; it's about leveraging it to solve complex, real-world problems. The true edge lies in depth and creativity, where your ability to draw on years of industry-specific experience can help you harness generative AI efficiently—something AI by itself can't do. This shift leaves even less room for entry-level programmers, as companies lean on the efficiency of AI and the expertise of veterans.My advice? Keep learning the basics and enjoy the process, but once you have a solid foundation, jump into advanced tools like Google Gemini Canvas. This isn't just about using fancy new software—it's a reality check that shows how far generative AI has come and how it can outperform entry-level folks on routine tasks. It also reminds you that real value comes from using code to solve meaningful problems, something that only someone with experience and creative problem-solving skills can do. In other words, don't just aim to be a freelance coder; consider positioning yourself as a consultant who can merge your decades of industry expertise with your growing tech skills to solve niche, real-world challenges.Bottom line: You haven't missed the boat yet, but today's boat is more like a high-speed ferry crammed with highly experienced, AI-enhanced pros. Your journey will be challenging, but by being realistic and strategic—focusing on niche projects, learning the basics, and quickly adopting advanced AI tools—you can carve out your own path in this highly competitive, ever-changing market.Good luck, and keep enjoying the learning process!",mintplantdaddy,2025-04-13 10:54:15,6,learnprogramming,t3_1jy3gap,False,

When I build a few silly apps like a custom flashlight, calculator, Todo lists, meal planner etc. I decided I want to make games.So I picked up C# (guess what, it was really similar), I was watching Brackeys and I learned a lot about Unity3D, I learned to 3D model my assets in Blender, texture stuff etc. I made a few games (tower defense, endless runner and then I even published one game on App Store where you had to draw symbols on screen in order to destroy stuff that was falling from the sky)Then I decided that I would like to build a web app so my friends and family can use it. So I picked up JavaScript, then React. Made a few projects and web apps. (I already had 1 year old kid at this moment)At that point I told myself. Man you're kinda good at this thing and you really like it, let's make a living out of it. So I started to apply.And here I'm, working as a fullstack from home for an awesome company with awesome people and a boss.

These may be referred to as int or long, but make sure to check your specs.But if you were working in python, integers support arbitrary precision by default. So 2\*\*1000 will spit out a number about 300 or so digits long, and 2\*\*(2\*\*1000) will just hang your system, because there's not enough memory in the universe to write that number down in base 10 format.So even with arbitrary precision, there are practical limits.

mnl1df3,"I think a lot of these jobs outside of customer service would require some sort of sophisticated robotics component to actually replace. A doctor can talk to NurseGPT all day, but something has to put in an IV and hang a drip line. A lot of robotics actually being used are incredibly simple, flat boxes that lift up 3cm and move pallets around for example. Robotics that can stand in one spot plugged into a wall and do the same thing over and over like on an assembly line, sure, but the power usage and overheating problems need to be worked out for autonomous units. And they need to do something about LLMs confidently giving you the wrong answer before anyone will trust them.But let’s say they iron out all the kinks; I’ve heard upwards of 60-70% of jobs could be replaced. Our systems are not setup to handle such massive unemployment. All these giant tech firms are not going to give up their earnings to contribute to any form of UBI, the line must go up! There are too few politicians that aren’t bought and paid for that will actually stand up and do something. In the long run this is all just another big tech bait-n-switch. They can run at giant losses for years, maybe even decades as they continue to subsidize everything with the parts of the business that make money. They will sell a restaurant a waiter bot with the latest wAIter model installed, but it can only stand at the hostess podium, and tries to seat people at already occupied tables 30% of the time. Human Robotics promises it will replace your entire wait staff in 5 years so a few people lose their jobs. But turns out the wAIter model was just a chatGPT wrapper making API calls the entire time. Human Robotics is running out of seed money, so now before the robot will seat your customers they must watch a 30 second unskipable ad for the McDonalds across the street.It just seems like if everything works out the way the big tech companies want it’s the worst possible outcome for humanity.",squeeemeister,2025-04-17 13:45:54,47,cscareerquestions,t3_1k1by55,False,

I had nothing to lose so you can do that sometimes. 2nd interview - COO is involved.. Very open honest discussion, great discussion.

You could be in any career, in any field, in any position and still get laid off. This is just the way of the world.With your YoE, you should be getting messages from recruiters on LinkedIn and other platforms that can easily land you interviews. Try premium for a month, spruce up your LinkedIn and add all the common skills you see across the job descriptions you are interested in. Even if you don’t have the skills, read up on docs and just get a basic understanding so that you can speak to it during interviews. Add those skills to your LinkedIn and Resume, I guarantee your profile starts getting hits from recruiters. Talk to the ones who supply Job Descriptions you’d actually consider taking. This is genuine advice that worked for me. I found a position after about a month and a half with 7 YoE (NYC area) which is really the same as 5 in the grand scheme of things.I’m sick of hearing people cry that CS careers are over. There will literally always be a need for SWEs. If you think AI will replace us, then you clearly haven’t used AI very much yet. It fucks up a LOT, and is really more of a tool than a replacement for people.The job market will eventually recover and you will be able to get a good job with good pay. Stop dick riding FAANG as well. FAANG is what made the market what it is because they over hired and over paid for people and set unrealistic expectations for what SWE careers should actually look like. They set a standard for unrealistic hiring practices that is not reflective of actual work we do on a daily basis. We’re grinding LC for months just to do a job where we do basic system design and basic logic. It’s absolutely ridiculous.Also, FAANG looks good on resumes, sure, but so does experience in any real job where you can back up that experience with technical knowledge. If someone is gonna hire you just because your resume says FAANG, then they’re an idiot and you probably shouldn’t work for them anyway.Lower your salary expectations a bit, you have to realize that you’re in competition with a ton of other people who were laid off and are all expecting to make more money than what they were making than when they were laid off.

Here is how you can frame it: ""I have been pushing myself hard and accepting everything that's been thrown my way, and I've been trying to do things as quickly as possible. I think I need to stop doing that, and instead be honest about how much time and availability I have, otherwise I'm risking getting burned out.""I have literally been told by my managers (as in, multiple have said this independently over time) that it's okay to go slower, and in fact, sometimes it's preferable. The only thing it's not okay to do is not communicate.So for example, if you get a Slack ping that's like ""hey, I'm seeing error X in app Y, can you please take a look?"", instead of saying ""I'm on it!"" and then frantically trying to chase down error X, say, ""sure thing, I can look in [a little bit/30 minutes/this afternoon/tomorrow/when I'm back from lunch]"".

If you are not particularly interested in a project, it is okay to step back and listen and only speak up when you have something important to say.

People will notice if you are obviously disengaged, ignorant about what's being discussed, or making them repeat themselves. They won't think to themselves after a meeting, ""Boy, YonghaeCho sure was quiet,"" and if they do, it's only for a fleeting moment - and if you spoke once or twice because *you needed to*, they won't think that at all.Overall: It's not just okay to slow down, it's good to slow down.

mnsj8cd,"Never take Glassdoor reviews as truth. The one and only thing you should use them for is to help you formulate questions to ask during the reverse interview process, and so you know what you keep an eye out for. Then based on the reverse interview you need to form *your own* opinion on if the company sounds like it has any of those negative traits you read about.The obvious reason why you shouldn't take those reviews as truth is they're often by disgruntled employees, or employees pressured into leaving good reviews by HR while they're working there. Neither end of that spectrum is reliable. Rarely does a content employee just think unprompted to themselves ""You know what would be fun? Let's go write a fair, unbiased review about my very average employer!""But beyond that, companies change over time. A review that was accurate even last month, might not be accurate today. All it takes is a single change in management, and a team's culture can shift literally overnight. So just because someone said they worked long hours, doesn't mean people are still working long hours. The reverse is also true, just because someone said the WLB is great, doesn't mean it's still great.Teams within companies also vary drastically. Even at small companies. I worked for a startup once that had \~30 engineers, spread across a few teams. The team I worked on was super laid back, modern stack, essentially no red tape so we moved very quickly, etc. Even pre-pandemic, we'd only come into the office once or twice a week, and nobody was watching us so sometimes we'd just WFH all 5 days and it wasn't a big deal because we got results. But another team was the polar opposite of us. Their stack was older, they had a *ton* of red tape, they moved very slowly, produced very little, and they were straight up told by the CTO that they need to be in the office strictly 3 days a week because they needed to get their shit together.So if you read a bad review about Team A, it doesn't mean Team B will share those traits. You need to talk to *your* hiring manager about *your* future-team to figure out what that team is like.The startup I mentioned earlier had a fair amount of negative reviews on Glassdoor talking about nepotism, and it being a boys club, and that if you're not buddy buddy with the CEO you'll never have any career growth. When I interviewed with my hiring manager and the CTO I didn't get those vibes at all. The culture seemed amazing, which is why I decided to ignore those reviews and join them. Lo and behold, the culture was great. I was absolutely *not* buddy buddy with the CEO, or anyone for that matter, and my career skyrocketed at that place. I've gotten the biggest raises I've ever seen there. It was a great place to work. The person complaining about nepotism probably just sucked at their job and got fired, and decided it'd be an easier pill to swallow to blame nepotism instead of themselves. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",SouredRamen,2025-04-18 17:29:57,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1k2a7a2,False,

mnjeo02,"QA careerist here, manager at the moment. The opportunities in the discipline are dropping dramatically. That probably doesn't help you right now at the moment you need a job, but medium/long term, I would definitely look at lateral moves to other functions. I think being early in your career actually helps you here because you'll be on the junior side for whatever you do. Do some dev work in your spare time if that interests you at all. Actually, even if it doesn't interest you, it's probably a good idea.There are two kinds of SDET jobs I see these days:One, what we used to call ""white box"" - someone who has dev-level skills and has written source code or close to it. These people can stand up a test framework from scratch and pipeline infrastructure for tests to run and report. These have a little more staying power and tend to have the opportunity to become other kinds of software engineering roles - devs, devops, release eng, etc. - when the business outgrows the need for dedicated QA.Two, jobs that are basically QA and mostly manual testing, but for companies that know they need to step up their testing game and need a stopgap while they either scale up their automated CI/CD efforts or offshore manual efforts. You can tell by the way I've described it that I don't think these roles have a bright future, but you might get to hang on for a while at a company that's struggling through that process.Observability, monitoring, and deployment tools have come a long way in reducing risk in software delivery since I started my career. Issues can be seen early and fixed quickly. Unit tests are fast and cover a lot of ground. There's still some use for end to end testing, but I see a drastically reduced need to have a specialized function for it that introduces additional process and the overhead of handing work off to different people along the way.",NearbyRock,2025-04-17 05:35:27,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1k10smd,False,

mnt1zac,"They shouldhabe salary bands—if they’re smart.As for the amount, it depends. Some companies apply a flat percentage for promotions; companies I’ve worked at, for example, used a flat 10%.Other companies have set salary ranges and will use comp ratios to determine the increase. They also consider your current compensation. Generally, managers and the comp/HR team aim to bring employees close to a 1.0 comp ratio. For high performers, they may go higher. However, some managers or comp/HR folks might think that bringing someone straight to a 1.0 is too large of a bump, so they might offer a lower comp ratio instead. They may also feel a candidate needs ramp-up time or isn’t fully qualified, which can also justify a lower comp ratio—though there’s usually a floor, such as 0.9.Comp ratio, short for comparative ratio, is a measure used in compensation management to compare an employee’s current salary to the midpoint of a given salary range for their position. It’s calculated by dividing the employee’s salary by the midpoint of the range and is usually expressed as a percentage. A comp ratio of 100% means the employee is paid exactly at the market or target rate. Below 100% may indicate they’re underpaid relative to the range, while above 100% suggests they’re paid more than the midpoint—possibly due to experience, tenure, or performance.

mnzy4ry,"Hard to say, it's always some combination of being extremely competent, having a good track record, and communicating with stakeholders well enough that you can convince them to trust you to do the work.I'm a team lead, and the biggest issue I see in the other team members is when they work on larger projects things don't get correctly delivered, or when they are talking to managers they bring up random stuff that isn't important to what managers care about. On that last point, it really drives me crazy, but when you have managers/stakeholders in the room, you need to speak to them with a language they understand, about concerns they care about, and at a granularity level that matters to them.I have one guy on my team, great developer, who spec'd out an EPIC level feature set, and wanted to present that to a manager. The only problem with his presentation is that it was way to granular, and talked about tickets in progress, focusing on the details of the how, and not the what/why. That's going to confuse the shit out of any manager whose trying to make sure the high level plan of the team is aligned to what they believe should get done.That's one thing, another is example is someone on my team shipping a feature without good product rationale, like the feature was just sort of garbage and we couldn't tell either way, and not backing down or and providing weak evidence that the feature was useful. What they said was basically: ""since we don't have data it's not good, we should keep it released and just observe"". Lol, I don't have data that my Greyhound can't drive a car, you think I'm letting him drive?Finally, the last thing which drives me completely crazy, is when people don't understand the purpose of meetings, and use the time in the meeting for something else. This just happened, where I was trying to run a planning session with the team, and an engineer goes: ""oh one more thing, u/justUseAnSvm can you navigate to the dashboard so I can show u/"" No brother, if you want a meeting to discuss this, schedule. Anyway, these are just some examples of things I notice in ambitious and competent engineers, that will otherwise be leadership material someday. I'm a real stickler for keeping things on track and not wasting peoples time. Your approach, listen, observe, and write it done, is a good one. Next step is to just ask for larger feature work.

mne66ao,"A few pointers： 1. You probably have done some sort of system design in game coding. Knowing how parts of a system work together is something you’ve already done, you just have to abstract that to other types of systems. 2. What type of system design question you’ll be asked will vary greatly on the scale of the company, the seniority of role, and the type of roll. You should not expect load balancing questions if you’re doing a front end engineering system design interview. If you’re doing backend at an established company, they probably won’t be asking about load balancing (because they’ve already solved that), but will probably ask about problems you’ll be expected to solve. 3. Unless you’re doing system design or architecture or tooling, they probably will just want to know that you can think in terms of systems. The specific database or asynchronous job or whatever other part won’t matter so long as you know how they interact or at a higher level what pieces are interacting. They care most that you’re able to grasp the whole system rather than that you remember the names of specific tools to build the system (unless they specifically list technology they use, then you should totally know about those technologies at a conversational level).4. ChatGPT is a great tool to prep for interviews. You can prompt it to create a series of questions for you for the seniority level and type of roll and company and interview type (systems design) you’re interviewing for. If you have the job description/company, that can help it be more specific.

mmwoix5,"MBA is a pretty fine entry point into the business side of things in which an effective product manager will dabble heavily. An MBA by itself is very unlikely to secure you a job as a product manager. Experience in the markets the business is targeting (healthcare, additive manufacturing, law, etc), the model by which the business operates (SaaS, PaaS, b2b, b2c, etc), and domain expertise over the product/market (peripherals, infrastructure, HRIS/ERP/EHR/etc), is king.> I was considering MBA but then I came across LinkedIn profiles of people who shifted to Prod roles of different companies without an MBA.Those people probably have heaps of experience in one or all of the areas I described above.To be clear, ""I worked for a SaaS vendor"" does not automatically mean you understand the full lifecycle of sales, support, adoption, and development of a SaaS product. Cranking out Jira issues is not the same as sitting in contract negotiations with a big client, producing estimates/SOWs, planning/executing a multi-month/year implementation across multiple functional groups (sales, support/training, development, etc), planning a launch to expand/capture a market segment, dealing with a pissed off customer because milestones are slipping, etc.My experience prior to moving into product management in my current org was in b2b sales/contracting of IaaS and managed services as an owner/operator. That's roughly the same model and domain I work in currently. I had practically no prior experience in my org's specific market segment but picked that knowledge up over ~2 years as a software engineer and ~3 as an engineering manager at my current org.Product management as a functional role should be pretty consistent among your F-100s and FAANGs. But it's going to vary wildly between practically any other company. Product management as a discipline is very much a YMMV thing.> Can someone guide? Are there any certifications or courses that companies consider in place of an MBA.[Pragmatic](https://www.pragmaticinstitute.com/), [PMI](https://www.pmi.org/), and [IIBA](https://www.iiba.org/) all have certification programs which bear some weight.

mnilnt3,"You only need a bachelors to work in most CS jobs, yes. That said, it's not as if a Masters is *bad.* At worst the employer considers it equal to a bachelors, and at best they view it even more positively than a bachelors. There's nothing inherently wrong with bridge programs so long as they guarantee you entry into their associated masters program. I wouldn't go to one that didn't guarantee entry though. You'll have to put in more personal effort with a bridge + Masters, because you need to learn the entire CS undergrad curriculum in only 2-3 semesters and also Masters are obviously inherently harder than bachelors. I would also imagine it would take longer + cost more. But you do get a better degree.I think either are fine really, would decide based on other factors like which schools you're deciding between, their costs, how much you'd want to attend that school, etc. FWIW some schools (eg [UPenn](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/)) offer a CS Masters aimed at students from non-CS backgrounds (it's also entirely online at UPenn), so you wouldn't even have to do a bridge. It's a pretty expensive program though.",Clueless_Otter,2025-04-17 02:03:53,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1k0unmp,False,

mni0ukv,"That’s part of the reason why version control exists: it allows everyone on a team/department to see code for whatever feature you’re working on or have ever worked on.Apart from that, you have stand ups to prove status updates about a feature/project, knowledge transfer sessions, lunch and learns, demos, etc.Typically, unless you work at one of those places that is super silo’d, it’s common to share knowledge and/or code among the team.
