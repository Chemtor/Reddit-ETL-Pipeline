In a situation where multi-tenant means a low number of organizational tenants (not individual humans) and the customer base is not growing significantly over time the shared db but split schema model can work really well as the high ops cost for multi dbs is not justifiable but the separation of concerns and queries via schemas brings lots of values in delivering features especially if different tenants have different demands which lead to asynchronous feature delivery and therefore async schemata to be handled by service versions.Overall the application layer is also not considered at all as schema splitting can help in certain scaling and complexity scenarios way more than splitting dbs or mixing everything in a single schema,OberstK,2025-04-12 15:33:51,2,dataengineering,t3_1jwl4w8,False,

Based on your definition this was a ‘Shift Right’. The analytics team operated for years without dedicated people to ensure their environment was well organized or resilient to new business processes that require the logic that was locked in that transformation layer.When I took over that position we started to migrate logic out of Looker and into DBT, a process we are still working through today. The pilot project here was to deal with a deviation of a legacy data model in our data engineering environment by cleaning up and replacing it with all the goodies our analytics team extended and prepared in Looker for years. Once the legacy model was replaced we also made sure everything was set to refer to the new models.We are not moving away from having analysts model in Looker/LookML, though we have also set them up with DBT Cloud. Instead we are treating that workflow more like prototyping. Once our analysts have iteratively refined those models and they are stable we find the best way to ‘Shift them to the Left’.

mmu64jk,"It's ok to write lots of files to open table formats like iceberg *up to a point*, and as long as you're doing blind inserts.The append-only blind-inserts are part of the purpose of a bronze layer. By appending everything you receive without reference to what is already in the table at the time you insert it you can have multiple writers all writing at the same time without conflict. If you start doing merge operations or `where not exists` on the target table then you can start getting write conflicts.Having lots of small files is an issue when you're reading the data back, as it takes longer and longer to make all the individual API calls to grab each object. That can be handled by periodically doing a compaction on the files. A compaction can be run at the same time as blind inserts -- they don't conflict with each other.But this is all fine on a scale up to writing every second or so. If you're *constantly* making tiny writes and inserts then you're crossing more into streaming territory. If you can receive your data through a stream (or queue) then you can buffer up writes for a while then bulk write them to iceberg. AWS Data Firehose and Azure Event Hubs can do some of this for you automatically - each has a capability to automatically write all streamed data out to data files every time a buffer threshold is reached (up to ~15 minutes / ~300MB, whichever is first). If you don't need ultra-low latency queries, then these can work, and generally if you're working off of some open table format your queries have a certain minimum latency anyway.---The post you read may be talking about something like [Databricks autoloader](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ingestion/cloud-object-storage/auto-loader/). If anything else automatically does this for you it will have to be part of the execution & orchestration engine that you're working on. It *needs* some kind of eventing system and metadata-storing db to track everything. Iceberg is just a table format spec, not an ingestion engine of its own.Whatever it is it will basically be catching blob triggers and writing their data into a managed low latency db, then periodically grabbing any unprocessed files and batch loading them. It isn't super difficult to roll your own, but there's a few components and you'll have to reason things out yourself around managing the state for un/processed file metadata.",azirale,2025-04-13 02:59:24,9,dataengineering,t3_1jxun0q,False,

mn1fgy7,"TL;DR So basically, you store data in its most raw form in the event source, without locking yourself into a fixed structure, and then you derive the data structure from it. When your needs change, you just update your business logic, delete the database, and replay your events through this improved logic. No more migrations, no manual backfills, no fragile one-off scripts, no emergency data recovery jobs, no writing painful ETL pipelines just to restructure your data — you simply reshape your models and press replay. Data becomes fluid, adaptable, and responsive to your evolving needs.",No-Exam2934,2025-04-14 10:31:44,1,dataengineering,t3_1jyve41,True,

We worked with a Faroese company information platform that pushed all their raw events into Flowcore — and even though the events were pretty basic (like CRUD changes and updates), we were able to layer meaning on top during replay to build dedicated AI-optimized models. The result was that they now have an AI chat interface where users can ask super abstract questions, like *“Which municipality had the most new companies in 2024?”* or *“Tell me about this specific person and all the companies they’re involved in”* — and it just works.

Not too many moving parts and no core dependency on Kafka. We could easily operationalize in our small infra team. 5. Community support on Slack is amazing. Some issues we reported were fixed immediately in the next release (our previous paid solution did not provide such support after paying a lot of money). 6.

There are more controls in the cloud for access control and security than I have seen in anyone's data center and I have seen many Fortune 100 companies data centers. Starting from physical security to data in flight & at rest to designs clouds are almost always able to be more secure. The issues come with knowledge and implementation.

The bandwidth between on-premises and cloud is never enough. Consider bouncing a 1TB table at one location against a 1TB table at a different location. Even with tricks like predicate pushdown and column reduction, you will still end up moving quite a bit of data to compare/join the tables. That has to happen over a WAN instead of an internal bus.

You can do essentially everything without coding or minimal coding whereas azure SQL you'll be building a database with code by code.Beyond that you're going to have to get familiar with azure portal and azure tools versus dynamics/dataverse etc. azure portal is in general much more complex than the latter.Azure SQL will shine when you have more experience and are in need of more throughput. An example being dataverse handles queries through fetch xml which is rather slow and clunky versus a traditional SQL query you can execute in azure. Relationships between tables is also annoying and superficial in dataverse.If you are new dataverse is a good POC platform until you outgrow it.,lysis_,2025-04-15 03:48:44,4,dataengineering,t3_1jzi6u4,False,

We had a few hundred objects to move and were rewriting our sql server stored procedure into dbt (which was a huge pain, but definitely worth doing <3 dbt) Before finding datafold we were just writing queries to compare the datasets on each side and some key metrics, which was tedious at best. About 30% of the way through the process we got onto datafold and started data diffing the datasets in both places and found a tonnnnnn of random stuff we missed in migration because sql server and snowflake just work differently, like with case sensitivity and extra spaces and date function quirky-ness. We even found issues with our previous load process in sql server that we had no idea about XD. The team is responsive and during the migration we reached out for them to fix or add a bunch of features and they consistently turned them around to keep us moving.

It looks as though my problem comes down to a lag function for which there are 2 identical rows coming back in the list of more rows at the start. The first row the lag should be null as it’s the start. But spark is favoring the second row and the lag is from the first row. In redshift the lag for the first row reports null. Just annoying.

mn3t969,"Some hard-won advice on this topic: 1. Have a good working relationship with your manager. Build trust. This will ensure they _actually hear you_ when you ask to take on opportunities to push yourself. Pushing yourself without this trust can cause your manager to view you as self-sabotaging (causing delays, ""biting off more than they can chew""), which makes everything harder. 2. Identify the developers on your team (or close to your team, this includes DevOps, architects, and even senior QA) who actually care about the quality of their work. Like someone else in this thread said, many people work in software simply because of the pay. Sometimes the ""this is just a job"" people are very talented engineers, but it's not as likely. When you find the people who really care, pair with them on your work, go to them with questions, etc. 3. Don't waste time, but ask questions when you can. In particular, if someone more experienced than you has work you can look at (e.g. in a pull request), and their implementation doesn't line up with how you would have approached the problem, ask them (politely/when it's convenient) to help you understand why they chose their approach vs your ""obvious"" approach. A major strength of more senior engineers is their ability to perceive/understand complicating factors, with nuance (see the last sentence in #4). A word of warning here... don't ask endless follow-up questions/don't get really in the weeds on every little thing. You run the risk of being seen as overly pedantic, nitpicking, or wasting time (for the pull request example, keep in mind that often the PR is only a final ""does this make sense to everyone?"" check before merging new code. So a developer might not appreciate having long conversations on every PR. For this reason, having a conversation or DMing them is often better than leaving a vague question as a PR comment). 4. Get involved in the design process as _early_ as possible. If you have the opportunity to sit-in on a meeting with an architect/dev lead while they design a new feature/project/service, _do it_. You won't be able to contribute (probably), and that is fine. But especially if these people are the ones you identified in #2, watching them work through a complex problem from the beginning will be a great learning experience. A big part of having engineering expertise is knowing what's important vs what is not important to the actual business requirement(s) (especially as it relates to the existing constraints of your application), not just knowing the ins and outs of your language/framework. 5. Talk to your coworkers about the work and build up your reputation as someone who cares. When you discover cool language features or software development practices, bring them up with people (""I found this cool HN article the other day talking about , do we use that here?""). Then, when other devs are working on something new, they'll think ""I bet /u/Spiritual_Donkey_521 would love to hear about this.""

mmm7eqr,"Sorry to hear you're going thru this. No, not all internships are like this. The ""this is an easy task"" and other passive aggressive responses in particular are major indicators of a fairly toxic culture in that team and very likely the company. That's not typical of most teams, but it's also not as rare as one might wish. (And it is more common in teams that are hiring, because those teams have a higher turnover.)Toxicity aside, the overall lack of guidance sounds like what happens when the hiring team is more swamped than they expected when they signed up to have interns. The pattern of having to drop lower priority balls in a crunch is pretty normal, and it's likely ""intern support"" is one of those lower priority balls.In that situation, an attitude of ""interns are both cheap and temporary, let's give them a non-essential nice-to-have and if they get it working, great, if not we'll sort it out later"" is the kind of strategy some people will run with if they have some interns they don't know what to do with. Another possibility is they're attempting a sort of extended interview, where what they wanted wasn't so much to train people as to identify people with the tenacity to get it figured out, with an intent to make a job offer to those already at the ""swim"" level of capabilities (in a complete failure to understand (or probably even comprehend the possibility) that this is a side gig for you while you're mainly trying to graduate, rather than your sole full-time work focus like their jobs are).Either way, your best outcome here is to get it running more or less ok, get a good letter of recommendation, and find a different place for your next paid position. (Tenacity, managing burnout, and finding alternative second-best outcomes under limited support and uncertainty of project success are all important skills in this field, but ideally you'd be sort of eased into them with some decent mentoring along the way, rather than left alone to maybe figure out your burnout damage or not. Also, burnout is a pretty well-studied phenomenon, and it will serve you well into the future if you read up on the literature, as another side project for an hour or 2/week.)For getting your actual task figured out, there's a few decent options under the guidance they've (implicitly) given that they don't want their engineers to be bothered. You're doing the right thing by posting in external forums, this approach can help with your technical questions too. (Plus of course the web searching you're presumably doing about the error messages and unexpected behaviors you're seeing.)You can also try finding a person or 2 in the company (edit: or outside the company) (but not your official team and not the point of contact telling you it should be easy) who you like their vibe, and just ask if they'd be available for an hour each week or so, and if they can, see if you can collect good questions they can help you get thru efficiently, or point you in their idea of the next step, for stuff you don't know what to do with.Also a useful trick is to keep a slide deck open and capture screenshots of useful things to ask about. Later you can trim it into a presentation or a walkthrough of issues you still have that you can show people easily.Anyway, good luck and remember that your most important goal in this arrangement is to impress someone enough they want to work with you and will write you a letter and/or be a good future contact in another job. Getting your ""easy"" project running is a decent means to that end, but you can also potentially achieve it by showing people the hurdles you did overcome on the way to not finishing.(Btw, most sane people doing actual backend work know that nothing in this space is as easy as it sounds, so the people telling you this are probably either lying to put pressure on you or not all that experienced themselves and mistaken about the difficulty of something they haven't attempted. Possibly they just forgot how they learned the things they know now and how hard it was, but probably they don't know how to do it either, and would take at least twice as long as their estimate.)",dosadiexperiment,2025-04-11 19:37:14,5,learnprogramming,t3_1jwf1z3,False,
mmmslpr,"I was in your position before. Just my two cents:What is not ok * No onboarding structure: Being dropped into a codebase on day 4 with minimal context isn’t setting you up for success—it’s just irresponsible.* No dedicated mentor: Saying “this should be easy” to a new hire without offering guidance is lazy management. Interns and entry-level engineers usually need a few weeks to a few months to become productive contributors (reference: The Manager’s Path by Camille Fournier).* Poor leadership: The people supervising you either don’t know how to mentor—or they just don’t care to. That reflects poorly on them, not on you. * If I were mentoring a second-year college student, I’d fully expect them to get stuck and need hands-on guidance at first. That’s normal. Once they’ve merged a few pull requests and built some confidence, then I’d start stepping back and letting them operate more independently. That’s how real growth happens.What you can do * Document everything: Keep track of what you tried, what went wrong, error logs, who you asked for help, what they said, etc. It shows initiative and covers you if anyone questions your effort. Learn as much as you can but do not stress over it after working hours.* Ask for clarification in writing Something like: *“Just to confirm, we’re expected to deploy a live service to EC2 using Docker and environment variables—is that correct?”* This can prompt a reality check or at least put expectations on the record. This sounds like bad internship experience, and that’s OK. Internships are a two-way street: *they* are evaluating you, but *you* are also learning about them. If this is how this team treats interns, I wouldn’t want to work there full time. Don’t let their disorganization hurt your confidence. And like others said—prioritize school. That’ll outlast this internship.Many people have gone through rough starts and still gone on to build great careers. Doing your best in a poorly managed environment speaks volumes about your resilience. Try to take what you can from the experience, learn from it, and keep moving forward.

Now, Python does a lot of things under the hood to help you out, which is why it's good to have knowledge of different data structures. For example, Python doesn't natively have arrays. Instead, it has lists, which handle lots of things for you that you would have to do in other languages. It's good to have a knowledge of how these things work so you can better understand how to program in other languages as well, since Python won't work for all applications. You shouldn't ""choose"" C++, you use the language that is best for your application, especially if you're doing personal projects. At my job, I've automated a ton of my daily work away, using exclusively Python, because it's so easy to do and simple to write, debug, and adapt to new situations. You're exactly right with your analogy of a hatchet vs an axe. There are a lot of people who will tell you that you need an axe, when in reality, you only need the hatchet. But to answer your question, yes, Python is absolutely a real programming language, and no, it doesn't matter that it's simple. It just helps to have a little knowledge of what's really going on. Once you have a good grasp on the language, you should try branching out into a different language to learn a little bit more about programming. I personally learned Java after Python, then C++, then C (since I primarily work on microcontrollers now), and that really helped me understand what's going on, since C++ and C do not hold your hand at all.

mmwvpnr,"This is a great question.The short answer is that they do easy tricks, like replacing a multiplication by 0. They don't do many for complex tricks because analyzing the number to see if the trick applies would take longer than just computing the answer.So how fast can a modern processor ""grind everything out"" for something like an integer multiplication?The important thing to understand is that it's hard-coded in circuitry. It doesn't have to execute a bunch of steps to multiply, one at a time - the circuits are right there in the chip and they parallelize as much as possible.That said, multiplication is not instantaneous. On a modern processor you can expect it to take 3 - 5 clock cycles, whereas something like addition can be done in 1 clock cycle.So, it is worth checking for some really easy tricks like multiplying by 1 or 0. Maybe multiplying by 2 even. Those checks are simple enough that the processor can detect them when decoding the instruction and shift it to another instruction, and that's exactly what's done.But, there are a lot of ""tricks"" that humans use to save time that wouldn't make sense for computer processors, because they can just ""grind out"" the answer faster than checking it.In general when you write code in a language like C or Python, the compiler/interpreter does some easy optimizations, and then your processor does some easy optimizations. Neither of them are likely to do tricky optimizations - they're usually just not worth the cost.There are specialized mathematical programming environments, like Mathematica, where using number theory and other advanced tricks are possible.",dmazzoni,2025-04-13 15:55:37,8,learnprogramming,t3_1jya33j,False,

mmwuwza,"Truthfully at it's most basic they are not doing ""math"" they are just changing electrical state.Someone figured out what logic needed to be applied to produce the sum of two binary numbers. So if you add 01 and 01 you get 10, if you add 10 and 01 you get 11. So you can look at this as a truth table. For the first bit if you have:0 + 0 = 0 1 + 0 = 1 0 + 1 = 1 1 + 1 = 0 (with a carry)Electrically this is a xor circuit. If they are both 0 or 1 the first bit of the sum is 0, if the are different values then the first bit of the sum is 1. Now for the second bit of the sum you have the logic:If there is no carry from the first bit, xor the second bits. If there is a carry then you now have the truth table:0 + 0 = 1 0 + 1 = 0 (with a carry) 1 + 0 = 0 (with a carry) 1 + 1 = 1 (with a carry)Remember that there is carry you have an additional 1 coming it. This truth table is a xor and a not. Now you can add in the logic for the 3rd bit and so on.You might want to read: [https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb\_7.html](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb_7.html) which appears to give a good description of a binary adder.As for shifting instead of multiplications all I can answer is probably not. This is because it would increase the time to do most of the multiplications, because now you have a first step of checking if only 1 bit is set on one of the numbers then do a shift, otherwise continue with the multiplication. That check is only going to help rarely, and the check does take time.Now with a computer the compiler might notice that you are always multiplying a number by a constant like 16 and insert a shift instruction into the output rather than doing a multiplication. But that means you are always multiplying some number not known at compile time by a constant that is a power of 2. Most compilers will actually do all the math it can during compile time so if you have it calculate x \* (1 + 3) / 2 then the compiler might look at that say oh, you want really want to just multiple by 2, oh that is a power of 16, you just want to shift by one, rather than making the computer always add 1 + 3 multiple that by the input value then divide by 2.",pixel293,2025-04-13 15:51:29,8,learnprogramming,t3_1jya33j,False,

By limiting the amount of data a number can have your precision is always limited, but almost always sufficient for a lot of cases.

So when trying to sort by distance developers will just skip the square root and find the smallest dX\^2+dY\^2+dZ\^2.Other than that: compilers will do all kinds to tricks to reduce complexity, which is done with optimisation loops.e.g. constant folding. If you write const a = 10+20, the compiler will just make it const a = 30.

mmq9vt5,"Have you ever completed a course by yourself? The reason I ask is because there's a reason people go to university and major in computer science. This content isn't easy. Keep in mind, in the US, it takes 4 years to graduate with a CS degree.To be fair, in the US, you have to take a bunch of other courses. Maybe 1/4 of your courses are CS courses, and the rest are some related courses (say, in math and sciences) plus more general education (humanities such as history and English).Even so, there's a linearity to the CS curriculum where certain courses are taken before others. Much of which courses you focus on will depend on your goals. In any case, if you want to master this, you could go back to school. Yes, unrealistic, but as pointed out earlier, it's tough for CS majors to complete this curriculum with decent grades. They have the added benefit of time, friends, teaching assistants, professors, and perhaps even free tutoring (or paid tutoring). CS majors are often under time pressure to learn this material so some feel, even after a semester, that they missed stuff along the way.OK, now to address your question, this is my opinion on what to take.1. Discrete Math * This is a precursor to data structures and algorithms. I would say it's not fully required. Discrete math, in my opinion, should be a course where you learn how to do mathematical proofs. Specifically, direct proofs, proof by contradiction, and the various induction proofs (weak, strong, structural). It should also cover formal logic, in particular, propositional and predicate calculus. The rest of discrete math is a bunch of topics where you can apply your knowledge of proofs. Many self-taught learners tend to skip this and head into DSA, and that can work too.1. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) * If you were to take a real courses in DSA, especially algorithms, then you'd do work on solving recurrence relations. This is the math behind big O notation. Otherwise, you could skip that, and just know certain algorithms O(n) or O(lg n) or whatever. It would help to work out book problems, but I think implementing the various data structures and algorithms is educational. For example, I don't use pointers for work (at least, not to build linked data structures).1. Computer Architecture * I taught this a number of times. My current belief is the goal of a computer architecture course is to show you can build a CPU that can run a simple assembly language out of a clock, a flip-flop (a one-bit register), and logic gates. I had envisioned the class building this in software, but never got around to doing that. Personally, I think CS majors learn that the computer isn't completely magic (yes, it does do a lot) and realize, yes, 0's and 1's can make a program do something.Beyond that, I think you can read about the rest (e.g., computer networking and operating systems). I've taken OS before, so building something (again, super simple) is interesting, but you realize that real OSes are extremely complex, but at its core, it's something you can understand if you strip it to its bare essentials.The question, should you choose to study this, is how much time you can devote to this, and how deeply do you want to study it given a lack of resources. If you can find some online courses offered through a reputable university (you wouldn't get credit, but you could follow the content), then that can help structure your learning.At this point, you need to pick an initial starting point, which is probably data structures and algorithms as that's the most pertinent and comes up in job interviews.",CodeTinkerer,2025-04-12 13:26:54,10,learnprogramming,t3_1jxera8,False,

Return is how the function gives you what you ask for.Take some code like:```function timesTwo(int i) int { return i * 2;}```This is a function, which means it can be called from other places. It has an `int` *argument*, `i`; this means that, whenever someone wants to call this function, they will have to supply some int to be used in place of `i`. The final `int` after the right parenthesis denotes the *return type*. In other words, whenever you call this function, you are *asking for an int*. So, in all, the function represents a sort of contract: I give you an int, and you give me an int back.Here's how you might use this function:```int x = 5;int y = timesTwo(x);```What's going on here? You have an `int`, `x`. Then you initialize another `int`, `y`, and assign it to *the result of the function call*. As we said, calling timesTwo means supplying an int, and then receiving one in return. Here we are supplying `x` - that is, `5`.`timesTwo` receives `5` and uses it in place of `i` in the function body, so we can read the return statement as `return 5 * 2` which evaluates to `return 10`.Now, timesTwo promised its caller that it would give it back an int, and that is exactly what `return` does - it gives `10` back as the result of the call and gives control back to the caller, which assigns the returned value to `y`.Essentially, the return type of a function allows you to use a call to that function *as* a value of the return type in most places in your code, because the return type is essentially a promise that the function will give you a value to use there. `Return` is how functions actually make good on that promise.",Technologenesis,2025-04-12 12:45:07,177,learnprogramming,t3_1jxg1zu,False,

Here, **c\*k > c ie c\*k** will be **asymptotically bigger** than **c ,** because c,k are variables and nonetheless will be positive, and since in Big-O, we care about the dominant term, therefore it will be **equal** to **O(c\*k**). An example can be c = 10 and k = 10. c\*k = 10\*10 = 100. c \* (k+1) = 10 \* 11 = 110, which is asymptotically equal. However, for the other case ie **O(c\^k) Vs O(c \^(k+1))** ; here **O(c\^(k+1)) = O(c \* c \^ k)**. However , c is a variable and **not** a constant. Therefore, **c\^(k+1)** is **not** asymptotically same as **c\^k**. Therefore, **O(c\^k)** and **O(c \^(k+1))** are **not equal.** An example can be c = 10 and k = 4 . c\^k = 10\^4 and c\^(k+1) = 10\^5 ; a **10 times** increase in the running time**.** This is my interpretation , I could be wrong as well. Please correct if my approach is wrong. (Also, note that though c,k are input variables, when we use them in Big O , it is expected that they are large positive values, because we care about the asymptotic growth as the input size gets large. So all inputs are expected to grow larger and larger. For people who are not familiar with the word 'asymptotic', in general it means that how fast the running time will grow when input size increases. Take two functions : n\^2 and n , where n is the input. For some duration, n\^2 and n will run in parallel, but as n increases, n\^2 will grow rapidly compared to n , then we say that n\^2 is asympototically larger than n. )",Glass-Captain4335,2025-04-14 19:07:17,4,learnprogramming,t3_1jz1oep,False,

mmy5t6k,"Well, this takes a rudimentary understanding of generative AI, especially image generation. Unless you have a reasonably powerful Nvidia GPU it can be a bit challenging but I can sum it up for you. Get comfy ui and watch a few quick tutorials about it. Then learn about something called ""IP adapter"". Basically, it allows you to take an image and upload it to comfy UI to create images based on the likeness of the uploaded image.The models you use are open free to download from within the comfy UI GUI. Most people use stable diffusion, but if you have a really powerful GPUs like 4090/3090 you can use Flux. Or, if you're looking for something specific (stylistic artistic styles) you can check out civitai.com (huggingface for image generation). You can find a wide variety of LoRAs (sort of like really fine tuned mini models) for exactly what you're looking for. After typing this out, I would probably avoid going too deep down this rabbit hole if you only have 15 days. As for the video generation, I don't have a lot of experience with video generation models, but diffusion generative AI (video generation) is very similar to image generation as far as I know. So, I imagine there are models that exist that can operate with IP adapter etc. However, image generation is very computationally expensive and video generation just takes it to another level. If you don't have access to powerful GPUs, look into some of the virtual machine services. They are fairly cheap, maybe a couple dollars per hour or find a way to use a free Google Collab for compute. Then, just spool up python and create a gradio web UI for the user to do all of this connected through API.

It's absolutely easy to modify data sent by a client. If an attacker gets access to a database with the hashed passwords, they could just make a dummy client just directly send each hashed password and get access to every single account. If the hashing is done server-side and an attacker gets access to the database, the hashed passwords are useless since they don't know people's original passwords which will be put through the hash. If you really really are worried you can hash both client side and server side using two completely separate cryptographically secure hashing systems. However this doesn't add very much security - if a hacker compromises an individual's password they can still run the hash, or if they compromise the hash they can just send it directly as a dummy client. The only thing you're protecting is a potential client trust (e.g. what if they're storing the passwords in plaintext?).

Few things, though: \- The system I have in place in my schematics has three parts: Clients, Private Nodes (Personal servers), and a Supernode (Global server). \- Each server has a global identifier (to report to supernode and truly identify each user) and a local identifier to keep each user's identity hidden. Only time an admin gets to access serverside data is when a user is banned/suspended (because in this enviroment it means you either put the server's security at risk or repeatedly violated TOS/Server TOS) and the data is needed for the administrators (namely the owner of the server, for other purposes there is a separate security role called moderators, whom get lots less info for the exact reasons some of you pointed out) to debug what exactly did you break. My best guess was to save the password as the hash to prevent the server from knowing the exact password. \- I'm not in the US, so my laws aren't the same, but this was a big oversight in my part and I'd like to apologize for it.

Role Based Access Control is your friend here. Passwords could also be stored in a separate database with very restricted access. \- access to sensitive data - this highly depends on what kind of data we're talking about and where you are operating since local laws and regulations apply.

For ""who can see data they don't need to"", it's largely industry based and based on legal restrictions on who can see what data. Though it's ideal that developers only get access to the information they need to test and debug their code, this isn't always necessary. Adding a bunch of restrictions will make it harder for the developers for a slight amount of added trust.For HIPAA compliance developers may see patient records and information to debug stuff and work on code and features, but the data that they see cannot contain personally identifiable information like name/email address/phone number/home address. Since there are also people working on the login portion and might need to see this information, there's a separation or ""iron curtain"" in place where the people who work with systems that handle personally identifiable information cannot have access to medical records or information. Other industries just make you ""promise really really hard"" under the consequence of huge lawsuits and financial repercussions. Like if you're working at a bank you might get information that Apple is executing an order to sell $1 billion of USD over the course of 3 days, or even non-public information about acquisitions and mergers. Not everyone has access to this information at the bank however, just the people working on the computer systems or on the deals. A person could potentially abuse this and frontrun their own trades or hand the information off to a relative. However IMO the stakes are too high to do this in nearly every case, and everyone that has access to this non-public information has a restriction on buying individual stocks, commodities contracts, or large amounts of any currency without explicit approval from compliance.I don't know about the realm of modern laws for social media, but I do know at one point in time there was a creepy Facebook employee that was using their position and access to data stalk a user. Since then Facebook has added additional restrictions on the amount of information granted to developers, and getting more information about someone specific had to be run through a compliance team to ensure it was for debugging/programming reasons.The one place where this material non-public information restriction does not exist, unfortunately, is for the US congress. They are given zero restrictions on stocks or products they can purchase or sell, and a huge ass 45 day window to report trades. It's concerning especially considering the amount of non-public information they deal with. Like if a congressperson knows that there is a huge deal in the works for a car manufacturer, they may buy the stock with no restriction, and only have to report the trade way after the deal has gone through and the stock has made significant gains.",Spare-Plum,2025-04-13 09:49:40,2,learnprogramming,t1_mmvcb8i,False,

What would you need to do in order to receive a full-time offer?IMO it's somewhat unprofessional/odd that you were not given that feedback: part of the job of a manager is to make sure every employee knows if they're meeting expectations/remove uncertainty about where they stand. But that's by-the-by -- I think the important thing here is to get direct info + directly ask for the feedback you're looking for.> I’ve been doing a programming internship at a big, globally known company for a year nowThe length of your internship is pretty unusual. Maybe this is a regional thing, but at least in my corner of the world (US west coast), most internships last ~3-4 months, typically during the student's summer break.In any case, I do think it's reasonable for you to be feeling burnt out. I don't think it's reasonable to expect you to juggle both schooling and work for this amount of time.> When I landed this internship, I had zero technical knowledge and was just starting my degree.I'm a little surprised by this, tbh -- somebody with zero technical background doesn't have the ability to contribute in a meaningful way in a programming role. It's an odd pick for an intern; usually you want somebody with partial experience so the intern mentor doesn't need to spend time covering the basics.Did the company know this when they hired you + ask you to go through some training program? Or was this more of a hybrid internship, where you applied some of your other skills in in addition to programming? What were their expectations?TBH my first instinct here was that the company did not set you up for success by hiring you at such an early stage in your career.> I made mistakes, of course,but no one really explained what I was doing wrong or how I could do better. Any internship program worth its salt should assign you a dedicated mentor. Do you have one? If not, can you ask your manager (or whoever is managing the internship program) to assign you one?> over time, I’ve started to feel like I’m being excluded. Nothing direct or obvious, but there are signs. I try to contribute, show interest, ask questions… but everything I do seems to go unnoticed. [...snip...] Despite being an intern, it often feels like we’re expected to deliver at the level of someone with years of experience.It's hard to tell what's happening here without more specifics.For example, maybe what's happening is that you rose to the occasion and people are treating as you as having roughly the same skill as a junior engineer -- and maybe they're leaving you alone since you seem to be doing fine and are not realizing you're actually struggling to keep up? Or alternatively, maybe they're disengaging because they need to focus on their own work now, or are burnt out themselves with teaching and mentoring? It's a bit hard to say.> Lately, I’ve been thinking that maybe I should try working at a smaller company—somewhere with a slower pace, less pressure, and where I might actually be able to learn and breathe.Usually an internship has a concrete end date; I'd try sticking it out until then. If yours does not, then I'm not quite sure what's going on tbh.Other things to try:- Quit to focus on your schoolwork. Find another internship next summer.- Add your current internship to your resume; use it to help you find an internship at a different but similarly well-regarded company.- Ask if you can transfer to a different team. Maybe the working culture will be different there?- Tell your manager that you're struggling to balance school and work and seeing if they can help adjust your workload.

It feels like it's more beginner friendly and slower-paced.In that case, I'd probably do CS50x. CS50p you could even do along with CS50x but they have different emphasis. CS50p is more like a series of Python exercises and is not CS50x in Python. CS50x is trying to introduce computer science concepts including programming, but covers other topics (later on) beyond just programming.I would recommend CS50x. Search for `cs50x edX 2025` and you can sign up for free at any time, and go at your own pace.Because you've already had a year of programming, you should find the programming assignments (called problem sets) easier than most, but they are still fairly challenging. Most of the core material is in C though the first ""week"" is in Scratch which is a visual language aimed at beginners. Although the course is broken down in weeks, you can go at your own pace, either as fast as the course goes or much slower, depending on how much time you have available.That's my two cents.Otherwise, you can look for courses in data structures and algorithms.Many of the courses you've mentioned are aimed at beginning programmers with no experience.

Problen is now that this function calls the db to get the user data, and wr of course dont want to include that in the unit test as we ONLY want to test the function.This is were you use testing doubles as you mentioned, mocks, fakes and stubs. Mocks tell you if an interaction happened, for example you can check if the database function getUserData was actually called by calcUserData.Fakes are working implementations but simplified. Lets say that instead of mocking away the database, you want to use an in memory db, or you could even store values into a list if all you want is something to put in and retrieve data from.Stubs are when you want to pre-define a response. Imagine you have a function called isAdmin, which simply checks the db if the user is an admin or not, instead of actually calling the db we can simply stub it to return True or False. This is useful when you want to force an interaction. Imagine you want to test if you correctly throw an error to the user if they are not an admin, you can do that with stubbing.The mindset you need for unit testing is using these 3 tools to force yourself to ONLY test what a small piece of code does.

That NIC uses some black magic to establish itself as a given IP on your local network, let's assign it as 192.168.1.20.Any traffic on your network will be able to talk to your network card using that address, and if your computer talks to anything else on your network then the recipient will see it got a package from that address.One such device on your network is a router, which is also connected to your ISP's network.When your computer tries to make a request to something not on your local network, say.... 8.8.8.8, then it asks the router if it knows how to get to 8.8.8.8. The router then asks the ISP, the ISP knows and then tells the router which tells the computer, the computer then sends the packet to the router to give to the ISP to give to 8.8.8.8.A similar process works for resolving domain names to server IPs.So when you go to google.com, your browser asks your network card to ask your router to ask your ISP if that's possible. It is, and a request is sent to whatever address that google.com resolves to, ""Give me your home page.""Google's server receives that request and after some processing sends back an HTML file, and probably a css and a JavaScript file. So an HTML file comes from Google to your ISP to your router to your network card to your browser, and a web page renders. Then your browser also executed the JavaScript that got sent and applies the css, not necessarily in that order. The JavaScript can then phone home by asking the browser to ask the card to ask the router to ask the ISP to give a message to Google, and so the cycle continues.TL;DR: By the time you get a webpage, a connection to the server has already been made at least once. The browser handles most of the details of connecting. The JS can make subsequent requests if the programmer deems it necessary",accountForStupidQs,2025-04-17 12:57:59,2,learnprogramming,t3_1k1bjaf,False,

Where do we start and where do we end.Let's start near the top, and cover the upper level bit.When you fire up your web browser, you basically get a blank canvas.You type in the Domain Name of the website and hit go/enter.That domain name is then looked up using a name resolution system called DNS (rabbit hole one) to get it to resolve to an address. This is very similar to you looking up your friend Bob in the contacts list on your phone, since names are easier than numbers.The browser then sends a request to the server(s) residing at the address it got to download your web page. (Another rabbit hole here). This is done using the HTTP protocol (more rabbit hole), the web page is then likely to be created using HTML as the markup language (more rabbit holes). The HTML might inform the browser it needs additional bits which require additional requests to the server or even other servers. These include things like stylesheets (CSS) to make things look pretty, code (JavaScript), pictures (PNG, GIF, JPEG, etc), videos (MPEG4, etc), sound/music (MP3, WAV, etc), and others.After the first HTML page is downloaded the browser will start to render the page and all the content and the code may start to be executed. The code might do nothing until you interact with the page, or it might send a request to a server for some dynamic data, which would be another HTTP request to some server somewhere.Each HTTP request might involve a different server which we don't have the address for yet, so that would be another set of DNS requests to look up those addresses.That's the near top level of how a website works with your web browser. Your next question might be how all these abbreviations, protocols, and the like work and how they all work together and for that we have a variety of central standards that specify how these work so everyone that needs to can implement their own. The majority of these are what are called RFCs (requests for comment) managed by the IETF (internet engineering task force) and we also have the w3c (world wide web consortium) and a few other organizations/groups made up of industry specialists like IANA (they're more involved in the DNS side).We have a generic model for a lot of this called the OSI model, and that allows us to navigate the rabbit holes and find the occasional breathable pocket.Hope that helps, Wikipedia has a lot of the extra information you might want to learn about, but beware of the rabbit holes (they're everywhere).",dariusbiggs,2025-04-17 16:22:45,2,learnprogramming,t3_1k1bjaf,False,

Its like drawing rectangles under a curve for the first 2 weeks of calc 1 ... if you got the concept 30 min into it, the next 2 weeks are blah blah.Take data structures: almost all modern languages have either these built into the language or libraries where they are done for you. It serves you no purpose to build a linked list out of pointers in C; first, its inefficient (page faults), second its error prone (pointers and inexperience don't mix), and thirdly as I said, its already there to be used in a library or language innate. What you need to know is when to use what data structures, and that isn't even well explained in the courses (they focus on reinventing them, not how to use them!). So go review a web site (not AI generated, find a human written one) on when to use what data structures.Big-O is just a jargon notation. Its like the math class on convergence of sequences (if you had that one?) where you examine the dominating term to see if it converges on infinity... except here we look for it to converge on an exponent. So bubble sort, where you go over the whole list of say numbers, find the smallest one, move it one location at a time until it gets to the top, repeat for the list except ignore the top item, then next time ignore the top 2 items... converges on N\*N amount of work being done to sort the data, which you can review online how to get there but its 2 nested loops effectively over N each, so its not too hard to see (this one). Proving an algorithm takes however many operations is helpful to know if its good at its job. The good news is that studying algorithms will include an explanation of how to do big-O & use it.Which leads me to algorithms. While a LOT of algorithms are included in languages and libraries, you still need to study them and to be able to solve your own problems using either the known common ones strung together or a totally new thing. I advise you to then do a quick overview of datastructures as I said above, and after that, do a pretty solid study of intro to algorithms and keep on digging into it as deep as you think is useful. I recommend not getting trapped/bogged down in graphs or graph theory unless you think you will be using that stuff (its pretty rare in most fields).after those, study object oriented programming if you have not gone deep into it. The last thing to do is design patterns, which require an in depth understanding of OOP & other basics or much of what these are doing will not make sense.avoid leet code.

If you turn the knob all the way to the left, the musical notes generated by the sequencer will only be one musical step long. If it's all the way to the right, it will only generate 8-step-long notes.

mmvkvp7,"I really admire that you're diving into HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Python at 54—your passion and diverse background are definite strengths. That said, I want to be as candid as possible:Freelancing in programming typically comes after years of experience in the industry. While there's no formal barrier to entry beyond setting up a profile on a freelancing platform, this low threshold means you're competing against a vast pool of skilled coders—many with years of experience, advanced degrees, and robust portfolios filled with positive client reviews. Back in the mid-2010s, there was a surplus of tech needs, and companies were more willing to take on individuals with bootcamp training or certifications in lieu of real experience because the talent pool was scarce. In today's market, the situation has reversed—tech is high-paying and attractive, leading to a surplus of highly experienced, often laid-off programmers. Most companies have their pick of talent, whether hiring full-time employees or freelancers, so they have little incentive to take a chance on entry-level coders or invest time and money into training someone without a proven track record. It's not impossible by any means, but it will take several people willing to ""give you a chance."" Until you build up those client experience reviews, finding freelance gigs will be especially challenging. It's the classic chicken-and-egg scenario: you need a job to gain experience, but you need experience to get the job.The alternative—landing an entry-level programmer role remotely—is almost completely out of the picture. Remote positions nowadays are typically reserved for those who already have a strong background because the market for remote roles is fiercely competitive. The COVID era, where remote work was the norm, is rapidly fading; everyone wants to work from home, but few get to. In many parts of the world, especially in regions like the U.S. (at least where I'm writing), remote experienced freelance or full-time programmers are still a thing—but entry-level remote roles are virtually non-existent. Even on-site roles face fierce competition. I'm not sure how things shake out in places like Albania or wider Europe, but the trend is similar: only highly experienced folks, often bolstered by a flood of laid-off talent, get those remote opportunities.On top of that, generative AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are changing the game. These tools can handle many of the routine tasks that junior developers used to do—completing boilerplate code and similar work much faster than a human. As a result, the real value in programming today isn't just about writing code; it's about leveraging it to solve complex, real-world problems. The true edge lies in depth and creativity, where your ability to draw on years of industry-specific experience can help you harness generative AI efficiently—something AI by itself can't do. This shift leaves even less room for entry-level programmers, as companies lean on the efficiency of AI and the expertise of veterans.My advice? Keep learning the basics and enjoy the process, but once you have a solid foundation, jump into advanced tools like Google Gemini Canvas. This isn't just about using fancy new software—it's a reality check that shows how far generative AI has come and how it can outperform entry-level folks on routine tasks. It also reminds you that real value comes from using code to solve meaningful problems, something that only someone with experience and creative problem-solving skills can do. In other words, don't just aim to be a freelance coder; consider positioning yourself as a consultant who can merge your decades of industry expertise with your growing tech skills to solve niche, real-world challenges.Bottom line: You haven't missed the boat yet, but today's boat is more like a high-speed ferry crammed with highly experienced, AI-enhanced pros.

Complex code needs many comments to explain it. Don’t solve a complex problem when you can solve a simple one instead. Split a complex problem into multiple simple ones if you can. Don’t optimize unnecessarily. If a function doesn’t need to be fast, a simple, slow solution is fine. Each file in your project should be able to be read and understood by itself. Ideally no files should exceed 2000 lines and a competent developer should be able to read and understand the file within 1 hour. After reading the file they should understand what functionality the file provides, what libraries and other files the file depends on, how often the file’s functions are expected to be called (once an hour vs 1000 times a second), and be confident that the file doesn’t have bugs. Your code should be able to be read from top to bottom. A reader ideally should not have to jump around a file, or jump between multiple files for things to make sense. Use functions to eliminate/reduce similar code blocks. Inline most single use functions. Use single line functions sparingly. Reduce the amount of useless information that the reader has to see. Example: if a class’s field is the same 99% of the time, use a default value for the field in the __init__ function. If you pass that field in every time, you’ll waste space and you’ll make the more important set fields less visible. Use white space to separate code blocks. Too much white space can be a bad thing. Ideally a function should fit on one screen, so the reader doesn’t have to scroll up if they need to look back at a line.

Do not take shortcuts (in the beginning). Actively compare your expectations with what you read. Does it really say what you expect/want it to say?Reading documentation is a very active and hard process. I constantly check what I read against my expectations. It shows more unknowns: some I move away for later (:thinking_face:), others I keep on a stack to be resolved while reading on.I have no idea what flutter does and just checked some API reference (https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/gestures/BaseTapGestureRecognizer-class.html). Here is my thought process in reading the docs:Before reading the first paragraph I assumed I know what a *gesture* is, and what a *tap* is.I soon recognised the *abstract* keyword, which told me to expect subclasses or even write subclasses to actually recognise a tap. I remembered to look for subclasses later.I read about a *arena*, and picture of fighting recognisers came to my mind. Maybe that is a model flutter used to decide which expected gesture best matches the recorded events my fingers do? Let’s look for more information.There is something like a GestureArenaManager. Ok.What then is described matches my expectations on a tap. I was surprised to read about a button. Can I only tap buttons? What if I have a canvas to paint on or something? For now imagine a button that I can drag or tap. I expect to recognisers to fight it out in the arena.The pointer concept in the next paragraph escaped me: maybe this down-1 down-2 refers to two fingers which touch? Is down-2 completely ignored? What is down-1 is on the button, but down-2 is not? :thinking_face:The next paragraph confirms that the class is abstract. *isPointerAllowed* does not make too much sense to me. The pointer concept is still weird. But the paragraph gives some indication how a gesture might be linked to a button: Subclassing has something to do with it.Aha: a ready made, therefore less variable, therefore easier to understand *TabGestureRecognicer* does exist. Maybe I will have a look at it to better understand the concepts. Also this answers one part of the questions I stacked earlier: which subclasses to exist. My interpretation of *abstract* and *Base* are confirmed. I do wonder: “tabs *of* the primary button”? I expected *on* the primary button! I thought of a button as a screen widget. Maybe it is something on a controller (remember: I still have no idea what flutter is)?I ignore ModalBarrier and inheritance for now.I move on to the constructor: Oh! What is a debugOwner? Must be a fancy flutter concept. Why do I set supportedDevices? What are devices? I need to learn more about flutter concepts. I need more context. Let’s read on, maybe I do not need to fully understand the constructor. I might back down to the simple TabGestureRecognizer.AllowedButtonsFilter refers back to scroll click. So Buttons are probably screen widgets and not controller elements. But why allow some and not others? Weird.Deadline: Ah that makes sense again: if it take too long to tap you loose and are out of the arena.DebugDescription is probably just a nice debug meta concepts. Like string conversion of Object in Java.DebugOwner is the recognizer’s owner. Weird: Is *ownership* just for debugging in flutter? Usually Ownership is an important concept to build hieraries and split responsibilities. :thinking_face:Going on …PrimaryPointer: the pointer this one is tracking: ok my assumptions about one or two pointers (Fingers?) with Down-1 and Down-2 from above might be correct: Down-2 is from another pointer that gets ignored.Team: what is that???Now lots of methods what check and set lots of more or less expected or unknown stuff. I stop again at *getKindOfPointer*. What might different kinds of pointers be? I expect (before I click and read on) fingers and mouse pointers. I check on *PointerDeviceKind*: Touch, Mouse, Stylus, etc. my expectation is met.I thought the handle… methods to be called so an action can take place like a callback, but instead they make the recognizer handle events to do its own thing. InvokeCallback: it especially mentions exceptions: is to *just* handle exceptions? :thinking_face:Ok more methods ….If I now like to know more, I would read on the subclass and look for some code which uses it.

Are you trying to get them to understand that you may not be able to achieve the goals set for the team? Are you trying to get help? Are you just venting?Your manager asked you to help fix the team. That means she’s probably already aware something is wrong with them and is looking for you to help come up with solutions or at least help identify what they’re doing wrong. If you need extra resources or to change the roadmap or need her to back you up on process changes, my guess is that’s all on the table, but she’s looking for your guidance and some semblance of a plan. Going back to her and just saying “this team sucks” isn’t helpful to anyone.If I was your manager and you came back to me and said, “The team is broken and I can’t fix it. Please move me because I don’t want this on my resume.” I’d honestly be pretty pissed and it would impact our relationship. I’m looking for your help with a problem at your current job and you’re telling me no because you’re worried about your next job. If you came to me and said, “Here are the problems I see. I think we need to focus on fixing this tech debt for a while which should allow us to deliver faster in the future. If we can get one more engineer on the team I think that would help too.” That would be much more well received even if I couldn’t make that happen.Venting to your manager a little bit is fine, but most of the time if you’re bringing a problem to your manager you should also bring at least one suggestion of how to solve it.

I had nothing to lose so you can do that sometimes. 2nd interview - COO is involved.. Very open honest discussion, great discussion. Dude knew I achieved what I wanted in EHS, looking for an opportunity into business side (non-ehs), was bored, etc. He tells me I am overqualified and that I am better than Safety. While some may have gotten offended, I did not because I agree lol. Nothing against my EHS brothers/sisters.. I just have always been bored and found it not challenging enough (I am director level currently). He was just spot on with everything and we were just starting to converse.. At this point, my interviews are not your typical ""give me a time you had to use decision making in a high-stress situation"" but more conversational, management style, personality assessing, etc. At least in my experience the last 2 job changes.

I checked their website to see what jobs were listed, and it was only a handful and none of them would match any I would fill. I believe the COO I connected with is throwing me a lifeline for a career change.

mnl1df3,"I think a lot of these jobs outside of customer service would require some sort of sophisticated robotics component to actually replace. A doctor can talk to NurseGPT all day, but something has to put in an IV and hang a drip line. A lot of robotics actually being used are incredibly simple, flat boxes that lift up 3cm and move pallets around for example. Robotics that can stand in one spot plugged into a wall and do the same thing over and over like on an assembly line, sure, but the power usage and overheating problems need to be worked out for autonomous units. And they need to do something about LLMs confidently giving you the wrong answer before anyone will trust them.But let’s say they iron out all the kinks; I’ve heard upwards of 60-70% of jobs could be replaced. Our systems are not setup to handle such massive unemployment. All these giant tech firms are not going to give up their earnings to contribute to any form of UBI, the line must go up! There are too few politicians that aren’t bought and paid for that will actually stand up and do something. In the long run this is all just another big tech bait-n-switch. They can run at giant losses for years, maybe even decades as they continue to subsidize everything with the parts of the business that make money. They will sell a restaurant a waiter bot with the latest wAIter model installed, but it can only stand at the hostess podium, and tries to seat people at already occupied tables 30% of the time. Human Robotics promises it will replace your entire wait staff in 5 years so a few people lose their jobs. But turns out the wAIter model was just a chatGPT wrapper making API calls the entire time. Human Robotics is running out of seed money, so now before the robot will seat your customers they must watch a 30 second unskipable ad for the McDonalds across the street.It just seems like if everything works out the way the big tech companies want it’s the worst possible outcome for humanity.",squeeemeister,2025-04-17 13:45:54,22,cscareerquestions,t3_1k1by55,False,

At 1 you'll work for a few hours then go home. Maybe ping pong or something once a week if you have coworkers who are into that and you want to play. That's your day. Somewhere in there you'll go get your free coffee and a banana and think about working at a company that isn't so cheap.As you get promoted, there are more and more meetings with every promotion and you get involved in all kinds of random email/slack threads but you're also expected to get as much coding done as the L4s.Most everything depends on your team and manager. Your manager has a very large role in your happiness and how horrible your deadlines are and your team will make it fun + help you... or they won't and you'll cry yourself to sleep because you can't figure anything out.

Anyone can pick that stuff up, junior or senior, and it doesn't increase your value as an engineer on its own.Your value as an engineer comes from your ability to solve hard, impactful problems of increasing scope, complexity, and ambiguity. Scope has to do with how large a task is and how long it takes. Junior engineers work on small tasks that only take a few days or weeks. Senior engineers work on large multi-month deliverables.Complexity has to do with how tricky the actual task is. I work in video streaming. A junior engineer might work on something like ""fix this tiny bug in the encoding module."" A senior engineer might work on something like ""design and implement a scalable transcoding pipeline for use case.""Ambiguity has to do with how well-defined the task is. A junior engineer would work on something that's really obvious, clear, and requires very little clarification. A senior engineer might be given a vague problem statement like ""our video transcode pipeline is too slow. Go fix it."" or ""We need feature, figure it out."", and the onus is on them to dissect that request into actionable, concrete technical tasks for the team to work on.The more you focus on these three things, the better an engineer you become.Read [DropBox's technical career guide.](https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/ic1_software_engineer.html) It goes into even more detail than this, at all levels from junior to director.Note that *nothing* in the guide mentions *any* of the things in your post.

mnjeo02,"QA careerist here, manager at the moment. The opportunities in the discipline are dropping dramatically. That probably doesn't help you right now at the moment you need a job, but medium/long term, I would definitely look at lateral moves to other functions. I think being early in your career actually helps you here because you'll be on the junior side for whatever you do. Do some dev work in your spare time if that interests you at all. Actually, even if it doesn't interest you, it's probably a good idea.There are two kinds of SDET jobs I see these days:One, what we used to call ""white box"" - someone who has dev-level skills and has written source code or close to it. These people can stand up a test framework from scratch and pipeline infrastructure for tests to run and report. These have a little more staying power and tend to have the opportunity to become other kinds of software engineering roles - devs, devops, release eng, etc. - when the business outgrows the need for dedicated QA.Two, jobs that are basically QA and mostly manual testing, but for companies that know they need to step up their testing game and need a stopgap while they either scale up their automated CI/CD efforts or offshore manual efforts. You can tell by the way I've described it that I don't think these roles have a bright future, but you might get to hang on for a while at a company that's struggling through that process.Observability, monitoring, and deployment tools have come a long way in reducing risk in software delivery since I started my career. Issues can be seen early and fixed quickly. Unit tests are fast and cover a lot of ground. There's still some use for end to end testing, but I see a drastically reduced need to have a specialized function for it that introduces additional process and the overhead of handing work off to different people along the way.",NearbyRock,2025-04-17 05:35:27,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1k10smd,False,

And being bored at work could easily make you feel kinda burned out, or lethargic, or like the spark is gone.I resonate with this a lot, because 3 years is about the point where I start getting bored on a team. The easiest way to cure this is to have a candid conversation with your manager, and see if they can either find you some different work, or transfer you onto a different team.Doing that usually reignites the spark for me. The longest I've lasted at one company is a little over 5 years, and the main reason I lasted that long was I switched teams after 3 years. Switching teams gave me a ton of new stuff to learn, it was in an entirely different tech stack, I had to learn all the business knowledge from scratch. It's fun, everything's new again. It's shoving you back into the ""honeymoon stage"".My new grad company was actually great with this. They *encouraged* internal moves at the 2 year mark for all employees.

As always with the US, the social services are lacking compared to Europe, though if you get a high paying job with great benefits, that difference is mostly mitigated2. Education in the Boston area is excellent, rivaling the Nordic countries3. Public transit is acceptable but easily the worst out of the 3 cities you’re considering, bike infrastructure kind of sucks, but the city itself is supremely walkable4. Boston is not a late night city, restaurants and bars often close quite early compared to other similar cities5. Most of the neighborhoods in Boston feel meaningfully distinct from one another, it’s something I love about the city but you should definitely shop around for a neighborhood you like before deciding where to live6. Food is good, not great for a city of its size - beer scene is arguably the best in the country though7. Quick access to New York via Amtrak is awesome8. As you noted, Boston is probably the safest major American city and rivals many European cities9. No shade, and I’m obviously biased, but I really prefer New Englanders to other Americans and Northern Europeans. I feel New Englanders are the perfect mix of being pretty friendly and kind without being obnoxious or fake about it10. Speaking of which, New England itself is awesome. Great vacation or long weekend opportunities all over the place for all seasons11. Boston is easily the coldest and hottest/most humid of the cities you’re considering, but it also gets the most sunlight. I prefer Boston winters to Berlin winters even though Berlin doesn’t get as cold12. The rental and buying market in Boston sucks, but I’m not sure it’s better in the other cities you’re considering13.

You can also learn most popular languages pretty easily if you understand C# well. Most software engineers change languages as frequently as they change jobs.Learning some JS, Ruby, or Python might help, as those are three extremely common languages on the backend.If you specifically want to build custom tools used internally (not client-facing), there are a ton of those jobs. These days web tools are probably more common than desktop programs, but in some industries the latter is probably still common. It might be hard to seek out “internal tools” jobs, because some of those roles involve building things for the core client-facing product as well.

mne66ao,"A few pointers： 1. You probably have done some sort of system design in game coding. Knowing how parts of a system work together is something you’ve already done, you just have to abstract that to other types of systems. 2. What type of system design question you’ll be asked will vary greatly on the scale of the company, the seniority of role, and the type of roll. You should not expect load balancing questions if you’re doing a front end engineering system design interview. If you’re doing backend at an established company, they probably won’t be asking about load balancing (because they’ve already solved that), but will probably ask about problems you’ll be expected to solve. 3. Unless you’re doing system design or architecture or tooling, they probably will just want to know that you can think in terms of systems. The specific database or asynchronous job or whatever other part won’t matter so long as you know how they interact or at a higher level what pieces are interacting. They care most that you’re able to grasp the whole system rather than that you remember the names of specific tools to build the system (unless they specifically list technology they use, then you should totally know about those technologies at a conversational level).4. ChatGPT is a great tool to prep for interviews. You can prompt it to create a series of questions for you for the seniority level and type of roll and company and interview type (systems design) you’re interviewing for. If you have the job description/company, that can help it be more specific.
