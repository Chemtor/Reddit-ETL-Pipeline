Don't expect to find a job where you are free from dipshit architecture and handed up to date documentation of your data assets in day 1, maybe those roles exist somewhere but I haven't seen them.If you think in terms of business value, I'm wondering if your org's move to the cloud was a bright idea. If you're not a fortune 500, a not-terrible on prem warehouse is perfectly adequate, and a better investment in data might have actually been to document what you have and work towards a medallion architecture just within the dwh, which would have given you the opportunity to systematically unpick the sources and transformations, embedding business logic and documenting it as you go.

In your case it sounds like your org had a not-terrible thing going already, and fucked yourselves with a lazy lurch into the cloud that just lifted and shifted your existing problems.Maybe the question to ask is what it is that you like about DE.

noq1ox1,"Let me focus on data products. I have a data engineering background, and yes, these terms often get thrown into the buzzword bucket.But I actually like thinking in data products. A little story time: Our team once had a major pipeline outage (fun fact: it was when we upgraded our Hadoop infrastructure to a new major version, what a mess :man_facepalming:). Suddenly, everyone in the company understood our value, because they saw what broke when our tables and processes went down.Up until that point, I often struggled communicating our value to stakeholders. Then, during a sales call with a third-party company, they asked me, ""What are your data products?"", I heard it the first time and thought it was just management speak. But actually, it became quite a useful tool for me.While software engineers ship visible features, data engineers build invisible infrastructure. Our work powers decisions, reports, and systems behind the scenes. That makes it hard to demonstrate value.Technically speaking, I'd define a data product as a composition of assets that, taken together, deliver a result with business relevance(!). Assets can be anything involved in the process: input tables, queries, processes, models, intermediate results, etc. If we're talking Airflow specifically (because this is well known by most), that means tables, Dags, tasks, everything involved in delivering the outcome.From a data engineering perspective, data products are a communication framework to make our work visible. Simple concept, but powerful for explaining what we actually deliver.From a management perspective, a data product is a measurable business asset with clear ROI and accountability. It's something you can point to during budget discussions, assign ownership to, and track performance against defined SLAs.However, not every table, task, or Dag is a data product, but it might be part of one. It's a good exercise to identify them by looking at: Business impact (if this disappeared tomorrow, would executives notice? Would customers be impacted?), orchestration complexity (we had a super Dag triggering lots of other Dags, that was a clear sign for a data product), and high-value consumption (multiple teams depending on it, feeding executive dashboards, etc.).Look at all your data assets, try to group them together as data products, and also learn what value those data products generate (e.g. what are the tables, reports used for? Is there any measurable impact like revenue, cost savings, increase retention times along the chain?). This will help you to communicate the value of your work, be it internally or when applying for a new job and it helps understanding what needs monitoring and observability.**Basically: When they work, they're invisible.

Said in another way, you could (in fact, I do) have jobs that are processing records in batches (everything from the past 24 hrs), BUT the way those jobs are triggered is thru a pub/sub architecture. Meaning its not a a run-at-3-am cron scheduler, but instead events & rules on an aws event bus. So in this example the ""choosing batch"" does not automatically exclude the Event Driven part. Our glue jobs were built to process records in batch, but then we also went back and swapped out the scheduled runs with pub-sub events.... and all of this was done **without touching the glue code...** Batch to streaming is a bigger effort to transition to. Scheduled to event driven is much easier, I do not mind using aws event bridge + step functions. Eventually I'll get around to refreshing quicksight data sets with the same pattern.

npfw4lg,"As /u/mysterious_rub_224 pointed out - event-driven & batch aren't opposite ends of some spectrum, they coexist just fine. Almost all data pipelines I build leverage small micro-batches with event & temporal triggering: * Data streams into files on s3, persisted once either a time or size threshold is met. Max time is typically 1-15 minutes, depending on the feed. * Once it lands all further processing is typically event-driven leveraging s3 event notifications and parallel processing kubernetes, ecs, lambda, or whatever. * If downstream apps need to run against newly-arriving files, they can subscribe to s3 event notifications for when they do. These can also be translated to load timestamps & ids if the apps want to query the database rather than just read the s3 file. * If downstream apps need to run against a certain newly-arrived period of data (ex: the most recent day/hour/etc) then a specific agent is responsible for periodically querying the data and is solely responsible for dictating when a given period is complete. And then it sends out a sns message and apps can subscribe to that.The net results is that it's extremely resistant to data quality problems from late-arriving data, it delivers data as quickly as it's economically feasible, most of the system is fault-tolerant and self-healing, and you don't have bloated daily processes failing in the middle of the night and lengthy outages, you deploy during the day, you know immediately if there are problems, and it doesn't take 8 hours in the middle of the night to know if the fix worked.",kenfar,2025-11-18 04:29:23,2,dataengineering,t3_1ozu1qq,False,

AI should be able to read the code and tell you what it’s doing. 2. Transforms: Same thing with analysts/wh users. Describe the table/views/columns and ask them to state their assumptions. Their data is a lot of work and valuable! We’re moving towards making data products. 3 exposures: approach business owners and those reporting to business and at this point just ask for the reports/models/ which see important and a URL which can get you to the report, or to know what is being referenced. “If you tell us what you’re looking at, we can ensure it’s not impacted by warehouse changes and upstream data evolving”1.

npgnzo1,"Near-real-time? Short answer: Flink.Long answer: I already worked in a setting in which the pattern was trained using scikit-learn (it was a simple classifier that considered 50 dimensions and decided if the event was fraud/not fraud). We packaged it and exposed it through a FastAPI endpoint. It was deployed on k8s with a load balancer for horizontal and elastic scaling. The main app called the endpoint with the payload and we answered with a float (the score). Using FastAPI background tasks, we sent asynchronously the payload, timestamp and score as a JSON to S3 (we could also have published it to Kafka). Then, a small ETL orchestrated by Prefect imported the JSONs into ClickHouse. The API was capable of answering the request in \~100ms. It was fast enough for the small product we had back then.Coming back to Flink: I believe that for usecases that requires statefulness, it is indeed the best solution. You could also use Spark, even though it will very likely be slower. Another good fit is TImeplus/Proton (waaaaaaay easier to setup than Flink, the tradeoff being the flexibility on the choice of the pattern).",palmtree0990,2025-11-18 08:39:47,12,dataengineering,t3_1p01h3l,False,

npqtnte,"OOP really shouldn't be a goal in itself. There are some people (usually from a Java background and sometimes C++) that seem to think all production code must be OOP which it sounds like you have run into. This mindset leads to odd things in Python, like classes with only one method other than init (just write a function) and classes with only static methods (just put the functions in a module).Python often lets you write simple clean code by just putting functions in modules or passing them as arguments without classes. In a lot of DE code, functions are often only run once rather than many times across an application so there is less utility for OOP than there is in SWE.OOP is worth knowing of course. Some examples from the last week I've had is writing my own Operators and Hooks in Airflow which requires you to inherit from various base classes, another would be managing database connections. I have also written code using the connector design pattern to allow easy connections to many different cloud storages for a pipeline.Python is a very loosy goosey language in OOP terms so I'd stick to Python specific resources or you will get confused. I'd recommend ""Python 3 Object-Oriented Programming: Build robust and maintainable software with object-oriented design patterns in Python 3.8"" by Dusty Phillips.

The Backend and Tasks seem to be the main expansion of your transactional data, so your processing bottleneck will hit there first.

np79ard,"For transparency, I am a co-founder of Bruin, an open-source platform for ingestion, transformation, and data cataloging. I will keep the advice general and vendor-neutral.You are on the right track. What you are feeling now is the natural boundary of relying on complex views in OLTP Postgres for BI and cross-system logic. The good news is that your data volume is still small, so you have a lot of cheap, simple options before needing a heavy architecture.A very important point: you do not need to move out of Postgres yet. One of the biggest cost-effective wins is to stop running 20-join views and instead materialize those transformations into tables on a schedule. Postgres can easily serve modeled fact and dimension tables for years at your size. And even in a warehouse or a data lake, you end up materializing tables anyway, so this work is never wasted.If you eventually add a warehouse, S3 + Athena or Snowflake are both very cost-conscious. You are already on AWS, your data volumes are small, and both fit the medallion pattern cleanly. Athena is extremely cheap (5$ / TB processed). Snowflake gives more predictable performance on small workloads. If you are comfortable running your own infra, ClickHouse on a single VM is one of the strongest low-cost OLAP choices and works well for real-time dashboards.Whatever platform you choose, keep your transformations in SQL. At your scale, you do not need Spark or distributed compute. Most transformations and even ML feature engineering can be done in SQL. Use Python only where absolutely necessary.A big structural improvement is to model your Backend and Camunda data properly once. Instead of repeating joins or routing everything through a massive consolidated view, create clean fact and dimension tables in Postgres or the warehouse. This will eliminate most of your current performance limitations.For ML and RAG, storing curated datasets as Parquet in S3 is ideal. Cheap, flexible, and compatible with all downstream tools.For ingestion, modeling, scheduling, and lineage, you can keep things simple by using a single unified tool. Bruin can pull from&to Postgres and APIs, run SQL transformations, and give you lineage and a catalog without stitching together multiple systems.If you prefer a more modular setup, dbt plus a scheduler (Airflow, Prefect, Dagster) is the standard alternative.At your stage, a simple setup is enough: keep everything in Postgres with materialized tables, or store raw data in S3 and model it in Athena or Snowflake before sending it to Metabase and saving ML datasets in Parquet.

Or use Databricks directly, but centralize it: one or a few pipelines per DB, scheduled jobs, and a shared compute / serverless SQL warehouse, instead of one pipeline = one cluster.The confusing bit with Databricks “Ingestion Pipelines” is they’re optimized for their own Auto Loader + cloud files, not as a general CDC platform, so you end up with lots of tiny jobs and infra to babysit.

For schema changes, version your mappings, keep a permissive extension field for unknowns, and add contract tests (Pact) so upstream changes don’t break you.I’ve used Debezium/Kafka and Fivetran for movement; DreamFactory was handy as a quick API proxy to wrap a Django service with auth, rate limits, and response shaping when DB access wasn’t allowed.Net: keep the API as source of truth and build a proper cache or CDC read model, not another brittle copy.",Adventurous-Date9971,2025-11-18 07:50:57,4,dataengineering,t3_1p05nq4,False,

nppq1or,"What you want is basically CDC from Postgres into a vector DB with an embedding step in the middle. The common DIY pattern is: use logical replication or Debezium or similar to stream row changes out of Postgres, push them into a queue or Kafka, then have a worker service that takes each insert, calls your embedding model, and writes vectors to Pinecone or Qdrant or whatever. That works fine, but you have to think about deduplication, replays, backfills, and schema changes yourself, plus make sure updates and deletes are handled correctly instead of just inserts.On the managed side, this is literally what we see people doing with Estuary. You can use the Postgres CDC connector to read inserts and updates directly from the WAL, so every new row for that table lands in a collection in near real time. ￼ Then you point the Pinecone materialization at that collection: it will generate embeddings using the OpenAI embeddings API from the document fields you choose and push both the vector and the original record as metadata into Pinecone, continuously, so your index stays in sync without custom glue code. That setup covers your main headache areas like ordering, retries, and exactly once replication, since the platform is built for streaming pipelines rather than batch syncs. ￼Biggest challenges you will hit either way: backfilling historical rows into the vector DB, handling updates to already embedded rows, deciding what text to embed from each row, and making sure your embedding call usage does not explode cost wise when you do a full refresh. With a homegrown setup you are wiring all of that yourself with workers and checkpoints; with something like Estuary you mostly configure some projections and let it handle the plumbing from Postgres to Pinecone.How real time do you actually need this, sub second or like every few minutes is fine? Also, are you only ever inserting, or do you need to keep vectors in sync on updates and soft deletes too?I work at Estuary, so take that into account.",dani_estuary,2025-11-19 18:55:58,2,dataengineering,t3_1p1ek48,False,

The upside of this is that it's a common pattern that most of your customers will understand. The downside is that they have to write code (ie do work) to get the data out. The shape of the data is limited to what you serve over the API. It also puts a bunch of extraneous load on your servers and db (we've seen APIs be taken down because they were being scraped aggressively for BI purposes).* you can let your customers download CSVs. Like the first option, this will take work on your side to support and operationalize. The upside is that it's a pretty well understood pattern. The downside is that your customers might get annoyed quickly because this is a manual process: if they want data with any kind of regularity, they'll have to do this over and over again.* you can upload the data to an S3 bucket (or other object storage like R2 / GCS) and let your customers read it there. This is similar to giving them access to a database that you own, but gives you better cost and load protection: they'll be using their own compute to read it so it's less likely they'll blow up your bill by reading the data (though they can rack up big egress fees if your dataset is large).* you can share data directly to your customer's database or data warehouse. The upside is that the data shows up directly where they're ready to consume it, and they have to do zero work in order to get the data. It's also much more secure than letting them access your database directly (for example, they can't take your database down by accident by putting undue load on it). The downside is that it can be more or less cumbersome for your team to implement, depending on whether you build it in house or use existing tools.

Messing around with computers, experimenting with viruses (at one point my laptop was full of malware), camping our computer classroom during secondary/high school studies - all of that was interesting for me. So, I went for a degree and I never regret it. Started Bachelor studies when being 28. Graduated when being 32, and then followed it up with Master studies in Cyber security. And working as a junior software developer at the same time.Self-study will not take you far. You do not know what you do not know but what you should know. While in a university professors know what you should know and make you to study it. Even when you do not like it. Yes, you can google ""X roadmap"" or something but this only touches the main topics not tells what exactly you have to learn in it. You can also pick some online bootcamp course, but this only teaches you the very basics that usually is not enough to get hired.With self study your portfolio will be much more generic. You'll be copying the tutorials you are following, writing meaningless calculators. While university studies will introduce you into much more complex topics and also will give you more variety ideas that you can turn into projects. Either as part of your course studies, as part of hackathons, part of the computer club or robotics club or such that you might join, or as your Bachelor thesis project. Also, you'll learn all the theory that comes handy later on. Online tutorials and bootcamps show you how to write a functioning simple prototype but they do not tell you why to do it the way you are doing. And often they leave out all kinds of things that will be needed during your work as a software developer.And then there are connections. All your course mates, professors, computer club mates, they can later on help you with finding a job. Most of your course mates graduate and get hired. Some of the professors already are working in different companies while also part time being lecturers in a university. People can give you referrals. You'll get none of that as a self-learner. Now, to the downside of doing these studies: you won't be able to study full time and work full time at the same time. Either your studies will stretch over to 4-6 years, to lower your study load, or you'll have to lower your work load. I was working with 50% load and studying full time. And I run out of all the free time. Sometimes my flatmates (I shared an apartment with other students) found me sleeping in the middle of my notebooks. I feel into sleep while studying. Also, it can cost for you. Where I am from, university studies are free for our citizens. Well, free as long as you are passing your exams and not failing some course. Retaking a course will cost. But in other countries it can be that the studies fully cost money.

We have noticed how one team had started producing visibly worse PRs recently. With stuff that clearly comes from an AI: needless comments, helper methods that make no sense, deleted parts of unit tests / integration tests, unnecessary visibility modifications (making a method public when it has absolutely no reason to be public), using full-path dependencies in a code (instead of using ""import this.is.some.package.dependency"" they use it as ""var this.is.some.package.dependency = some value or initialization"", etc. Stuff that serves no purpose or is even dangerous (deleting functionality to ""fix"" tests).We have just rejected such PRs when the PR makes no sense. If it is a small code smell or such, we let them change it. If it is a nonsense, then we reject it and tell to rewrite the code. ""IDK"" is not acceptable answer to comments that we add.There have been also some complaints that we do not accept such PRs and the task stays unfinished because of taking too much time in the code review phase. But then we just escalated our concerns to our managers. It is their responsibility to talk with the managers of other teams for them to deal with their developers. Inside our team we do use AI tools but we also share both pros and cons with each other to teach the whole team to not fully rely on an AI and to not permit AI-generated code that does not first pass the review/criticism of the developer himself. We also are using SonarQube tool for checking some of the more common mistakes in coding style and such. The person who is pushing his PR has to fix these findings before even forwarding the PR to somebody for a review. We will not consider a PR that has unfixed findings from SonarQube and from one vulnerability check scanner.Also, the PR has to have a good test coverage (measured by another tool). Adding a feature without tests that verify its functionality, that also is not an option. The coverage % will drop and is visible from the PR.I'd say that first talk with these bad actors.

np9a3kq,"By ""small indie studio,"" are you referring to an actual company that hired people and pay them, or just a team of volunteers that someone with an idea recruited on Reddit and Discord? I've worked with plenty of indie teams of the latter, and the skill/experience level of the programmers that you find in those are very low. It's usually someone who just started learning game dev after watching a tutorial video on YouTube. Sometimes, you find someone who already knows how to code because they're a CS major in college or something. It's almost never an actual experienced programmer, because they're usually not out and about looking for unpaid or rev-share work. It's one of the main reasons why I stopped working with other programmers on projects. I can code the game by myself, and I team up with artists, composers, etc., to cover the skills I'm not good at. Finding a good programmer out in the wild is like finding a needle in a haystack, and the bad ones just slow down the team. Even when someone says they have several years of experience, you have to take it with a grain of salt. I worked for a studio with a dev whose LinkedIn showed 3 years of game dev experience, but he didn't understand the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms. He wrote a path finding algorithm that took 3-7 seconds instead of the 40 milliseconds it should have taken after I fixed the bug. The bug? The GetNeighbors function was iterating over every tile in the game board (several thousand of them) to find the neighboring tiles each time it was called, instead of simply retrieving a stored list of neighbors or using a constant time method like adding/subtracting 1 to the X, Y, Z coordinates. If your studio is actually paying people, your studio needs to re-evaluate what they're paying for. If it's a team of volunteers, just let go of the unskilled programmers.I also hope that your studio isn't trying to build a MMORPG that's supposed to have thousands of players all in the same server interacting with each other in real-time or something along that line. If the project is over scoped to a degree that's challenging even for AAA studios, it's very unlikely that your studio will succeed with a team of volunteers who have no obligation to stay on the project.

They also were juniors once. They also were slow, once. And even there is no point to compare yourself with other juniors. Every junior has a different past. Some juniors got a degree. Do you have a degree or you have a diploma or neither? Some juniors participated in computer clubs and such, during their studies. Some have been coding since a kid/teenager because their parents were in the IT field.Compare yourself only with the past you. Did you learn anything new during the sprint (or, if your team is not using sprints then during last week/month)? If you did, then well done. You are only competing with yourself. Not with others.Ask your boss if the time estimate in these tasks is taking you into consideration or the time estimate is how majority of the team members should be able to finish it in time. Let's say the time estimate is 3 days. Is this 3 days what your team mates should be able to do it in given time or is this 3 days also what a fresh junior should handle? Ask him what will happen when you deliver your task one or two days later. Depending on a project it can be that nothing happens. Some projects are quite agile. Client is fine with waiting some days more. Other are public sector projects where the government and ministries are setting fixed deadlines that can't be changed. Perhaps you delivering your stuff one or two days later, as a new junior, is totally fine. YOU must talk with your boss over this.You are not expected to work off the clock. This can give wrong idea to the boss. Perhaps they should put more days or story points to the estimate when going over the tasks in the backlog. But when you are working at the night or something then they will not see this (unless you push your stuff, then pipelines will leave a mark behind). Work 8 hours a day. For the better or for the worse. You doing overhours WILL start affecting the quality of your tasks. Right now you are freaking out over a bug. The next time you might blow up their test environment or something. Because of being too tired, from working more than 8 hours. Stop working more. Get rest.Bugs happen. This is why QA and/or developers testing the product exist. Even mids and sometimes senior developers have a bug in their code, a missed business case. Or a client asks something to be changed. You have to write tests to your functionality. Then test locally. Then test in your team's testing environment (if it exists). And after that pass it on to your team mates (QA or just other developers). They will do a code review and will do the testing. It is a normal process flow. Especially as it was a small bug. That is fine.Your boss is right. You must communicate more. If you are stuck then ask for help. Tell what you tried, what did not work out, where do you think the issue is (or where it is not). And people will help you out then. If you feel that you are running out of hours then talk with your boss. It is his job to ask more hours from the client or re-prioritize tasks. But when you are not communicating with your team and with your boss, then nobody can help you.",mandzeete,2025-11-15 22:29:16,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oxzm5c,False,

I quit my old job to move to a major tech hub (this was before I had kids -- it would be much harder to do this now) because, you know, you should go where the money is. And by ""move"" I mean ""sleep on the floor of the one guy I know in this city"".I was very quickly disabused of the notion I'd get hired as a software engineer because 1) I had absolutely no worthwhile experience to speak of, and no one is hiring you off a portfolio.\[0\] 2) I was objectively unqualified, which I can now say with the benefit of hindsight. I wasn't competent enough to understand how actually incompetent I was.After sleeping on my friend's floor for a scary six months of unemployment and failing to get hired as a software engineer, I changed my approach from ""What can I do to get someone to hire me as a software engineer?"" (because that clearly wasn't working) to ""What can I do to get on a path that will allow me to take meaningful steps toward my goal?"" and this basically unlocked everything for me.I made lists of what I deemed the ""right"" companies to facilitate my growth. These were:1. Companies that were smallish but definitely growing. Successful startups or just post-startup-phase companies. Places like this, you're going to get asked to flex out of your zone all the time, and internal mobility is very high relative to the Googles or Metas of the world.2. Companies where software engineering was in the DNA of the company: whether it was a strong engineering brand, or the customers were engineers. I wanted to become a software engineer, so I wanted a place that had software engineering top of mind (ie not like, a photo-sharing app or dog-walking-as-a-service or whatever).And I guess (3): a place where my past background might be at least slightly relevant, to leverage in some way the value of my past life.And from there I made it my goal to get \*any\* role in one of those companies. I would have taken a role in the kitchen.I got hired as a non-technical customer support agent at what was the dream company on my list. And I spent the next few years proving to them that I am awesome and capable of bigger and better things, and after a few years transitioned internally to a software engineering role, which I would have ABSOLUTELY NOT ever been considered for as an external candidate, largely because I was not competent to do the job. It's much, much easier to become competent while you're inside the house. When you're on the outside, you're largely flying blind and it's very very easy to waste energy.

npp1x74,"The value of taking notes isn't the note itself, it's having written it in the first place. You are exercising your mind by writing it.In the industry, documentation is scarce. The point of you writing your documentation is to get you to think about what you're doing in your homework. You're practicing structured thinking and discipline. It's helping you more than you realize.The only reason I write documentation is when I'm publishing an API. Clients rely on accurate documentation when consuming 3rd party code. The documentation is either correct - or it's COMPLETELY DEAD. If your documentation betrays the client, they'll never trust the documentation or the product ever again. You wouldn't, if it were you.Beyond that, there are design documents that describe system architecture at a high level. This is for internal consumption for my colleagues. I don't rely on my own documentation.The last layer of documentation is the source code itself. The program documents itself. Abstraction hides complexity and tells us WHAT - this is the most important; an `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`. The implementation tells us HOW - and we really don't care. `std::for_each` could be in terms of `for`, `while`, or `goto`, I don't give a fucking shit. Comments in the code tell us WHY, and provides context.Outside of your class requirements, you never write documentation that tells us what the code tells us. If I see: template std::span::iterator median(std::span);I don't need to be told the `median` function computes a median. I need to be told the parameters are a sorted range and the return value is within the range, because I can't express that in code. I need to know the rounding function used, as it's consequential. I don't care how the median is computed, otherwise.There are a TON of bad comments, and they should tickle your intuition that something ain't right. The problem with comments that tell me what the code tells me is who is the authority? The code or the comment? This matters when the code and the comment don't agree - which they usually don't. A comment might be a heading, telling us where we are and what the next segment does. We call those ""functions"". Break your code up. Let the compiler elide the calls and composite the function for you. It's a sign your functions are too big.Another way comments and documentation warn you of bad code is that the whole thing is bad. Getters and setters - ""Gets the thing"", and ""Sets the thing"". Bad sign. Getters and setters are not OOP, if you're busy learning that, they're an anti-pattern. It's a sign of boilerplate - which there should be none. It's redundant. You have a misunderstanding of applied software engineering, and this code can't be justified when there are equal or superior solutions.Use bad documentation as a test for code quality.

You don't need to learn every single thing from all of those areas, or even from a single book. Just being familiar with the core ideas / basics helps a lot. Then slowly study more of those books and topics as time goes by.But here are some of the best programming books that were popular already back in the 1990s:* The Art Of Computer Programming series of books (Donald Knuth)* Design Patterns (Gamma, Helm, etc.)* Anti Patterns (Brown, Malveau)* Refactoring (Martin Fowler)* Pragmatic Programmer (Hunt, Thomas)* Introduction To Algorithms (Cormen, Leiserson)Those should get you really far. And the more you test everything you've read and learned from the books, the faster you'll become good at what you do. So don't wait to try out the ideas from those books. Try them out when you're reading, if possible. Pick a project or two and develop them from start to finish. You'll learn tons that way. Only reading doesn't get you very far.

Go with Python for its clean syntax—check Codecademy's free module or Python docs to build easy classes, say a Car with drive and honk methods. Java's good too if you want stricter rules; Oracle's tutorials are free and solid.Once that's down, build projects to make it real,a text RPG with inheriting character classes or a bank app with transaction types. Use Replit for quick setups and GitHub to track and learn from others. Do a couple projects monthly; that's where OOP clicks, not just reading.For deeper stuff, grab ""Head First Object-Oriented Analysis and Design"" for its visual take or ""Clean Code"" for practical tips. freeCodeCamp has interactive sections, Coursera's Java OOP course from Duke is structured well, and YouTube spots like Corey Schafer show examples clearly.

I very much recommend that for a -very- deep dive! If you are more into data structures than user interfaces, taking a deep dive into the **Collections framework** in Java is another interesting example of using OOP! And of course, there's always the option of building your own game - like e.g. **a simple text adventure**, with objects representing items, rooms and characters, using inheritance and polymorphism to give different items either similar or different attributes, and letting objects communicate, like hitting an enemy with a weapon could happen as the player-object calling a hit-method on the enemy-object with a weapon-object, and the enemy-object then asks the weapon-object how much damage it would inflict, and subtract from its own health.

Their intent would be clearer if they'd called the function `toggleAutoPlay` too.You don't need the if statement at all if you use code like this:- let intervalId; function startAutoPlay() {   intervalId = setInterval(function () {       const playerMove = pickComputerMove();       playGame(playerMove);     }, 1000);   document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').innerHTML = 'Stop';   document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').onClick = stopAutoPlay; }; function stopAutoPlay() {   clearInterval(intervalId);   document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').innerHTML = 'Auto Play';   document.querySelector('.auto-play-button').onClick = startAutoPlay; };Instead of checking state variables and branching, you just make the click event point to the right code block in the first place, Personally I'm not a big fan of the choice to put the looping function inline either, there's a lot to be said for a few extra lines of code and the additional clarity.",motific,2025-11-18 18:36:55,2,learnprogramming,t3_1p0evm0,False,

UNIX pros will have no trouble typing the above command, but after a few times of using it they will probably start to hate it. New users, of course, will be lost trying to type the above.Imagine your program worked like this instead: ./my_awesome_program -o my_output.txt my_input.txtIn general, that's much easier to use, for newbs and pros alike. But of course you'll have to write at minimum some code for processing the arguments (see Python's argparse, for example), and code for opening input files, opening output files, checking for errors, etc. However, such code is definitely reusable across projects, though, so once you've written it once, you can and should reuse it in many different such command-line tools, not only to prevent code rewriting, but also to enforce ""consistency"" in your CLI apps.BTW, even for programs that accept input parameters by naming files, it's a popular convention to also allow an option to read from standard input. This is particularly useful if the input the user wants to process comes from another file. Typically this option is called ""-"": ./some_other_program_that_produces_output | ./my_awesome_program -o out.txt -So in that way of calling the program, the output goes to out.txt, and the input comes from standard input (specified by the - argument for the filename), which we can see comes from some other program (but your program should not know nor care about that).

That's why we made better CAPTCHAs. When the best OCR could outperform the worst human, we changed techniques. Pick the stop sign. Solve the math problem. Slide the puzzle piece. These all got defeated in their own way. It didn't remotely require ""AI"" in the buzzword context we use it today.The modern ubiquitous reCAPTCHA - owned by Google - is more focused on behavioral scoring than solving a challenge. You won't get specific details on how it works, that's by design. Security through obscurity is still important.Mimicking imprecise human input is not exactly difficult, and still doesn't require ""AI"". From what I understand reCAPTCHA is as much about browser fingerprinting, IP reputation, web history, logged in Google account and many other signals, as it is about checking if the mouse shakes while you move it. Cloudflare does something similar. These signals are relatively easy to defeat at the individual level, but harder to scale. Which is really what most websites care about - not a couple bots creating accounts, but a troll farm creating hundreds.Google constantly improves detection with machine learning. Google doesn't publish the efficacy of reCAPTCHA. They may not even have accurate figures themselves, because identifying real world bots is exactly the problem. [Independent research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12108) suggests reCAPTCHA v3 may be the most effective CAPTCHA and highly accurate.

The server can take a list of prime numbers, and select 'n' random prime numbers from that list (repeats allowed), quickly compute the product and send it to the client.

So that’s why in lot of people say that OOP is essentially just a method of encapsulation.Also as someone in this thread pointed out, everybody defines OOP bit differently, for what’s it worth I recently saw this definition and kinda liked it: ”compile-time hierarchy of encapsulation that matches the domain model”",UdPropheticCatgirl,2025-11-18 08:08:49,3,learnprogramming,t3_1p05ueo,False,

Primitive data.2. Aggregation of primitive data (optional).3. Associating behaviour (functions) with (aggregated) data.You have a form of OOP from this point but you can go further:4. Runtime polymorphism and dynamic dispatch of functions (ability to treat sub-types as super-types, and looking up which functions to call based on which concrete type your data is to select behaviour at runtime).5. Optionally, encapsulation of the data. (access modifiers at language or design level).6. Design patterns (e.g. GoF Patterns for OOP).Those are basically the core OOP concepts. Plenty of implementation details within each (e.g. message-passing, vtables, etc.)It will be useful to look at the differences between OOP in message-passing langs (Smalltalk, Ruby, etc.) vs something like CLOS (Common LISP) vs any class-based language (Java, C#, C++, etc.) vs a prototype-based language (JS etc.) for differences in the interface presented by the language to the programmer as well as implementation.",HashDefTrueFalse,2025-11-18 11:22:27,2,learnprogramming,t3_1p05ueo,False,

npig3pr,"Object Oriented Programming is based on an ideology, whereas Functional Programming is based on mathematical principles. I'll tell you right now that FP is consistently smaller, faster, easier to maintain, and scales better than OOP. You REALLY should focus on FP.The principles of OOP do not cause OOP, they come out of OOP as a consequence. So you can use abstraction, polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance as standalone idioms, or in other paradigms - Functional Programming has all these things, too - and you can still completely miss OOP.OOP is all about message passing. It's also known as the Actor Model of computation, which you might want to read up on. There's an old tome called Theory of Objects you might want to track down and read, you might want to Google Alan Kay and Carl Hewitt. You might also benefit from dabbling in Smalltalk for a bit - Squeak is a modern implementation.---In OOP - you send messages to objects, and the objects decide ENTIRELY how to handle that message.You do not call `car.accelerate();`, you instead create a message, ""I wanna go faster"", and you pass that to the driver, and the driver decides what to do with that. MAYBE they accelerate the car, maybe they maintain a more consistent speed by moving to a less busy lane, maybe they take a shorter route, maybe they're already doing everything they can and have to ignore you.Java doesn't have a message passing interface like Smalltalk an C++ do, but you can build something - make a `Producer` and `Consumer`, both derived from `Runnable`, that share a `Message` queue. In Smalltalk, message passing is a language level construct. In C++, it's standard streams.You are giving the object - the actor, autonomy and agency. You are not giving up control. You don't need to command the object what to do and when to do it; it's your object - you built it, you designed it, you've just relocated WHAT and WHEN to somewhere else in your design - when you construct the object. Want a more aggressive driver? Give it more aggressive characteristics as a part of it's construction parameters. Now when you pass it messages, you know it will drive as predictably as you have prescribed.Objects have no public interface beyond the message passing interface, maybe some necessary boilerplate per your language. You don't GET or SET anything - members are implementation details. You don't push or pull information, you can send it messages with new information, or you can submit a question or query and maybe get a response. Normally objects are constructed in terms of other objects. A car that is accelerated - you don't QUERY the car for the speed, the transmission sends a message to the speedometer, which could be a text output, it could be a widget, an analog device, a HUD...So in OOP, you assemble this graph structure of objects as your nodes and message channels as your edges. Your inputs are a source, a monitor, a motor controller, a log file... These are sinks. Things in the middle of the graph can be both sources and sinks - you can make objects that produce their own messages, consume messages, and produce other messages as a response. Perhaps a motor controller is producing heat, speed and power consumption on its own, but also responds to control inputs to speed up or slow down, and acknowledges it received the request.I dunno, use your imagination.OOP is GREAT for graph theory, which means it's great for distributed systems. Bjarne invented C++ because he wanted to build network simulators (could have just done it with a matrix - linear algebra is great for solving for networks), but its performance is quite damningly limited. It's ability to scale is also limited - you can scale your graph horizontally all you want, but eventually the size of the network becomes the most limiting factor and you can't get additional performance.You can abstract any problem into the OOP domain. That doesn't mean it's a good fit. You can make a text character an object and pass it a message asking it to capitalize itself. This is how Smalltalk works, since everything is an object. But consider the overhead... OOP, Smalltalk presumed a smart compiler, an investment in the paradigm could make the object oriented nature compile out, leaving optimal machine code behind. I don't suppose that's flawed, but it would be an investment in this unique programming paradigm. You're basically trying to get the paradigm out of the way so you can get back down to the lambda calculus formula of computation that the program should actually be.So in any of these languages, you can create User Defined Types, as classes certainly are, but that doesn't make them object oriented. Without that autonomous agency, without message passing, it's just more imperative programming, where you're taking direct, explicit control of what happens, when and where.And think about it, once you have an object that accepts messages - you have abstraction aka complexity hiding; you don't know how the object is implemented and you don't care so long as it behaves as it should in lieu of the message. You have encapsulation, which is that bundling of state and functions, aka you can build it internally in terms of stateful behavior. You have polymorphism, which is the ability to interchange any object for any other and they each decide what a message means to them. And you have inheritance, which is an implementation detail, but gives you type hierarchies for when that is sometimes useful.You weren't TRYING for any of that, but you get it for free.",mredding,2025-11-18 16:04:29,1,learnprogramming,t3_1p05ueo,False,

That is, if an A objects contains a B object that contains a C object that contains a D object, then BW argues that A needs to know all the dependencies of B and C and D.Except, of course, *nobody actually writes OOP this way.*In real life OOP we use dependency injection.

So in general it’s good to keep them separate.That said, there are tools that integrate a language and GUI framework pretty seamlessly, and languages that are meant only for use within a particular platform.

Then framebuffered graphics cards became a thing, and then all of a sudden there were window managers and bitmaps, but the languages pretty much stayed the same. Libraries of course helped create an interface between the language and how data was represented visually.There will always be a separate layer between the general purpose language and the UI. Also, people have different ideas of how a UI should be represented. For example, the Win32 API lets you call the OS layer to draw windows, buttons and style them according to the OS, but that means you can't use your program code as-is on another platform like Linux.Libraries like GTK and QT attempt to solve this problem by creating their own API, which calls the underlying OS to create some of the OS-layer objects like windows, but does the rest of the display stuff itself, in order to have a consistent cross-platform experience.So most language rely on separate libraries or frameworks, like C#/.NET having WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) that is Windows-only, or AvaloniaUI which is cross-platform, and MAUI, which is... well...Then different libraries have different ways of abstracting the layout, so WPF uses XML or rather XAML, Kotlin has it written as code.",rupertavery64,2025-11-14 13:12:42,1,learnprogramming,t3_1owq8fz,False,

If just looking directly at the requirement, it seems like the minimum parameters would be the item number and location to be delivered to. It does make sense to also parameterize the ""1 hour"" part assuming folks using the API would be interested in other time frames, too.I think I prefer /centers as the end-point, since presumably a list of that resource is the return value, and the rest as query parameters treated as filters. They could even be nested as filters to make it explicit. Or they could have filter added to the query parameter name.I would not do it as 2 queries without knowing more requirements that would justify an API like that. You'd want an API like that for various reasons. But without any reasons, you may as well just make the API as friendly to the user calling it as possible. 1 call is certainly more friendly than 2. It's also almost always more performant, though I wouldn't worry about performance without a specific reason to.Since it's your API, you can of course require the user to pass the item ID in. Since the requirement is so open-ended, I would just assume the user has an item ID, unless there's some reason to think they don't.

Where does that leave us?Maybe `GET items/{itemId}/availabilities?deliverTo={}&maxTime={}`?The `Availability` entity could include things like Time, Center, etc.> do you think it is okay if we require the user to provide IDs of the entity they are seeking as query parameters?Yes it's expected that they would know the id of the item that they need more information about",Lceus,2025-11-14 18:34:05,3,learnprogramming,t3_1ox0anw,False,

LLMs make this part even faster, which can be nice, especially when I have writer's block.But.I have to go back and read through everything it wrote, make sure it works properly, make sure it caught all the weird edge cases specific to our codebase, make sure it matches our coding style, make sure it's going to be reliable, make sure it didn't hallucinate. I usually end up having to rewrite a decent amount of the LLM generated code.This sucks because reading software and auditing it is much harder and more intellectually draining than writing it.Figuring out what you need to write is the bulk of your job, understanding the specs, understanding the context of your changes within your codebase.

At medium to larger size orgs there tends to be a split after senior where you decide to either continue advancing as an IC (with titles like staff, principal, architect) or go into management (with titles like manager, director, senior director, VP, CTO). As a result staff or principal engineer wouldn't be considered management. As these titles are in the IC track. This can be important because if you say you want to be an architect or staff title but are talking about management you may be sending mixed messages to gatekeepers. I was surprised about your post title and then the contents of your post weren't about jobs that are commonly thought of as being management. They may think you don't know what you want. Or worse they may think you aren't experienced enough to know the difference and set your application to the side.\> my manager keeps saying i'm ""operating at the next level"" but when i apply for staff or principal engineer roles, either internally or externally, i hit a wall.You will have to be honest with yourself here as we can't evaluate you. But if you are struggling in the behavioral and system design rounds it doesn't sound like you are there. You shouldn't be struggling at all in a behavioral at any of the titles you've expressed. Those titles have a lot of coordination with other stakeholders and you should be able to breeze through them for those titles. Likewise system design is also a fundamental task for those titles. If you are struggling then that may mean you haven't worked on complex enough tasks for them to feel comfortable hiring you with that title. Yes interviewing is a different skill, but it's just as important for getting the job. Yes sometimes the interview is harder than the actual job.If you have skip level meetings I'd highly encourage you to talk to your manager's manager about getting specific with what ""strategic thinking"", ""broader impact"" and ""working on communication"" means to them. Strategic thinking to me would be forward thinking about the feature not just how it's used right now but how will it be used in the future, should it be architected a little differently so we can get future wins for free. You may already be doing this, and what you really need to work on is how people perceive you. If you aren't explaining your thought process to your boss then he may not realize that you are doing ""strategic thinking"". You should be doing this in 1 on 1s. Sometimes using the phrases they care about can work too. I know it sounds dumb but when they are filling out a review and you've been consistently talking about strategy for a project to make sure it has impact can go a long way. Broader impact tends to mean impacting multiple departments. If you are already doing that it might be code for you getting more visibility within those departments when you work in projects that impact them. That could be scheduling meetings to ensure the technical requirements will fulfill their needs. Yes product is usually involved here, but product isn't technical and may not make optimal choices.It should also be noted in some companies they have to have a business need for the title you want to be promoted into. You simply operating at that level isn't enough justification.Lastly, the market is utter garbage right now. You are competing against a lot of other people.

""Strategic thinking"" and ""broader impact"" mean different things at different companies, so without specifics you're just guessing. i went through this exact thing trying to move from senior to staff at a company in the loop about two years ago.the problem for me was that i was still showing up in interviews like a senior engineer - talking about technical decisions, code quality, architecture patterns. but staff/principal interviews are fundamentally different. they're not testing if you can build systems well (they assume you can), they're testing if you can influence the direction of multiple teams, if you think about technical strategy at an org level, if you can identify and solve problems before they become fires.i worked with close cohen career consulting when i was trying to figure this out. the big shift they helped me with was moving from talking about ""what i built"" to talking about ""what technical problems i identified and how i influenced the organization to solve them."" like instead of ""i designed and implemented a new caching layer that improved performance by 40%,"" it became ""i identified that our scaling issues were rooted in inefficient data access patterns across three teams, proposed a comprehensive caching strategy, and influenced those teams to adopt it, resulting in 40% performance improvement and $200k in infrastructure savings.""same technical work, but the framing shows strategic thinking and org-level impact. the mock interviews helped me practice talking at that higher altitude without losing the technical credibility. i ended up getting promoted to staff internally about 6 months after i started really focusing on this, and now i'm fielding recruiter messages for principal roles.the chicago market is competitive but there's definitely demand for senior ic roles. you just have to communicate at the level they're hiring for, not the level you're currently at.",Main_Lengthiness_606,2025-11-16 15:23:11,36,cscareerquestions,t3_1oyl3ce,False,

npkiea1,"Most AI performance measurements are not credible, and growth in that sector is not sustainable because of the costs of the underlying infrastructure. Neural networks don't scale very well, and the explosion in their usage from 2010 onwards was basically only enabled by improvements to GPU hardware.Those improvements have plateau'd, both due to shortages of silicon, and due to how little headroom there is to make hardware breakthroughs at the moment. We've basically hit the point of diminishing returns for the everyday consumer and for business use of LLMs and GPT systems.With that in mind, I can't predict the future, but for the time being, LLMs and GPT systems are *a convenient excuse* for the layoffs required in the post-COVID recession conditions. Businesses don't like to scare their shareholders and stakeholders by saying ""the market sucks and we shrunk"", so they spin it as ""we adopted AI, so the 40% reduction in forces is actually 40% efficiency!!!"" LLMs and GPT systems also took off right when crypto startups needed an exit plan and a way to unload *thousands* of GPUs.So you'll need to prepare to job-hunt in a very large recession, and the AI / ML sector is currently experiencing a hype bubble. Obviously, some of that hype is totally valid -- they are fantastic at classification problems that don't have formalized training sets. But, a lot of the hype is business people and end users not quite understanding the shell game going on. And there's plenty of grifting because people think they'll be able to sell their ""bottle imp"" before it's too late. LLMs and GPT systems will remain, and they're *really* cool. But not $10B+/year cool, and in 10 years it's **astounding that they are no closer to AGI than when they began promising it ""next year""**.As a new grad, you'll need to keep yourself sharp until you get your first role in the industry.

There really hasn't been anything new in the software world (outside of Gen AI) in quite a while, and what has been done before is quickly becoming so saturated, that there's not a whole lot of reason to make more of it. Software has eaten the world, but it turns out the world was not as big of a meal as what was once thought.For example, you see posts like ""wow Gemini 3 can make a threejs game!"" or ""look at this fancy UI GPT-5 made!"" and they are for sure impressive if you are completely unaware of how commonplace it is for people to make stuff like that since well before generative AI took off.Look at [Deepmind's game examples](https://www.youtube.com/@googledeepmind/playables) on Youtube, you have:1. A very basic dungeon crawler in threejs2. A starfox-like3. A subway surfer clone with a pirate theme4. Astroids5. A space invaders cloneAll of which are impressive if you've never made them and have no clue how to, but none of which are new or innovative.

That requires a lot of dedication, and frankly, down right hours on the keys at the desk that most people aren’t willing to put in.Most teams will end up with their senior engineers being the longest tenured engineer on the team or someone rotated over from another team who was either a rising “true” senior engineer or more likely: just one of the longer tenured engineers who is backfilling another person’s position. Most engineers with a senior title are mid level engineers who haven’t left.To be a “true” staff engineer, you’re doing everything a senior did, but expand that across team’s through your entire department. Now take the hours you invested in your original team to be a senior, and multiply it by number of teams (roughly). That’s way too many hours for most people to want to invest to reach this level. Even after you make it to this level, your desire to stay here might wain and while your titled a staff engineer because you were performing at that role, a few years later you’re essentially a senior again because you don’t want to keep investing the hours.I quoted “real” everywhere because titles mean different things at different companies and the lower the max TC a  company offers: typically the lower the bar is for a higher title.

Staff and above focus more on why.As a staff, it's my job to become deeply intimate and opinionated with the product or platform I am paid to improve, as well my company's technical roadmap. From there, I need to form solid business cases as to what technical work is most important for my team, defend those with SLT or C-suite leadership, and then set up my seniors for success in the execution of that roadmap.As a senior, it's your job to become deeply intimate and opinionated on the problem that's put in front of you, likely a project from your staff dev or manager.

novq48i,"Yeah, I usually see them as MLOps Engineer or Data Science Engineer, though they can also be listed under more generic AI/ML Engineer, or even occasionally as Data Scientist, depending on the organization. But there's absolutely a career to be made in the space.Candidly, I find that ML Engineering as we're discussing it isn't really an entry level role, but more something that a software/data engineer or data scientist will lateral into if they have an affinity for it. While as an ops/deployment person you won't need to have the same familiarity with the statistics/math as the data scientists and researchers putting together the initial proofs-of-concept and models, you're going to need enough familiarity to be able to sense check things, collaborate effectively with the research side, and, from time to time, optimize the approach without negatively impacting the model capabilities.Key skills include traditional software dev, including the usual system design, engineering, testing, etc., with a few other things. For embedded, there's additional nuances around programming on custom boards, signal processing/cleaning, and to some extent hardware tinkering, and for cloud/forecasting stuff, parallelization and distributed computing comes up with some frequency. Some of the more relevant challenges I see day-to-day are around model instrumentation/tracking metrics, managing cloud costs, runtime, and wrangling tech debt that inevitably spawns as the model pipelines keep changing.I'd personally want to take a software engineer with a few years of experience working in the cloud, or someone who's done some lightweight embedded stuff, and get them up to speed on the ML-relevant side. I could probably take a data scientist and do it, but I've found that most professionals that grow up on that side have pretty terrible programming skills. It's easier to beat data quality and validation into an engineer's head than to get someone up to speed on formal engineering, I find. Though if our nascent ML Engineer is bad at math and logic, their career in ML will probably be pretty short lived.Edit: For LLMs, I think that there isn't much reason (apart from political organizational reasons) to have ML/DS teams responsible for applied LLM implementations and deployments. You'd think that people who should notionally be familiar with the math would be more clear-eyed on what these models can and can't do, but that doesn't seem to be the case--so in my mind, there isnt't a reason to bother having a data scientist involved in the implementation from a technical standpoint.

I would argue something like:""Developed a DAG-based AI inference engine for video analysis using Python, FastAPI, and TensorFlow for deepfake video analysis.""is better than:""Wrote a python backend service for a machine learning workload.""Be specific and provide overwhelming evidence that you have done useful things. The evidence is these hyper-specific bullets. Be ready to talk in detail about everything you say you have done. It is really easy to tell when someone is talking out their ass about a resume bullet point. If the interviewer is doing their job they will ask you to get specific. Specificity, detail, depth of knowledge.The best way to get these bullet points is for every single job sit down for at least thirty minutes and just write every single technology you used and every single thing you did. Be painfully verbose in your listing of things. Once you have that you can go back and create bullets like the first one I showed you.I would focus on LinkedIn (shocker), Dice, and Indeed. Dice and LinkedIn are where most of my 'in bound prospects' come from in terms of job opportunities. Dice has actually been really great for me. Get your profile there up to date and as specific as possible.Now let us talk applications. You need to be doing hundreds per day. Don't waste time creating tailored resumes to job postings. Your resume will likely get lost in the sea of other applicants. I wish it was not this way. When I was looking for a job when I got laid off earlier this year I was doing 200-300 a day or more. You will find out eventually that most recruiters look at the new job postings Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday so Saturday and Sunday are GREAT days to slam job postings but you need to be ass-in-chair submitting till your fingers fall off every single day. Do as many easy applies as you can stomach then start moving toward the regular job applications. APPLY, APPLY, APPLY. It sucks, it is boring, it is a numbers game. I had 10+ interviews a WEEK for almost a month when I was doing this. It works.Have two or three references ready to go that you can submit if recruiters or job applications ask for them. Let them know you are applying to a TON of places. It speeds things up if you don't need to ask every single time.Back to the resume thing. It is a good idea to have 2-3 developer 'archetypes' you want to apply for. I have 'Full Stack Python focus', 'Full Stack TypeScript focus', and 'Full-stack AI infrastructure focus' archetypes ready to go. Then you can go to LinkedIn and type 'TypeScript Software Developer' and crank through applications.Also, I like to have at the top of my resume a little blurb that shows what I am:""Software Engineer with experience building AWS-native Python applications to automate critical workflows in the insurance industry as well as large-scale video analysis for customer POCs, securing $10K+ MRR deals, and developing a Python-based DAG-driven AI inference engine for deepfake video analysis.""The HR person or whoever is looking for X type of developer and if you can put that in front of them your chance of getting a callback goes way up. Do EVERYTHING you can to show them you are what they want.One more thing, on LinkedIn it is a good idea to filter by 'Jobs Posted in the last 24 hours'. I applied to some of those earlier this week and within an hour got a call from a recruiter for one of them. This has happened many times.This is how I hunt for jobs, it works for me. It is alot of work but its pretty straightforward once you have the resume and profiles ready to go. And I don't mean to be an ass by bringing this up but I make $150k a year, graduated late 2024 with my CS degree. I landed this job in a tough job market.

After accepting the offer, I brought up this dilemma with the hiring manager. He would wait a few weeks if he had to, but of course, he emphasized that he needed me ASAP. Ultimately, I decided I had to look forward and accepted the start date before the bonus payout. My previous employer did end up paying a decent bonus that I missed out on.I've been at this job for two years now, and in my opinion, there was no actual rush where a few weeks would have mattered, but as soon as I mentioned it to the hiring manager, I realized that it was now a test of my commitment to the new job.

noo8ec5,"I think y'all are misunderstanding side projects. Originally, recruiters would scout people with impressive side projects because it gave strong signals about technical excellence/leadership/etc. So job search gurus started to spout the idea that having side projects would help differentiate people from other candidates, and new grads started to misunderstand it to mean that \*they\* have to have a side project. But now we're in goodhart law territory, aka ""when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure"".Thing is, the original people getting scouted are senior level high achievers with years of experience. And yeah, the average run-off-the-mill new grad project is nothing to write home about. What people don't realize is that the ""years of experience"" from these high achievers also include a graveyard of side projects that never saw the light of day. Side projects are largely for upskilling and exploring the depths of some technical specialization/area. When you see people getting scouted for a side project, that's survivorship bias from those that stuck with a side grind for years.New grads themselves seem to at least half understand the importance of ""years"", since years of schooling is what differentiate them from bootcampers, right? But they need to be productive years: it's a very different thing to coast during uni playing games like all your buddies did in high school vs going home after uni classes and hacking on side projects and coming out of graduation with a very good idea of what the professional landscape of your desired specialization looks like.There's a saying that the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago and the second best time is now. Side projects are like trees. If you want the fruits of labor, then you ideally should've had the project for a while already, but if you're just starting, don't expect it to be bearing fruit next month.",lhorie,2025-11-13 18:22:30,11,cscareerquestions,t3_1ow81hu,False,

noo79az,"Hi again. I think these are the things you really need to take to heart:1. Recruiters really don't care about the reality of your projects. They normally do not look at Github accounts, project sites, project descriptions, and the like. Nor are they normally equipped to actually judge anyone's technical skills or the quality of a project. Recruiters really care about essentially checklists - previous experience? education? does everything look OK? are the skills there, maybe?2. I (as an interviewer) don't typically care about your resume holistically. By the time I'm given your resume, I'm already slated to interview you. I may not even look at your resume for more than 10 seconds depending on the type of interview I'm conducting.3. Hiring managers may actually be the person who care the most about your resume as a whole if they are involved in selecting resumes.4.
