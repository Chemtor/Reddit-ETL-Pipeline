So if your company uses AWS and you need a data warehouse, it's likely that leadership just chooses redshift, despite the fact it shouldn't really be used in most cases. Check out this [white paper](https://www.redshift-observatory.ch/white_papers/downloads/introduction_to_the_fundamentals_of_amazon_redshift.html) for more info.

mqnpaxh,"I spent a couple of years with redshift and I would pick literally anything else. Redshift is a very black box that throws unexpected errors and is very difficulty to introspect.One of the more frustrating things it does is it can sometimes pick a query execution path that it doesn’t support depending on the tables you’re hitting. Exact same query, exact same table structure will error from one execution to the next.It doesn’t support all of SQL and I don’t mean the syntax, I mean that certain sub queries and joins will sometimes not be supported.When it encounters an error it shows up as a stack trace to an internal C file that you don’t have access to.It’s also sometimes wildly inconsistent where the compute nodes and the main node have different behaviour. You need to internalise what will run where to be able to keep track.It’s a pain in the ass to optimise things because makes it hard to turn off caching and other optimisation to be able to measure execution impact of iterating on your queries, it rewrites queries into multiple queries and makes it a pain to track down how things are getting decomposed.Redshifts feature development is very slow, and it has surface level support for things like JSON. I wish we had gone with something like ClickHouse where you have some hope of seeing long standing issues and features gaps get resolved over time.It’s also quite complex in terms of managing it, if you adopt it and actually use it you’re gonna be spending a lot of time learning things that are only relevant for redshift which is a huge time sink. One of the major selling points of redshift is the price, but when you need to spend money on salary to manage redshift that calculation may not work out in redshift favour.",kitsunde,2025-05-05 04:49:33,19,dataengineering,t3_1kf1uff,False,

mqoecom,"I think some of the hate is unjustified, some is justified.A huge part of the Redshift hate is people comparing Redshift to an entire ecosystem such as snowflake or databricks. The comparison isn't equivalent. Redshift in combination with other analytics services such as Athena gives better results. It is the complete AWS analytics stack which needs to be compared with snowflake and databricks, not Redshift alone. Recently AWS have begun to address this with the new Sagemaker Studio.A huge chunks of the complaints fall in this category - UX, and features which are outside of Redshift but possible with other very well integrated services. On the other hand it is true that Redshift tuning needs higher skill and detailed knowledge. A lot of people don't understand what MPP is. Or how database internals work. However if uses correctly you end up running a cheaper and more efficient system.Personally I haven't seen any ""random errors"" - I've generally been haply with Redshift.After a long time looking at such discussions I've concluded that it's usually a problem of engineers not making an effort to understand their tools properly. You can run any platform - AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, BQ. Each has its pros and cons.Good engineers will figure it out, bad ones will complain. Maybe I'm just cynical.I know people who are happy with AWS, happy with snowflake, happy with Databricks, and also others pissed off with all of them - several migrating in between different stacks.The biggest sell of snowflake is that it is an easy environment to work in, but more expensive - what you save on salaries you may spend on snowflake.

This can be a lot of work. And also ugly in its own right when building an ecosystem around a third party.Sometimes what you are dealing with is just the name of the game. Organizing workflow for all your processes will make the biggest difference. A real basic breakdown of what I like to see:1) Store the raw data, either unstructured or semi-structured, or both. (If semi structured, some of the parsing step should be broken out to accommodate first)2) Parse the data with a schema/layout (if not meta data driven, just write some sql or code. Depends on how much time you have on your hands and if you expect to support many dozens, if not hundreds of layouts. Or just 7. In which case I’d dumb it down) should initially store everything as string, imho. I personally like to stage as stricter data types when reasonable (dates are a great example), as long as I’m capturing the raw data elsewhere.3) validate parsed data with a schema/layout. (Layout-specific validations — discovering inconsistencies from customer-specific problems4) transform data (and/or structure) using a schema mapping. 5) Store the sanitized data in a staging area.6)Validate data in staging area (validations on sanitized data)7)Send valid staging data to prod.Such system still has limitations as I laid out above, but if you only need to consolidate behavior, you need to build a workflow that will validate data from source, transform the input to a common output to be loaded from, then validate data at this staging area to validate for the destination (prod).",BarfingOnMyFace,2025-05-05 15:24:11,8,dataengineering,t3_1kf6eym,False,

I have seen so many databases filled with stored procedures that no one wants to touch and they aren’t being version controlled.With DBT you organize sql scripts in nice little project folders. Add as much or as little documentation as you wish. You can reuse common snippets of code (macros) among the scripts, which is helpful for making the code modular. The whole thing is code so it harmonizes nicely with git and version control. Finally, the little SQL scripts are easily referenceable by orchestrators to be used as building blocks in other programs.Duckdb is used to create versatile lightweight ephemeral database instances that can hold a lot of data in memory and can run blazing fast queries and joins in SQL. If you need to temporarily store data then duckdb is a nice way to ingest, transform, and stage data on its way to some more permanent system. Well, you can even use duckdb as the final resting place for some data since it is after all a portable embedded database like SQLite. Duckdb can fit just about anywhere in a data pipeline, but it’s especially useful for memory-intensive or slow tasks that are bottlenecking your workflow.Honestly the tools have a ton of overlap and you could very well use both, like [this guy](https://georgheiler.com/post/dbt-duckdb-production/).",BrisklyBrusque,2025-05-02 04:19:50,56,dataengineering,t3_1kcrd8o,False,

Didn't ask a single question, no comments or suggestions. Meeting ends, we all go out for lunch and invite him, he says ""go ahead, there's some personal stuff I need to take care off during the lunch break, see you soon"". The guy never came back. We were all shocked, ""maybe it's something I said?"", ""did he think our architecture was so bad he didn't want to work here anymore?"", etc. I was a little suspicious because in the quick small talk we had he didn't seemed like he was a very experienced programmer, so I asked my boss to send me his GitHub profile. There were dozens, maybe hundreds of repos there. I started to click in each one and... It was all just repos forked from various open source projects with ZERO changes from the guy.

I work in mobile gaming, unfortunately going full Google stack is the pragmatic choice. They take 30%+ of your revenue on the store, admob takes an indisclosed % of ad inventory and for marketing ads your also having to trust their pricing algorithms - oh and pay for search ads, which is a straight up mafia style extortion :P Add to that the tooling, we are going Google in the order of millions- 10s millions a year. For that wonderful cost, you get broken products and some incredibly sub-par support - as a company they are so segmented that none of their business facing staff actually know anything with any practical depth. The only way they could be worse was if they were ironsource or Apple.AWS on the other hand are a dream.I'm starting to think the migration to cloud was a mistake. The idea 20 odd years ago was less code to manage and simple environments to deploy, with more reliable backend. Most cloud suites are a bloated mess, with skill and time requirements slowly creeping up to just having a dedicated backend team. Also, the nature of being a black box with slow response to business issue, they are becoming unreliable at scale.Granted, when it all works my life is a dream.

mr60l73,"I was a DE in RL during 2024 and left in Jan this year, so just giving my 2 cents here.Obviously, if you don't currently have a job, the answer is yes, especially in the current market. Not much to talk about there, so I'm going to assume that you do have a job that you are hesitant on leaving because of stability concerns in RL.IMO, there are three main factors for you to consider about stability. The first is the stability in the role itself. This depends almost entirely on what org the role is hiring for. Roles supporting, say, the RL games catalog/shop might not be as stable as roles supporting login or service stability. Even the most recent round of layoffs within RL only affected those within Oculus Studios (at least, as far as we know).The second is the overall trend of RL. Lots of people online seem to have a negative view on RL's trajectory since it's been a massive money-sink for Meta, but I personally would be surprised to see real mass layoffs across RL anytime soon.The third is the stability of Meta as a whole. From what I can tell, people within Meta feel very insecure about their jobs, especially after the Feb layoffs this year. I got to witness both the Nov 2022 and this years layoffs, and from what I can tell, moral is at an all-time low right now, even compared to Nov 2022, which was almost 3x as big a layoff. Several of my coworkers across multiple teams were already on the verge of burnout before Feb, but now, people are worried about this year's layoffs happening every year. Even though everyone that I worked with at Meta seemed like genuinely good people, many voiced concerns about others stealing their work, overtaking their scope, and whatever else they need to do to get great yearly rating, because apparently even just a good yearly rating isn't good enough to secure your position, and every year, the bar raises. Given the current market and that people's livelihoods are at stake, it's definitely a reasonable concern.Without more context about your current situation, like your current TC, financial responsibilities, or personal and/or professional priorities, I can't confidently give any solid pointers, but despite all of the doom I just posted, if given the opportunity, I would advise most people in most situations to take the job. Meta rewards you very handsomely for the shit they put you through and are not afraid to promote you in just 1-2 years if you can perform. I've heard of senior engineers breaking 7 figures because of stock bonuses and the stock's performance in the market. That kind of compensation is usually reserved for staff+, and if you can achieve even just half of that for one year, the amount you earn can be life-changing. Also, as others have mentioned, having Meta on your resume is incredibly valuable.If I were you, I'd definitely at least try to get an offer. In the meantime, you can weigh the different factors in your life that you care about. You won't even have to actually make a decision until you get an offer, and even if you decide to not accept the offer, you can at least try to leverage that offer at your current job for a raise.Good luck!",YUGETBPLUS,2025-05-08 00:54:20,23,dataengineering,t3_1kh8yub,False,

Also it would require for you to go back and change previously written partitions as time goes on.The functionality more so exists so say you have a massive table where you want to “evolve” the schema and/or partition over time, you don’t have to rewrite the whole table.What you are proposing could work, but I am guessing you would be incurring some performance hits because now your query execution engine has to factor in multiple partition patterns. Would be curious actually about how this turns out.What I normally do is instead I will have my “source table” with all data that is partitioned yearly as my “cold” storage. I will then incrementally build another table that is just maybe 1 year or month worth of data partitioned by month or day as my “hot” storage. Yes I am duplicating data but the compute cost to query is significantly less. This is also very easy to do with dbt. Also cost of storage is cheap which is a big selling point of Apache Iceberg in the first place.Edit: And of course anyone who needs more data will accept that increased cost and simple go to the full history table.",teh_zeno,2025-05-04 09:10:14,5,dataengineering,t3_1kedne3,False,

mr3e5ik,"Sorry for a big fat ""it depends"" answer. I think decisions like this exist on a spectrum, for the sake of your question.If the ML prediction outputs are something that is very ""closely"" tied to the document records, then re-funneling things through the raw layer so that it all flows downstream, could make a lot of sense. A trivial example, would be like a ""word count""... I don't really see anything wrong with adding a ""word count"" column alongside the original raw data, especially if downstream datasets will also benefit from it.If the prediction outputs are something that is totally separate from the original records, and/or if you plan to expand your ML platform to cover more models and different kinds of predictions, then it probably makes more sense to aim for an independent architecture, use things like MLFlow for tracking/registering instead of the existing DWH governance. But there's no absolute right or wrong here, it all depends on what direction the team is going in, what kinds of skills or resources are available, etc. There's no point pursuing a ""pure"" ML architecture that is too big for you, if you are a single solo MLE and can't support it well. OTOH, if the team is gearing up to invest more deeply in ML overall, then the calculus for making future-ROI investments can be weighted differently.",strugglingcomic,2025-05-07 16:52:10,3,dataengineering,t3_1kh1wtp,False,
mr3gc9h,"The ML outputs should definitely be re-ingested as a new source in the raw layer and make its way up the various layers. My team is doing with both ML and LLM outputs following same pattern.The reporting layer for model ready inputs is also a good idea (and something my team is doing). To add the ML/LLM outputs to reporting layer, you just need a separate object in your reporting layer for the final consumption. Our ML/LLM versioning is handled outside of the warehouse (through an app we built) and ingested into the warehouse. We have a generic section of our warehouse dedicated to modeling the ML/LLM workflow that includes entities like document (text/data evaluated), the prompt (type 2 generated from app data that version controls the prompts) and the ML/LLM outputs of each version of the prompt that was used against the given 'document'. All data flows through this generic model and then flows to the various reporting layers that need it. This also provides standard building blocks for document chunking/RAG which we have built on top of this. Not sure on exactly what you mean by pushing the derived data breaks the idea of it being raw data? The point is that is raw data, totally new. Take away the ML/LLM model used to create that data, you can't regenerate that data using SQL with the data you already had in your warehouse. It's a totally new source of data, hence it should be treated as such and move through the raw layer.",FactCompetitive7465,2025-05-07 17:02:23,6,dataengineering,t3_1kh1wtp,False,

mr7rzsm,"No problem with the it depends as long as it’s as well explained as yours. Thank you for the insight!Predictions right now are for example article topics. The outputs are mostly used for reporting right now and even in the case of a recommender system, ML outputs would just be stored on a feature store and repurposed for the system or other models. A first question would be, what do you mean with an ML output being closely tied to the record and how do you measure it? In a sense, all ML predictions based on articles used for reporting a related to the article itself, but how that requires funneling them again to the raw layer I don’t get yet. Another question would be tracking lineage, output versioning and handling re-edited articles. The team uses dbt for ETL and lineage tracking, I don’t know if this would influence what integration to use. Moreover, if we were to track prediction versions, this could be handled in a feature store. But the real challenge is handling re-edited articles that must be repredicted and what integration would facilitate triggering repredictions and updates into our DWH.So far the options have been funneling to raw layer or an independent architecture sourcing from the analytics core, processing predictions in an independents architecture, and the piping predictions back into the later reporting layer. Only draw back is looking the dbt-integrated lineaging creating a kinda black box effect. But then again, this could be tracked from the ML side. What do you think?",octolang_miseML,2025-05-08 09:18:24,1,dataengineering,t1_mr3e5ik,True,
mr5fc4v,"Yep, this one.The ML prediction/classification aren't part of the data flow or modelling inside the dwh. It is a downstream system that generates new data that needs to be ingested.The days going to ML might change in some incompatible way, so this allows the ML output layer to account for that, rather than breaking things at the integration point. If the data from the ML changes then that forces to raw, and it goes through a usual process of standing a schema change or a new source.Another way to think of it is that a dwh processes *never* goes backwards through the layers. That makes it extraordinarily difficult to pick where to put the ML inputs and outputs as the most sensible place to integrate the data into other models could be anywhere, or in multiple places, or it might move. Therefore you treat it as external, you send it says from some output layer, and you interest into your raw layer.",azirale,2025-05-07 22:51:45,1,dataengineering,t1_mr3gc9h,False,
mr7sw81,"Thank you for your insight, I think you just clarified the concept of raw data and how ML outputs could be considered as simple another source of raw (aka new) data. In our case, we have data from different products going into the raw layer, later processed and aggregated into fact tables. Your suggestion is that ML models would be based on the aggregated data in later layers, be processed in an independents architecture outside the DWH, and then piped into the DWH as an additional source of raw data. Correct?Since predictions of this type would be tied to a uuid (here an article id), I’m guessing it wouldn’t matter if the ML predictions table have the schema of the aggregated tables (i.e. not a product wise schema, where each product comes in as a separate source), because the predictions table could be rejoined by uuid in the aggregated tables or even earlier, while still passing through the whole generic model.

This task might need highly refined prompt with many instructions (and RAG) + good (large) thinking model that can give correct results.At the same time, results may be much better if context is not SQL database but data model inside BI tool and output is not SQL but rather simple report configuration (JSON), generating this kind of structured output is much easier task for LLM (even small models you can self-host with ollama!) which doesn't require thinking, in fact users can get a relevant report in seconds.From BI end-users perspective, another useful application of LLM can be assistance with report's analysis: imagine that user opens a report, and simply chooses from menu ""Get Insights"", ""Find Anomalies"", ""Analyze trends"", ""Generate summary"" and this report's data context is passed to LLM with an appropriate fine-tuned prompt.

mqofhw9,I’ve effectively made this transition over the past few years because I’ve been in your situation a lot so I guess here’s my thoughts: 1. Learning ‘data ops’ will only make you more employable and will never be a bad thing. A lot of data teams are not fully supported by a central devops team so being able to do it yourself will be invaluable.2. Don’t try to be an out and out data ops engineer. Most business do not hire for someone that specialises. Being a data engineer with a lot of data ops experience will get you a long way in my experience and is probably better for your employability.Anyone else out there feel free to correct me if you think I’m wrong - this is all anecdotal from my personal experience.,valligremlin,2025-05-05 09:13:50,6,dataengineering,t3_1kf454a,False,
mqog35e,"Hi! I am a little experienced programmer (\~20 years), mainly in heavy-data-oriented companies (banks, governmental taxes, investment funds, energy). IMHO, DataOps - and similar teams - are costly solutions for an underrated way of seeing data.Even companies dealing with high volumes of data can use other solutions, which - although old-school - are cheaper, effective enough, and have known, stable tools. Companies have analytics teams, reporting teams, controlling teams, etc., working closely with IT. If all they deliver useful, valid data, it's good enough. DataOps as a team is another layer of organization, which requires more collaboration, more tools, more discipline, more dependencies, etc., giving unknown (maybe?) better value. Which company wants to pay for it?!DataOps should be more a general concept, a part of strategy, like DevOps, not a new role or a new team. (BTW, this is one of the reasons for failure in introducing DevOps - by a team or a role foundation.) Of course, this is very convenient for some people to have a visible ""thing"" on an orga chart, with attached obligations and maybe some KPIs, but it is not working for 99.9% of companies - I guess this level, but I will try to justify:DataOps as a team or a role is a kind of coordinator role. There are two general attitudes (it's malicious, but it's for real): first, this role is given to the least competent person, who needs to do something, but in this role can't mess up anything; second, this role is given to the most competent person, who quickly becomes a bottleneck.But there is easier, working alternative, which paradoxically is also a MUST for DataOps: collaboration between parties. Without collaboration DataOps is probably impossible. With collaboration DataOps is probably not necessary.So, if you want to look for a very niche job offered by very few companies, that are rich enough to proceed with such an experiment, and if you have very high skills in business and technical issues, you are probably a good candidate for a very lucrative contract.

It doesn't go overly in-depth into any one topic, but still explains a lot of things in a way that's easy enough to grok even without a CS background. And it's not just historical figures like a textbook, he does explain things like how vacuum tubes worked and *why* certain things developed the way they do, like how CS concepts we consider foundational today were being theorized/implemented to invent devices to accurately. Lots a little fun facts you can repeat to sound smart at parties too which I appreciate from any book.... like how a committee inventing machines to calculate the necessary settings to aim anti-aircraft kinda just offhandedly invented the term ""digital"", humble beginnings for a word that defines the modern day. Definitely recommend, especially if you like history or are a little shaky on certain CS topics. Really having a good explanation of how a vacuum tube actually works before moving onto microprocessors really helped the IRL ""tech tree"" make so much more sense to me, and now if you ask me what a microprocessor is, I won't any longer respond by saying ""idk, shit that low level is just magic to me""",BrannyBee,2025-05-04 12:20:59,34,learnprogramming,t3_1kehctm,False,

mqwsr1p,"Programming languages and techniques are an abstraction. As my first boss used to say, ""It's all just zeros and ones at the end of the day"". Generally speaking, developing programming languages and techniques is a matter of allowing humans to express, in the ways that they think, a bunch of instructions than can be converted to the way the machine 'thinks'. Humans think in objects. There is a thing called a car. I have one. Mine is a particular colour and it can drive to places at various speeds... yada yada yada. OOP let's us express these ideas in these ways. When it comes to large, complex systems, this kind of separation and encapsulation can help tame the chaos. Over the years, I have come to accept that forcing \*everything\* into the object model is a mistake (as a Java guy for a couple of decades, this was a hard lesson to learn), but there are times when it is the right way to express an idea, even a very complex one. Over time and assuming the tools support it (and hopefully in 2025 they do), you just learn to combine all this stuff.",hitanthrope,2025-05-06 16:38:03,222,learnprogramming,t3_1kg8ndf,False,
mqx2h6h,"Let's be honest with you: your programs so far were way too small to really benefit from OOP. OOP works great with huge, complex programs.Yet, there are even smaller programs that can greatly benefit from OOP - provided, you have the right use case.For me, a prime example are card games. Here OOP can really play its strengths in simple, fairly small projects.Think about what you need for card games: you need cards (obviously), you need a deck, you need players (also obviously), players have hands (the card hands, not their physical ones), and there could be much more.Exactly the nouns above: Card, Deck, Player, Hand translate very well to Classes in OOP.+ A *Card* is a class modeling a single playing card. It has a suit, a rank, potentially a numeric value, potentially, a front and a back, and it is either face up or face down. It can be flipped (toggle face up/face down), can report its suit and rank, and value *provided* it is face up, otherwise it should not reveal its values.+ A *Deck* is a collection of cards. It can be initialized, can report its size, can be shuffled, can deal 1 or more cards.+ A *Player* models a human player with a name, potentially some money, a hand (the cards they are holding), a bet, etc. Of course, it can report all that.+ A *Hand* is basically similar to a deck of cards, but always directly related to a player.When you have this fundamental classes above and add a Game class where you define the rules of the game and how the game rounds run, you can quickly whip up any card game.Even better, by just changing the game class you can make Blackjack, Poker, and many more games by reusing the other classes you have previously made.Sure, you could just as well do all that without OOP (and it has been done plenty times already), but overall the OOP code will be much cleaner, much more modular, much easier to maintain and reuse, much shorter in total than its non-OOP counterpart.Reuse is one of the advantages of OOP. Another is *encapsulation*. The outside, the program that uses your classes does not need to know anything how the inside works, how it stores its data (state). The outside always ""communicates""/""interacts"" with the class/object through well defined and limited channels, pretty much in the form of a dialogue. The program asks the class/object for something and the class responds.",desrtfx,2025-05-06 17:23:22,95,learnprogramming,t3_1kg8ndf,False,
mqx7tsd,"The primary benefit of Object Oriented Programming is that objects can model the system you are programming directly. An object contains data about itself, and methods to manipulate that data, so other objects can ""communicate"" directly with it, without having to know anything about how it is built.The example you supplied is just a single method that does some procedural work on some separate data, so you don't get any benefit from doing it more object oriented.But imagine a game, where different players have different health and shield-status, different inventory, equipped weapons and so on. Every item in the game is an object, so that when one player hits another with their weapon, you don't have some central code that does all the calculation, but the Player1 object sends a message to the Player2 object, that they hit it with WeaponA - Player2 then calculates the damage delivered by WeaponA, subtracts its own shield, and adjusts their own health-level. Maybe even deciding to hit Player1 back.That is all done by code inside the Player-object, making it seem more like the objects are ""communicating"" than running a procedure.Since many processes - in games and business - can be modelled as entities communicating, OOP lends itself very well to that way of thinking, and it is ""easy"" to transfer an abstract model of a system to independent objects, than to a huge procedural program. Smaller procedures, like parsing a text, calculating shortest distances or sorting data, usually don't benefit from using OOP.",peterlinddk,2025-05-06 17:48:31,20,learnprogramming,t3_1kg8ndf,False,
mqwu7xo,"The benefits wont show up much on small single person projects over a short timespan.The essence of OOP is encapsulation. Encapsulation is what makes object polymorphism possible, and it’s the core thing that distinguishes OOP from procedural and most functional programming.The point of encapsulation is that it limits how much of the system you have to keep in your head at one time. At its best, you can focus on the responsibilities of a single object and trust that other objects are doing what they’re supposed to do. This is in especially important when you’re on a team where someone else is writing those other objects.One place where the rubber really hits the road with object-oriented encapsulation is in the enforcement of invariants. An encapsulated object can make more guarantees about its behavior than a publicly mutable struct. To understand whether a struct is in a valid state you might have to look at every place that has mutated it, whereas to understand if a mutable object is in a valid state you should (ideally) only have to verify that its constructor and setters properly maintain its validity. You can think locally rather than globally.The other place where OOP has a leg up is extensibility. When you encapsulate your objects by writing to an interface rather than a concrete implementation you gain the ability to add new implementations of your interfaces which will interoperate with existing code, without having to modify the existing code. This is also very important as the project increases in scale.I’ve written a basic [blog post](https://jnkr.tech/blog/abstract-data-types-and-objects) on the tradeoffs involved in choosing between proper objects and imperative abstract data types which you might find interesting.",josephjnk,2025-05-06 16:44:57,23,learnprogramming,t3_1kg8ndf,False,
mqzorfa,"To your credit most intro programming courses do a horrible job of explaining the purpose of object oriented programming. They usually try to introduce it with some flimsy metaphors of cats and dogs and bicycles and wheels and then have you memorize the four tenets: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, without really giving a good reason for why OOP embodies these tenets better than any other paradigm. To their credit, it’s difficult to see the benefits until you are seasoned enough to start working on larger scale coding projects.First, let’s get this out of the way: OOP is not strictly superior to procedural programming. Different paradigms are good for different things. We also don’t choose one paradigm over another because of performance reasons, or really anything involving the computer. Paradigms are solely concerned with how we, the humans, conceptualize the code we’re writing. At the end of the day, every program is in an imperative paradigm once it gets compiled down to machine code.Procedural programming is great if what you’re coding is best conceptualized as a procedure; AKA a series of instructions. If you’re writing a python script to run some preprocessing tasks on your ML model then it makes total sense to take a procedural approach.However, let’s take the most stereotypical application of coding, software development. Say you’re developing an app like Microsoft Word. Is Microsoft Word better described as series of instructions, or as an object? In this case, OOP makes much more sense because you are developing a *thing*, and that thing is composed of many smaller things like buttons and menus and widgets. It makes it much easier for our brains to decompose the task of coding Microsoft Word into manageable subtasks in a way that effectively reduces complexity.In reality, most languages these days include elements of many different programming paradigms, there are very few languages that are purely one paradigm. This is nice because you don’t have to commit completely to one paradigm if there are little parts of your project that would be better done in another. JavaScript mixes OOP concepts with functional programming which works well for web developers since functional programming is great for dealing with network protocols.",Quantum-Bot,2025-05-07 01:26:50,6,learnprogramming,t3_1kg8ndf,False,

Done cleanly it can certainly work, but it's rarely done properly and often results in much more complication than is really required.As a learning pattern it is something that really seems to ""click"" with people in theory, but implementing in practice it brings in more natural bias about how things ""really exist"" even if that doens't make sense for the actually requirements for the code.You can frequently see this with beginners who want to do something like write a game, the first thing they will is start listing out object types and quickly realize that half the time ""Enemy"" should be a ""Unit"", but other times it should be a ""Targetable"" or something and often end up with inheritance trees that look like spider webs.With practice you can learn to manage this better, but it never fundamentally changes the fact that model isn't actually that great in the first place.I think a lot of people have spent so much time hearing the supposed benefits of OOP that they have never seriously questioned that fact.",Infinitesubset,2025-05-06 20:31:47,11,learnprogramming,t3_1kg8ndf,False,

Example: a Car object knows its speed and has a method to drive(). It’s great for modeling real-world things and managing complexity.•Functional programming is like a pure vending machine—you give it input, it gives you output.

Management tells you to add a feature so buyers can be enticed to buy a new version, and the more you look at what has to change to make the feature work, the more impossible it seems.Object-oriented code is a way to manage complexity, and make it possible to add to the code without having to understand all of it.

It is only my opinion but here we go.Employers won’t except you to know everything, but they’ll expect you to know the basics very well. The tech industry is built on tons of abstraction. In our ‘modern times’, new, complex, shiny technologies are abstracted away to a point where using them is very easy. This makes it more and more common for underlying concepts to go overlooked.An example is the frontend web development world today. We constantly see new shiny web frameworks that make the development precess so much easier, and alongside them, the big frameworks trying to catch up. And as a result we see teenagers ‘vibe coding’ SaaS apps with minimal understanding.This is a slippery slide that makes you feel productive and confident in your programming abilities. Makes you think you can definitely land a job already.In reality, most employers don’t need people who can use new tools. They need engineers who can solve difficult problems. To become an engineer you need to have a very deep understanding of the fundamentals before going into the advanced stuff. Frankly, the fundamentals are not even about one’s ability to code or use different technologies, but rather theory that you learn by reading and practicing with pen and paper.In my opinion, the best way to land a job is by mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (that means reading books and studying them, not solving random LeetCode problems), Networking, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems and Unix, Databases and RDBMSs, OOP, and the cherries on top - a low level language (C or C++ - understanding explicit memory management and having the need to implement everything on your own is very good for practice), and a high level language (Java, C#, Go, Python, JavaScript, etc - pick your poison).Of course ’mastering’ these concepts is subjective.

mqham9t,"as stated, learncpp is great. But maybe some order to the chaos...why not start with some things that are radically different from C? Lets take on C++ strings and string processing first, then. Try doing the basic stuff... make a string from a constant, append to it, find a substring, convert it to uppercase, and so on. All those common things you do regularly. Use only C++, no cheating and using c-string tools or the string to cstring conversion.From there, I would master the vector class. You don't have to understand the template syntax fully yet, just know that its vector variablename format and work it from there. Work the learncpp chapter on vectors hard.NOW, with your feet a little wetter, give classes and object oriented programming chapters a look, and start working that stuff.A couple of things to forget from C for a while: pointers. Just forget them for now. You can circle back later, but code without using any at all for a while. Iterators are OK to use. macros. Don't use them unless strictly necessary, like a debug tool to spew a line number. As with pointers, just don't go there for a while, get used to coding without them, and circle back later once the C is a bit of a distant memory and less of a habit.As you move forward, I would alternate a day to study c++ differences with a chapter or two on the deep topics. For example (literally!), the c++ for loop has a new twist, you can iterate over a container with loops that look like for(type &t : container) and t will advance through the elements of container, becoming each one in turn. If referenced, its the real value, if not, its a copy, and that is a big deal for performance and behaviors both, to get that & or not absolutely correct.

Continue on the current road**Learn other languages / frameworks for backend development: Java Spring Boot, JavaScript Express, C# w Razor/Blazor, Python w Django / Flask, or whichever combination you find. Something new but well known.**2. Go deeper in the professional development career**Learn more about the infrastructure around coding: all the DevOps branches, testing, automated testing, dev containers, docker, github actions, deployment, CI/CD and so on - become a ""software developer"" more than a programmer, and understand the environment around the software.**3. Go deeper in programming**You have some low level C++ knowledge, but do you understand data structures and algorithms, do you know how a linked list is built, or why a hashmap is as fast as it is? While these aren't necessarily required skills in this day and age, it helps to understand more about the machine, more about why programming works the way it does, and it can be very code-nerdy fun.**4. Take the alternate route**Try something completely new: * perhaps **frontend programming** (which would be a nice match for your backend knowledge), learn some React, try to build frontends for your existing backends* or **games programming** \- pick a language and framework you like, and play around with making small games - if you like designing complex programs, that can be a great challenge, and could be an excellent hobby, if not exactly job-oppertunities* or **hardware programming** \- buy an Arduino or similar small scale microcontroller, and play around with controlling lights and motors. If you feel up to it, try to do without the libraries, and learn how to actually control the hardware. Can be very challenging, but also great fun, and the physical aspect makes it feel a bit different than programming, while still giving you lots of practice.* or **app development** \- try to make small apps for your phone, small things that you can use yourself, and decide if you want to expand in to better UI or more AI once you get going.Right now there's no guaranteed direction that will make you a lot of money, so pick the one you deem most fun, and try it out.

For example, regardless of whether you are doing full-stack web development in JavaScript, Machine Learning development in Python, DevOps scrips in bash, PowerShell, or Python, or red team cybersecurity penetration testing scripts in Python, you have to know how to code. First, you need to learn programming fundamentals like variables, integers, Strings, booleans, conditions, operators, loops, functions, etc. Then after that, you need to learn Object Oriented Programming (OOP) like classes, class inheritance (subclasses), interfaces, methods vs. functions, etc. At some point you should probably also take a class called ""discrete math"" that covers the math of logic (and, or, not, true, false, etc.). This class (in the University of Michigan course list): https://eecs203.github.io/eecs203.org/ Also, for most of those specialties, a Computer Networking class is also useful (note that this is a 400 level class, so students usually take it in their 4th year of undergraduate university studies): https://github.com/mosharaf/eecs489> ""Everyone says, 'Pick what interests you,' but that’s the thing—I like all of it, and it’s kinda confusing.""You don't have to pick a specialty in Computer Science right away. Look at the list at https://roadmap.sh/ and know you can be in university for years before deciding on a specialty. Sometimes you don't even make a conscious decision, life circumstances and availability end up deciding for you. Like I know one guy who graduated with a Computer Science degree but couldn't get a coding job but did land an on-premise server I.T. job, and then he ended up going that route and eventually managing/supervising a huge number of on-premise servers.

If you can't handle that delay after having typed in a command, of course you should go with the faster version ...Anyways, never believe anyone talking about how some constructs in the programming language are faster or slower than others - usually they are wrong, and perpetuate myths started by 1970s assembly-programmers.

mqvbw4y,"There are many goals to writing a program. Many beginning programmers want to emphasize speed, but it can be misleading. In particular, programs already run very fast. The idea of fixing a slow program because you believe long if statements make it slow is often termed as premature optimization (not the specific reason, but any reason you think a program is slow).It's often more important that a program be readable if it's fast enough, and likely, it's going to be fast enough. If you have evidence it's running slow, then you can look at *profiling* a program. This means using a program called a *profiler*. Many beginners still choose to optimize without a profiler because it's just one more tool they need to learn, and they'd rather guess what's slow.If you insist, you can create a HashMap (or whatever C# has) that maps the command string to a something that implements a Command interface. You can pass the command line and the args. interface Command { void runCommand(String command, SomeType lineArgs); }Replace `SomeType` with the actual type.You would create this map in an initialization phase (static constructor, say). You'd do something like // commandMap is a hash map Command obj = commandMap.get(commandName); obj.runCommand(commandName, lineArgs);It is a bit more complicated to get this set up, but not a whole lot more.",CodeTinkerer,2025-05-06 11:56:49,2,learnprogramming,t3_1kfwzc6,False,

That doesn't mean you should write fast and shitty code, just that you need to learn the optimal amount of ""should I consider this now"" vs ""note this as a place to consider if execution time becomes and issue"".I am a firm believer in not putting off refactor if you see problems, but beyond keeping good, clean, defensive coding practices, overthinking problems that haven't even presented themselves yet will just drive you fucking crazy.B: You have decided to listen to random people give you ""this is how it is"" advice instead of exploring and learning about how if/else and switch might differ in the resulting assembly. Stop letting other people answer your questions with other things you don't understand. The internet is full of fucking nonsense, and I read TONS of it being given as confident ""this is how it is"" programming advice when the reality is ALWAYS more complicated and nuanced. Get curious. The answer to your question is out there and well explained by someone who actually knows what they are talking about.Anyway, what you are doing is fine. Using a switch might make it look a little cleaner if it gets longer. I would also look up using function pointers and a dispatch table, more as a thought experiment. Function pointers seem outlandish at first but are an amazing tool to be comfortable with. If you want to DM me at any point, I do light tutoring for free and I think this is a cool problem to talk about a few interesting design patterns.edit: I dropped the term ""function pointer"" in this without thinking language.

mr8bsie,"I don't know that I enjoy either. Reading code is more of a job, but it helps to be able to read code.30 years ago, people were terrible at reading code. This is often why you saw a new programmer on a project rewrite the code. They couldn't understand the existing code. What these programmers didn't realize is they were writing code others couldn't follow, for the same reason. We know what we meant to do in our own code. There's a lot of code out there with little documentation, so it can be a pain to figure out what the code does unless it's very clean code.Unless you write horrible code, you're always going to prefer your code over others. Maybe if you wrote spaghetti code and someone is writing super clean code, you'd prefer reading, but I'd say that's uncommon.It's a necessary task.Oh yes, sometimes working with other people's code leads a person into rewriting vast parts because they didn't like how that person coded it up. Depending on the situation, that could be considered a waste of time.I had to work on legacy code where there were Java methods 2000 lines long, where the Java class was 20,000 lines long. *One class!*. It was a bunch of copy/paste and spaghetti code. But it would have been insane to rewrite it. First of all, it was hard to tell what the program was *supposed* to do. Second, it was so large that it would have taken a long time and been challenging to test.Indeed, we often asked our customers (non-programmers) to test manually (use the web applications). They wouldn't have time to do a good test (often hastily done and incomplete) because, guess what, they had other work to do.So, we had to live with not changing the code, or changing it in minimal ways.

But, if your colleague gives meaningful names to his methods than reading the method body is irrelevant, the name reveals the purpose. Layers in the code are actually abstraction layers, go to the minimal necessary depth only. For example the code has to decode some binary and get an ID from it. It requires reading, decoding, transforming and extracting. About a dozen lines, but if the name is good and says extractSomeIDFromTheBitSausage(), then the only information you need that this method gives you the required ID.

mr3d3ru,"Whenever someone says ""possible"", they usually mean ""likely"". For example, someone could ask ""Is it possible to play in the NBA?"". The answer is ""Yes, it's possible, because people play in the NBA"", but it is nearly impossible for almost everyone.The odds that you can become a front-end developer are far greater than being in the NBA, which means it's hard to guess whether you can or can't. That's the risk you take. You have to be willing to spend time to get good regardless of whether you make it or not. There are hundreds of thousands of people that want to play in the NBA, and they try really hard. Fortunately, many can play at a much lower level (for fun, at a high school, in college, etc) and so they can gain some satisfaction in doing that even if they can't earn millions of dollars. They want to believe they can make it, which is why they try. You have to delude yourself that you can, until enough evidence presents itself that you can't (or you lose interest).A potential problem with your dream is why you haven't started it. If you are second-guessing yourself (""Should I do it or shouldn't I do it? What are the odds I will succeed?""), then you can run into trouble. Either you have to convince yourself that you are good enough to do it, or you have to say you're going to give it all you've got and not worry whether you're good enough or not because those kinds of worries just stop you from making progress.And really, that's the danger.

Do not listen to people saying straight out ""no"", or ""not possible"", or ""not in current market"", they are **fucking idiots**. They are sheep, and you shouldn't concern yourself with their opinion. I mean for real, ask yourself this: ""If i spent 16 hours daily learning, and live & breath programming every day, including weekends and holidays, then would I be able to catch-up and get a job?"". If you frame it like this, then obviously the answer is yes. It's the same concept when people ask you: ""What are the chances that you make 1m$ this year?"" And majority people respond ""1%, 2%"". Then shift the perspective - ""What are the chances you make 1m$ this year, or else your entire family dies?"" Suddenly everyone answers 100%. It's not the goal or timeframe, it's the perspective. My point is, anyone that is so closed minded to give you a definitive answer to a question that is so open-ended, is a dumbass.I am completely self-taught in everything I have done in my life. I dropped out at age of 16 from high school to pursue business, and when my peers were getting their bachelors, I was buying a new apartment. While that sounds great, it took 16 hours daily for years, my health declined hard, and it frankly, wasn't worth it. I wanted more stability in life, where I still make great money, but not at cost of all my time and health. So I started learning programming to transition, and mind you I started in 2024. In a shitty market, filled with the same comments you see on this thread saying you can't do it, CS is dead, there's no jobs etc.Fast forward to today, and with zero YoE on the job, I am interviewing for Mid positions at various companies and tomorrow I have another job interview with F100 company. Was it easy to get to here? No. In the last 365 days, I probably spent 330 or so coding and learning every day for 8-10 hours. Is it doable though? Absolutely. Fucking. Yes.I was like you though, posting threads on reddit asking if there's future. Until I realized that there is future, but only for people who put in the work, and don't spend their time worrying on reddit.

And as real professionals, though, we must find ""stomach"" to cope with the unenjoyable bits as well, at least in a professional manner.There are certain types of programming that are enjoyable for some folk and not to others.

You have to learn what kind of programming or systems ""get you up in the morning"" as it were.But if you don't enjoy programming ITSELF, then I'm not sure what can be done. There are always annoying parts to the craft, as well, but once you have done it for a while you know you can get ""to the goal"" and that is always a good feeling for me. For example, if you don't understand how something works yet you need to understand, then that is annoying at first, but you know that you can eventually ""get it good enough"" to accomplish the task. Or, if you are in a greuiling debugging session then again it's frustrating, but with experience you know that you can either find the bug eventually (even if it's just one dumb typo) OR can find it or learn to find solutions to work around it if it is too elusive. In any case, once you achieve these goals, it's ultimately going to trigger dopamine in the brain and will become addictive in a good way (basically a self-fulfilling positive cycle in psychology).

Technically I started with BASIC but I would say that Java was the first language I learned to code in at a professional level.If you have a particularly good reason, like somebody being able to support you, like you have described, then there is no real reason not to start there.That said, in isolation, I would say no. The language designers at Oracle have done a reasonable job of bringing the language up to modern expectations but there is a lot of history there and backwards compatibility to maintain and I think that has resulted in some less than optimal things.The Java platform (distinct from the language) is great, there is a huge ecosystem, lots of libraries and the JVM has some of the most clever engineering that you'll find anywhere. It's a nice platform, but if a person I knew was starting today, and wanted to learn Java platform development I would probably suggest Kotlin over Java. You can still use all of those tools and libraries and run on the JVM but I think it is a nicer way to express yourself and has some really useful features.Independent of even the JVM, i'd probably say that Python is perhaps the best absolute beginner choice. At the risk of upsetting some Python people, I think Python is the closest modern, widely used language to the BASIC that I started with. Obviously people use it for insanely complex stuff (ML in particular) but the syntax is pretty simple and the much maligned, 'meaningful whitespace' feature is actually not bad when it comes to instructing people on writing readable code. The people who complain about Python's indentation semantics are typically indenting their non-Python code in the same way, or their IDE is doing it for them.

JQuery is really for modifying the DOM (styling and what you see on a webpage) so you can tangibly see your changes happen 'live'.When you boil it right down, JavaScript is really just: * Variables (var, let, const) - places to store bit of data * Arrays and Objects (arrayName[data], objectName{dataKey: data}) - places to store many bits of data that are related to each other * Conditionals (if, else if, else) - ways to run different pieces of code depending on something, usually the value of a variable * Loops (for, while, do while) - ways to run the same piece of code over and over again * Functions (someFunction(someArgument)) - ways to reuse a piece of code in many places without having to re-write it.There are a lot of complicated terms to describe many variations of the same ideas. There can be confusing, but they still really just boil down to these core ideas. Eg ""ternaries"" are just short-hand conditionals. ""Iterations"" are just another work for loops.The problem with Boot Camps is they go so fast.

My concern would be that you're struggling to get through the content, even when taking ADHD meds. If you don't have a genuine interest in programming (as in, actually programming, not ""what you think programming is""), then it isn't unlikely that it's just... ""not your thing"". You don't need to be a math genius, or be able to perfectly follow code in your mind, but you do need to be interested. A lot of the developers I know could take ADHD meds and program for 18 hours straight. It make them insatiable.At some point, you'll need to learn more about data structures, algorithms, and memory (which is usually what the Bootcamps skip). I tried my hardest not to learn that stuff for as long as possible, but eventually... you just need to. It helps you recognize problems and how to solve them.JavaScript is particularly tricky (even though it's also beginner-friendly) because it's the only language that has built-in templating, windowing, rendering, and styling (HTML, the browser, and CSS). Vanilla JS teaches you about manually manipulating The DOM, but the second you move into more professionally-oriented work, you'll likely be using frameworks like React that abstract The DOM away. So they teach you all this ""document.querySelector"" stuff in JS, it's unlike anything in any other language, and when you've finally figured it out, they say ""just kidding, we usually use libraries to do that for us"".JS and all of it's libraries, packages, and frameworks update regularly. Syntax changes, frameworks fade in and out of popularity, and you'll need to keep up. I'm autistic with ADHD, and for me that's a benefit. It keeps changing, but it keeps getting better, the tools are fun and relatively easy to use, and I enjoy trying and learning all of the new stuff. Keeps me from getting bored and keeps me sharp.Bootcamps are intended to jump-start you. So they'll walk you through database, server, and user interface - relatively quickly - so you have a reasonable understanding of how to build a complete application, even if you don't perfectly understand the languages, syntax, and tools being used. It's just a starting point.For Vanilla JS, as is always recommended in this subreddit, [https://javascript.info/](https://javascript.info/) is the best, most modern, comprehensive, interactive tutorial. If you can get through part 1 (save part 2 and part 3 for later), you'll have a really good understanding of Vanilla JS, it's tools and it's syntax (depending on how well you learn, and how well you integrate what you learn).",AmSoMad,2025-05-06 15:47:17,2,learnprogramming,t3_1kg6wi7,False,

It can probably be done with just some really snarky batch file, depending on what exactly you have and what exactly you need to do beyond the stated stuff. I highly recommend looking into this idea. The learning curve is very low, just poweruser stuff instead of full on software engineering level. that said, a windows .exe file is generated by turning a programming language (the stuff YOU write) into machine code (the .exe file), which is done by the tools (compiler and linker for example in C++) for that programming language. Some languages are 'interpreted' and do not make an executable program, but instead run directly from the source code. That may also be ok for your needs, but any computer using the program would require the tools to run it, which are not default installed on windows. A windows program that makes actual windows (the GUI) take more know-how, as you have to learn the tools to make the windows and widgets on them. This can be little more than glorified drag and drop to build, but even so, there is some learning curve to it. If you don't do those things, the program will be a 'command line program' and work under the cmd shell (dos shell) that you may or may not use (its part of windows). Such programs just accept typed text and print out response text to the shell, 1980s style. Even when you make a windows exe, the target computer may need something you used -- its often a shocker to beginners that other computers lack the debug libraries so debug mode executables won't usually run on other machines.

For smart home features I'm curious what you'd charge, 200$ profit for motion and voice lights, 17-20 for materials, 60 for the extra functionality, you're already paying the 300 in this option so total price comes out to 570 now. They buy their own lights so customer cost goes into the 650s-700s. So it does get a bit crazy on the customers end.. since I've never seen this service offered and definitely not peer to peer I don't have any baseline though. Garage door opener is another big seller if they bought the lights I'll bundle in the door for 50 profit on my side, they see around 70$ additional charge. If they didn't starting is still 200. Temperature controls if above it bought I'll bundle it for 100 additional profit, this I know I should increase since people always have weird requests when it comes to temperature. Always gotta modify this one. The watering feature is definitely under priced but people treat it as a novelty and walk away from the additional 160 even though that's only 100$ profit on my end.

mqwxcvd,"If you’re on Windows, just start with Cygwin; it’s very similar to a Linux, but it runs natively on WinAPI without blocking it from you. (Properly, it’s a POSIX operating environment.)MinGW comes with some of the same gunk, even forked from Cygwin, but gives you a much thinner shim around WinAPI, which ranges from irritating to miserable for beginners. (E.g., the Windows environment of the NT kernel—now the sole one AFAIK—has two separate subsystems, console and graphical, and they expose slightly different APIs and behaviors. Cygwin matches other Unixes in model and behavior, which means you can follow Unix tutorials, and if you’re careful with `LONG` vs. `long` you can probably follow some Windows ones too.)WSL2 is another option, but it’s stood off from Windows itself by a hypervisor, which means you don’t get good access to things inside the Linux domain from outside or vice versa.Otherwise, chances are you’re already on Unix. Apple’s Darwin (incl. OS/X→macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, etc. ad ridiculam) is in the FreeBSD family, which derives from Jolix which is a clean-room BSD/Net2 Unix. Linux wasn’t forked from anything, but its kernel tends more towards the AT\&T family of Unixes culminating in System V, rev 4 (SVr4). Android is a variant of Linux using Bionic as libc and very little in the way of shell environment; desktop Linuxes tend to use the GNU libc and environment, of which Bash and GCC are also constituents.On Android, you can install F-Droid and thereby Termux and Programmer’s Keyboard; immediately run `pkg update && pkg upgrade`, then you can install your preferred packages. Termux layers GNU onto Android, giving you a rough, subordinated desktop Linux environment.For desktop Linux, I use Neon, which is an Ubuntu variant for KDE, which is my preferred windowing environment; Ubuntu is a vast family of Debian-based distributions, so pretty much anything major will do—Mint is supposed to be reasonably good, but you do you. Konsole (part of KDE, but runs anyway) is imo the best terminal available on Linux (also works for Cygwin and Win-per-se); open it up, start a [shell tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview), and you’re good. If shit ever breaks, Ctrl+Alt+Fkey will usually drop you to a lower-level terminal, so monkeying is never far away.Most Unixes uses Bash for their interactive shell nowadays, though POSIX mandates certain characteristics for the baseline shell environment, and older systems tend to have their own, quirky Bourne shells. IIRC modern Linux tends to use Ash or Dash for POSIX and startup scripts via /bin/sh—Bash used to be used everywhere.For editing, Kate (also KDE) is a very good GUI (MDI) editor for getting started with, but I strongly recommend you at least install Vim and start learning the basics, whether or not you use it for day-to-day work. It comes with a built-in tutorial, and it’s pretty straightforward to pick up. Very useful when you’re three ssh forwards deep, trying to resurrect a very custom, in-flight supercompute batch job, for example.So that’s 1½ languages to start with, Bash and Vim.I’d probably start in on a C tutorial, also—prefer GCC or Clang; under no circumstances should you use MSVC for C or C++ unless you’re being paid to or have no choice in the matter. Also, I’d recommend staying away from full IDEs in general for just now, since you don’t need all the extra trappings. Build directly from command line, and try to engage directly with the terminal where it’s not counterpurpose. Get a feel for imperativeness.IIRC for Apple, you get a Clang-in-GNU’s clothing with XCode, but I don’t do their nonsense so that may have changed. XCode itself is a …fine editor, but probably overkill for your purposes—syntax highlighting will often not line up with what the compiler actually sees or does.On Linux and Cygwin, you go through the usual package management tools for compilers, or build them yourself if feeling adventurous. `pkg install gcc` for Termux, `pkcon install gcc` for Neon, `apt-get install gcc` for Ubuntu, `yum install gcc` for RedHat, and Arch has its own, fancy mess.If you install all the goodies—sometimes from separate foo-doc packages accompanying foo—you should have Bash `help` built-in command, a `man` command to acess manual pages (e.g., `man man` for man’s manpage), `whatis` and `apropos` to search for manpages, and `info` to browse the info manuals. (E.g., `man gcc` tells you how to run the `gcc` command, and `info gcc` tells you how to use it. /usr/share/doc may also have some goodies.)I recommend installing the POSIX manpages alongside native, where available, and bookmarking or downloading the 2001–2004, 2008–2018, and 2024 editions of the [POSIX standards](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/), which is what you aim for if you want your code to be portable to other OSes in the Unix family. (Links to prior versions at bottom of that index page—only 2001/12, 2008/09, and 2024/05 editions are recognizable from within the C-language build environment. You can also find 1988 and 1990 versions as FIPS-151-1 and FIPS-151-2, FWTW and FTTB.)If you learn C, K\&R’s *The C Programming Language,* 2ed (1988—not 1ed from 1978) is the usual approach vector, and you can easily find free copies to work from. It’s a bit out of date, but so is most C software, and you can push forwards from C89 pretty easily using the draft standards, or backwards using XPG, TCPL/1ed, and compiler manuals.[ISO WG14](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects.html) is presently in charge of the language (qua ISO/IEC 9899), so they produce standards docs that form the backbone of the language. The final drafts are effectively equivalent text for free, so they form the most portable layer undergirding the language, and then dialect extensions (e.g., GNU, MS), POSIX and X/Open, and other environmental stuff layers atop that. If you want to know whether something ought to be “legal” or not, start at the standard for your language version and then look at your compiler and ABI manuals for how the blanks are filled in.Good luck! I’d probably run through to pointers, then take a dip into assembly and come back, but delve however you like. Most of the system software is in C or C++, and if you’re on Linux, the source code is readily available to explore and play with, so you can reconstruct pretty much everything to your choosing.",nerd4code,2025-05-06 16:59:30,1,learnprogramming,t3_1kfuc30,False,

To javascript, name could be an integer, a String, a boolean, it doesn't know until runtime when it is evaluated.Typescript interface User { name: string; age: number; } function greet(user: User): string { return ""Hello, "" + user.name; } const user: User = { name: ""Alice"", age: 30 }; console.log(greet(user));Here, we once again have a user with name and age fields. However, this time, we provide an interface that defines the object. Not only does a user have a name and age, the name is a string and the age is a number.

Recursion takes a case and breaks it down into sub-cases until it gets down to a base case. Induction does the opposite - builds from two base cases every possible sub-case.You can prove your code is correct by doing an induction proof on it - proving the base cases are correct, assuming the recursive calls will provide the right answer, and proving your call will produce the correct result. You can also do this with runtime complexity or amortized analysis. A simpler example is something like merge sort. If you can show ordering 1 element works and is ordered, then show that you can correctly merge two ordered sub-lists into an ordered one, you can prove that your code orders the entire array.

mqgxrd3,"Hey exact same boat here, untreated ADHD, graduated in December from WGU and work full-time as a mobile diesel technician with an ever changing schedule. I hit it extremely hard with the job search and have only had two interviews first one for full-time junior dev, I bombed. Second one, was an internship at the same company, position got pulled because the current state of our economy. That really killed my motivation.After that I pretty much didn’t touch my laptop until about the middle of March, where there was the first local in person hackathon in my city. I signed up and started to get excited about programming again…and then extremely nervous, because up to that point I realized I got through the degree because the “thought process” & “project requirements” were given to me pretty much on a silver platter. With a mediocre grasp on the fundamentals and no real problem solving experience I didn’t want to look incompetent in front of people that were likely much younger and realistically more experienced than me. So, I went to roadmap.sh and started from the beginning with JavaScript. I got reacquainted with the basics and nuances and went to the event, I was in a group of 4, one took building out the frontend, ironically another guy was currently enrolled with WGU as well and he took the backend, the other was our pitch person and that left me as a floater to just help wherever I could. This was the absolute best position for me! the frontend was next.js/tailwind, backend was spring boot with a Postgres db. I remembered enough about the backend and how everything “worked” that I was able to help there anytime our backend guy got stuck or needed a break and was able to pickup right where he left off, having used typescript at WGU and refreshing my js knowledge I was able to figure out enough of next and tailwind to be helpful there too. This helped in a few ways. Building a fullstack app with stuff I hadn’t used and people I don’t even know in 48hrs showed me 1.) I knew more than I gave myself credit for and 2.) I’m capable and genuinely have a love for programming.

mqqaqys,"From the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/ranges-indexes):>A range specifies the start and end of a range. The start of the range is inclusive, but the end of the range is exclusive, meaning the start is included in the range but the end isn't included in the range. The range \[0..\^0\] represents the entire range, just as \[0..sequence.Length\] represents the entire range.[A comment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54092520) on stack overflow contains some sorta lost info on how this came to be:>We decided to follow Python when it comes to the from-beginning and from-end arithmetic. 0 designates the first element (as always), and \^0 the “length’th” element, i.e. the one right off the end. That way you get a simple relationship, where an element's position from beginning plus its position from end equals the length. the x in \^x is what you would have subtracted from the length if you’d done the math yourself.>Why not use the minus (-) instead of the new hat (\^) operator? This primarily has to do with ranges. **Again in keeping with Python and most of the industry, we want our ranges to be inclusive at the beginning, exclusive at the end.** What is the index you pass to say that a range should go all the way to the end? In C# the answer is simple: x..\^0 goes from x to the end. In Python, there is no explicit index you can give: -0 doesn’t work, because it is equal to 0, the first element! So in Python, you have to leave the end index off completely to express a range that goes to the end: x... If the end of the range is computed, then you need to remember to have special logic in case it comes out to 0. As in x..-y, where y was computed and came out to 0. This is a common nuisance and source of bugs.>Finally, note that indices and ranges are first class types in .NET/C#. Their behavior is not tied to what they are applied to, or even to be used in an indexer. You can totally define your own indexer that takes Index and another one that takes Range – and we’re going to add such indexers to e.g. Span.

mrbw5rs,"Nice website. I had a quick look and noticed a couple of things you can improve.I see you're loading the page via Javascript. There's a lag while the data is being fetched and then the page updates. During that lag, there's nothing to indicate that anything's happening.The low-grade way to fix this is to put a spinner or loading bar on page while you wait for the content to be fetched. The much better way of doing this is to render the page on the server. Modern frameworks allow you to do both without much difficulty, especially if you're using Node or Deno to serve your website, and you can also progressively load content over XHR now.I noticed that when I resized the window from a mobile width back to desktop width, the layout was odd. This implies that you're building the page with JS rather than relying on CSS media queries to lay the page out at different screen widths. Ah, `determineLayout` confirms it! You can do a lot more with CSS than you might realise.I see your firebase keys are in your JS config. I guess that means I can use your database at your expense? These should be on the server. At the very least, stick them inside a JWT.Your JS is nice and clean. The way you're populating the DOM is satisfactory for a site this small, but even here, you should be able to reuse components. For example, you have lots of functions that build back buttons (""back to categories"", back to foobar"", etc). Try and make a single function for that. See if there are other opportunities for code reuse.Also think about using the CSS `:hover`pseudo-selector to make it clear to the user what elements are interactive.

mr8phru,"I’m a software development manager, and I’ve had to give that kind of feedback before. The reality is, every task comes with drivers and constraints. If the business wants something done, it’s because it provides value—but that value only matters if the costs (like time and effort) don’t outweigh the benefits.If your manager brought this up, I hope they were direct about it. There should be no mystery here. Understanding the ""why"" behind the feedback is important: it's often about balancing quality with efficiency.Here’s how you can tackle it:1. **Improve your estimating skills.** Be realistic about how long tasks will take, and speak up if the deadline is too tight.2. **Include contingency in your estimates.** Plans rarely go perfectly—account for interruptions, unexpected challenges, and even just bad days.3. **Prioritize effectively.** Focus on the essentials first—what absolutely needs to get done. That way, if setbacks happen, you can adjust without missing the core requirements.4. **Apply the 80/20 rule.** Recognize that 20% of the work usually delivers 80% of the value. Tackle that first, and you’ll find the rest often falls into place more easily.Finally, self-assess and seek guidance. Understand your manager’s expectations, find a mentor for candid feedback, and always keep sharpening your skills—not just new ones, but fundamentals too.The goal isn’t just to avoid criticism; it’s to become more effective and confident in your work.**Addendum:** Before I get waves of criticism—yes, I did use AI to help generate this response. But let me be clear: every thought and idea here is my own.I’m mentioning this because, fittingly enough, I often struggle with being too slow and too detailed when writing responses. To address that, I use GPT by giving it an outline my points, tell it my preferred tone, and have it draft a response efficiently. I’ve given it instructions on how I like to communicate and trained it to match my general style.Some might be offended by that, but the reality is: this technology is here. I’m using Reddit as a learning ground—not just for discussions but for honing my ability to work with emerging tools. If we don’t learn how to use it effectively, someone else will. Personally, I’d rather be ahead of that curve.This is the same technology that is being integrated into software development tools and can be a great factor in increasing productivity--and increasing performance expectations.

There was one slot per core on the CPU the process was running on. So, when there was a free core, the scheduler would create a thread and cause it to run the scan for the specified file.This involved a but of Thread management and process coordination via semaphores and single entry functions to coordinate the allocation and release of slots for the individual processes.When it ran, the system would be fully CPU bound for the duration of the process which on a fast system took about 24 hours.

mq4cc77,"I thought I knew the answer, but apparently I was rather off.  Here is Claude's responseI'll explain how physical memory is partitioned into blocks for contiguous memory allocation in operating systems.In contiguous memory allocation, physical memory is divided into fixed-size blocks or variable-size partitions that can be allocated to processes. Here's how it works:Physical memory is organized into addressable units (typically bytes), and the operating system manages this space by dividing it into partitions or blocks. When processes request memory, the OS allocates these blocks based on specific strategies.There are several approaches to partitioning memory:1. Fixed partitioning: Memory is divided into fixed-size blocks (like your example of 10 MB chunks). Each partition can hold exactly one process, even if the process doesn't need all the allocated space, which can lead to internal fragmentation.2. Variable partitioning: Memory is allocated exactly as requested by processes, resulting in variable-sized partitions. This reduces internal fragmentation but can lead to external fragmentation as processes terminate and free memory becomes scattered.For allocation, the operating system maintains data structures (typically tables) that track:- Which blocks are allocated or free- The size of each block- The process using each allocated blockWhen a process requests memory, the OS uses allocation algorithms such as:- First-fit: Allocate the first available block that's large enough- Best-fit: Allocate the smallest available block that's large enough- Worst-fit: Allocate the largest available blockThe actual implementation involves memory management units (MMUs) that translate logical addresses (used by processes) to physical addresses. These hardware components, along with operating system tables, handle the mapping between a process's address space and physical memory blocks.Modern systems use more sophisticated approaches like paging and segmentation rather than contiguous allocation, as they address many of the fragmentation issues.",mikeyj777,2025-05-02 01:08:17,-10,learnprogramming,t3_1kcor54,False,

Are you using that version? Does it still count as ""old school""?Honestly, I think this is a mistake (especially as someone with no programming experience, who isn't ""naturally a math person"").>A lot of modern advice says to start with Python because it’s easier or faster, but I’m not looking for shortcuts.Programming isn't just one-sided. By increasing the time and complexity on the low-end, you're decreasing the time and complexity on the high-end. You'll be a master in low-level programming, in a language you'll never use, but you'll be unable to build anything meaningful, and it'll have taken you 20x longer to learn than a student who chose Python; who's already producing full sack applications.Using higher-level abstractions isn't some kind of cheat or shortcut, it's a productivity play. Historically, developers had the luxury of spending hours and hours improving simple functions, because computational power was limited, memory was limited, the scope of their concerns was limited (they might only be working on a single function), and small improvements in memory-usage could mean the difference between a program that runs or doesn't run on a system with 1MB of RAM.You live in 2025, and you don't have that luxury. If you ""don't want to take shortcuts"", then why not learn binary? Machine Code? Or Assembly?Here's a simple add function in LISP (Scheme): (define (add x y) (+ x y))Here's a simple add function in Python: def add(x, y): return x + yNot exactly a huge shortcut, eh? Not to mention, you'll be teaching yourself syntax that doesn't translate well to any other language (I can't think of a modern language that puts the operators before the operands like LISP). There's a reason they stopped updating the book in 2014, and why MIT's curriculum has shifted towards higher-abstractions like Python.Learning the fundamentals, data structures, algorithms, memory, and memory-management in a language like C or C++ is plenty low-enough level, plenty hard-enough, and plenty time-consuming. There's no reason for you to dip lower, unless you specifically intend to pursue a hobby/career that requires such a low-level.Reading an outdated book to learn the fundamentals is going to slow you down, and leave you behind your contemporaries (even if you aren't pursuing a career).

On the other hand if they’re the type to mix in Hindi or something and shift without realizing they’re doing it, you’re fucked and need to explicitly say you’re having trouble understanding them. Usually - especially if you’re the only non Indian - they don’t even realize there’s an issue. I’ve had to do this a couple times in the past and ask them to stick with English and annunciate a bit clearer and they did make a concerted effort which helped a ton. Just be polite and have a tone like a request for help rather than an accusation and you should be ok. Stuff that can be jarring for native English speakers vs Indian English - - pauses at weird points mid sentence and sometimes multiple times per sentence- rising tones like asking a question but during a statement or other part of a sentence- dropped words (your brain will autocomplete the sentence anyway once you get used to whoever you’re working with) - certain phrases (do the needful being one of the most infamous) and words (definitely, certainly, surely, etc pop up frequently) that you will soon realize are far more vague than they imply. For example the “definitely” does not mean definitely, it can often be said as a “yeah yeah whatever” vibe- sometimes questions are phrased more like demands, but just know that usually it’s still a request and no offense is intended.

The idea that you could cut comp by 50% and increase workload by 50% without a mass exodus is pretty disconnected from how labor markets actually work. Engineers aren't stuck in one company or even one industry. Talent moves. Fast.Tech compensation is high because demand is high, the skillset is hard to build and maintain, and the impact on business is massive. If one company decides to nerf pay and crank up workload, that’s a gift to their competitors. Good devs won’t just stick around out of loyalty or passion; they’ll walk. Even the ""not-so-passionate"" ones are often very competent, and they know their market value.Could there be some cooling in salaries over time? Sure, especially as markets mature or we hit saturation in certain roles. But some exec ""overheard"" saying they want to halve pay and work people harder isn’t a signal of an imminent industry collapse, it’s a signal they’re going to lose talent fast if they try.So yeah, I'd still code if unicorns were real.

Hardly anyone will tell you this, because it's likely you don't have anyone close enough in your life that you wouldn't immediately push away, if they pressed you to pursue getting help. That is a sign of the problem, in addition to spending several years and not actually getting software dev experience, which speaks to fundamental motivation. (It is worth asking the question: you've done some of it, do you enjoy doing it at all?)Get signed up for whatever affordable coverage you can and go find a therapist that has a background in depression, addiction, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT.If you really don't know where to start, go to a Gambling Addictions Anonymous meeting.

You should, but I am going to tell you that is a *symptom* of the cause, because waiting years to try and get a job after getting a degree, or not applying yourself to available skill learning resources (you literally have to not look for them) indicates that your problems lies in fundamental motivation, and is likely co-incident with other mental illness. You need to fix that first, or at least find a sustainable coping strategy or short term medication assistance, because everything you've described (switching from what sounds like hardcore imposter syndrome pivoting to high risk, low reward strategies as the first shift you've described) points to the problem not being your ability to learn, but in fact, something emotional you're not dealing with that is impairing your ability to deal with your problems, which are not compounding (and not just like the interest on debt).This stuff is worth figuring out and you are not hopeless, you're just mostly avoiding doing this, because I highly doubt I am the first person to say this to you, but in case I am.

Because everything I have seen you write indicates an immaturity in dealing with the consequences of your own actions. You need to own that first, and you need to help yourself. Because you have created problems that will take years to solve, and you have to be the one to do it. The upside is you will feel better when you actually start doing working on it.

The recruiter is a real piece of shit and is putting their thumb on the scale by pushing you to $180k so that they can tell the hiring manager you are expensive, making the candidate that the *recruiter* favors more likely to get the job.2. The recruiter is looking out for your best interest and doing you a favor - even if you don't get an offer. Sometimes the recruiter knows that salary will not be a factor in the final hiring decision. When I've hired, whenever there were high quality interviews, salary was the last thing I or anyone in the process cared about. Getting the call right on picking a high performer was all that mattered. Salary was only a factor when all of the candidates were meh and you didn't think getting a high performer was a likely outcome.The reason for the dynamic in point 2 is simple. If you are a manager and hire a high performer, it makes what you deliver look good to your boss. In this scenario the boss will almost never care if the high performer's salary is high for the organization's salary bands or the salary is above market. It's the opposite. They will worry about retention if the salary is low. If you hire a mediocre performer, the boss will have questions.

We discussed the shortcomings of my submission and what I could have done better… totally open conversation with many back and forth exchanges.

mqsufsu,"Absolutely you can but if I was to give you some advice it would be this. It sounds like you haven’t even dipped your toe in yet. Get some experience. Program something. Coding is a long journey so you should at least have a taste before convince yourself it’s something you want to do for an occupation. Programming is a huge - almost never ending - learning endeavor. It takes a lot of effort. Anyone can do it but the vast majority of people don’t like it enough to study it constantly for years until they get paid to do it. If you drop everything, quit your job, and study, you should be prepared to invest a lot of time.The market isn’t the best right now. Not as bad as some say but it’s definitely not great. Out of my graduating cohort of like 50 students, I think maybe 10 percent are working as software engineers. Who knows where the market will be by the time you’re looking for a job but the optimist in me says it should be better. That said, it’s still a risk.

mr2oq2k,"I've worked at 3 Fortune 100 companies - so, large companies.The only job postings that I think would qualify are when someone posts a job that is intended for an internal hire. That is when a team has decided to create a job to make a career move for an employee (maybe a promotion, maybe a diagonal move), and in order to create that new role - even if they intend to hire internally - they need to (by law) post the job publicly and have that posting up for at least some amount of time before hiring.EDIT: u/ImSuperHelpful is correct - it's not by law, but it seems to be a very popular policy at a lot of companies to prevent nepotism/encourage diversity. It's been the case at every large company I have worked at. I also wonder if it helps to prevent potential lawsuits for discrimination.The idea of having posts out there that the company does not intend to hire for generally doesn't fly at most companies because the entire process of creating a job posting starts with actually getting a real job approved first.It's also why recruiters can't just create a job posting to look busy - again, it would be the hiring manager (i..e, the person who owns the team where the new employee would work) that would need to get the job itself approved by his leadership before HR and recruiters get involved.Now, I don't doubt that there are some companies that do that - I think that might be true for super mega large companies like Meta, Microsoft - and that is to have a generic job posting meant to attract candidates for a large swath of jobs, but without necessarily having a job opening right this moment. But I think that's a minority of companies that do that.I think as someone else said, the other source of issues might be 3rd party recruiters posting fake jobs to farm resumes - but those should be easy to spot because they wouldn't actually tie to a real company's job posting.I think the reality is that a lot of this job postings are real - there's just so many applicants (including internal ones), that it probably feels like they're fake.",dfphd,2025-05-07 14:49:12,18,cscareerquestions,t3_1kgxzpn,False,

mq81l4l,"This depends on a few things \* The kind of job search you're doing (fishing around for new offers with low information vs already knowing exactly what you want)\* The quality of the recruiter\* The job market that you're inMost of the time I would say no; in general I think it's best to have an idea of where you want to be and give that range for where you want to be. Ex. if you make $80,000 and want to make $100,000 tell them you want to make $100,000 to $160,000 (arbitrary ceiling chosen but give yourself a nice range) rather than you make $80,000. I don't think it's unreasonable to give SOME number, if your number is TOO low then it's possible you should have bolstered your position by understanding the market better (to be fair, sometimes difficult to do).However third-party recruiters don't just have the incentive to match you to multiple companies, they have the incentive to match you ASAP. That means if they're going to companies, they may be getting the cheapest offer just to line you up with a few offers and have you choose (if you are presented with 3 offers ranging from $85k to $95k it may also give the impression that is all companies in your area are willing to pay and cause you to commit early). This isn't always the case, but if you get a lazy recruiter, this is more likely.If you give them a target, they will more likely hunt against that target, in which case you're aligning their goals (getting you matched) with your goal (getting you matched at your target) which I think saves everyone some time in the long run (companies for whom you are out of their league won't bother, companies who are willing to pay more may be more inclined to be more competitive).Hope that provides some clarity.EDIT: I also generally don't like advice to never give a number, I think that's just lazy on the part of the candidate and can be wasteful of the time of the recruiter if they're following leads you would already know are not worth your time.

mqpmvid,"> Back in college, I struggled to land strong internships. When people asked where I interned, I’d feel insecure.> ...> Eventually, I had to ask myself: Why do I feel the need to share my successes so often? Why is this decision so agonizing? And I think the honest answer is that I care a lot about how others perceive me.You just answered your own question, you *feel insecure*. I think you just brushed this off, but it sounds like you feel the need to constantly validate and confirm your worth due to insecurity. Hopefully it should go away once you get some experience under your belt, or if your priority in life changes(such as getting a partner, getting married, starting a family, etc.).Not every successful engineer becomes an icon in the tech world, a social media influencer, or even a revered name that is whispered among their peers. While some become celebrities in their own domains, others prefer a life of quiet anonymity. > But digging deeper, that desire doesn’t feel purely ego-driven. In tech, career advancement almost entirely depends on perception. Recruiters scan for brand names. Managers reward visibility. Friends decide whether you’re worth a referral. Your market worth is defined by what others think, not by what you think you’re worth.This is because you surround yourself with people who believe in this and actively participate in this grind.

mqq7tj5,"You’re right that perception is important. “Your career is what people think of you” is a pretty insightful way to think about progression. But I think you’re thinking about it too simply, and the way you’re approaching it is (at least slightly) counterproductive. It is valuable to be perceived as competent, confident, and personable. When switching jobs, making new connections, or seeking capital investment, peoples default assumption will be that the MIT grad who’s a staff engineer at FAANG is smarter/more capable than the state school grad working in QA at northwest mutual. But I think at some point, you cross a vague threshold where you’re taken seriously at a glance and you don’t really need to worry about micromanaging “prestige”. I’d even say that continuing to be visibly/noticeably concerned with prestige is a negative signal if you’ve already “made it” into high scale software development. It reads either as very self-conscious or very braggy, neither of which are good things for people to think about you. Strongly preferring a big brand like FAANG or a major scale-up over f500 or a small startup is just rational career planning. I don’t mean this in a flippant way, but agonizing about picking meta or google or citadel for prestige reasons is probably a question for therapy. It sounds like you’ve overcome a lot of challenges to get where you are. I’m proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself. But things aren’t as Machiavellian as you’re thinking. People aren’t going to go out of their way to help that person who wouldn’t ever shut up about how awesome they are and how many other offers they got and how hard it was to choose because they’re so impressed with them.

mqhzo9p,"I'd just say this -- it's easy to think that the entire world goes through you staying at your current company, but you actually have options. Software isn't a game we play for a day and can take big injuries, but a game we play week after week for years. For you, it doesn't sound like you are in a sustainable work environment -- you'll ever suffer some major health consequences then lose your job, or lose your job a little bit sooner and be back home.Therefore, I'd figure out what you need from your work to start getting on top of your health: maybe that's medical leave, or it could be an accommodation like more WFH. Then, tell HR what you need, with the right documentation, and let them decide. They don't really need to know the details of your condition, just that you are asking for certain things that are medically required. You might a little screwed right now, but if you lose a finger (or more), you'll be dealing with that consequence for the rest of your career.You're already on your way out of the company: that's what it means when your manager is forced to PIP you, it's a pretext for planned turnover, and it's very likely that no matter what you do, the manager will be forced to make another decision they might not agree with, since this is already going on at the company. I'd weight that pretty heavily in planning on what to do next.Also, you gave a small tell that your performance probably isn't as good as is expected or you might be misreading the situation: ""This was shocking, since one of those leads had publicly praised my work before, even in front of my current manager"". This complaint is common in a few people I've had to coach for not meeting expecations, and it's difficult for them to understand that praise of a single task, or doing one thing well, doesn't equate to broadly meeting expectations.

mqa2nu3,"Like the other commenter said you can get that degree and become a quant. Honestly, every SWE in Financial Services I’ve met has considered becoming a quant. It’s important to recognize that the quant job market is significantly different than just SWE/tech job market in some key ways. Culture, working hours, stress, and sustainability of your career should be considerations. Can you handle joining an investment firm then getting the axe a year or two later? Can you handle one or two years of garden leave due to non-competes? Can you handle being restricted by non-disclosure agreement?Anywho, I know Wells Fargo and PIMCO is huge out west. All the regular developers I know who work on securities pricing, risk reporting, trading systems, or otherwise more business-activity related platforms seem pretty secure in their jobs, if overworked. Although the American banks, at least, love a good layoff (eyes on you Goldman). IMO it’s great having a $$$ cash bonus at the end of every year while not being on the front line for layoffs relatively (suck it bankers, quants, researchers, and sales traders!). Maybe it’d be easier to skill build and lateral into a business-related developer role (ex. Java Algo Dev, E-Trading Dev, Low-Latency Trading Systems Dev, etc) than get a grad degree just to work on capital markets technology again?Definitely get in touch with recruiters and headhunters.

mqt440e,"The only tip I can give is maybe list the skill used at each place. It's what I do and I guess it works for me because I've always been doing that and it seems to work for me. Like when you said you used WebSockets you didn't say which language you programmed in. I would list everything packages, library, programming languages or whatever used on any given project. It bloats the resume, but no human is going to read it. You just want to cram in keywords. Even some jobs ask for ""git"" experience and I just assume that is a given and don't list it, but I do ""managed projects with git"" dur. Even when it seems redundant like you used Java at your last two companies, get that keyword in there at each company.Also, it may just be me, but I find a lot of companies don't give a shit about ""non-professional' experience, projects don't get any weight. They will explicitly say so in job descriptions (X years of professional experience with Y). Or recruiters or managers will appear kind of disappointed when you admit you know something from a personal project.And also, you can just lie. A find a lot of companies rarely check you on the skills you know, if you know you can pick it up easily, they won't know the difference once you're on the job. A lot of requirements are written by managers who think you need 5 years with git or else you don't know it at all. And like what I mentioned about projects above, you can just say you did that at your job rather than as a side project.Anyway getting your foot in the door is hard, I got my first job by referral from a relative.

mqsijhq,"When I was looking for my first job in 2022-2023 as a self taught without degrees, I researched the job market of my city and found out that jobs were divided into 2 main groups: popular techstacks and unpopular ones. Popular techstacks were Nodejs, PHP, Java, and C# with Nodejs being the most dominant among new grads like 5 to 10 times higher than usual (I asked my cs friends from colleges/universities all over the city and they all confirmed this) while PHP was treated like a second class citizen even though positions were just as much as for all of them. Unpopular ones were Python and Ruby: I'm talking about like just 4 or 5 postings per month.So I had a decision to make, should I compete in popular techstacks knowing that there would be more jobs to apply but the competition would also be crazy or should I choose a less popular one knowing that there would be only a handful of jobs to apply and only a handful to compete against? I picked the latter, learnt both Python and Ruby, and landed my first role after 3 months.Niche stacks have served me really well and now I'm even more invested in them. At my previous and current company, I've got the chance to add Golang and Elixir to my resume too. So now basically I have to maintain the knowledge of 4 stacks knowing that the amount of jobs I can apply to won't even compare to many of friends who have experience with only Java or Nodejs. For the current company, I've been more involved with the hiring process and the amount of Python/Ruby devs are still very few and far between.

mrcc69g,"orthodontist or dermatologist? it’d be nice to have a job where it’s literally impossible to do more work after you leave the office.

Plus the hygienists do the actual hands-on procedures; orthodontists just make the treatment plans and send it to Invisalign to 3d print. Seems pretty chill idk.

mr5ettj,"Don’t count on landing an AI/ML research role in industry without a PhD, it’s pretty rare and those positions are limited to begin with. There’s a bit more wiggle room when it comes to ML engineering roles, but even those are super competitive and a lot of folks in them still have PhDs. A master’s might open some doors for AI-focused jobs, but if you’re aiming for research or highly technical ML engineering roles at FAANG level companies, having a PhD is still the norm.",cashfile,2025-05-07 22:48:51,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1khavln,False,

mr6tk6d,"MS is fine for a development position, generally not enough for research. The most competitive research roles are mostly for people from the most pedigreed research labs and programs, so not just any PhD.In industry you will find plenty of people with CS, science, engineering, math, econ PhDs, etc. doing applied AI/ML. Many also just have an MS. Depends on the team and company, and nature of the work. Some will more heavily prefer PhD over MS. Some just want MS and BS is not enough, basically a hard filter. Other places, particularly if leaning towards more analyst-like work, may hire BS grads.There are plenty of people without graduate degrees working AI/ML jobs but more likely on SWE side and many of them already have experience in the area (and got that opportunity when the field was newer). If you don't already have prior experience in AI/ML and want to work in it, an MS is a good investment.But if you want to do research in industry or academia, your educational goal needs to be PhD, so don't get an MS if you're considering stopping there.",rajhm,2025-05-08 03:53:00,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1khavln,False,
mr5l7ml,"Doesn't really matter what you do with the masters. The masters degree is just a means to acceptance into a doctoral program. AL/ML roles which are research focused will expect you to have a PhD, and several published/presented works. That's table stakes. No one is going to give you money to figure out how to run a successful research project -- not when practically every reputable university has a lab or two you can work in. A competitive candidate in this space has published/presented works with them named as the PI rather than just a contributor.",healydorf,2025-05-07 23:25:04,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1khavln,False,
mr5sc7u,"> Applied science roles pretty much require a PhD though so don’t count on that. I actually disagree on this one. It'll obviously depend on the company, but, while a PhD is the norm at my company, there are a fair few people with a masters (and a rare few with only an undergrad degree). We're probably a little more engineering-heavy than some applied ML positions, but not drastically so.",anemisto,2025-05-08 00:05:43,2,cscareerquestions,t1_mr5i255,False,
