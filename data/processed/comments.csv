There was another logging interface configured, but stdout was missing from there as well. The only option to see the error message was to rerun the step again directly on Airflow through SSH. A step usually took 5-30 minutes. So if there was a failure, an extra 5-30 minutes had to be spent instead of just seeing it in the airflow logs.

Alternatively, it actually is a hard question to determine whether there is value to a consistent view of enterprise wide entities or whether it's more valuable to have different context data in different systems.

nl0qevr,"If your company's strategy is to grow by acquisition that means you will continually have to integrate new customer, supplier, and item data sets. You'll never be able to truly answer how many unique customers, suppliers, or products you have. That uniqueness is required for the denominator of your KPIs at an enterprise level. Yea I'm sure it's not needed at an operational level but that's not the level that your execs and ultimately your board is looking for.If you acquire your competitor and say you both share the same supplier but have different supply terms which are more favorable to the company you acquired then you would be smart to use that contract going forward. You will get to that answer sooner with MDM.MDM helps us get in front of these types of data challenges. Yes the tooling is bloated, expensive, and hard to implement and maintain. Regardless, the need will always be there. Another easy example, what if your customers are subsidiaries of other companies. How does Finance calculate the consolidate line of credit if it doesn't know or manage those relationships in the systems. When your company decides to change and modernize their ERP there is a huge effort to migrate accurate master data. If that master data is wrong it could put the whole migration and implementation in jeopardy causing millions in damages. There's plenty of risk if you don't accommodate for the needs of MDM that you might not see now but will when you eventually cross any of these bridges. So the need is not dead.

It Has to be able to rewrite all of the data in scope so that the ordering can work properly, so it would necessarily rewrite all the data. That would conflict with concurrent merge/update/delete operations, as at the time of finishing the ZOrder you would revert the rewritten data. However, if you run ZOrder on a single partition, then you can still merge/update/delete data in other partitions.The same goes for performing merge operations -- if you can isolate them to a single partition then the system can know for certain that you could not have possibly rewritten data outside that partition, so you can have concurrent merges working on different partitions.But that's all you really need it for now. You might add it for `is_active` on an SCD2 table because you will generally fundamentally only be updating current data and frequently only querying it, but you wouldn't be trying to optimise tables with partitioning.

nl9y08n,"Interesting to see the demand growing for analytics over JSON data. We've been working on improving JSON in ClickHouse as well.We released our native type last year, and just recently did a big update (https://clickhouse.com/blog/json-data-type-gets-even-better). We originally designed it so that you could pick (or let CH pick) about 1000 paths to store as native columns, and then pack the rest into a shared part file. It worked really well, but as more people used it, we found that a lot of people have A LOT of JSON paths. Either huge objects, or just huge variance between objects, which results in tens of thousands of paths. At which point you have many thousands of paths being bundled into the shared parts, and losing much of the efficiency (i.e. trying to aggregate a field that is packed into shared parts was slower and used a lot of memory compared to a real col).We redesigned it so that we can essentially do hierarchical indexing of buckets of shared parts - the post above explains how it works in detail. We managed to get some pretty impressive gains - about 58x faster when querying paths in shared parts, and using 3300x less memory, when you have over 10k unique paths.It's a pretty interesting area to work on as not many OLAP DBS handle JSON very elegantly, typically you just flatten it which is pretty annoying and brittle.",sdairs_ch,2025-10-25 08:00:48,11,dataengineering,t3_1of1xxl,False,

They should all already be identified and catalogued someplace, as part of a data security framework. If they're not, that's a problem in and of itself. You need to know where the PII actually exists, and ideally section it off into separate, higher-security datastores. Less sensitive datastores should only store identifiers to the records in the secure datastores that contain the actual PII. This step alone can dramatically simplify the process of keeping things secure, and can make it safer to allow production access for developers to debug issues. It's rare that a bug involves needing to know actual PII, even in production.Once you know which datastores/fields contain PII, you can set up automated ETL pipelines to mask or tokenize them during the process of being copied into non-prod environments.A good practice is to have (at least) two non-prod environments: development and QA/staging. The QA environment should be automatically overwritten with a fresh, sanitized copy of production data, on a regular basis.

nkxk6br,"I've tried and seen a couple of approaches, usually starting with using open-source [Cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos) to orchestrate dbt Core projects so you can see each dbt model/seed/test as an Airflow task in the DAG for additional visibility and to see the dbt docs in the Airflow UI (side note: this feature will be back for Airflow 3.1 with Cosmos 1.11 that should come out next month).The next ""level"" is to use Asset (in Airflow 3.x) / Dataset (in Airflow 2.x) scheduling for cross-DAG dependencies. That way the Asset graph (exists in 2.x and 3.x but imho is much easier to navigate in 3.x) serves as a proxy-lineage graph. Side note tip if you need both, runs based on time and upstream DAG dependencies, there is a combined [AssetOrTimeSchedule](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-datasets#combined-asset-and-time-based-scheduling).From there, yes, some people implement custom solutions, often based on dependency information gathered from the Airflow API or use the OSS OpenLineage integration to get ""true"" lineage and then visualize it with Marquez. How well this works highly depends on the operators and hooks you use, if they already support lineage extraction (there is a [list of supported classes](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-openlineage/stable/supported_classes.html)) or if you need to add extractors to your own custom operators. Inlets and outlets (so Assets again) are also evaluated by this integration.If you want an out-of-the-box solution there are paid products like [Astro Observe](https://www.astronomer.io/product/observe) which is based on OpenLineage and reads in that information to create a lineage graph with additional fancy features like SLA definition, alerts, cross-deployment lineage etc. There is also a list of potential up and downstream impacts in case of failures. The upside is minimal setup needed and managed service support.Disclaimer: I work at Astronomer :) and a lot of the above was inspired by [this blog post](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/the-road-to-reliability-implementing-pipeline-observability) (and the webinar linked at the bottom of it) from our internal data team.

nlisgpa,"1. ClickHouse is great to run analytics on very large immutable data (super fast because of the vectorized engine, sparse index etc), I'd only use it for that and only if your data is actually very large (or you anticipate it to be in a reasonable time frame) and move the SCD and model layers into a proper OLAP db. So: raw, very large and will never change in ClickHouse, anything aggregated or that needs to be updated ever in Postgres/BQ/Snowflake etc. But honestly for a first PoC if your data isnt that big, which I assume based on the current CSV/SharePoint/PowerBI combination, you can also skip ClickHouse for now.2. Sorry no first hand experience with PowerBI+ClickHouse. From what I've heard it works fine for basic dashboards but complex joins are not fun with that combo.3. I'm biased here since I work for Astronomer so I have a lot of Airflow and only very little Prefect experience. I'd recommend spinning up a small dev environment of both and creating some mock pipelines to see which fits your needs better. For small projects it's often the case that several orchestrators can do the job and the decision is made more based on personal preference. Some tips for Airflow: * Use the Astro CLI to spin up a local dev env in containers to try it out (its free and does not need a sign up). * If you are combining Airflow with dbt you have to use [Cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos) (ok, technically you don't *have* to but it is really the best way!). It is an OSS package that lets you render dbt projects and dbt docs in the Airflow UI. * You said your ingest is pulling from REST APIs using Python: you can use the `task`decorator in Airflow to turn any Python function into an Airflow task, thats probably the fastest way. I think Prefect has a similar decorator too. So with either tool hopefully you can reuse a lot of your existing code there. * If you end up passing data between tasks that is more than just small jsons in Airflow, for example larger pandas dataframes, you'll want to store that data in a blob storage. This used to take a bit of setup but about 1.5 years ago a class was added in the Common IO provider package that is very quick to set up via env vars ([a tutorial](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/custom-xcom-backends-tutorial)). * PSA: top level code in Airflow is executed every time the file is parsed, so don't connect to your db in top level code (i.e. outside of tasks).4. If there is a good way to do SCD with ClickHouse I have not found it yet. There is [ReplacingMergeTree](https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/replacing-merge-tree), which I haven't tried myself but generally, yes, that is definitely a good reason to have the modeling layers somewhere else.",TJaniF,2025-10-26 18:51:14,2,dataengineering,t3_1ogop8w,False,

nlqbbcf,"I think in your situation I would go for it, at least for an initial smaller proof of concept since you already have the account set up and already other teams in the org that have experience (that is often underrated being able to bug coworkers for help).The orchestration does sound very doable no matter which of the 3 orchestrators you mentioned you use. If you go with Airflow I'd recommend looking into [DAG Factory](https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/) (or creating your own), it is an open source package that abstracts the Python for the Airflow pipelines behind YAML, it is especially useful for simple and repetitive pipelines. I've also seen setups were almost all of the Airflow code was abstracted away by one or two engineers and the analysts only wrote SQL (an OSS example here is [gusty](https://github.com/pipeline-tools/gusty)). Might be a way to help the drag and drop team members to slowly start to see the beauty of code-based abstractions and pipelines, once they see that can just fill in a few values in a template instead of clicking around when adding a new source etc.Also if you ever end up hating one of the GCP tools you can still switch them out against another tool and move towards a hybrid setup later.I haven't used data transfer service/dataform before so can't speak to those vs Fivetran/dbt.

nl1wukm,"There is a reason that the vast majority of data science projects never make it to production. You're experiencing it. Your approach sounds more like an Agile approach. Start by building the MVP (minimally viable product) THEN add features and improvements. Build with the intent that things will get bolted on. They are doing a classic waterfall approach. Deliver the final product all at once. So in this method, building in certain features first might be more efficient to get to the final deadline. Agile is faster, more flexible, and some variation of it is the new modern standard. Waterfall is good for building something with core features that are extremely well defined. Of course, there's the other option that they are just building what they want to build whether it is needed or not. With data scientists, you can't rule that out. Here's the catch, every data scientist I have ever met HATES Agile. I suspect it is because in academia, you design your entire experiment, make your hypothesis, do your research, THEN do the experiments THEN publish your results. To them, Agile is following a poor practice of finding something 80% correct with the end goal of getting something better in the next round. Plus, if they are building a gradient boosting regression with specific variables now, the 90% correct version may require completely different variables with a Random Forest Regression. In other words, a complete rebuild. Data engineers can add features much more organically. I'm not saying that the Data Scientists are right. There is a very good reason while Agile has dominated tech, and there is a reason Data Science projects never get anywhere. Understand where they are coming from, but ultimately, you're more likely than them to be following best practice.",BoringGuy0108,2025-10-24 00:25:33,5,dataengineering,t3_1oeh29i,False,
nl8km9l,"I guess it depends on what you mean by features. If you mean selecting what variables go I to a model, yeah, you figure that out first. Typically data scientists work in a sandbox environment when they model. If you’re talking delivery, then I assume you are building data pipelines? They need to figure out what model works before they can tell you what data they need and how they need it. It’s a lot of exploratory work. When I worked on an agile data science team, we just wanted access to copies of raw prod data from different sources while we figured out approximately what worked. (Honestly, even if it would work.) Training can involve significant amounts of data. If it was something large and complex, like a simulation, this might take weeks. At review we usually had draft models to talk through with business and often changed or added data as a result. We didn’t get involved with engineering until we had a good idea of what data we needed and how we needed it first (and where we were putting it). If business needed something faster for a particular reason, we’d just refreshed our working draft. (They usually had access.) “Productionizing” something like that as we worked would have been wildly expensive and time consuming. We had conflict with one of the engineering teams at one point because they thought it was inappropriate to give us access to data until we could tell them exactly what we need. Then they would decide how to model it, spend time modeling for us, and it wouldn’t be modeled in a way that worked, the back and forth arguments took forever. (No, six months of data isn’t enough. No, the most recent value replacing the old value doesn’t suffice. Actually, we needed those variables you deleted, etc.) It was a nightmare. They considered us “non-technical” as just told us we didn’t understand best practices. No idea if this applies to you. Hopefully not. But you might ask them their reasoning. Data science is not a software dev discipline and follows a different life cycle than the standard SDLC. I have seen multiple issues with tech people over my career who could not wrap their heads around this.

If I didn't need the DBT plugin I would look at SQRuff in preference to SQLFluff.For DBT we publish the output of DBT Docs to cloud blob storage so clients can download it into whatever internal websites suit them. Again, interactive data lineage comforts auditors and people who query business data.In the past I've used products such as Redgate SQLDoc and Innovasys DocumentX to document databases. As the company I was with went with a plethora of other databases I ended up writing my own version. For any tabular DB my app needed a DB connection and a folder to hold that DB's equivalent of queries whose output was a defined contract. Again, this comforts the auditors.Code quality tools such as SonarQube, Sonarlint are useful. In JetBrains PyCharm there us a ""Problems"" tab that provides code improvement suggestions. I've found these to be useful. I think VS Code has some useful extensions that do something similar.JavaDoc is over 30 years old, most languages have an equivalent.

Using Mermaid markup allows the relationships between various cloud artefacts to be autogenerated. I'm crap at graphics so Mermaid is about my limit. Again, a diagram comforts auditors. A comforted auditor is a comforted management team.Data testing can be DBT Test, Soda and more specific queries. Its easy enough to generate AWS cloudwatch metrics from the results of a query. From AWS Cloudwatch metrics, its easy ti generate AWS Cloudwatch alarms. An example would be average expected sales +- 1.64 standard deviations as the acceptable range, anything outside of that range needs investigation.In all honesty, the tooling is not the important thing.

You should be using sth like dbt/bruin for that so that you have a maintainable framework to build these SQL pipelines. * If you need to ""activate"" this data by pushing the data into some other systems/reports, you then build that part of the ETL in Python or any other language you are familiar with. * If you need to orchestrate these, you use something like airflow/dagster/prefect/bruin to make sure the steps run at the right time in the right order.A significant chunk of the work here is exploration, as you can tell.

Put tenantid first in ORDER BY and partition by month (toYYYYMM(ts)) for fast pruning and easy drop/backfill per tenant-month. For custom fields, store a Map for long tail, but promote high-usage keys into real columns; add bloom filter indexes on common filters and a soft\_delete flag with TTL DELETE to keep storage sane. Row policies work well for tenant isolation if you expose direct SQL. Tinybird is great for serving pre-aggregates, but keep ClickHouse as the source of truth and rebuild from staging when mappings change. I’ve used Airbyte for ingestion and dbt for tests/backfills; DreamFactory helped us expose secure REST endpoints over the star for internal tools and partner integrations without hand-rolling auth.

nlbnniw,"Thank you! Looking briefly at this post, it does seem to touch on what I’m asking. The post calls it a “monster query”, which is accurate. A composite metric fact table is just that - rather than a period snapshot, or transactional fact (or other) it’s literally taking data (facts) from many adjacent places and smashing them together - in my case to create “supply vs. demand” - adjacent facts include production actuals, production schedules, inventory (on hand, consignment, with vendor, in transient, etc), stock received from 3rd parties, projected sales, actual sales, goods issued, etc. There is like >17 datasets that comprise the formula for “supply vs. demand”, and each data set is multiple ETL jobs / facts broken out by different companies / regions of the world (in a large multinational). Hence, you can see my concern about potential challenges about different points of time due to unexpected failed or delayed ETL jobs, and ensuring to write an artifact to the fact for data quality purposes. I don’t need to expose this to my end uses (who are restricted to views on top of my table) but I would put in in the physical table for quality/explainability. Also, I’m only concerned with the explainability part now (best practice design). Obviously, the more important part is the proactive portion of who you programmatically ensure all combined data is from the same point of time. For example, you can break the metric up into regions of the world (NA, EMEA, APAC) to ensure it’s computed relevant to their time zones, you can adjust your “subqueries” to enforce timeboxes, or time travel / time restrictions to ensure they are all consistent, or you might do some sort of staging tables that can be “frozen” (for example frequent loading upstream but frozen into daily buckets, etc.). I’m sure there are a few good options.Again, I’m starting with “hey they this is very complicated since ETL doesn’t always work as intended and error free” so how do I assure quality given the many challenges. Thanks again - it’s is a great link, very helpful and exactly what i was asking for.Edit: the blog post called out something I forgot to mention that’s pretty critical. The subsets of data are all aggregated, so what’s included/missing from the aggregation is very important. For example, if we are calculating MetricValue = Inventory on hand [region | material | day] - goods issue [region | material | day ] + projected sales [ region | material | calendar day] —> and each of these are very volatile. The different businesses in different regions of the world will change their sales forecasts through out the day (especially as we near quarter/year end, or other business target dates), inventory changes drastically, and goods issue (reduction of inventory) is very dynamic. So, if I’m after a daily level, as in what’s my EMEA inventory for material 111 on 10/23/25, this value could be very different if my subquery executes at 1am vs. 4am vs. 7am. Where as in a transactional fact table, i would simply be adding rows (ie: additional sales invoices to a sales fact table) and the differences are easily understood - I’m summarizing inventory per day, so the differences in values due to timing are a mystery. I like that the blog post is pointing this out as a challenge in the “monster query” which aggregates results into a “common grain” (which is exactly what I’m doing here).",rotr0102,2025-10-25 15:27:12,2,dataengineering,t1_nl9swgv,True,

nkky0t1,"I finally had my first ""good"" AI coding experience this past week.Had built out a project with just a frontend left to do.Chose react and scaffolded up the app with a data provider and reactquery. Built out the first screen then created a ""mocks folder"", with Claude mocked up several screens based on the first one I'd manually coded. We iterate a bit and land on something that's almost ok.The code produced yes of course is pure trash but that's ok. I then cut up the mocks into functional components and fix the things I don't like.At the end I realized all it really did was save some typing during the design phase, if I tried to use it to produce any production code of more than a few lines it just couldn't do it.I had some use* bugs that were pretty obvious, Claude could not figure out the dependant arrays, it couldn't figure out how to correctly useMemo or useEffect, it would solve one problem create another solve that problem and the first problem would return. None of those problems were hard to solve, it was clear Claude couldn't remember or factor in multiple requirements.I've concluded that ai is not capable of building any real functionality and coding with ai is still more of a pipedream than reality. Now I've done enough to be convinced vibe coders and advocates just aren't very good devs.It was good for visualizing the app, and giving me some design direction, but none of that code is usable and for every minute it saved it wasted 10 of mine.

It could have been made by half a dozen different implementations of that interface, or it could even be a mock object created in a unit test. You treat all of them the same way and don't care where they were constructed.If you think there's something wrong with the way the object is being constructed, looking in the code that is having it injected is the wrong way to inspect it.

Instead, what we see is Java trying to copy other languages while maintaining backwards compatibility, which naturally makes the language harder than needed. See the ""wonders"" of how string interpolation is stuck with a kind of nasty format, because all the more reasonable ones were used in other libraries first, and they didn't want to break backwards compatibility. See the streaming api, less comfortable than the equivalent in every language with monadic collection operations. The Option class that has no nullability guarantees, so it's not reliable, And since 95% of all Java for services is written in Spring, the annotation salad is what we've got.So yeah, your best bet is to cope via heavy IDEs that do all the work and will track usages, including knowing the autowiring logic.",hibikir_40k,2025-10-24 14:31:27,26,learnprogramming,t3_1oey2jw,False,

The hardest part is learning that when you write `int weeks = days / 7;` on line 14, and then change the number of `days` on line 20, the value of `weeks` doesn't change along with it. But you get used to it, and learn to read code.Then comes **procedural** code, with loops and functions/methods (we ignore the objects at first), and it gets a bit harder to understand that the loop does the same thing over and over, but with the values changing - so now changing a value on line 20 **DOES** impact the calculation on line 14, if they are inside the same loop. Or a function behaves differently from time to time, because it depends on a global variable, whose value might have changed since the last call ...Then you move into **object oriented** code, where objects ask each other to do stuff - but it still mostly reads like procedural code, where a single thread of execution goes through methods living in different objects - you get used to having to jump around in different files, but most of the time you can still follow along. The hardest part is knowing when the objects are instantiated, and who ""owns"" the reference to them - but other than that you begin to abstract away the actual program flow, unless you really need it.But you begin using frameworks, and suddenly you don't see all the code - you have objects that extend existing objects, who then call methods in your object. You don't know exactly when or why your own methods are called, you just get CVS-receipt-length style stack-dumps when something fails, and you sit ""outside"" the code, looking in, trying to understand what might be happening around your own code - mostly you are guessing or using information from other people also guessing.It becomes very hard to follow, even for experienced programmersAnd then you move to Spring, which is **aspect oriented** programming, where you don't even write, nor see all the code, but only add annotations and interfaces, and then some magic entity behind the curtain reads your code, and changes it! Sometimes before compiling, sometimes after! And you have no idea how your code is being used, who uses it, what for, or when. You just hand code to the monster, and it does something - now it is literally impossible to follow what is going on, and you need to know what the platform does, what the framework does, how it uses your classes and methods, and why it uses them in the way it does ... And you either have to read through 35 years of accumulated specifications, or watch days of indian youtubers explain it, still somewhat on the surface-level ...So to answer your question, **yes**!

No exceptions, even if it's as little as 30min for one and 30min for the other. Every time you feel like you're not skilled enough (which may be true), remember that people less skilled than us ARE getting jobs.Figure out why. Are they applying in novel ways? Do they have really good interviewing skills? Are they personable? Did they do x, y, and z? Improve yourself based on your findings. There are A LOT of unique ways to get hired while being less skilled. At the very least, you can improve your interviewing skills by failing at them and learning what to learn. Don't be afraid to look for more technical, but still retail-adjacent/low-level roles as a start. Don't allow yourself to settle for this either - keep searching and improving your process. I'd also try doing Neetcode 150 as well.

Don't worry about ""not knowing the answers.""

Focus on your preferred languages and up your skills.I recommend that path the most.At the end of the day, school primed us to be very good at intaking new information and thinking like a computer, so now you have to learn how to be a craftsmen, building new projects and applying your theory. Too overwhelming? The Odin Project is a free online boot camp that will essentially take you from 0 to the very minimum skills of a junior full-stack developer. You'll learn how to research, use version control, and build projects. This will solidify your programming foundation, especially if you go a layer or two deep when using the additional resources/reading books.Don't forget to keep applying. When you're done with Foundations, you're not going to be ""cracked out junior"" level, but you'll be ""meh, *maybe* I can teach him the rest"" level. If you haven't been applying due to being an imposter, you want a job or what? At least start at this point. The more you improve at learning to program, the workflow for it, the rigor it takes, etc, the better you can pivot to other domains of programming. This is just one method of trying to open that door.You are free to learn whatever else (project-based building in your preferred domain, reading books about programming, following tutorials on building a game, etc) as long as you complete that block of time for applications (or learning novel ways of getting a job) and dedicated self-study (this example being The Odin Project).It's important to have fun during it all and not try to speed run yourself into burnout.

It could be generative AI, ML, or complex but important topics, but also things that are completely irrelevant to today's world or the job market. Similarly, other cybersecurity categories will likely include theory, encryption, encryption algorithms, and more, but there's a good chance they won't include what everyone expects—hacking or active intrusion prevention. Web can also encompass anything, perhaps focusing more on network administration or web application development (more or less latest technologies, languages). Depending on how the university keeps up with the times, databases might have a well-developed foundation, but they might also include cloud computing, Azure, data warehousing, Big Data, and more.Based on what these specializations contain, you can make a more informed decision, and we can recommend one over the other. Of course, it's also important what you're interested in, what you've done, and what you felt good about. This is especially true for things you didn't particularly enjoy; this can strongly steer you toward a particular specialization.

It's also possible that the technologies they'll teach you for creating web applications aren't entirely aligned with market demand.

Same for OS design and for parsers/compilers (the purple dragon book is still likely going to be the book you read for compilers and that was written 40 years ago).What you want to do at your stage is to continue passing your math and engineering classes because those are extremely important if you want to do anything with CS that doesn't involve basic software engineering. And the reason for that is going to be that the math classes you take will likely gate what upper division electives you can take. Go through your course catalog and look at the electives for your major. THOSE are going to lead to high-level, interesting stuff that *does* require a college education. For example, machine learning as a college junior or senior is severely more intensive than what you're going to experience through online tutorials aimed at people who don't have a CS background.The important thing is that a lot of interesting stuff that you can learn as a CS major *isn't necessarily CS.* If you want to learn about simulation, you might end up looking at stuff for civil engineers (and realize that you need to take more physics). If you want to learn more about data science, you might end up looking at economics and might need to take way more philosophy.

But if you always plush to master, and you've done work since you realized that feature you added broke something, removing it without removing the in between work is a pain. It's also harder to go back and figure it out.We branch from master when we start on a new major update. These usually are usually a very big deal - features being added. We don't merge a major into master until we end support - master holds the oldest version we support.When we patch, we branch off the major branch into a patch branch. So most of the time there will be master, major, and patch. There can be two major branches, though it's not common. When we release a patch we merge it into the major, so that doesn't get cluttered.When a developer starts working in something, they branch from, usually, the patch branch. When they're happy they submit a pull request so someone else can review it, then merge once approved.This makes it very easy to keep things organized. If you need to pause work on one incomplete task, you can just swich branches, do what you need to, switch back and, if needed, rebase to bring in the thing you stopped to work on.And commit often.

In Europe/US as far as I know, Python, C# and Java are still pretty common, Go, JS and Ruby (and rust) exist, but at different and lower frequencies, I have seen only very few Kotlin backends, even though I love how it is done in the language. If you want real numbers, go on job portals in your area, and look through a few hundred backend jobs. (Yes, it will take 2-3 hours, but you will have an accurate answer, which did not come from the subjective, 2 years out of date experience of someone from germany)2. I mean... Not sure what you mean? A Backend REST (or GraphQL) API will work for any frontend, as long as that frontend can do network requests. You can use the same backend for a python Frontend, a JS Webapp and an embedded C controller, and I have done so in the past. 3. You will have to learn the concepts of backend.

But once you know how it works and how to set it up, it works pretty much the same in every framework (+/-, different things will be included, there wil be different names and slightly different details). If you know what middleware is, or how a request/a form is handled, you can migrate frameworks pretty easily. If you don't know those things, you can't really work productively in teh backend. 4.

The forwarding can happen through HTTP calls, but in modern data centers you may also encounter request forwarding through other protocols that are more suited like gRPC. Reverse proxy servers can also handle load balancing, i.e. if the same application is deployed multiple times behind the reverse proxy the reverse proxy can choose the application with the lowest load as the forward target so that no server becomes overly burdened.Reverse proxy servers can perform so called ""TLS termination"", where the reverse proxy handles the TLS handshake (and is aware of the TLS private keys that are used to prove service authenticity). This effectively strips the TLS functionality from the requests so that an application can focus purely on providing functionality, while the secure connection responsibility remains with the reverse proxy. However it is also possible (and encouraged) to encrypt a HTTP / gRPC connection that gets established within a data-center from the reverse proxy to the application server with TLS.

Way back in the day, a variety of simple hacks made it easy to imitate a web site through dns poisoning/etc. SSL certificate and encrypting the data between client and server was a huge step in resolving that.

nkl10ig,"If you really want a completely honest and maybe harsh answer: You're trying to build your house from the second (or even higher) floor up without building everything that's below first (and that's why you're overwhelmed).What I mean by that is that directly jumping into game dev with a game engine (even as beginner friendly as Godot) is a guarantee for failure.You need to learn *general programming* first. You need to learn to create the discrete steps that make the computer do what you want it to do. I fully do understand that your ultimate goal is to create your game, but that's a *future goal*. (A new carpenter doesn't directly start building intricate Victorian furniture. They start with learning to work with hand tools and with the grain of the wood and gradually work their way up.)Take two steps back and start with general programming. The suggestions I give you now are tailored to your desire of making games in the end:+ Start with the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki. It is a free, textual, extremely practice oriented course that is the current first semester of ""Introduction to Computer Science"". This course will give you a solid general programming foundation and understanding along with teaching you the *Python programming language*.+ Then, move on to [Making Games with Python and Pygame](https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/) - also free to read online. This book will lay the foundation for game programming. Maybe, if your game is simple enough, you can even realize it with Pygame already.+ Then, move on to Godot. And here, I'd suggest that you shell out a few bucks (it's really cheap) and buy the [Humble ""Learn Godot in 2025"" bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/software/learn-godot-in-2025-complete-course-bundle-software) (available for 2 more days at the time of writing this comment) - I've bought a previous similar bundle and can attest that the courses are excellent and well worth the money.My recommendation for Python first comes from GDScript's similarities to it. GDScript is basically a Python dialect with some additions for Godot and some peculiarities.

Once that is covered, you'll be able to do a lot of things (still, it will be laborious and dirty. But the important part is being able to craft stuff).You'll then enter that part where you just try out stuff and document yourself with the eventual learning of x technology or y algorithm. This point is where some can get stuck in the infamous tutorial hell where you just drift from one tutorial to another one w.o. ever really achieving something. Thus why I suggested earlier to ""just tackle your own problems"".Now that I explained what I would advice and why I would advice it, I would still want to add this : encountering and trying to solve your problems rather than doing tutorials w.o. ends is one thing.

This way, you'll ensure to develop your skills rather than stagnate relearning the basics n times. Eventually, get (or create) a map of what you learn and what you want to / have to learn.

I could list a bunch of stuff I believe are important to know, but more than likely, miss quite a few in the process.A more broad answer is that the fact that you are aware of gaps in your knowledge is a great place to start! If you find yourself unaware of why an implementation is done the way it is - investigate it! Many of the frameworks you're using are likely Open Source, and likely developed in the open, with open issues, RFCs, etc. that describe exactly the sort of information you're missing.Now I don't know your skill level, so I don't know if you are well adept in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP, etc. But I would add that you should know what the frameworks you're using are doing for you. If it is a frontend UI framework - your first question should be ""Why am I using this?"", ""What problem is this framework solving for me?"" If your answer is ""because this guide tells me to"", then that's an issue.Understanding basic design patterns is also something I consider to be quite important. Sadly I think many traditional methods of showcasing these patterns are quite poor in terms of teaching the way one can internalize the patterns and use them - even if programming in a different language than the one being used to show examples in, and even if the implementation details differ to the way the patterns are shown.So, to summarize, my take is that the fact you're asking questions is half the way to progressing, now you just need to look for the answers. Mastering all of this is a craft, and it is ever evolving. But if you want to look past the frameworks as ""the stuff you learn"" and get to ""I use them to solve specific problems"", you need to be painfully aware of exactly what those problems are. This is also the only way you will ever gain a proper understanding of when to switch to a different framework. Remember this industry moves fast, most of the frameworks in use now either didn't exist or were quite new 10 years ago, and going back 10 more year will yield the same result.

First ""wireframes"" with a pen and paper, to roughly block out what could go where. then I made a single page in detail, to decide on a style for my UI. With those two in hand I went to some potential users, and used them to ""test"" my idea. I put the papers in front of them and asked them to perform a task (and I ended each test session by letting them choose a few tasks themselves) This resulted in me changing quite a few of my designs and intended workflows. It is good to catch errors as early and cheaply as possible. Changing the blockout version of a site costs a few hours in drawing, changing a coded version would take days or weeks.5. Then I sat down with my new UI and double checked, that all planned features are present, and that all parts of the UI are part of a planned feature. If not, I adjusted either side until I was happy. Then I used my feature List to plan my tech stack (yes, I did it this late in the game) Now I knew everything I wanted my (web)app to do and what it needed to do. So I chose rust(leptos) frontend, rust(axum) backend and postgresQL as my database. (shocker)6. With my new tech stack in hand, I made some rough diagrams of the architecture of the front and backend, something like a UML diagram, but much less formal. (because I am alone, as long as I can guarantee that I understand it, it's fine, and I have been using the same ""almost-UML"" since year 2 of university) I also mapped out the DB, but in excruciating detail, every nullable field, every relationship. Then I double checked again, that every feature, both in the UI and my docs, is present in my database.7. Then I started implementing a vertical slice: Meaning a single feature, from the DB to the UI, ""fully"" functional. I took this to even more testers, got feedback and did a final round of adjustments to my UI style plan.8. This is where I am now: I am currently implementing version 1 of my app, in it's entirety. This will be interrupted by testing with real users from time to time, but I am hoping that no major issues will come up, and I am confident that my architecture is strong enough to support refactoring most features.This is not ""the best"" way. But I was bitten by agile too often in the past, so for my free time, I wanted something a little more waterfally. I am certainly not moving as fast as I could, and if I was dependent on external funding, this might not be a path I could afford; but since it's only my spare time, I chose to take the time and try to get it right the first time. If I get it 75% right, I will be more than happy.EDIT: I forgot Step 0: I actually built a prototype. The UI was shit, and I only had 10% of my final featureset, but I wanted to see if the ""demand"" was there. It is. The UI was built sloppily over a few weeks with no plan, and was very unmaintainable. I learned a lot about the domain though, so it's not wasted time, it made my second attempt so much easier and better.",Beregolas,2025-10-22 20:46:04,2,learnprogramming,t3_1odj3hg,False,

nkxmvz8,"> I realized I should have built some of these other areas first because now I was back-tracking and making corrections to code I've already written when I wouldn't have to do that if I had just built everything in the right stacking order.Maybe. Maybe not. You should expect to have to rewrite parts of your code as you discover errors in previous assumptions, find better ways to do things, find that your requirements change, or whatever else comes along. That's why you try to have strong separation of concerns and loose coupling between well defined functions (and architectural layers) that can be swapped out at a later dateI would generally advise writing an end-to-end solution as early as possible, including installing your app on an iPhone/iPad to prove that it works in the wild.A good starting point for an architecture is to separate your app into 3 separate layers: data, business logic, and presentation logic. The data and business logic would be in the 'M' (model) of an MVC architecture, while the presentation logic would be in the 'V' (view).Try to think about how easy it would be to swap the components within one of those layers for other components with minimal impact on the rest of the app. The fewer changes you have to make to interfaces between layers, the more decoupled they are.> Can someone please breakdown their typical workflow, do you start with back-end? ground level framework stuff, and then work your way up to re-usable shared features that can nest into full components later?If you imagine your architectural layers as being stacked one on top of the other, with the data layer at the bottom and the presentation at the top, then my approach is to design the architecture from the top down, then again from the bottom up, then finally once more from the top down.I start from the top because that's where the user lives, and it's the user experience that will drive the app. There's always a bit of tension between the the best implementation for the UI and the best implementation for the data, and that tension has to be resolved somewhere in the middle (e.g. at the API); so once you've established your data models from the perspective of the user, it helps to look at the system again from the perspective of the models, make sure you've established the best way store and query those models, then see how your UI will interact with those models. With your new understanding of how the data will be modelled, you might find a better design for the UI, or at least refine how your UI interacts with the models.",marrsd,2025-10-23 10:37:25,1,learnprogramming,t3_1odj3hg,False,

If you're already at a school, shouldn't you just do what your teachers recommend? Specific tech stacks don't matter at all, you're getting a degree to learn how to think, not how to use languages.Data structures and algorithms are often taught in pseudocode because the principle mattes, not the implementation. Sometimes metaphors are used like lightbulbs or searching a phonebook, etc. Nevertheless, the C language is often used for more practical examples because it is barebones. There's not much high-level fluff and it feels closer to the actual memory implementation, which sometimes makes it feel more relevant to learn about sorting algorithms when working directly with raw arrays. A language like Python works just the same, but the ecosystem around it will throw high-level standard libs in your face, which already take care of all data structure and algorithms for you, so it feels more pointless than a lower level language.I've never heard that C++ or Java would be preferred for learning DSA, why would they? C++ is like C, just with classes and more high-level features, which aren't applicable when learning about the fundamentals. Java is a memory-managed high-level language similar to C#, therefore still in the root vein of C, but with many more features, all which are irrelevant for DSA.Use whatever your teachers/mentors know best to reduce the friction of setting up any environments or getting stuck on syntax features.

I say in your area because it does drastically change depending on when you live!

You are already familiar with JS, so you can learn the server-side concepts more easily without having to relearn the language. But learning comes in any shape, so it would also be perfectly fine to switch to a different language if you want to.\- If your goal is to become a full-stack dev with a decent developer experience, definitely stay in the JS ecosystem. This way you will be able to leverage both the fe and the be to a very high degree while writing the same code, reusing types, etc. With time, you will probably move to Next or some other full stack framework instead of express.Notice that I answered your question regarding JavaScript in general.

I start by explaining the idea of what I want to do and what I might need to make it. Brief 4-5 lines as an intro to the project2) Aims and Objectives. Here I detail exactly what I want and what it needs to be a success. This help keep things on track and prevent scope creep as I can always focus on what I really need and the real objectives in the background. 3) Plan. First through rundown of how I think I’ll build it. You don’t need to be exact on every detail but figure out what you’re going to need. Login section, landing page, diff options, processing input for ‘x’ or ‘y’ and how it’s done/what the out put should be. 4) Components. List out the big bits you need to do. Parts that need to be put together with key functions and features. It’s to track that plan you did earlier and figure out what needs to be done at a glance. 5) Variables Functions libraries and Header files. List out all the variable you’re using and why you use them, do the same for function. Very basic ones can just be named with type, you don’t need an explanation but if you won’t know at first glance what it does write it out. What are we importing from this library. Why did we make that header file and what’s in it/how does it work. Keep updating as you move along6) Working journal. This one might branch into a different file depending on the size of the project. Start the project, write out what you need to do first and what you’re planning to work on. I usually put the date in but that’s just for me to be able to look back over it. Every day I start by bringing unfinished tasks forward and writing out the next set of tasks I need to finish. Copy across what you’re doing and what’s not working and the final version when it is. Anything important or interesting I need to note for later goes in here. “Had to scrap an entire section and restart it”, throw that in here and explain why. At the end of the session I list out what I did today and what I need to do on the next session (cuts back 10-15 min of figuring out where to start when you sit down next time). 7) Closing Brief. I usually move this up after the objective section once I’m finished. How did the project go? Did you achieve your goals? What was difficult how did you get around it? What would you like to improve further? And finally are you happy with the finished product? 8) Lessons learned, at the end of the file, where did you go wrong and what do you know now about doing “x”, “y” or “z” for next time. .Read Me file:After the project I’ll make the read me file. 1) Update the Concept, Aims, Components and Brief so I have a concise document that anyone I share the project with will be able to understand what’s going on and why it’s built this way. 2) Features:Detail what the project takes in and what the intended out puts should be. If it’s an API detail the call and expected output if it’s a web app follow a trace of how the user progresses through the app. Think of it as a guide on how someone else should use the application. 3) Components:List out the key functions and methods, how they work and how you’ve used them. No need for major details just let people know why it’s important and what you were thinking with it. 4) Closing Statement:Detail what you achieved in making this application. What needs more work and whether you intend to come back and work on anything else. .It’s a good habit to start tracking your projects as you go along even just for your own notes. When you look back at this in 6 months or 2 years are you going to know what you were thinking on April 3rd when you need to fix/plan around a similar issue in the future. The notes.txt file is just for me and I usually put it in the gitignore. It’s helped out in interviews when I was asked to walk through some of my work I’ll pull up my notes file and can quickly find key details on what I was doing and how I did it. I’ve shared my screen to show some of the details or pulled up A specific part of my journal where I figured out a problem. Really helps to have actual example of what you did and how you processed the problem before finding the solution. You can also then say “Well I know about this library now that fixes this for me but I could build it myself again if I needed to”. Very small concept projects or feature test I don’t do this out. It’s only for projects I might show people or a 10 min glance wouldn’t explain what’s going on.

This is connected to the fact, that the frontend is very visual. The backend works on data: You get a request, you react to that request ba returning data of some kind, often after running multiple layers of checks (authentication, authorization) and fetching data from a database.

nlk2ryu,"If you want a course for it, check this out: https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-graphics/the-university-of-california-san-diego-computer-graphics I took it in 2012, and I'm not sure if it's changed much since then, but you basically start off with some simple assignments in OpenGL where they provide skeleton code and you fill in some of the functions, and then work your way up to building a simple ray tracer from scratch that can render various types of scenes. They guide you through the implementation to some degree IIRC, but you write all the code for the ray tracer yourself. The final scene contains nearly ~1million triangles. It's very rewarding once you get each of the projects working since there's a nice visual payoff. I remember it being short (6 weeks?) but a little intense due to the pace, particularly the ray tracer, so make sure you have nights and weekends available to bang your head on the assignments.I think you can audit it for free on edx? not sureIf you find the topic interesting, I would seriously recommend just giving it a go and to not let the idea of the math hold you back. Maybe you'd surprise yourself with how much you can understand and learn as you need it. The lectures all cover the important material, and there are tons of other resources online (plus LLMs) that can give you a major nudge. I think they also have forums for the course where people can answer questions if you get stuck.For the final homework project (write your own simple ray tracer from scratch), IIRC there were about 7 scenes, where the final scene was by far the most complex and could take quite a few hours to render if not using any optimizations. All the other scenes help you know you're on the right track and that your final scene will likely succeed. The final scene is basically just a stress test. Some things that can majorly help:* use OpenMP to trivially add parallelization to the render loop. Ray tracing is considered ""embarrassingly parallel"" as all the work done to render each pixel's final color value is independent. This is a free win that will make the render go faster with hardly any work on your part. If your machine has 8 cores, this could give you ~8x speedup. IIRC this only required adding a single #pragma above the outer render loop, like this (and installing openmp if needed, and adding an `#include ` somewhere): #pragma omp parallel for collapse(2) for (int i = 0; i < height; i++) { for (int j = 0; j < width; j++) {* restrict the rendered region down to a small square (e.g. add a conditional inside your render loop, to only process pixels within a certain region). You could also disable reflections.* bonus: use a space partitioning data structure to eliminate a ridiculous amount of unnecessary intersection tests that each pixel's ray otherwise has to perform. I forget if the course went into any detail on this or just left it 100% as an optional exercise. Anyway, instead of each ray performing an intersection test against all ~1M triangles only to find that for the vast majority there's no intersection at all (wasting a huge amount of time), the space partitioning structure will chop the number of intersection tests per ray down from ~1M to ~50 (~20,000x speedup). If you got all the other scenes working, there's a high chance the final scene will render just fine and you don't really need this optimization to finish the course. But it's a nice optional addon you could try doing once the course is over.At first I did none of those things, and I saw the scene was taking forever to render. I think I added some logging on every Nth iteration to get a sense of progress, and it would have taken at least 15+ hours, possibly much more (can't remember). So adding OpenMP made it only take ~3-5 hours or something, and at that point I figured that was good enough and I walked away and let it finish running. Space partitioning would have been nice to add but I didn't have time, and wasn't required. Also, I was using a 2012 intel macbook with 2 cores, so YMMV significantly with a more recent machine with more (and faster) CPU cores.",SoSpongyAndBruised,2025-10-26 22:49:19,3,learnprogramming,t1_nli9fba,False,

nknw7tp,"I think what you're being confused by is a special feature of unions in C++. When you declare a union starting with a simply typed field like an integer (or an enum, which is just integer values you that have certain names), or multiple such fields at the start of a union, C++ treats then as the ""Common Initial Sequence"" of the union. What that means is that the compiler assumes that all the struct union member types that follow, such as, say, SDL\_WindowEvent, SDL\_KeyboardEvent, and others -- that all of those structs themselves start with those fields/types. If your SDL\_Event event union is in a variable e, it lets you write e.type as a shorthand. What that actually means is ""no matter which member type (SDL\_WindowEvent, SDL\_KeyboardEvent, etc.) I'm currently interpreting my union variable as, I know it starts with an enum SDL\_EventType value (because I've arranged it so all the union struct types start with that field), so just interpret the first four bytes of this variable as the type.""I think (?) when you say 'shouldn't it be e.SDL\_EventType == SDL\_QUIT', what you mean is, 'when I access things from a union, I always have to specify which sub-type I'm thinking about the union as at that moment, so I expect to see e.SDL\_EventType or something like that, just like I would write e.SDL\_WindowEvent.whatever, and I shouldn't be able to access any field directly as e.type"". But you can because of this Common Initial Sequence convenience C++ gives you.On the other hand, if your question really is just about how enums work: An enum is just a way of telling the compiler that certain symbols stand for certain integer values. So when SDL defines the SDL\_EventType, one of the values in there is SDL\_QUIT, which is assigned some particular value (like 5 or whatever) by the enum. Your intuition is right that it's kind of more ""proper"" to refer to that value as something like SDL\_EventType.SDL\_QUIT (i.e., the SDL\_QUIT value as defined by the SDL\_EventType enum. But C/C++ let you just say SDL\_QUIT and it knows that by that you mean 5. It doesn't make sense to say e.SDL\_EventType because that's trying to refer to a field of e using a enum \*type\*. The actual field e is an integer, so it has values like SDL\_QUIT or other enum values defined by SDL\_EventType.",Immediate-Top-6814,2025-10-21 20:31:56,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ocmu53,False,

The first member of the `SDL_Event` union is `UInt32 type;`, followed by a bunch of members of various struct types.Each of those structs must also begin with a `UInt32` so that they share the common initial sequence.

From memory, these are drawn on the UML diagram using solid or dashed lines.The 'has a' relationship can also be of differing types, for example 'one to one', 'one to many', 'many to many' etc. Again, from memory, these can be captured on the UML diagram using circles, triangles and other symbols.The UML is just simple diagram that allows the OOD to be captured on a piece of paper. That is all there is to it.The harder part is learning the OOD itself, but that too is not overly complicated as it is about things like attributes, visibility, methods, abstractions, encapsulation, relationships, polymorphism etc.**EDIT**: I used properties in my description.

Also, that ""stereotypical technical person"" who just has it in their blood? Thats mostly a myth. Sure, some people might seem more natural at it, but honestly most of us are just googling stuff and figuring it out as we go.

It's switching your tools to revisit a concept you're comfortable with. Your issue isn't needing a new language or framework, but to continue down a singular path, even when it gets difficult. That will expose your weaknesses. Only then can you see them for what they are and improve upon them. I'm a beginner, so I don't have any meaningful advice regarding what to do next, though. .Perhaps search up ""github (insert text here)"" repos that can help you get more project experience. Things like ""project based learning, how to build x, app ideas, beginner projects, intermediate projects.""As you go through them, think of how you'd do things differently and do it. Think of an idea or two you can add, and attempt it. Think of how you'd add a new feature once you're done and get to starting. Don't copy line by line, but actually learn as you're interacting with them. if you can't do anything but copy line by line, then pause at certain points and see if you can recreate everything from scratch up to that point. If you can't remember, keep going through it until you can memorize it and understand why things are happening the way they are. Then, see if you can make small changes at this point.Get familiar with how they break down these big and difficult topics, then try to do so yourself with your own ideas. The moment you hit a roadblock trying to break it down, don't run away from it. Instead, confront it. What's the issue? Is it still too hard to code when you broke it down? You can't think of any other way to break it down or even start to break an idea down?That's a sign you need to research how others break down their ideas. Usually, when that wall is hit, it's a sign of a lack of knowledge on the subject. You can watch videos, read articles, check out docs, or follow a tutorial or lesson on that specific thing. Then, when you know enough about it, break it down more. When you break those things down but hit an early wall, repeat the process. Do this enough times until you get to a stage where you can build something yourself (or can follow a tutorial to build that sub idea).

No matter ... We'll just pretend that you are a skilled painter.Now imagine that someone comes up to you, saying: ""How to I get better at drawing? I'm not very artistic, but I like to think very logical, and my goal in drawing is to simply be able to make these drawings I see street-artists do, where a few simple lines suddenly resemble a duck or an elephant! I want to try those challenges and overtime get better at it!""How would you react, what would you tell them? I'd imagine that you'd get somewhat angry, tellin them that isn't what drawing is about, that is just learning some basic shapes and strokes, and repeating them over and over again, following a pattern like a robot! No, if they want to learn drawing, they should start by watching the world around them, note how light and shadows move, make sketches, thousands of sketches, practice, imagine, dream and practice over and over, not trying to copy those ""hack artists!""Because that is what leetcode and the rest is - it isn't about programming, it is about knowing and memorizing patterns for solutions to specific problems. There isn't even any problem solving involved - surely, you might be able to ""invent"" an algorithm that solves that particular problem, but that isn't what most people do, they just know of the correct algorithm to apply. And the only way of knowing, it to have been exposed to a large number of algorithms, and remembering (or being good at looking them up). Something an AI like ChatGPT is extremely good at - but still, it isn't really programming, just like drawing a ""remembered shape"" isn't really drawing. If that is still your goal, then you simply need to learn all the algorithms and remember them - it is boring stuff, and absolutely useless, but it can be done, and is done by a lot of over-eager students around the world. Just go through every article in this list: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Data\_structures\_and\_algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Data_structures_and_algorithms) \- read and implement every one - then you'll quickly see that most leetcode problems is similar to one of those.If however you would like to learn to program, and actually solve real problems, then look at your program like you would look at creating a piece of art. Imagine the finished piece in your mind, begin with the rough sketches, implement some ideas, research parts you need to know more about, and gradually work your way towards the goal.

nlo3nrb,"I have some weird semi-related experiences to this actually.At one of my jobs, we hired a new grad who had launched a very successful app in their home country. It probably didn't help him get the initial interview, since I think that was more about the fact that we were recruiting at his school, but it definitely helped him stand out during the interview process. When we were in discussions about the new grad class, that project was mentioned often and certainly kept him above the fold. It should be noted that he had to pass the interview solely on technical merits.One side point with this is that he was extremely difficult to work with because of this. He kept mentioning how he had built an app with thousands of users so he knew what he was talking about. We were building a company at petabyte scale with millions of users, so his experience was not particularly applicable. Not saying that you're like this, but it's something to be aware of. It shows that you're a go-getter and good at figuring things out, which are important qualities of a great SWE, but a SWE role at a big company is an entirely different skill set than a successful app builder.On the other side of the coin, I was able to land my first internship through a successful project. The thing that made my experience different from yours is that our app had very few users but a ton of publicity (it was kind of a wacky idea). This helped recruiters find us. All of the members of our team landed internships by responding to social media posts about our project. I also think that the companies liked the marketing aspect of ""look at these fun young founders working for OUR company.""In short, I think having a successful project is great during an interview, but having a highly publicized project is better for getting your foot in the door.",NeitherOfEither,2025-10-27 16:04:18,8,cscareerquestions,t3_1ohffgc,False,

nlfhcby,"Unionizing is a great idea but unfortunately there are problems with this idea that in my opinion this will exacerbate the problem. First and foremost, if software devs unionize then it will give the companies a golden opportunity to push for more AI and outsourcing. Simply because the people here are complaining about work hours, pay but hey over there in this other country we can abuse the living shit out of people and our operating costs are lower.Secondly, software developer position is highly dependent on the thing/service the company is trying to make. For example, a person sitting in pakistan or india can make the same website/app that any person any american software developer can make. Moreover, these people will bend over backwards to adjust to the american demand. Thirdly, unions will demoralize and depress the high salaries one can find in tech companies. Again, for example pilots in air canada are paid bonkers and the union has to constantly fight against the corporation to hold a bargain. Fourthly, the supply of software engineers is slightly higher than the demand at the current moment. This will overall negatively impact the strength of the movement. A new grad software developer doesn't have the leverage to bargain for higher salary because of inexperience.This is however, not the end. If you want, push the law makers and politicians, collective force to lobby the government into taxing the companies which outsource or use more AI. The way I see the current problem in software industry is that, the big players want to cash in on the AI demand, the mid level companies are trying to make a product which will earn them the attention from big companies. The government is only interested in sucking rich peoples' cocks. There is nothing to stand in the way.Other commenter u/dontping mentioned some other pathways, which are viable but they demand more time and effort than the current market is willing to deploy.

The pay is also good state dependent, I made about 70k year 1, year 2 I was close to 6 figures, and the next several years I was ~120-200k depending on overtime and how much I wanted to work.The negatives: you often get shit work days (weekends, nights), poor pto, work holidays, work in hazardous environments, it’s hard on your body, and you work with people who HR would have a meltdown if they heard for 5 minutes (gay jokes, teasing you, political talk, stuff some aren’t comfortable with I didn’t mind but I’ve seen several people quit a week or 2 in over it).

And good bosses keep their own backlog of these things ready for these low periods.Tech work is not as transactional as some other careers. The value generated by good engineers compounds with time as they improve their skills and understand the domain better.

Don't let them flounder and meander if they obviously don't know, just move the conversation on. You only have a set amount of time to figure this person out.2. Let them show you what they do know and let them go into depth about it. If they have a project or past work experience this is a good place to start, ask them what they did, what decisions they made and if they might change those decisions in hindsight. 3. Have prepared questions. This doesn't mean a script but you need to be able to move the conversation on if it gets stuck. Hopefully your company has good enough practices the topics for your interview are defined, but if they aren't you should know what skills/tech/aptitudes are important for your job since ideally you have them.4. You aren't trying to trick them, too many interviewers do this where they will ask a misleading question to see if the candidate just takes the bait. The problem is candidates are nervous and will always be hesitant to disagree with the interviewer. Keep questions straightforward and open ended. 5. My most important advice especially if you are an early round interview, you aren't trying to find the number 1 candidate. You are trying to avoid the bottom 90 candidates.

You have to just forget those who passed on you and keep looking for a job that will fit. Also, don't assume people are spending a lot of time doing a really personalized candidate tracking process.

Don't panic they're easier than most people think. The easy level questions shoudln't be too hard, go through 20-30 of them to see what sorts of questions you'll be asked. But before moving to medium or hard, first learn DS/A. Data Structures and Algorithms is what Leetcode is there to test (not entirely, but basically). Most jobs will almost never need it, but really complex problems solved at scale (think Google Map's directions handling hundreds of millions of requests a minute) do, so Google started using these questions to test their recruits and the rest of the industry couldn't be bothered to make their own interviews, so now we all have to answer them. This youtube channel has some great lessons on how DSA/Leetcode all works:https://www.youtube.com/@mycodeschoolThey don't cover every element of DSA but do cover the most common. Either watch a video, then go to neetcode.io and practice the questions related to that video, or get a question on neetcode.io, look at the answers, then go find the videos that cover the answers and watch the video and then learn how and why the answers work. Sorry if that's unclear, my point is don't sit and try to ""learn"" how to answer leetcode questiosn on your own, lots of them are not ""intuitive"" and you will only get annoyed. It's much simpler to understand the question, then find the answer soemone else already fine tuned and learn that. If you want to fix a car, you don't just go smashing on things and see what happens, you get the manual. For leetcode, DSA and neetcode.io togehter, are your manual. And no, you don't need to pay for neetcode.io for it to be incredibly useful, you get better organization if you pay, but it's all still very usable for free. Though I will say, its' a pretty useful site, so I did end up paying, but I actually got the lifetime membership after I got my job and had some money coming it.

These companies are huge with around 100k employees so it’s impossible to have widespread cultural changes quickly). Baked into the agile process is the decoupling from requirements driving code and moving towards user stories. By the book agile means that every user story has an acceptance criteria which resembles a unit test. This means teams (again, not everywhere but it is slowly propagating as a culture) perform test driven development where they inherently do red-green-refactor. Built in the development process, devs usually are presented a failing TDD/BDD style acceptance criteria to get started (red), they write just enough code to pass the test (green), and they (refactor) the code with the safety of the tests performing safe operations from Fowler’s refactoring book that may use GoF patterns. Some teams have a senior engineer or software architect that write user stories or tests that explicitly force software into a particular architecture or forces a design pattern in order to be implementable. So yes, we do refactor but it’s baked into the process. Code doesn’t break because it is common to have projects have a strict requirement for 80-100% test coverage. Unit testing is just one level.

nkm50cz,">just so you can have easier life with maintainingYou're dismissing the value of refactoring... it's not so I can have an ""easier life"", although that can be a side effect. The goal of refactoring is to make the system easier to extend, update, and understand.When you have a brittle system, actual feature changes are significantly more likely to break production.When you have a difficult to extend system, seemingly simple feature changes can take months (or years!) to complete, costing the company tons of money and time.When you have a difficult to understand system, your employees because a single point of failure. When one person leaves the company, now you have to find their replacement or else the project timeline gets delayed by several more months. But when the system itself is cryptic and difficult to understand/modify, it takes significantly more time to onboard a new employee, easily resulting in a year+ of lost productivity. That high onboard cost can often get teams into a situation where *all* their developers leave, and now you have a fresh team of people that don't understand the codebase. This is how ""black boxes"" get created, by not refactoring combined with turnover.All this kinda plays into retention, which exacerbates everything. A complex, brittle, difficult to work with, system is *not* pleasant to work on. If management has no interest in letting the SWE's improve that system, then those SWE's won't be staying at that company for very long. High turnover introduces new developers, who are significantly more likely to break prod, while also having a very long and expensive onboarding process.So yeah, in critical areas, you *need* to refactor. The costs of not doing it aren't always immediate, but it's significantly more dangerous than not refactoring at all. Any halfway competent engineering manager will be going to bat for their SWE's to refactor against product and upper management. This is the balance of a healthy SWE team. Product is pushing for features, upper management is pushing for results/money, engineering management is pushing for a stable/maintainable/extendable codebase. If either of those 3 prongs get an inordinate say, you're on a toxic team.That said, there are very well defined approaches to refactoring a legacy codebase. Writing a massive PR with +10000/-12000 isn't the way to do it. That's a high risk PR whether it's a refactor or a new feature.

Feeling trapped between financial obligations, career dissatisfaction, and the loyalty you feel towards your team, especially with such significant projects on the horizon, must be incredibly isolating. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when facing such critical decisions, particularly when they involve your health, your peace of mind, and your ability to start a family. When you're dealing with such frequent panic attacks and the daily drain of a job you dislike, it's natural for your brain to feel like it's in overdrive, making it hard to see a clear path forward. Prioritizing your mental health is never a sacrifice; it's an investment in every other aspect of your life, especially when you're considering bringing a child into the world. It might be helpful to explore different ways to manage the acute symptoms of anxiety, especially since your current medication situation is changing. Sometimes just having a toolkit of techniques can make a big difference in those overwhelming moments. There's a free [podcast](https://youtu.be/72ZhaR-aWNI) that covers common anxiety symptoms, coping strategies, breathing exercises, and techniques for controlling panic attacks, which you might find useful to listen to in your own time as you navigate these challenges.

nl3aos6,"It's a matter of picking your battles. In my experience ""clean code"" is very much in the eye of the beholder and is more a matter of whether the author and the reader are on the same page rather than any objective superiority of any particular method of coding. Just like any other sort of writing. There are of course some general principles that tend to make things better, and it is certainly possible to make *horribly unclear* code, but past a certain point a lot of it really is a matter of taste.So essentially a person who has strong opinions about specific details of how code should be written is similar to a person who thinks their preferred genre of music is superior to others, or otherwise thinks their taste is superior -- they are wrong, but it's going to be very difficult to convince them of that, and the more persuasive you are the more they will probably dig in and get pissed at you.So you'll need to decide which things *you* care about and which things you don't. If you don't actually care about something, just go along with what they want and smile and nod anytime they try to justify it, content that they're trying to justify it to themselves as much as to you.If you do care, really think again about whether you actually do care. Lots of people don't actually care about things they fight for but rather let ego get tied up in it and are instead fighting over ego. Try to avoid that if possible. So really think about whether you genuinely do care.And if you genuinely do, try to act in good faith. Explain what you think, then invite them to explain what they think and walk you through their thought process and be genuinely open to it. They might actually have good reasons, and so *you* should be open to changing *your* mind. But inviting them to explain will both make them feel like they are valued (which is important to them if they have strong opinions about how the code should be written) and also let them talk themselves out of ideas that are bad (like, if you explain a good idea and ask them to explain theirs, they will have a hard time denying yours is better if they actually have to explain it, and because it is them talking it through and deciding they will be more likely to compromise than if you order them to).Inviting them to explain also gets both of you on the same side -- rather than arguing you are instead both looking at the same problem and talking about it as a thing separate from yourselves. And that change in perspective is helpful -- it makes them feel less like *they* are being devalued if their ideas aren't used.In my experience, most workers do ultimately want to get along and do good stuff, and if you can diffuse their defense mechanisms and avoid getting defensive yourself you can usually find a common ground.But if a person truly is an asshole and can't be reasoned with and truly is my way or the high way, and you really do care about the thing they're digging in on, your best bet is probably to try to go around them. Build support for others / get others to validate your view. After all, if the person is an asshole to you then they have probably been an asshole to others as well, and so you probably will find support.

You're bouncing from ego to ego of the full time teaching staff that have never been in the private sector, but are charged in preparing you for it. I wrote essays on the ""Browser Wars,"" traced some algorithms, tried out some new programming languages, but NOTHING from college prepared me better for my fulltime career. I actually did a bootcamp for the time that I had my degree, yoe and still couldn't get interviews because my history was in legacy systems (COBOL + Mainframe). So everyone reading those COBOL developers are drowning in offers, just know that's a very hurtful clickbait lol. But the bootcamp gave me a full stack experience that tripled anything of value from college, since we used a template of Flask. That bootcamp gave me 90% of my modern view of development work. I started working personal projects until I got hired to do API work. There's nothing of any value from my undergrad degree. I answer these because I'm a contrast for some of your worldview. I experienced it in the weird oddball way that OP highlighted. I broke into the career, then got my degree, then continued my career. Calc 2 and 3 didn't make me a better developer, it made me better at test taking and studying.

I was working in procedural languages, so I got an OOP lesson, which was neat, and I probably had the best OOP professor who added in how he uses it practically which is what many of my classes taught by academics were missing. My electives were taught by academics and did not help me apply much of my core studies. A bioninformatics class had given me hope, but the teacher just read from the book and power points and we had a 3-4 week intro to what bioinformatics is and the tools used before getting our hands on anything. My DevOps class opened where the professor asked us ""What is DevOps,"" and started taking notes and building that syllabus on the first day. We didn't touch git until our software engineering final group project and most of the class couldn't figure it out.

An acquaintance of mine ended up doing front desk at a hospital after trying to pivot around.If I'm a hiring manager hiring for Vue I don't necessarily care if you know React or Java or anything else. Casting a wide net for a job search makes sense if you have a broad transferable skillset, but if you're already somewhat niche with something like Vue, it might make sense to just go deeper in the niche since the pool of qualified applicants also tends to shrink the more niche you go, since depth isn't as easy to acquire due to paretto principle.",lhorie,2025-10-24 16:23:47,13,cscareerquestions,t3_1of0yyo,False,

nl6ix14,"I feel for you. My team recently laid off a new mom after her maternity leave for ""performance"" (the company was not performing well and pushed everyone to work longer hours which she did not do) and it felt very scummy.I feel like you have 3 routes you can go. The first is to find a job at a company that has a relaxed WLB. That's hard to do on command, at any company, in any role. Historically the best option has been government work, which right now is more volatile than it has been in the past. When I've seen this work out for people in the private sector, the situation is usually that they got hired into a ""boring"" company that doesn't pay particularly well, and they stayed long enough that they're performing well and worth more in the market vs. their current job so therefore they have the leverage to push for a great WLB. This isn't your situation. So if you can find a company like this, great! But I wouldn't bet the house on it.Option two is to accept that you're going to end up working longer hours than you want to for a while. I don't think it actually matters whether you stay in software or pivot to sales, PM, solutions engineering, or recruiting (which are the most common pivot options). Those may be more people oriented and may be a better fit if that's what you want in a job, but you aren't necessarily more likely to stay employed, or have an easier time finding work. This is kind of the time where leaning on family for help with the kid is going to make a big difference.Option three is to take a few years off until the kid is in school.",flamingtoastjpn,2025-10-24 18:32:25,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1of0yyo,False,

As you scale you gain more leverage to incentivize companies/clients to implement their own pre-processing (or provide as a paid service) to gain access to your tool.

For example, I'm a big fan of step builder pattern in the main language I use ( Rust ). Why? It's pretty ergonomic and it makes it so invalidly using the API is a compiler error rather than a runtime error.

Nothing about design patterns makes you're code A) correct or B) performant, and most the time you end up taking what was a really simple problem and making it wayyyyy over engineered and over abstracted. The worst is when people go to build out something and they start with a design pattern in mind that they want to use and the first implementation is driven by that pattern, rather than the actual problem that needs to get solved. Outside of stuff prescribed by a frameworks, starting with a pattern is a terrible idea, you have no idea what functioning code will look like and even worse, you have no idea if a pattern is even necessary for what you are trying to accomplish. Depending on what patterns you are even using, you may actually be affecting the compilers ability to optimize the instruction set because it can't reason about the amount of misdirection you have introduced into the code.I'm not saying there is never a use case for design patterns, but more often than not, if you just keep it simple and straight forward, your life will be easier.

nlizfst,"You’re not a fraud. You got a CS degree and that is a testament to your knowledge and ability to learn and grow in this field.I don’t know what companies are looking for with respect to new grads these days. It used to be the case that companies hired knowing you had zero experience but the capacity to learn and grow into the role. These days, since there’s so many new grad applicants, the bar for hiring has been raised and so you’ll need to improve your resume to get interviews and improve your interview skills to increase the odds of performing well.Think of it as levels in a game, you'll want to focus your energy on one level at a time (more or less). Since you're not landing interviews, this the first level to pass. Get constant feedback on your resume. You should be iterating on it — share it with friends or redditors to get feedback, make improvements, and send it out to companies (job boards, networking, etc). If you get callbacks, this means your resume is good enough. If not, keep doing that iterative feedback loop until you do. Once you feel you're landing interviews a bit more consistently, then you'll need to focus on the interview rounds. I don't really know what that entails for new grads, but you seem to be on the right track. Practicing leetcode as a way to prove your understanding of DSA is good. Working on personal projects is also good. Keep track of what problems you encounter and what you did to solve them, and be able to communicate that. They don't expect you to be an expert, just want to know how you think and tackle problems. It's great that you're focusing on infra and LLM projects btw. There's no right or wrong path here, the field is too broad so it's best to do what you're interested in because enjoyment is a crucial recipe for making progress and preventing burnout. It's better to have some depth here rather than shallow breadth. It really sucks that this is the market you’re graduating into, but you’re definitely not a fraud, and you're definitely not alone in this experience.

Once you get there, find out what you need to know for your team's projects and tech stack. Go from there.I didn't have AI to help me when I started, but I think AI makes it way easier to learn quickly nowadays. Use it to understand the code base. Like if you need to modify a part of something in the codebase, use AI to find where the code is and understand what patterns this codebase use and get suggestions.Need to build something from scratch? Use AI to quickly understand parts of the tech stack you don't understand. Feed it documentation and ask questions. Clarify your understanding, but be skeptical about what it tells you. ask it to confirm, ask it for direct reference sin the documentation if you're unsure.I don't really know what's best for a junior in this era of AI-assisted tools.

nlj368s,"The problem with academic programming in school is that business has an entirely different set of needs, tools and development processes. As a junior-level person, you're not expected to know all that stuff. There are a couple of exceptions to this rule -- startups frequently expect new grads to know as much and be able to perform at the level a senior with full implementation level knowledge of their tech stack in the first week. FAANGs might also have higher expectations and be more unforgiving as well, depending on the FAANG.Larger corporations that aren't FAANG will generally have well established IT groups who can offer a decent level of mentorship. Maybe focus on trying to find a spot at one of those.The more you know in general the better. Being able to set up docker instances and CI/CD pipelines is a pretty good skill to have, even if you don't find devops particularly interesting. You might even want to go look at hashicorp's terraform and tools like that, that allow you to stand up a huge amount of infrastructure with the wave of a hand. I don't particularly care for terraform's configuration, would much rather do it in python, but it's still a pretty neat tool and a good one to have in your toolbox. You are very much building out a toolbox now, and it's good to know the things you have at your disposal.I wouldn't suggest coding directly with AI. There are a couple reasons for that and your instincts are good that if you just blindly copy and paste AI code, you're not really going to learn anything. Poke at the problem a bit and use the AI for inspiration. If it writes code for you, try to read and understand it and possibly even rearrange it a bit. Rather than ""Write some code to do X"", focus on ""How do I do X"" and try to understand the underlying concepts.Also, relax! Back in the 80's when I was getting started, there was already way more to know about this field than any single person could know. Math has been like that since Isaac Newton's day -- before him, one single person could know everything there was to know about math. He gave us the map to an infinite landscape. Programming is similar, an infinite landscape of the mind. Don't try to understand it all at once and accept that there will be things you couldn't have even imagined were out there. Maybe you'll even invent one of them one day!Got a couple of funny stories for you if you care to keep reading.Funny story about relaxing: I decided to learn how to skydive when I was in my early 40's. My instructors kept telling me to relax. And I was all like ""I'M ABOUT TO JUMP OUT OF AN AIRPLANE! I AM NOT GOING TO RELAX!"" A few months later I went to the indoor skydiving wind tunnel and told my instructor I just wanted to mess around today and not focus on learning anything. As soon as I hit the wind I felt my whole body relax and I realized that *I'd never done that before!* And I flew so well that day. And knowing how to relax, my driving (which I'd been doing for ~30 years at that point) immediately improved as well. It took a somewhat extreme experience to get me to that point, and it's something I wish I'd learned much earlier in my life.Funny story about people skills: Empathy is a human superpower. We have the ability to think about what another person might be thinking and feeling and act on how we think they're feeling. Hone that power to a fine edge and it's as close to telepathy as we're gonna get. At some point along the way, I found that while reading code, I could get a sense of how well the programmer who wrote it understood the requirements and even their mood and how they were feeling when they wrote the code. It's weird when it happens.So back in the poker craze of the early 2000s there were a bunch of guys around who'd go to bars and set up tables to run free poker tournaments. They'd arrange to get a small kickback from the bar for each customer they brought in. I got laid off from a company I was working for at the time so I started frequenting these tournaments, as they were free to enter and usually offered a free $30 bar tab to the winner of the tournament. I could pick up one or two of those a week and get one or two halfway decent meals out of them. Playing poker taught me to look at people. I can't read people as well as I can read code, but the first time I knew what a guy's hand was just from watching him while he was thinking about betting, I felt like a sorcerer.So learn what you can about computers, but also learn what you can about yourself and the species you belong to.

nlmwx0e,"You need to understand that their request for changes has more to do with them trying to justify their position in the company than actual usability. By developing it yourself, you've just demonstrated to everyone that no one really needs them to develop internal apps. In the future, I'd consider bringing one of them early in and showing them early prototypes - if you want to be more strategic about it and know what they like/don't like, you can create decoy features which you know they will insist on removing, just so that they have an illusion of power they can use.What I'd do now?\- You can detach yourself emotionally from this by finding an external point of reference in respect to the changes they insist on. For example, instead of saying ""We need native notifications because this is how the system works, and everyone else does it this way"", say - ""If we go this route, we'll have to maintain a home-grown notification system. This will incur an ongoing maintenance cost, and it may be difficult to go back on this decision if we run out of resources"". It helps if you bring up these points with your manager before you speak to them. Tell your manager that you've thought this through and what really matters here is that we ship something the users want, and ship it relatively quickly. \- Show the prototype to users and use their opinion as an anchor point when having discussions. If there's an outcome you don't like, find a relevant data point to support your claim and point them to it. Create a perception that you don't really care either way, but it seems that this is what the users want. \- If you can, roll it out to some beta testers and gather feedback to strenghten the above point. \- If you can provide numeric data to support your claims, that will have a much stronger effect than anything above - if you can say 9 out of 10 users want regular sized widgets, then there's not much to talk about. \- Speak with your manager and try to get him to buy into the following narrative: ""we've already spent so much time on this, our users need this ASAP, they love the design, so let's just roll it out and spend the remainder of the time on this project adjusting it to their liking"".It's important to create a perception of being detached emotionally from it, this will bring their guard down.",jasiek83,2025-10-27 12:10:50,0,cscareerquestions,t3_1oh99n8,False,

nlmzzg5,yeah that's the problem we actively TRIED for months to get them to weigh in on the design as I was writing it. Crickets until I had pretty much solidified the final design and was working on individual OS tweaksI really didn't and don't have any emotional attachment to it. That being said I absolutely will not abide you insulting my intelligence. At one point (in the debate over the notifications) they actually sent me a link to one of the first things that pops up on Google with the gall to say why don't you try this? No I'm so glad you were able to take the time in between your expert UI design to educate me on the options I have for scheduling notifications. I can't believe I didn't already explore it and 3 other potential options discarding them all for various reasons.This is far from my first rodeo I'm well versed in the art of spinning things to sell them to people this is just the first in almost 30 years of working professionally that I've had a group this petulant and stubborn about the aesthetics over literally everything else.As for my manager helping that would have been nice but I'm at least glad I know now he never had my back and never will so I can plan and work accordingly.,TofuBug40,2025-10-27 12:31:37,0,cscareerquestions,t1_nlmwx0e,True,

This is just the first time I can remember a work project not just taking so much of my joy but replacing it with a seething amount of resentment. I know its mostly my leadership absolutely not having my back at all that gets me the most. I've made a good career out of writing software FOR incompetent coworkers that runs well despite their natural tendencies so the UET might be HIGHLY annoying but they are workable. I've worked with leadership in the past that I thought was really antagonistic to my ideas and approaches but was always able to win them over with a combination of showing instead of telling and a solid reputation of being the guy you go to for apps that you don't have to think about using and rarely if ever broke. I've never had one outright make sure I had paid to ride the bus before running me over with it. Got hit again this morning with another ""How was your weekend?"" twice really when I ignored it the first time and asked what he wanted. I just can't stomach that kind of person. I can absolutely work with someone like that but there will be no idle chat or getting to know you.

nlponu3,"There are a couple of ways to deal with this.One is to find a new job. I've seen good work environments turn bad, but poor work environments usually don't turn around. Don't expect your current job to get better.If you don't mind getting fired, you can start pushing back and calling them out when they're stupid. I usually avoid confrontation, and would just quietly start working for a new job.For example, at one job, someone started yelling at me over the phone because the website was down for an hour. I just hung up on him. Surprisingly, everyone knew he was an asshole and nobody else complained.The other is to just do your best to humor them, try and meet their crazy demands.
