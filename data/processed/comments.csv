No backups either, and he thought backups were an extra expense we didn't need.2. Stored patient phone numbers and zip codes as numbers, dropping all leading zeroes for about four months' data until he put that into a reporting table and freaked out about why so many rows were wrong.3. After fixing the phone number issue, he decided to use phone numbers as a patient table's primary key, 4. This is my all-time favorite: he put unhashed SSNs in a table that was fed into Tableau, so that all of our practice administrators could see the SSNs of all the patients across all of our practices. *Huge* security issue.5.

I used Kafka to stream each static dataset which was in a CSV format, while also collecting and performing feature engineering using Spark Streaming in realtime, passing it to a pre trained ML model that simulated classification in realtime. You can stream that data using Kafka, no memory issues, Spark streaming can handle all the known formatting issues, the ones that are not anticipated, can be sent into dead letter queues using Kafka. Then, at the end look at that data to understand why it failed, put all the newer checks and run an iteration again on those failed records.

You could do everything right as far as schema to schema and wind up with the destination enterprise software handling the end result poorly due to rules represented outside the schema (or api) definitions.

na38mnq,"# My Personal ExperienceI've had the fortune of working on a complex Big Data project that gave me hands-on experience with the exact technologies the market is looking for today. This experience was a catalyst for my professional growth.In that role, **PySpark** was our main framework. We used it to build scalable ETL/ELT pipelines capable of processing massive datasets efficiently. For orchestration, we relied on **Apache Airflow**, which was a game-changer for automating and monitoring our data workflows.To manage our code and documentation, we used **GitHub** and **GitLab**. This ensured that our development process was organized, collaborative, and easy to track. For data analysis and validation, I used **Hue** to run queries and visualize data directly on our Hadoop cluster. And for database administration, **DBeaver** was my go-to tool for managing both **MySQL** and **Oracle** environments.This exposure to a modern, integrated tech stack was invaluable. It not only deepened my technical skills but also prepared me for the demands of the current job market.# > Is It a Bad Career Choice to Stay?Yes, in terms of professional growth, it absolutely is. Your current role is a maintenance position that doesn't challenge you or equip you with the skills needed to be competitive in the modern data engineering field. You're not building new solutions or working with the tools that most companies are using.# > Would You Take a Pay Cut to Leave This Situation?Yes, I would. A pay cut is not a loss; it's an investment in your future. Accepting a lower-paying job that uses modern technologies will significantly increase your market value in a few years. Think of it this way: a small short-term loss in salary could lead to a much larger long-term gain in earning potential.Given that you're in your early 30s, you have plenty of time to pivot. Use your current low-stress environment to your advantage. Take the time to study and build personal projects using tools like **PySpark**, **Apache Airflow**, and cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure.

na91qth,"Obviously, great work if you did that alone without much DE experience beforehand. I guess a few points to consider:1. How will the pipeline behave if the UI changes on the website you are pulling the data from, or if the website is down or behaving slowly? In my own experience, Selenium is quite limited to basic actions like “wait for page to load” or “wait until the export button appears.” I would assume you, as a BI Analyst, would probably know when the UI change happens since you are closer to the business user. But still, you don’t (at least you have not mentioned it) have any sort of monitoring or alerting and are just relying on everything working smoothly. So I would advise thinking about adding logging and alerts for those cases.2. Again, this kind of follows the second point, but it would probably make sense to add some retry logic when pulling the data if the website is slow on that particular day.3. Raw data is usually pretty fucking bad, and it’s the task of a Data Engineer to make the business see only pretty fucking good data. What I mean by that is: do you have any validation in place to prevent bad data from getting into your Power BI models? You mentioned you are pulling customer data profiles and geolocations, and this kind of data is soooo easy to get messed up - it’s insane. For example, postal codes being bad, or missing pieces of an address, like the street being available but not the city, etc. So I would think about adding some sort of validation for your data, if it’s not already part of the transformations you are doing.4. You are pulling the Excel files, applying and saving them, and then reading them and saving as parquet. Why? Literally, no offense, but why? You have two versions of the same file in different file formats stored. I would probably store the raw Excel files somewhere for archival purposes so that if you need to check the raw data, you don’t need to re-download them. But I would store transformed files directly in parquet to avoid unnecessary reads/writes.5. Create/replace tables is a simple, working strategy, which is cool, but really inefficient for big tables since you have to reload everything. I would suggest checking out `MERGE` or `INSERT...ON CONFLICT` statements for incremental updates so that if a row is unchanged from the previous table version, you don’t need to reload it. Also, I assume your SQL commands look like: `CREATE TABLE t1 AS SELECT * FROM 'file1.parquet';` Which is normal, but I would advise wrapping it in transaction logic. What does this mean? Imagine your tables fail in the middle, and you have 10 tables. Now you are stuck with 5 updated and 5 old tables - sucks, right? To ensure that your group of loading operations is atomic (meaning they either all succeed or all fail together), you must manually wrap them in a transaction block. That way, you know for sure that either all of them were updated, or all of them are in their previous state, but the data is still consistent between them.Again, what you did is really solid, especially for your first time, but maybe my wall of text will help you a bit. I am also open to any comments since I suck at DE and maybe messed up somewhere. Be very proud of what you designed.",Fiarmis,2025-08-23 14:19:02,4,dataengineering,t3_1mxzqt1,False,

It's constant learning, even as an experienced engineer, whenever I switched to a new stack, I needed between one and two years to be proficient at the local stack and the local software. Good engineering managers know that and will mostly expect you to demonstrate that you are proactively learning by asking questions and reaching out to seniors to get help.If you're good at SQL and have some experience with proper software engineering (git), dbt should be easy for you to pick up in a couple of weeks. Just follow their guides and best practices to make sure you use it correctly and in a way that is easy to follow by another dbt user. Snowflake is probably the best hands-off OLAP distributed database, if you're good at SQL, there should be no difficulty. As with any data processing tool, the key is to focus on their documentation about optimizing query performance (partitioning, clustering...).So, the learning is not going to be a problem, I think the hardest is going to be passing the selection in the current market.",sib_n,2025-08-19 03:37:57,6,dataengineering,t3_1mtws1v,False,

na40liw,"I’d treat it like a slow crawl with state. Do one pass to get the roster of IDs, store that set, then on each poll diff the set to find new and missing IDs.Here are a few things that worked for me in the past on similar issues: For updates, fetch in batches but avoid refetching everything every time. Keep a raw bronze table of the exact JSON per employee keyed by employee_id plus poll_time and a content_hash. If the hash changed since last poll, mark it changed and upsert into your modeled tables. If an ID disappears from the roster for a few consecutive polls, tombstone it. Add last_fetched_at and last_changed_at in your modeled table, and keep headers like ETag or Last Modified if the API gives them.Start with a tiny script using requests plus a small state store in Postgres (or just a json file), and land raw to object storage or DuckDB. Polling is still fine here, but tier it by heuristics. Recently created or recently changed IDs get polled more often, long lived records get sampled less. Backfill can be a manual trigger, then switch to a low frequency poll.

Easiest setup, no need to find duplicates or changed values. Daily rewrite of all employee data shouldn't be too bad. If there are limitations or API is really slow then you can fetch only new employees data daily and all data weekly, for example. You can used ID to figure which employees you already have.Slowest API I'm currently fetching data returns 5000 rows with one query and it takes little less than minute.

Treat S3 as the ""immutable log"", partition by table then ingest date and hour using the Debezium event time ts\_ms, and write Parquet with reasonable file sizes so Redshift can scan fast.In Redshift, instead of the sink, optionally, you can create an external table over staging for cheap ELT, then build a deduped view or table by using row\_number over partition by primary key ordered by ts and the Debezium op so you keep the latest non delete.If you need a current table for BI, schedule a merge from that deduped view into a skinny current table with sort key on the primary key and updated\_at. This avoids constant vacuum churn from doing small upserts, and you still get perf. If you need point in time queries, keep the bronze and build a silver that is deduped by key and day.Do you need only latest or point in time? Do deletes happen a lot or rare? How big are the hot tables and what is the 95p change rate?If you opt for the ""zero-ETL"" approach, for organization, keep your data in S3 partitioned like `s3://your-bucket/db_name/table_name/dt=YYYY/MM/DD/hr=HH/`. That layout plays nice with Redshift Spectrum and makes pruning way more effective when you're querying or loading batches. Helps a ton with downstream compaction and dedup too, since you can scope it to a smaller time window instead of scanning everything.Dedup pattern is primary key plus Debezium ts\_ms or source commit lsn, with a tie breaker on op where create beats update beats delete. Partitioning matters for both Spectrum pruning and for batch merge windows, so compact small stuff like five minute files into larger hour files.Alternatively, if you want a no fuss route, Estuary can land CDC into Redshift with append only and handle dedupe and merges cleanly.

I'm probably not following what this subreddit would consider to be best practices, but here's what I did:* Built out a Python ETL platform that allows me to generate pipelines using JSON config files. The pipelines ingest Excel files directly from our local network, transform and clean the data, and pop it into an on-prem SQL Server database. My platform is modular and extensible, so I tend to add/update functionality as needed.* I use dev/test/prod environments in the DB but haven't done bronze/silver/gold layers. Monitoring is manual right now (log files!) but I plan to migrate to Prefect and/or implement some Power BI dashboards that consume my logs.* I avoid manually-managed documentation wherever possible, because that will be the first thing to go out of date. Instead, I'm using JSON schemas and GitHub Actions to automatically generate documentation for my config files on push, and docstrings + pdoc + GitHub Actions to do the same for my codebase. Only manually-maintained documentation is the top-level README for the repo.* Power BI is a star for me. Getting the on-prem gateway running was painful, but I've established dev/test/prod environments where I control access. Users can access the dashboards via Teams or, in some cases, export the semantic models to Excel for further analysis. I'm also using PBIB files so I can manage dev in GitHub.In terms of general approach, I would start slow and be responsive. Full-stack data analysis means you're also your own PM, so be sure to communicate well and be able to justify your choices to stakeholders. Figure out your P0 items that are crucial for what you're building and then go build it. As you work on this, you'll naturally identify new concerns and priorities and be able to respond to those. Having a vision for what you want to do will help you build for the future--for example, I want to manage my configs via a website, so I established JSON schema rules that unlocked automated documentation--but your vision should remain flexible.Good luck!(Edit: Formatting)",Tokyohenjin,2025-08-20 10:36:49,4,dataengineering,t3_1mv97xj,False,

The vector store will bring you the answers, but if you only send the last line the user types, it can be something like ""What flags can I use to format the output?"" It's lacking content.

na8sz29,"You are going about it in a weird way. Go back to your management and convince them to apply the concept of an analytics window. I have worked on this problem multiple times already, most notably with logistics. It’s the same concept with deliveries in that open orders on the last few days of the month will only be closed many days after. My advice is that you get the highest possible time that the order is closed, use that as your window, and only calculate by then. This is similar to intra-day calcs where hourly measures have maybe a window of a few minutes, a variance expectation, and an end-of-day resolution via batch job. As an example: if closing an order takes 4 days maximum like in your case, then calculate your close rate on the morning of the 5th. Basically, you’ve given all open orders from the previous month the appropriate waiting time to close. This way, you can properly report on them already.What of the still open orders by then? Consider them unresolved. This is an analytical tradeoff your management should accept on a monthly basis. If they find this problematic, then do multiple checkpoints: an initial view a day after the month (highest number of open orders), a view after the initial window, i.e. T+5, and a view maybe 2 weeks after. At that point, you should be able to have extreme confidence in your data. Variance should be very low, except in extreme outlier circumstances.If revenue is being tracked using this order system, well… you’re doing it wrong. Or rather your company is doing it wrong. They should be doing that off of your invoice system, not your analytical data. It can be a placeholder, sure, but nothing says money earned as well as money that actually arrived in the bank etc. The best you SHOULD tell your stakeholders is that this is estimated revenue from orders and that it is not indicative of actual money coming in. That is for the finance department to resolve, not yours. You’re a data engineer. And unless your name is Harry, you’re most probably not a wizard either.Overall, your approach can be solved by educating your stakeholder/client/management and reaching a compromise with them.

na518nl,"So the biggest favor you can do for yourself is to think beyond the immediate asks. Good data engineering benefits from a perspective that plants trees you'll probably not enjoy the shade of. Comment your code with intent, explain the reason why you are doing what you are doing in that moment in documentation and note when you are doing the same thing multiple times. When you first start it is often easy to build something that works initially but is ultimately not going to scale or isn't maintainable. Learning from those times helps you think about the bigger picture and understand the true scope of a given ask. Example: the company is recording things in Excel files and they want you to make some of the data available in a consolidated dashboard. You could just grab the specific data/fields from the files and write them to a database then point a dashboard to it. That would fulfill the request but then in 6 months they realize they want other data from those old Excel files and you need to reprocess them again to get the rest of the data. Whereas if at the start you consider the durability of the files and potential future needs vs. Cost of storage you may have taken everything from those files. Then when the ask for more of the data eventually comes you can provide the data in a fraction of the time and you've ensured that everything is backed up in case some accidentally deletes a source file.",Mrbrightside770,2025-08-22 20:50:45,1,dataengineering,t3_1mxhdi4,False,

n9wjhvw,"""Azure Synapse SQL Dedicated and Serverless"", what? You've just used words from different technologies and slapped them together. Fabric offer pretty much nothing that Synapse doesn't - the ""one Lake"" approach is a new feature that dilutes the whole concept of ""single source of truth"". And Fabric doesn't support data flows.Synapse is a solution for enterprise needs, it can be optimised as you'd expect for that level of usage.Fabric is aimed at ""citizen"" developers, e.g. people who operate as individuals and pull reports together from different sources. The one thing fabric genuinely does better than Synapse is allows you to connect to data sources easily. It's not difficult in Synapse, it's just not very intuitive.The easiest way to envision is it: Data Factory does a bunch of legacy operations and support basically everything that on prem does, with no need to rewrite it all. it also offers newer ways of doing things but that's not what makes it useful IMO.Synapse offers true ""PAYG"" data processing which takes the load off your internal systems, and generally will be cheaper than Data Factory but needs a significant rewrite on new technologies (Such as Spark, Python) and a whole new approach to how things are processed. The upside is the power of the servers you can provision is massive, and you only pay for what you use - instead of paying for them 24/7.Fabric offers most of what Synapse does but has a very different interface to Synapse. It also leverages One Lake. The main difference is pricing. In Synapse you need to pay for each resource individually, but in Fabric you pay for ""capacity"" which can range from storage to processing - but it all comes under one payment.The reality is that Synapse is a great product that can operate alongside DF, and both of them utilise each other for specific functions, but Synapse is a whole new world. Fabric is aimed to try and give non technical people ""democratised"" data processing - which is a great idea but functionally is very close to giving someone 15 excel files and hoping they know what they're doing when they copy paste from them all that the data is correct at the end.All of these technologies need a data platform and approach - trying to sell Fabric as ""better"" is just wild. I know MS are pushing it, but having worked with all 3 technologies AND on prem, i can safely say there are more headaches in fabric than the others because it's solving a problem that data engineers didn't need solved.",B1zmark,2025-08-21 14:55:50,0,dataengineering,t1_n9uj8av,False,

n9xw2xi,"As to the first part - no, I'm naming 3 distinct components:* Fabric Warehouse* Azure Synapse Analytics SQL Dedicated Pools* Azure Synapse Analytics SQL Serverless PoolsBelieve it or not, there's one engineering team who built and support all 3.As for the rest - reasonable people can disagree. Yes, you need a data platform in both. But there are genuinely significant improvements in Fabric that aren't in Synapse.Yes, Synapse is a very capable platform. But it's also a challenging platform to use well. Synapse SQL Dedicated Pools make you choose between best performance (storing in its proprietary internal tables) and open formats (external tables). Scaling is offline, and disruptive. And they require a lot of tuning to get good performance out of them. Synapse Serverless SQL pools are better on that front, but have a lot of limitations of their own.I genuinely believe Fabric Warehouse is better than them. It gets rid of that division, and has many, many improvements elsewhere, from provisioning (scaling is online like Synapse Serverless SQL Pools, but faster and more intelligent), query optimization (overhauled and distinct from either Synapse SQL Pool offerings), query execution (improved beyond both previous products), and so on. I have worked on all 3 products, seen the customer experiences on all 3, and that's my honest opinion.Similarly, if you look at Fabric Spark, it has NEE, based on Gluten and Velox, to improve performance and lower costs:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/native-execution-engine-overview?tabs=sparksqlNote that Fabric Spark has a pay as you go billing option:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/autoscale-billing-for-spark-overviewThere have been discussions about expanding that to other workloads where it makes sense, but that's a question for PMs rather than me.Feature development is focused on Fabric these days, so the engines in Fabric will continue to improve further with time. And as I said above, I genuinely believe they're already significantly better than what we have in Synapse. And unfortunately, many of those improvements are not really feasible to bring to Synapse - we had to do very significant rearchitecting to deliver them, and that rearchitecting means it's not really feasible to put the improvements into the older products, they just weren't designed for it. Anyway, you don't have to agree with me, that's fine. This is my personal opinion; that's your personal opinion.

n9qpkf7,"Well, my situation was a very different time initially: the 1990's. But since you asked... Ya, what surprised me was just how desperate a company was back then, and well into the early 2010's for anyone with programming/admin/networking/tech-support capabilities. Essentially, if you showed any prowess in those 4 areas what-so-ever (and especially if you had cursory basic knowledge of all 4 of them) then wow! Suddenly you became a kind of semi-hero in the work space? A kind of defacto tech support and programmer (even if that wasn't your main job!). ------------------------------The need was so great that... At that point, there's was pretty much nothing you could ever do to get fired! Like ya... I was younger at that time, and foolish, so even though I didn't control my emotions at some point and even yelled back at the senior founding partner of our firm, I still didn't get fired! I kid you not: I even got caught late at night in a rather compromising position with a certain colleague, in which her and I were inappropriately hitting it off... and then... well... hit it off one late night, when wouldn't you know it: that same senior partner came into the office unusually to check something. And kinda freaked, then backed out, and never spoke about it to me! (Ya, if that was today, I would have been long fired multiple times!)------------------------------Anyways... So, I actually got hired by a pretty well known international law firm as a technical writer, since I had done two entirely separate university degrees: one physics, and one English Literature. Ya, I know: that's a strange and weird combo, but those are my 2 loves in life! Despite the fact that unfortunately I'm not all that good in either of them, lol! But the law firm dealt in many aspects related to the sciences and engineering, ranging from patents to immigration of highly talented people, etc... So they needed someone who could read scientific papers, and be semi-decent at writing. (As you can see from the length of this comment, I'm a pretty crazy writer: always constantly writing. Just not anything all that good! But still always writing, and I can type at about 90 to 100 words per minute.) ------------------------------Finally to get to the point, not only did I do technical writing... But if anyone had a problem with their computer in the office, my phone line would light up and ring (if the main tech-guy/admin wasn't there yet in the morning, or was already busy). And then people would approach me to help them automate some tasks. So believe it or not, I would actually use C++ (taping into Win32) combined with a program called ""Autohotkey"" to do scripting and automation! Like who uses C++ of all things, to do quick scripting and automation tasks!? Well apparently that would be me! ------------------------------But ya, I got the job after I graduated with my second degree, and boy was I surprised by me being thrust into that role, and just rapidly utilizing anything I knew to get the job done, even if it wasn't anything close to 100% the correct language or solution model for the problem. Just as long as it worked, mostly glitch free, then nobody gave a flying F what programming language or tool I used to get the job done. And because of that, they never-ever-ever wanted to fire me, even though they had to scold me several times. ------------------------------Fast forward to today, and ya... Times have really changed, mostly for the worse in this field unfortunately. I worry the good old fashioned crazy pure days of fun are behind us now in the tech sector, and companies have turned something great into something of misery...

n9qptu6,"I've been on the other side: interviewing candidates for entry level back-end focused dev positions. Here's my thoughts. Active Github profile (daily commits) - not important. ""Daily commits"" is especially not important, some days you just aren't going to have code worth committing. The important part is _having worked on a project of nontrivial complexity_. You had a problem and you tried to solve it... how did you approach the problem, and why did you choose the solution you did? Talking about the candidate's prior work is very valuable as the person trying to understand if the candidate in front of me might be a good fit. Well-structured and documented programs (Modular & uses Swagger) - maybe of interest, but just having used tools like OpenAPI (which is the name of the spec for what was called ""swagger"" btw) or readthedocs or redoc doesn't actually tell me anything. Remember, I'm trying to figure out your approach to solving engineering problems. Does slapping swagger-ui into a maven project mean you're any more informed about how or why to use such a tool? Not necessarily. Now, if what you developed had an external API with users that needed to know about/test your endpoints, that's something worth asking about. This could dovetail into asking about other tools like Postman. ""Well structured"" is too vague of advice and honestly I'd be wary of anyone preaching this to a new developer. Trying to perfectly architect your work in progress ToDo app is not a good use of time. Get your hands dirty. Learning from mistakes and iterating is the name of the game. Waxing philosophic about how you wanted your first app to scale to thousands of users might be relevant if you're interviewing at Netflix, but anywhere else it's probably just signalling that you didn't really understand when it's appropriate to use the tools at hand, or worse, that you might be the kind of junior dev who needlessly introduces more compexity. Projects - yes, very important. Your plan is simple but if you follow through you will be fine. The only thing that stands out to me is that you don't have concrete examples for your projects. You should pick problem(s) that sounds interesting to you and then just work on them. You will inevitably run into topics that you know nothing about (how do I hook up my server to my database? how do I expose this API endpoint? how do I secure my endpoint behind basic AuthN? if my project is depending on other services, how do I rate limit my service so that I don't get angry emails/IP blocked from those services? is there some way I can process this data more efficiently?). If you are able to work on any actively maintained open source project, you can get some ""real"" dev experience before getting your first job.Here are some of the kinds of basic questions I have in my interview template: * What do you do in your current position (if any)? * What side projects have you worked on? Which languages do you use or which are you learning?* How familiar are you with ? (e.g. Spring, React, etc)* Have you used git or other source control tools? Have you submitted (or reviewed and approved) a pull request before?* Do you know what a unit test is? What do you think is the point of tests?* Walk me through your side project (if any).

na1xmu0,"You're falling into the same trap most beginners do that can last forever if you arent careful. It's good to copy once or twice and follow along tutorials to get a baseline, youve got that part down, but you aren't proving you've learned how to build shit by doing that. You need to reframe how you go about this and treat it like learning an actual spoken language. You learn some nouns and verbs (keywords in programming), then you learn some concepts and combine those with your vocabulary (grammar), but you will never be able to speak with just that (speaking = programming).You can pass a Japanese test and technically ""know"" Japanese this way, but you'll never be able to express your own thoughts to a native. In the same way you can't program your own apps. If you want to progress beyond the beginners at your stage and speed up your learning, paradoxically you need to slow down. Pause the ""studying"" and ""learning"" you're doing for now and do the same thing youd do for learning a spoken language. Take what you know and form your own sentences and evaluate where you get lost and what you need to learn more of. Speaking a language = coding a project. Coding is NOT and will not ever be the most difficult part about being a programmer. Coding is hard for beginners and anyone that tells you that coding is the hard part likely does not understand what programming actually is. Build something, and when you finish build something else. Occasionally rebuild something youve already built, maybe add some new tricks youve learned to speed the process up or add features you were unable to the first time.And ""i can't build anything yet"" is not an acceptable answer. Day one of a spoken language course you learn how to say ""hello"", day one of a coding course you learn how to say ""Hello World"". Thats a project in the same way that a simple sentence in Japanese is. It's not impressive, but it is by definition a project. Now add complexity to your app. Can you print ""something besides Hello World? Can you make it print that new phrase 10 times? Can you print out what a user types? Can you make that phrase print 10 times? Can you take in more than one string of user input? If you know how to do those things, you should be able to bang your head against a wall and build a calculator. A little more complicated than ""Hello World"" and takes quite a bit more work, but building it is a lot more feasible than you think. Coding isnt hard. But it takes practice.

na39jb2,"I would say if you copy paste it’s bad. This may be a controversial opinion, but I believe that it can actually help to copy if you retype what you see. Knowledge acquisition doesn’t always require understanding before exposure, often repetitive exposure to things that don’t make sense is the foundation of knowledge. It’s how we all learned to speak. Our brains are actually designed to work this way.So if you are retyping programming basics like loops, syntax, the use of built in methods, turning an array into a map, the elements of a form that go together, and the js methods that move the info from the front end to the back end, the shape of classes and functions, event listeners and their methods, etc… I think that stuff is okay to copy as long as you type it out line by line. It’s hard to tell while you’re doing it, but you are learning things just by transposing them from the screen through your keyboard. You will inevitably miss a symbol or a letter and you’ll have to scan through and figure out what went wrong. This will help you gain deeper understanding. Eventually you see the patterns. Seemingly disconnected confusing things start to become connected and organized. At its heart programming is us training ourselves to be conscious of subconscious steps. Like we never have to think of every individual step of putting on a t-shirt. We just know how to do it. I believe when we program our brain begins to subconsciously understand what is happening which is why (after it clicks) sometimes coding can feel like magic, and why we have to reread and relearn code we wrote two weeks ago. If you find yourself copying something that looks familiar too often I would say take some time and focus on the use of that thing by itself.

Start by figuring out the data types of the parameters and return value.1. Next, implement the base case.1. Take a leap of faith and assume your recursive function magically returns the correct value, and write your recursive case.1. First Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call cannot be the original argument.1. Second Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call must ALWAYS get closer to the base case.The main thing to know is that recursion is mostly overrated. If your problem involves both 1) a tree structure and 2) back tracking, then it's a good candidate for recursion. Otherwise, if you find yourself asking, ""Why couldn't I just do this with a loop"" then you're right: it's a poor candidate for recursion and you should just use the simpler loop solution.",AlSweigart,2025-08-19 20:47:46,3,learnprogramming,t3_1mulhd1,False,

But you'd need one stack for the file scanner objects (representing the system's view of the directories you had descended) and another for the data you were building for each directory... and you'd carefully inspect each file object, and push a new file scanner if it was a directory, and carefully handle your end-of-scan issues at each level, popping both stacks... it could get tricky.Now consider doing it with recursion. You imagine the functional interface you want – let's say, a File, and a DataSoFar. Consider your base case – is the File a simple file, not a directory? Great, you're done. Produce your output. Otherwise you need to recurse – okay, it's a directory: update DataSoFar, create a scanner from the File, loop through the scanner and call your function on each of the files. Boom, done. The book-keeping and boundary conditions are handled for you by the program stack, and you stick to familiar function calling and error-handling idioms.The key leap for me is always that imaginative step: *what's the functional interface I wish I could use to solve one step of this problem?* Recursion sometimes allows you to achieve that interface with minimal effort and great clarity.",SubstantialListen921,2025-08-19 15:45:56,3,learnprogramming,t3_1mulhd1,False,

No, do I learn one? Where do I get the words? Do I input them? Do I use any cloud solution?This never ending circle of questions, or you could just write a function that takes a word of language L and a word of language K then it returns true if it's correct. Internally it finds the L word in list L and checks if K word matches the word at the same index in list K. This is your core mechanic AND database. You can go even lower and make sure you can match strings at all.GUI? Once you start considering libraries and frameworks... thats a whole can of worms on it's own...print to terminal first.

n9hrva1,"That is a very good analogy, and the answer is actually quite simple!The way you figure out if ""the programming LEGO piece you need actually exists"" is exactly they way you figure out if an actual LEGO piece you need exists!Every time you build a LEGO-set you follow instructions, like a tutorial - and you take note of new pieces or unique ways they are used, storing them in memory for when you later want to build something similar. The next time you are building one of your own creations, you have some ideas of what pieces you have and how they could be used, so you disassemble some of your sets, and try to use the pieces in different ways in your own creation. Maybe it'll work, and you have to order more pieces like it - or it won't work and you have to imagine something else.When not building you are sorting your pieces, experimenting with connecting them in different ways, trying out small techniques outside of large projects, and you get ideas for how you also could use those pieces, maybe you even get an idea for a large project using the pieces that way!Also, you follow builders on social media, and talk with other builders, asking for inspiration, looking inside their creations, and you are always learning!When you have an idea for something, but absolute no knowledge of how to build it, you try sketching it, experiment with the pieces you have, will this fit? No, well how about this? Maybe if I turn that one that way?You won't always succeed, and some projects might be abandoned, but you are always learning! Don't ever expect to ""see"" the magical piece that will solve your exact problem, if you have never worked on anything even remotely similar, or even seen pieces anywhere close to what you need!And don't think that you'll immediately get to know thousands of pieces and how they connect - sometimes you will have to make things ""the wrong way"", or simply ""fake"" them, make a function that pretends to do the work for you, until you learn the right way. Take a look at the LEGO creations by young kids, they almost never look exactly like they should, but they are an appromixation.So, answer 1 is: always be learning, experiment with what you have, try to solve it close enough. And answer 2 is: Don't try to look for the perfect solution when you only know 1% of everything that is - look around you, and see if you can get just a little closer to your goal!

One thing that helps me is using something to keep track of that sort of thing - a folder, a bookmark app, anything where you can drop everything you come across that makes you go ""that's cool/useful/whatever"" but isn't directly related to what you're doing *now*. Without that, a five minute research search can end with me realizing it's 2 am and I've gotten nothing done. As for the rest... it really is just experience, and not feeling bad about the fact that you still need to look stuff up X years in. For example, I've been using PHP for like 20 years and I still have to look up simple functions because I forget the syntax *all the time*. Who cares, though? I know what it does and how it works, not remembering what comes first in a substring isn't the end of the world.For me, at least, becoming a better programmer is less about memorization or always knowing what the right ""piece"" is, and is more about a general understanding and ""feel"" for how things work. You might not know if a specific function exists to do what you want, and it sucks to spend the time working on something only to find out later it was as easy as using a function that already exists, but it's probably going to happen to you more than once - but now you know the function exists and you know how to work without it. Figuring out how to do something, even the most trivial ""I'll never need to do this again"" thing, is never a *bad* thing and will help you grow. Maybe later you'll be learning another language that's similar but it doesn't have an applicable function for what you were doing, and it's not a problem because you know how to do it by hand. This probably isn't the most realistic example, the point is that I try to never look at ""I just did more than I needed to"" as a negative as long as it's not causing you to miss deadlines (and as long as it's not happening constantly).I'm hesitant to push AI as it's really easy to become overly reliant on it, and you should never rely on code AI slings out without vetting it yourself, but if you treat it like a search engine it's certainly a lot easier to say ""I'm trying to do X with Y and am wondering what methods others currently use"" than to try and get the perfect Google search or scroll through docs.It never hurts to join a coding community, either.

For example, all these languages have for loops, but Python has list comprehensions, JavaScript has array methods that take in callback functions, Java has implementations of the List interface…Going further into back end dev, Ruby on Rails defines endpoints as methods on a Controller class, inheriting from the framework’s built-in ActiveController. Java Spring Boot does a similar thing but with decorators, favouring composition over inheritance. Node Express doesn’t have Controller classes/prototypes, instead endpoints are just function properties assigned to an instance of an App object with callbacks to define their behaviour. They all have the concept of endpoints, they all have HTTP verbs and request/response objects, they all push you more or less to an MVC architecture, but very different implementations. Knowing the concept is way more important than knowing only one implementation.When you move to a language you don’t know - say Rust - and you try and implement an endpoint as a Node Express style async function, you’re gonna have a bad time.

It is upon you to build the house brick by brick, floor by floor.You start with small, simple games and work your way up.Take the game engine of your choice (I'd recommend Godot for starters) and build something simple, something like e.g. *Tic-Tac-Toe*. Then venture into more complex territory, e.g. something like *Battleships*. Then, move on to more complex tasks, e.g. *Sokoban (Box Pusher)* - these are all fairly simple to make games that will each teach you a lot. To get something more dynamic, the classic *Pong* or *Breakout (Arkanoid clone)* are good starts, but only after you have progressed enough. Make a *Pacman* clone. Using old games has the advantage that the entire *game mechanics* are well known and well documented.When you gradually build up your skills you can always venture into larger, more complex games, make the switch from 2D to 2.5D (often also wrongly called Isometric) to 3D.With each game you make you will improve your skills, *provided* that you don't just do tutorial after tutorial that creates the game *for* you. At utmost, use the tutorials as inspiration and try to make things on your own. Then, if you fail and can't find a solution, look at the tutorial to see how they did it. Don't just copy the tutorial. First, try on your own. Experimenting, trying, failing, fixing are all part of learning, copying is not learning.Also, games are developed *incrementally*. They start with simple mechanics, e.g. how to interact with the player, how to set up the levels, etc. Then, they work with the collisions, and so on. Commonly, the *game art* is quite far towards the end of the development. Sure, you need to know roughly how big your game entities (players, enemies, background, etc.) will be but you don't need to have them fully developed at the start.Get things working first and then make them good and pretty.",aqua_regis,2025-08-19 10:27:34,20,learnprogramming,t3_1mue3m2,False,
n9iiy6v,I started coding my own game engine without any prior experience in coding before. the way I did it was via starting by coding snake. Then I decided “let’s make the rendering algorithm more efficient. And then I thought “wouldn’t it be cool if I had helper functions for all the draw commands?” and then I thought about adding colors sprite support alpha transparency and switch from the terminal output to a proper window. The trick is don’t go into it trying to do everything at once. I think when getting into coding one underestimates how far they can get by just taking small manageable steps and learning how to do something when you can’t figure it out by yourself.,jonermon,2025-08-19 11:59:18,7,learnprogramming,t3_1mue3m2,False,

Build something where you have to think on a higher level of abstraction than while-loops and if-statements, struggle with understanding the framework, and use all your knowledge of the language to build something 'standard'.You are ""done"" with learning the programming language, now you have to learn how to build programs - and the easiest way to get started is to follow advanced tutorials, and notice repeating patterns in the way they build things!Also, don't forget about the interview-exam - store it somewhere, and pick it up again in a few weeks, try to see if it suddenly becomes easier.",peterlinddk,2025-08-19 14:53:14,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mubg50,False,

Do you mean how the computer even starts up, where it gets the programs from?If so:Every computer has some form of persistent memory, the BIOS (Basic Input Output System) where the bootstrap code is stored (in modern times, this is the UEFI BIOS with some more data and programming).A CPU only knows one thing: to look at a certain address in a memory (typically address 0) and execute whatever is there.The BIOS of a computer has the bootstrap program at exactly that address stored. In the former days, this was an actual ROM, now it is usually some form of erasable programmable memory, like an EEPROM.The BIOS then has all the code to carry out the POST (Power On Self Test), plus libraries/functionality to talk with the various hardware components, and the code to then start, in case of a PC, the Operating System, of which the boot-loader is stored in a certain place on the hard drive (SSD, nVme, etc) of the computer.In case of the modern UEFI BIOS, this system is usually also stored on the computer's hard drive, but also exists in a storage on the main board so that when you change the hard drive, the computer can still boot.A good start to understand how everything of this plays together is to look into Microcontrollers, like the 8031/8051, Atmel (Arduino) as they are basically the same as a PC minus the operating system.",aqua_regis,2025-08-21 12:50:41,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mw9lc2,False,

OS broadly, web browser narrowly, your favorite game, maybe Lua.> Can you give me examples of where some feature is not implemented in a language because it would directly block another feature? How about [type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system)? How a language lets you define and handle types tends to be a defining feature. It also will impact every aspect of how you develop a program in that language. Choose one, block the other. A strict type system catches errors at compile time, a loose one might only catch some errors at run time. Write your tests accordingly.Along the same lines, [mutablity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object). This is the break point between imperative and declarative. The level to which that can be dictated by the programmer also defines a language.[Function overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading) comes to mind. It's extremely popular, lots of languages do it, and lots don't. There are pros and cons in implementing such a feature. There is implementation complexity but also programmer expectation.Garbage collection? How resources are released is a big deal in all languages. In some languages, all clean up is the responsibility of the programmer. In others, the programmer barely has a say.Virtual machines? Java and .NET, among others, run inside a sandbox.

Most of them can do the task. It's just what you like.Think about C++ and Objective-C. Both were attempts to make C object-oriented. Did one stop when they heard about the other? Did C++ win because it was the best for the job? No, C++ won because it was part of AT&T which was a much bigger entity than the folks that developed Objective-C.It's just like natural languages. Is English the best language? Some (who natively speak it) say yes, but it's only because they speak it. Others insist that their language is best. We could learn Esperanto which was a designed language where the ease of learning was a key objective. Yet, it's not popular because people love their own languages, and maybe ease of learning isn't that important. Some people love how complex their language is (or how many feature it has).To get to your second question, there are languages that try to avoid using null, so they have to create Option types (that's one way to do it). This creates a level of mental overhead that those who have never used those types find unimportant, yet others, who think null pointer exceptions are evil and the cause of many errors feel it's justified.Or languages that want to be pure functional have problems with I/O, such as printing, and have to use complex math structures like monads, when everyone else feels printing is really easy, but it's counter to the functional philosophy.Prolog was built to have a backtracking mechanism, and for most, it looks like nothing you'd expect and is hard to get your mind around, and because of that, hard to figure out. Erlang, which was inspired by Prolog, has a syntax that's hard for those used to C-style syntax (which is most popular languages) to understand, partly because it was designed before language designers decided languages should look like C.And was that because C was a great language? No, but it was hugely popular in industry, so to design languages that looked like C was considered beneficial because people were more likely to try out your language if they didn't have to struggle with the syntax as much.Functional languages don't like having state, so they don't have plain old for-loops because the looping variables change values. So, they use functions like: fold, map, filter, zip, etc. to achieve looping capabilities without a looping variable. They also rely a lot on recursion.It helps if you try these other languages like learning Prolog or Erlang or Haskell to see how different they are.",CodeTinkerer,2025-08-19 09:21:44,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mucv2f,False,

If after almost 5 years, and you can’t find the spare time to study coding this might not be the profession for you.I know very little based on your post about your current skillset, but if it as bad as you make it out to be, you might be better off going a product manager route for your upcoming project. These roles are always undervalued and under represented in big team projects in university and schools. Some people might partake in this role, but usually the team doesn’t take the role seriously. But that is usually the way it is with product managers - they have to make themselves useful, so that the team can see the purpose in the role.Even though you can’t code, I’m sure that’s a lot of things that you’ve caught on about - use that knowledge to support the team in every possible way. Communication is key - as it is in any successful endeavor.But you won’t learn enough in a month - it is simply not enough time.But if you do choose to study hard and try to make lost time, here’s a few suggestion for you:Stop focusing on fancy called examples or guides from people that tell you that this kind of projects will get you jobs - find something that is within your scope of capabilities; even if this means this is simply a small blogging website or a simple web crawler or even a calculator. Finish that project - and do not use AI tools to complete it.Don’t get me wrong. AI tools are extremely powerful and in the industry we use them daily. But at least where I come from we have a saying, that the AI is only as good as your own understanding - but understanding doesn’t come, unless you put down the groundwork.I’m sorry if this is harsh, but I truly wish you the very best in the future.",SpiritualFee6270,2025-08-22 19:43:29,9,learnprogramming,t3_1mxf97n,False,

Displayed them* Break for lunch* Google `how to catch mouse clicks`* Click away happily for a few minutes* Use some advanced math (uh, division and modulo) to convert a point on the screen to an element of the 2D array* Change the code to say ""You clicked square x, y, which contains a blue blob""* Use my advanced CS degree to do find all the blobs of the same color connected to this blob (flood fill)* etcI can go on for a lot longer, but I hope I've made the point.

Here's how I do it (may or may not work for you) - I tend to generally only give docs a very surface level read/ avoid them until I'm fairly well versed with the language. Then - once I start doing more complex stuff - I tend to simply use my IDE to read docs for specific things I'm working with.E.g. in Java, if I'm using a class from the core library, I can hit F12 in my IDE to go to the class's source code and read the doc comments directly within that class.I find that this compartmentalizes the doc information to only the specific pieces of info I need for my work.

Nowhere could i find a methodology to go through the documentation to find something and honestly its kinda confusing especially with poorly written docs.What i have found to help is to start high level and zoom into specifics as you get a better idea of what to do. Heres a recent example from my side while building a crud app. I want to create and view a blog article so what do i do? Assuming the html forms and express server is already set up. Ok so i need to be able to firstly log the inputs, what does it look like, how do i do that, and if its not in a useable state, how do i transform it. Ok then i need to be able to access the json file and also somehow save to the json file. Ok then lastly to view the article i need to again access the json and somehow display the info somewhere in my html( or in my case ejs template). Again what would happen if the data is not in a useable state? This breaks down all the steps which you can then go looking for your methods. So as an example (im using node and express for the backend) i want to access the json file. So you can google that and read around or go straight to the docs (if you know roughly which module) and then look for various ways to read a json file. And then when you find, ok so in the fs module i have a few methods to choose from, .read().readFile().createReadStream(), so among these methods which one is applicable to my situation. Now you're reading the docs, looking at specifics, comparing methods with a specific goal in mind. You can even test each one to see if it works or not. I have found this to work for me...

The problem you need to solve is _text processing and XML handling_, but what you're asking about is _fully understanding Python_. These are two different things.Python as a language lets you be productive with only a small understanding of the language itself (that's how I got started with it; I've actually forgotten how or when I started writing Python, at some point I realised that's what I was writing my scripts in, rather than Perl or Bash).In programming, as elsewhere, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. The stuff you write with only a minimal understanding of Python will look awkward to someone more experienced, including yourself some few months from now.Generally what you want is:1. a _good enough_ understanding of the language semantics itself. ""Good enough"" is poorly defined, and varies by language: * A language like Rust will require more investment in learning up front, but deliver very few gotchas down the line * A language like Javascript or PHP will require very little investment in learning up front, but deliver more gotchas down the line * Python is kinda more middle-of-the-road. * For this bit you kinda just gotta read a book, preferably a good one so you don't fall asleep, and do some exercises to get a feel for it.1. A decent understanding of engineering in the language, as in, how do you write long-term maintainable code? * This includes which libraries and external tools you're expected to use. * For Python you kinda have to check /r/Python and other resources, but currently Astral tools like `uv` and `ruff` are good to have in your toolkit, and a typechecker like Microsoft's `pyright` until Astral's `ty` gets to 1.0. * Static analysis, both typechecking and linters, will help you catch weaknesses in your understanding of what you're doing.1.

A backend of some sort (usually some kind of API that serves JSON, but depending on your design it might also serve fully rendered HTML), a database that stores persistent data (user info, product info, user content, etc) that your backend interacts with, and a frontend that consists of HTML, JS, and CSS (this frontend may be served by the same backend discussed before or could be served by a different service.

Another might be that you have really specific performance requirements that demand a certain stack. For you, the answer is ""whatever you want"". Really. I would look up some common stacks that maybe use languages you're already familiar with and then just pick one and go with a getting started guide. Like javascript a lot? Use MERN. More of a Python guy? Use Flask or Fast API and pick either Vue or React for the frontend. Want to learn more vanilla javascript and not bother with frameworks? Cool. You don't need React or Vue or any other framework. For other tools, make sure you're comfortable with git, github, working in bash or zsh or some other *nix shell.

So, doing good at SQL will open doors to data science, business analysis, database performance work, and in general will make you more valuable for every developer team in the future.Another one such ""language"" is regular expressions. Python may not be a good language to learn and use them because AFAIK it lacks special syntax support for them, but Ruby, Rust, JavaScript have better syntax for them. Learning regexes *well* will help you work with unstructured data, extract data form text, logs, do data migration between systems, and do quick changes to text files including some advanced search-and-replace operations in your code editor. It's a very good supplemental skill to have.Learning Shell scripting is my third recommendation.

Consider “gathering requirements” this in itself is some documentation you want to create before you start developing. You probably also want to pin down any quality attributes and relevant SLO/SLAs, and a workable architecture or design for your software. Basically you start by producing a pile of documentation that you reference throughout your development, and while developing you may produce documentation about certain methods or functions, or a quirk of a third party system you interact with, and so on, which will help the future developers (likely you) maintain the project. You’ll also want “user facing documentation” that the people who use the software you produce can use to help them get the most out of it or answer questions for them when they stumble across a workflow quirk.Further I consider the value of a SWE to not just be code output, but “knowledge output”, so alongside development or while making architectural decisions or soliciting requirements, or after getting user feedback, they should also be learning things about the domain and ideally producing some documentation that can help the whole team understand the why and how behind certain domain-specific things. Code is almost inherently technical debt, and knowledge is the only thing that lets you pay it down.It sounds like a lot, but all of it can usually fit in an agile sprint or whatever. And to some extent it depends on what level of developer you are, Jr. dev will likely not be getting customer requirements, setting quality attributes and SLOs, nor drafting architecture.

na5h0zw,"The first few chapters of ""Designing data intensive Applications"" covers this nicely.BUT, those have become buzzwords that mean nothing at this point, all job descriptions have them, all CVs have them, all project descriptions have them.No, being on the cloud does not automatically make software scalable, neither resilient. A service must be designed with the intent to be runnable in multiple instances for it to be considered horizontally scalable, not all applications meet these criteria, and once they meet them, other services they depend on (e.g. databases, queues, weird disk based sharing) must also be able to meet demand, or else the service will just bottleneck outside of its control.Resilience can be broken down into three categories, what happens when the service breaks, what happens when the services around it break, and what happens when the service is used incorrectly - all three must be covered for it to be resilient, and cloud helps with none of these.What you probably have in mind is *availability,* which yes, load balancing a service which supports it in the cloud, whether automatically or manually, does to an extent solve availability (*to an extent is doing a lot of heavy lifting here).* This is what happens when *one or more* instances of your service are no longer available.Security is not only authorization and authentication, but also what information I can receive from your system while being a legitimate user, whether I can abuse timing, delays, your concurrency model, false requests, rollbacks and a thousand other things.However, most job postings don't really mean all this, it's just a fun thing to write these days.",disposepriority,2025-08-22 22:16:02,3,learnprogramming,t3_1mxivfe,False,
na7oy84,"Great answer from u/disposepriority !For my two pence, I'd like to add that, as much as the internet is only as fast as the slowest connection between you and the other end, the same can be said for ""resilient, scalable and secure"" software... if the fundamental processing units (the deployed code) are flaky and buggy, you are going to find stuff dying, then AWS for example will trigger an EB/EC2/Docker restart depending on what deployment route you set up, that will be blue/green usually so least disruptive but still, until the new box is switched live, users are left running the faulty one!So, from the bottom up it helps if good development practices regarding tests, integrations tests, staging servers to test prior to production release etc, these are all factors in a ""reliable"" system.As for **scalable**, depends on your needs: horizontal scaling is easy enough with AWS to trigger more boxes up under heavy loads, but again the onus is on you to make sure you can handle sessions properly, JWT based authentication usually makes that a no brainer but if you are using database sessions then that adds an extra step I guess but all normal stuff these days, plenty of best practices guides out there and from AWS; they have documentation on everything but it can be hard to find / hard to digest at times.**Vertical** scaling with AWS is easier if you use something like Terraform, we have a guy does tat for us. Usually vertical scaling isn't an issue for us, we use Django and Celery and they run on separate instances to reduce load on the main API server, for that we use RabbitMQ in the mix. I can't remember the lats we needed to tweak a box specification. We run everything via ECR/ECS, the AWS Docker solution.**Performant**: Well to some extent this goes back to initial software design, choosing the most efficient algorithms, libraries and your own data structures. For example, me being an big fan of Lisp, Haskel etc I tend to use \`deque\` instead of the stock Python list as it handles certain types of insertions fast that the List, then you can hand it back as a list() if you want later.[https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)**Secure**: We use at rest encryption for our RDS instances, plus certain data models have custom load and save to perform encryption prior to sending fields to the database for double protection, using the SECRET\_KEY value.Also, we use asymmetric encryption on the JWT token, using the AWS Parameter Store to manage all keys, our environment configurations, TaskDefinitions etc are all setup to reference the keys so that they are available to Django at runtime through a simple AWS API call, and some are pushed into the running environment as we use \`decouple.config()\` quite a lot as well.So, that's what we do!",bravopapa99,2025-08-23 07:52:11,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mxivfe,False,
na7v3qf,"> The advantage of a cloud platform is that you don't have to worry about how to implement horizontal scaling (which would provide resiliency and scalability), right?I wish. The platform can do it, no stress, but whether the app can handle it is up to the app. If you slap an old stateful app into kubernetes and make more replicas of it, you're pretty likely to get bad behaviour, as in erroneous responses or crashes.We had high availability designs for apps before cloud providers, they were just a bit more of a PITA to get the other replicas for.One guide to getting there is the [12-factor app](https://12factor.net/). The guide might look a bit weird to those of us who think those are just normal apps, and work with gitops and distroless containers on a daily basis.> And would using the cloud platform's built-in authentication and authorization services be enough to ensure security?Yeah, nah. You can still leak your credentials and do lots of stupid shit. Vibe coders do it all the time. You need to have some idea of what authn and authz means, _why_ you do it, and which bits of information can go where. If you think the cloud services provide all the security you need and then push sensitive information out to any client, you've fucked up.Security is also something of an eternal cat-and-mouse game. Like some algorithms need to pretend to be slow just to limit their vulnerability to timing attacks. Security is an entire rabbit hole of its own.> I also see job postings that want experience designing ""performant"" software. Aren't you always trying to make code as efficient as possible? What is performant software and how would software not be performant?Software is non-performant for a whole host of reasons, and getting it to be performant isn't just one thing. One thing is bad [big-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), but people also do stuff like bad structuring of network calls, and to some extent choosing the wrong language (program design usually matters a lot more than language choice).",syklemil,2025-08-23 08:54:43,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mxivfe,False,

na6e7fn,"I'm going to disagree with the other two posters a *bit*, and post my own definition. Firstly, you absolutely, 100% should learn classes. They are used everywhere in every facet of programming, *including* Frontend Dev. Modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, Lit, etc. use them, so they're absolutely necessary to have at least a basic grasp of.I'd also disagree that the ""description of an object is called a CLASS"". This is like...90% accurate, but there's a small bit of distinction that I think is important.# Classes and ObjectsFirstly, let's define what the word ""object"" means. I like to think of an object in programming as a *noun*; it's a ""thing"". It has can have some **adjectives** that describe it (it's ""old"" or ""blue"") and it can have some **verbs** that it can do (it can ""drive"" or ""honk""). It's also got a name usually that describes it (so we can refer to that ""thing""), and often times we can say that it's a particular **kind** of thing. Now, instead of using the words ""adjective"", ""verb"", and ""kind"", let's replace those with more programmy words: - `property`: properties are the adjectives. They describe something about the object. Some of those properties can be changed (I may get taller or shorter as I age); other properties cannot change (I will always have been born in my hometown; that cannot change). Generally speaking, properties don't ""do"" anything; they're just descriptors. Each property has a ""key"" (what it is) and a value. For example, our car has a property with key ""color"" and value ""blue"". - `method`: Methods are the verbs, and they usually have a pair of parentheses somewhere in their name. I can `program()`. I can `write(message)` (write a message). I cannot `fly()` (that's not one of my methods!). - `class`: The class of an object is, roughly speaking, its _type_. I am a human (my class is Human). The `old`, `blue` thing that can `drive()` is an object of type `Car`. All objects of a particular type are defined as having certain methods and properties. Classes can also be thought of as ""templates"" for objects. I want an object that fits the template ""car"" (i.e., does things a car can do), so I'll use the Car class.Here's an example of a class in JavaScript:```class Car { constructor(color, age){ //roughly speaking here, `this` refers to the object we're talking about. this.color = color; this.age = age; } drive() { alert('vroooom!'); }}```And to use this class, I'd do something like this:```const myCar = new Car('blue', 'old');console.log(myCar.color);//'blue'```So why would I disagree that the description of an object is a class? Well, in describing that old blue car, I'd... well I'd describe it exactly that. An old, blue car. _However_, the adjectives ""old"" and ""blue"" are _not part of the class_! Instead, they're values (see above). Instead, a class describes a _template_ for an object, not that actual, specific object. Every person alive has an `age` property and a `placeOfBirth` property, but mine is almost certainly different from, say, yours. # WhyClasses allow us to organize our data in a paradigm of programming known as Object Oriented Programming (OOP). It's not the _only_ paradigm, but it's a pretty popular one. Classes: - Allow us to define a particular behavior _once_ and then reuse that behavior - Can be ""extended"". For example, I might have a `Pet` class with properties like `hungerLevel` or methods like `makeSound()`, and then I might ""extend"" that class with something like a `Dog` class (with a `bark()` method), or a `Fish` class (with a `splash()` method). Again, this allows us to define certain, common behaviors only once!The first point is particular important. Imagine if every time a person signed up for FaceBook, a team of programmers had to write functions to deal with that person's account. Oh, /u/Maleficent_Speech289 signed up? We'll need to write a `login()` and `getPictures()` and `postMessage()` method for them! Instead, with classes, you can just say: ```const someUser = new User('Maleficent_Speech289');someUser.getPictures(); //this behavior is already defined, so we can just use it!```# TL;DR:You absolutely, 100% need to know classes as a programmer. It doesn't matter if you're new, senior, or somewhere in between; you'll need to know them at some point, and it's never too early to start learning them. Anyone that hires you will expect you to have clean, structured code, and while there are other programming paradigms, OOP is one of the most popular to the point that it's kinda a ""default"".",HealyUnit,2025-08-23 01:37:19,6,learnprogramming,t3_1mxf2kp,False,

na6yn1g,"In JS, a class, aka object, is not really an object, it is ***a prototype *** This difference was emphasized in many older books but has been forgotten since around 2012. The last book I know of that adheres to this differentiation though the author did not explain the difference at all was the book Javascript the Good Parts by Douglas Crawford. You should think of a prototype as a ***generalized object/class***, it is a ***meta-class*** so to speak. This was something discussed in a very old book called The Art of the Metaobject Protocol by Gregor Kiczales. A typical object is very easy to understand as others have no doubt explained to you already. It is basically a list of data and a list of methods that operates on those data and those data only. You can create a new type of object from an existing object by inheriting all of its data and methods + nee ones you specified. You should think in your mind as a circle engulfed by a bigger circle where the smaller circle is the old and the big circle now containing the smaller circle is the new. This is pretty much all you can do with objects if JS were really an object-oriented language like Java -- I wrote some stuff bashing Java the other day, people interested should search for the keyword Scratch in my comment history. I basically argued why Scratch is better than Java, but that's just a click-bait title. With prototype, the relationship between the old and the new is not a circle in a circle but two circles connected by a line. Yep, that's it. We are done.To truly appreciate the difference, you have to ask what happens during the ***construction of a new new-object***. In the circle-in-circle model, you simply get another circle-in-circle. However in JS, creating another circle-line-circle new-object can be done in ***two ways***, hence all the weird constructors in JS. When you use the keyword 'class' you are creating a brand new circle-line-circle. This is the standard method since ECMA6. However there is an older method using the keyword 'new"". With 'new', you do not get another circle-line-circle, you get a new circle attached to the existing circle-line-circle, and the relationship is a triangle. The you have circle-line-Circle-line-circle where Circle represents the old-object and the two 'circle's are the created new-objects. Why does this matter? This means both child (new-objects) share the same parent. And either one can ***modify the parent's data or add new methods to the parent*** and that information will be propagated to the other child. This is an important feature because it means you can modify the parent ***at run time.*** You can use this for all sorts of purposes. It would take too long to explain all the things you can do with this, just consult the book I mentioned or use your imagination. I do want to mention something that is not in the book and I do not believe it is implemented anywhere. In JS at least you can do it pretty easily. Imagine now you go to the new 'class' constructor and you use that to create another circle-line-Circle-line-cicrle, now you have two families of the same objects, but they can follow different ***dynamic*** paths during program run time to become something else entirely. One obvious application would be for games where you have different creatures from different families but as they evolve, they can split off from the main tree. But, it can even go back through its ancestor tree and start ***rewriting history.***Anyway, this is long enough.e: JS was originally derived from Scheme and the book was written for LISP based language which is the root of Scheme. The creator of JS wanted to create a Scheme language to be used as the scripting language for the then best browser Netscape. However, Java had just taken off and was seen as the future of the programming world. So the investors of Netscape insisted on a ***java-like*** language thinking it would make JS compatible with Java in the future. Obviously you should never let non-tech people make tech decisions. So the JS creator took the matter into his own hand and created a ***java-look-alike***. It looks like Java but it has nothing to do with Java, it is way better because it runs on Scheme under the hood. Yes, that's all it is. He took a Scheme engine and created a cosmetic layer over it. This was how he created JS in 3 days. And God took 7 days to create the Universe. Not too shabby.",kcl97,2025-08-23 03:57:09,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mxf2kp,False,

For example on ARMv8 and above there are 4 privilege levels, which they call Exception Levels, with EL0 being the unprivileged level under which regular user applications execute, EL1 being intended for kernel supervisors, EL2 being intended for virtual machine hypervisors, and EL3 being intended for firmware security monitors.On macOS you only have access up to EL2, and that requires using either the Hypervisor or Virtualization frameworks to create a virtualization environment (the Virtualization framework is a very high level virtual machine implementation on top of the Hypervisor framework), but you can run unrestricted EL3 code on all AArch64 Raspberry Pi models, so if you're interested in privileged bare-metal development, the Raspberry Pi is likely your best option. On the other hand, M4 Macs are already on ARMv9, which is pretty similar to ARMv8 as far as unprivileged code is concerned but significantly different for privileged code as many system registers were added, changed, and removed since ARMv8, plus the M4 in particular also has 512-bit Scalable Matrix Extension support, so depending on what you want to do, that may or may not be appealing to you.General purpose AArch32 and AArch64 HTML documentation:* [ARMv6M, ARMv7, and ARMv8 assembly reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0801/latest/);* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 instruction set architecture](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/latest/)* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 system registers](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0601/latest/)Documentation specific to the SoCs used by the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 and their derivatives:* [Cortex A72 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100095/latest/)* [Cortex A76 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100798/latest/);* [ Generic Interrupt Controller core reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0471/latest/);* [Generic Interrupt Controller v2 specific reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0048/latest/);* [PrimeCell 0111 UART](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0183/latest/);* [BCM2711 datasheet (Pi 4)](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/bcm2711/bcm2711-peripherals.pdf).Other resources:* [Bare-metal section of the Raspberry Pi forums (I help there sometimes under the same name as my reddit account)](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewforum.php?f=72&sid=de4c2c97b2b1372281ef64d6aed3dc5f);* [Tutorial that got my feet wet on AArch64 (I already had experience with AArch32 from decades ago)](https://www.rpi4os.com/);* [Rust HDMI audio driver that I made for the Pi 4 and 5](https://github.com/CodexTextor/rpi-hdmi) (will not work on the BCM2712 D0 stepping SoC used on models of the Pi 5 introduced after I wrote that code because the physical addresses of the hardware are different).Note that there's no public official documentation for the BCM2712 SoCs of the Raspberry Pi 5, so all my code targeting that platform is based on my own reverse-engineering research effort that included reading the official Linux driver code from Broadcom, messing around with hardware registers on Linux to figure out how they work with a proper driver, and deriving knowledge from my experience with and available documentation for the BCM2711 SoC of the Pi 4, since there was very little community work done on this front when I got my first Pi 5.

Steve wrote the entire program in 6502 Assembly - on paper - then hand-translated everything in the numeric machine code that then could be loaded on the Apple computers. You can find plenty information on how Steve did it on the internet.When I learnt 8051 Assembly in my degree program we initially also learnt to hand-translate the Mnemonics into machine code and vice versa. Can highly recommend to learn that with simpler CPUs, like the 6502, the Zilog Z-80, or the 8051/8031/8080 series Microcontrollers.Assembly is just a 1:1 translation of machine code and therefore is closest to hardware.",aqua_regis,2025-08-21 09:36:55,5,learnprogramming,t3_1mw5n7i,False,

n9he2gh,"You're definitely not alone in noticing that — a lot of people have been expressing similar thoughts across different forums and subreddits. The rise in AI-generated content has blurred the lines of authenticity in online discussions. Here are a few reasons why it might *feel* like that:# :brain: Why Posts Might Feel AI-Generated1. **Overly Polished Language** Posts are increasingly written in this weirdly structured, “essay-like” format. People don’t usually talk like that on Reddit — especially in tech circles where tone tends to be blunt, sarcastic, or informal.2. **Generic Advice & Vague Details** A lot of posts give surface-level advice or talk about issues in super broad terms without getting into the gritty technical details — which is common with AI output unless prompted very specifically.3. **Repetitive Phrasing and Templates** You’ll often see similar turns of phrase or story structures across different posts — things like “After X years in the industry, I realized Y” or “Am I the only one who feels Z?” It starts to feel formulaic.4. **Influx of Low-Effort Engagement Farming** Some users (or bots) are using AI to mass-generate posts and comments to farm karma, drive traffic, or build fake authority on niche topics.# :robot: Signs a Post Might Be AI-Generated* Lacks personal anecdotes or uses generic placeholders.* Echoes common sentiments without adding anything new.* Oddly balanced tone: too formal but pretending to be casual, lol.* Uncanny ability to sit on the fence on controversial topics.* Unnatural use of :pile_of_poo: emojis.* Overuse of the em dash (—).# :puzzle_piece: You're Not ""Schizo"" — You're PerceptiveIt’s unsettling, yeah. And it *does* erode trust — not just in content, but in online community culture itself. Part of Reddit’s value used to be real, lived experience and human nuance. If that’s being diluted, it makes total sense to question what you're reading and who's actually behind it.If you're feeling disoriented by all this, it’s not paranoia — it’s pattern recognition.

You could feel that every single crypto asset is bullshit, but even then I’m not sure you could deny that selling services to people who want to use and trade those assets isn’t a real business. I think Pokémon card investing is bullshit, but if someone built a website to facilitate buying and selling of cards and took in real revenue, I’d still call that a real business. And all of those trading venues and lending venues need developers, often to build rather complex products that can’t have much downtime.An area that’s bigger than ever are stablecoins - crypto assets pegged to (generally) the US dollar. The companies that offer these digital assets hold things like US treasuries to back them, so the company can earn revenue off of the interest while also ensuring that each digital dollar can be redeemed for a US dollar. As far as crypto things go, these are probably the most useful. People in countries with volatile currencies and poor banking systems can now receive, hold, send, and earn interest on US dollars with just a phone and an internet connection. They can send them anywhere in the world and be paid from anywhere in the world. And with the crap going on with Steam and itch.io having to block NSFW games because of pressure from credit card companies, I’d argue we actually could really use a digital dollar that’s as free flowing and censorship resistant as a real life physical dollar.

If not, they may want to allow for more time to get better documentation.You don't need documentation to close the PIP without firing you. All your manager has to say is ""u/linkthecat's performance has been acceptable and I want to close the PIP."" Boom, done.The fact that it's extended most likely means that your manager still wants to get rid of you, but HR is blocking it.There are chances that your manager said ""they seem to be improving, but I need more time"". This happens, but it's unusual, simply because PIPs are unpleasant for the manager and they're unlikely to want to extend them. It's also possible that they're waiting to get your replacement.

I've also questioned whether I'm still good enough to remain in this industry. For now, all I've been doing has been trying to better myself for what my role actually requires. I've been doing courses, studying up on terminology, and I've even been studying my resume to make sure I can fully explain anything I did that's on it.Every rejection is demoralizing, but for the interviews that I do get, I take it as a learning experience since it highlights another thing I need to work on.",Flare200,2025-08-23 00:06:26,28,cscareerquestions,t3_1mxm916,False,

You cannot leave opportunities on the ground especially when they throw themselves at you. You can always outlast a bad manager or coworkers—one of the most important things when determining work satisfaction. You can’t always find a good opportunity to advance yourself. DevOps is close enough to what you’re already doing that you could transition back if you wanted to and it’s a step in the right direction if you decide you want to do more dev stuff. A potential issue is the lack of dedicated support structure or guidance regarding best practices, the future of your company ops, and career development. Certainly in your team, if not the org at large. Been there, done that. That means your trajectory will be up to you to make or break. It’s hard to be a trailblazer, but the benefits can be huge. If you decide you need to go somewhere to do some learning in a year or two, it will be that much easier with the title under your belt. As for being rusty with programming, I wouldn’t stress it too much. I’ve never held the title explicitly, but as a data engineer who has only worked at small companies, I’ve done a lot of ops stuff.

The intern ended up starting and he absolutely exceeded all expectations. I felt like I could give him a task and with only a little guidance, he would figure it out on his own get it done and was really quick to pick up on things. I also didn't have to explain things to him multiple times. He would complete things quickly and with the enthusiasm of someone still fresh in the field.Despite me never wanting an intern in the first place I ended up pushing to hire him after the internship ended and after he finished out his last semester in school. He is now with us full time and whenever raise time comes around, I'm asking my boss what if anything I can do to help him get a promotion/raise- the answer is usually nothing, but I want to keep him because he has proven himself to be super valuable to the team and I know that earlier on in your career is when you can make moves to other companies for the biggest jumps in your career. I guess to me what made the difference was that, he learned/improved quickly and was fairly independent. I didn't have to spell out each and every little step like I would to a chatgpt prompt.

n9wpudx,">Quiet quitting / giving 50% on my day job isn’t an option, management is tracking quite literally ever 30 mins of my day.What would happen if you changed the 100% of your day to mean a regular, 8 hour, 9-5 work day?You're not changing it to 50%, you're not quiet quitting. You're establishing professional boundaries and making it clear that your working hours are 9-5, M-F. You'll be working 100% of your working hours.I don't know how cutthrough the consulting scene is, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but that's the advice I normally give to people suffering burnout. People always think in extremes. ""Put up with being miserable working 12 hour days"" vs ""Quit without anything lined up"".In reality there's usually a less extreme option: ""Enforce your professional boundaries, and work 8 hour days, regardless of what's going on around you with the project and management"". And immediately start job searching with all that extra time.The thing about that approach is even if that ruffles feathers, they usually don't fire you right away. They'll heckle you about your performance, they might PIP you, they'll desperately start looking for your replacement, maybe the client will drop you... but all that often takes months. Firing you outright is a much larger impact to the project than letting you work ""normal"" 8 hour days until they hire and train your replacement. It'd be a stupid management decision to react prematurely.So in that time before they fire you... you're job searching *and* collecting a paycheck instead of draining your savings. And the best part of that approach is if they do end up firing you before you line something else up, you're *exactly* where you were about to put yourself voluntarily: Unemployed.That said, at the end of the day quitting without something lined up isn't the end of the world. It's a calculated risk and an expense. If you decide that's worth it, go for it. If even after reducing your workday to 8 hours you're still feeling miserable, then that's likely not going to help, so quitting ASAP may be the best option for you.I'm surprised you lasted 3+ years of 12+ hour days... I would've be gone in month 1. WLB is my #1 priority. I'm a 9-5 employee.

From the company’s perspective, a billable hour is a billable hour, but overtime hours are expensive, so it’d be perfectly reasonable to work with your leadership chain to cut overtime and hire more people instead. If relying on overtime is widespread, you can probably even rally support from coworkers by getting everyone to complain to leadership simultaneously.The time tracking thing doesn’t need to involve micromanaging. All they care about is for time to be plausably accounted for, you don’t need to annotate every tiny minute.

Then after COVID and work from home, my manager started riding me over every little thing. I had been given tons of independence up to that point because our sales were so great and because my manager honestly didn’t know exactly what it was I did. I built the entire position from scratch and my manager had no computer skills so digital marketing and data analytics were not something he could really check my work on. So as long as number went up, he let me be. I had 5 years of smooth sailing, loved the work, did a good job, etc. So it felt super out of left field when I started getting grief daily.

Wanna know the craziest part? Remember how I was the ONLY employee under my manager, the one who built the entire department from scratch? Well, a week after I got that disciplinary review for poor performance, my manager won employee of the year because of his department’s outstanding performance. He got a big bonus lol. Got called in the next week for another disciplinary review where they tried to push me into a lower pay position (I already got paid well below market standard, like half) and I quit on the spot lol. Sent him all the data I had, updated all my contacts and consultants to email him going forward, sent him a text file with something like 80 or 90 usernames/passwords for the various tools, apps, etc I was handling, and just walked out.

Your resume should obviously be in human readable format but it should be jam packed with enough key words from the job description to get a high enough match and pass the ATS.

What is complexity of accessing a hashmap, what is an interface, what is REST, what is ACID, what is an index and when do you use it, would you choose monolithic or microservices architecture for a startup?2nd round - live coding: TDD approach, language of my choice, editor of my choice, testing framework of my choice, AI disabled. Create a very simple bank account and a way to do a transaction between 2 accounts. Then make it work in a multithreaded environment.3rd round - still live coding but very pseudo-code stuff. Write very simple load balancer (no network stuff, just simple code no real integration), make it random, make it round Robin. Then few stuff about SQL, what is pessimistic locking, what is optimistic locking and how does it work, write SQL for it, show me how to use it. What is a transaction, a dead lock, etc..4th round - system design.. model a system that solves this simple X real problem found in our domain. Just a chat basically.1st round quickly filters out people who don't have basic knowledge2nd round verifies skills in OOP, TDD, multithreading (locks, dead lock, race conditions).3rd round again verifies skills in OOP (bit redundant tbh), but then goes into the DB and verifies that you actually know what is going on under the framework4th round verifies that you know more high-level architecture stuff.. message queues, redundancy, gateway/api/reverse-proxy, sharding... and that you can think bigger than just a few classes.I think these 4 rounds could be compressed in just 3 and be just as effective. Phone call was 15 minutes, the 3 rounds were a little more than 1 hour each. A total of roughly 5 hours that could be shortened to 3.5 or 4.

If this is for senior+ level roles, then not having had many technically challenging projects with wider scope and ambiguous requirements that you need to drive discovery in addition to implementation for is legitimately something that will (and in all fairness should) work against you, because those are exactly the types of projects senior engineers are hired to work on, and companies want to see proof that you can successfully do that type of work.If you're interviewing more for entry to mid level roles, then I think you can make this type of project feel more impressive and impactful by talking about the business need that drove the work, any technical design decisions you made (however small - like researching and deciding to use some third party library), any collaborations you were involved in for the project (both engineering and cross functionally), how you tested and deployed your feature, and what the business impact was.For instance, maybe the technical piece you worked on was just calling some API endpoints to fetch data and building a dashboard in React - pretty straightforward project. In addition to talking about what was involved in coding the dashboard, you should talk about things like: why your company wanted this dashboard built, how you worked with the design team to build your dashboard to their design spec, how you wrote unit/functional/e2e tests and UATed your dashboard prior to deploy, how you used feature flagging and log monitoring to ensure a successful deploy, and what business goals were accomplished after you successfully deployed your dashboard.

That is because:1. They are top tier companies and they can attract top tier talent in countries like India. Bringing top tier talent from India to US would mean paying them 3x or 4x of what they are paid in India. For those companies it does not make any sense to move people from India to US or hire developers of comparable caliber for much higher costs in US.

This is what executives do - it's not that they're guaranteed employment, it's that if you let them go you're going to have to pay them like 2 years of salary in a severance package. Because yes, in the US, because of how employment contracts are built, the only way for someone to guarantee you 3+ years of work would be by signing a 3 year employment contract - and even then, that doesn't guarantee your employment, it just clarifies/defines the remedies you have if they try to break the contract early. Which again, can be literally ""you have to pay me the remainder of my contract"".So yeah, next time don't ask if they can guarantee employment (they can't), but ask what their standard severance package is at your level, and then tell them that since this job would require relocation to a very expensive city (from a very expensive city), that you'd like to negotiate a more substantial severance package to ensure that you're financially able to relocate back to your city of choice.Mind you, depending on your level, they might still say no - especially large companies tend to have pretty inflexibly policies for this type of stuff for rank and file employees.

Be able to convince the other side you know everything from ground up and you are a rock star. And sound super organized.>I've never considered idempotency or what a hash ring is or what golden invariants are. I've never thought about CAP theorem, just that available and consistent is good. Requirements get passed to us by product managers, we never make them from a 5 minute conversation with the BA or stakeholder.This is what my friends (senior engineers) at Google told me.""We just use Spanner for everything. For all practical purposes, Spanner is highly available, highly consistent (basically instant so the 'eventual' part is just theory for practical purposes), and infinite scale.""So ya... now, CAP theorem states that in a real world, we have to choose Availability or Consistency as first priority. And that is true. But generally the idea is if you are dealing with money especially in banks, then choose Consistency. Otherwise, basically all the time Availability is fine.In the real world? Unless you work at Amazon/Google scale, you are going to use postgres/mysql anyways.

Dude, sql databases have run the world forever. Credit cards before the days of DynamoDB worked everywhere around the world. Everyone was swiping left and right. Big banks hold records of swipes, withdrawals, deposits, etc globally. Those dumb Youtube videos during covid by these juniors trying to gain views about high writes == nosql (kind of true but whatever)? sql databases can when writes are properly batched in theory go over a million insert per second though in reality, let's say 10k insert per second. 10k insert per second is 10\^5 \* 10\^5 sec a day = 10\^10 inserts a day aka 10 billion rows a day.Schemaless? Unless you are dealing with e-commerce, fraud, machine learning, etc., you can shove in your metadata to JSONB on postgresql.ACID vs BASE? DynamoDB supports ACID as well. You can have sql databases have BASE like properties. Especially mysql in which you can change engine.Biggest differences are really nosql databases tend to be LSM tree oriented while sql databases tend to be B tree oriented. But DynamoDB on its sort key is B tree oriented as well.Sharding? SQL can have auto sharding. Though it is true in practice (this part I agree since I have not used auto sharding in my jobs) you do have to worry about sharding on SQL. But like what? A few days a year or two for the team once everythings set up?

From there given there's finite time, I can also get someone's thought process and communication. And most importantly, pattern matching skills (which is honestly some of the most important skills on the actual job). Let alone LC at its fundamentals tests on the very basic concepts I would expect every CS grad should know like classes, hashmap, set, bfs/dfs, stack/queue.

If your soon to be wife loves her job, you love your city, you're planning on having kids soon, etc... then that will need to take precedence. That might mean that you let Jan come and try to find a job in the meantime and tighten your belt a bit. Once kids come into the mix, you need to think long and hard about where you want to park for a second. Do you have any networks from college days? Is your manager understanding of the situation? If so, I would have a blunt conversation with them and ask them if you can use them as a reference or if they know anyone around the area that's hiring. Anyone you know that might be at a company, possibly hiring? The market is not great right now, and companies know this, so they're pulling whatever bullshit they can for attrition (my company is doing the same thing although maybe a softer version of yours). To answer your question about your current knowledge, you might want to give yourself more credit. I doubt someone goes into a role for 4 years and ""everyone else is doing the work"". Have you received any promotions since starting? If that's the case, then you probably did something to get there. But the fact that you know Kotlin and Java is good, the industry is full of Java roles. So you could shift to Java (or C#... they're similar enough) and see what's out there. At the end of the day, it's business to companies, but personal to you. This stuff can be really hard mentally and emotionally. I can't tell you which path to take, but if it were me, I would first ask yourself if you want to stay in mobile. If so, then focus on learning the rest of the process. Read up your code base, pick up more Kotlin, learn JetPack Composer, etc. If not, then consider a shift into learning more about Java and/or C# then try your luck there.Most importantly, talk to your partner about the move. If they will be happier where you are, then just explain that you'll be tightening belts until you can find something else.

na2w92a,"First thing I’d suggest is to pause the scattershot learning for a moment. It’s easy to feel like you need to chase every cert or language, but that often leads to burnout without real progress. Instead, reflect on what you enjoyed most from your tech role. Was it the problem solving side of coding, or the precision and detail that comes with testing? If testing was your comfort zone, roles in QA automation or SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) could be a natural pivot. These roles often let you leverage your coding skills while staying close to quality focused work.If you’re craving something new, IT certifications can definitely open doors but you’ll want to be strategic. For example, if you go the cloud route, AWS Solutions Architect Associate or Azure Fundamentals → Administrator can get you noticed quickly. If you lean toward cybersecurity, CompTIA Security+ is a great starting point and pairs well with your testing mindset. The key is to pick one lane, commit, and build a portfolio around it. Whether that’s small projects on GitHub, automation scripts, or even freelance gigs on platforms like Upwork. Freelancing can also be a good bridge though it won’t always be glamorous, but it’s real world experience that helps fill the gap on your resume.If you can structure the next 6–12 months around one clear goal say, “transition into cloud roles” or “move into automation testing” you’ll find it much easier to cut through the fog.

n9vh4gy,"I personally think that of the things which AI will impact the most in this space, its design. I am a fullstack engineer and the biggest trouble I had with personal projects is the designs of my pages. I now can get AI to come up with a theme, a design, a layout, an admin dashboard, a home page and everything for me to use as a basis to build on and bounce my own ideas off.Although I think great design is unbelievably valuable, I think good design is fairly self evident. I mean, I can tell you if a site is well designed - so can my mother. I dont think its difficult for AI to grasp this concept and produce designs for you. Almost all sites have at the very least the same layout; search bar at the top, nav bar top right/left and so on. Beyond this and the small design changes between different sites, I cant see design needing to be done in the way it is now. My team at work no longer needs the amount of designers we have - we got AI to design us a new view based on our existing views and it looked great.The only exception to this (as always there are exceptions) will be exceptional designers in my option. Those designers who come up with new, unique almost game changing designs followed by many. AI wont be able to do this as easily, because AI needs a basis to train on. For example, in the late 2010's we got the gradient design you see on Stripe, with the scrolling animations as you scroll down. I think this design was game changing within the game of design, and so many sites followed this (I dont even know if Stripe were first tbh).I feel like if youre that good, original and can constantly change/push the bar, you'll be fine.
