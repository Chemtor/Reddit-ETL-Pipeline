With cloud you can still use Airflow, but nocode tools start running into the issue of not being customizable enough and you risk running into black box issues, where your etl is wrong and can't see what's going on under the surface.I won't talk much about AI, but that's for me a dangerous push that can ruin a lot of things if you don't have engineers or developers that can keep that on a leash",Stock-Contribution-6,2025-07-19 15:02:31,4,dataengineering,t3_1m3tswv,False,

Boom - you can upgrade and rollback your business logic by just changing which image to use in Airflow's web UI.At this point, Airflow is pure orchestration. This is where it shines in my opinion and you can migrate off relatively easily because your transforms aren't tied to it.If you build all your transformation logic within Airflow, you're in for a world of pain trying to scale your Airflow cluster and deploy / test anything",lightnegative,2025-07-19 20:35:44,3,dataengineering,t3_1m3tswv,False,

It has a lot built in connectors which is great but one of the services I used (hubspot) has new endpoints which aren’t yet available in Airbyte. So I used the builder to set it up myself. It worked well and it think can probably handle a lot more complexity than I tried with it. I’d imagine you could certainly run into limitations compared to a purely custom coded solution, but it’s nice. And when building your own you can give it the documentation and an AI tool tries to build it for you. Your mileage may vary and it didn’t really do what I wanted so I didn’t use it. The other great thing about it is that you can self host. I haven’t tried but the docs make it seems straightforward enough. Then it’s free (other than Infrastructure costs) and you don’t have the normal vendor lock in.

n409lgq,Start by decouping ingestion from orchestration. We had this problem earlier and we realized soon enough that way too much dev time was going into ingestion and basic data cleaning. Integrate.io replaces custom Airflow DAGs for ingestion and Python scripts for basic cleaning. It handles the connectors out of the box. This should solve your API maintenance challenge.Your Airflow instance should only do one thing that is triggering dbt build job after Integrate completes the loads. You would have a tradeoff here where the ingestion logic would reside in Integrate but I think the gains you would have in speed and stability should make this worth it. You can also try Airbyte if you want open source control but it would have different tradeoffs.,Individual-Durian952,2025-07-19 15:10:17,2,dataengineering,t3_1m3tswv,False,

n3h5r81,"Hi, u/alex-acl. AJ from Airbyte here. :waving_hand:Those performance stats sound like they may point to a slower Hubspot connection. Hubspot may have some slower streams which could significantly slow down the rest of the sync if they are the first to run. A general suggestion for API sources (especially when slow) is to deselect any streams that you don't need.In regards to the destination performance (BigQuery), we are starting to roll out our ""Direct Load"" (https://docs.airbyte.com/platform/using-airbyte/core-concepts/direct-load-tables) which may speed up BigQuery load performance up to 2-3x. That said, if the source connector is the real bottleneck, the BigQuery performance boost may not help as much in your scenario. With API-type sources, much of the performance constraint is often in the API itself, but without diving deeper, I can't say specifically if that is true in your case.I hope this info is helpful - and sorry you are seeing poor performance here. Let me know if any of the tips here help, and I or my colleagues will check back again to see if we can further assist.Cheers,AJUPDATE: BigQuery destination connector >=3.0 now supports ""Direct Load"", per changelog here: [https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/bigquery#changelog](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/destinations/bigquery#changelog)",burnfearless,2025-07-16 17:14:54,43,dataengineering,t3_1m1hj09,False,

I'm phrasing this strongly not because I want to scare you away, but because I would like you to be aware of what you are walking into when you say yes. I chose to switch into the managerial track a while back and I must say I really enjoy it. If you have a tech background and can convince people of ideas you can really move the needle.That said, the ""cost"" is that you no longer get to play with any the cool toys yourself. You argue for better tech, fight for approvals, maybe participate in vendor negotiations, but once you get your hands on it you immediately give it to your engineers and they get to have all the fun. If you don't like the sound of that then maybe the managerial track is not (yet) for you :)Also, I had several conversations with people chasing manager positions because of salary. I wouldn't do that. You can get a VP-level paycheck as an architect or principal-level engineer if you are good.

n3hbm7f,"Congratulations on reaching the point in your career where this kind of thing becomes a problem. You are placing your operational decisions in the context of business decisions.Fwiw, it’s not reasonable to expect an out of the box solution to outperform something bespoke. And your conversation is really about custom in-house versus a customisable off the shelf (often abbreviated COTS) solution. It’s not really meaningful to bring open or closed source into it- some of the slowest, crustiest, dogshit code on earth is very expensive and has a proprietary license attached. And if your thinking is ‘in-house = free’ like open source, you are very much mistaken. Honestly, not even open source is actually free, you just don’t need to pay for a license. We can’t really comment on your particular situation without knowing more about it. What code did you implement your custom solution in, for example? What is it actually doing? Is one solution parallelised whilst the other not? Where are your bottlenecks? In 2025, I’m very suspicious of any process that takes 5 actual minutes for less than a million or so rows, frankly. It suggests a configuration issue. But as a more general thing, software is like a pet- it needs to be fed, watered, and periodically taken to the vet. Eventually, you will need to deal with it humanely. If your org can support a development team to maintain your in house solution, good for you! It may be worth considering how well that dev team scales, what else they do, and what their long term prospects look like. Consider the time and salaries of those developers versus an off the shelf approach, for example. You seem to be operating under the illusion that your in house solution is free, when in actual fact their on-cost will be about 2-3x their salary. Your organisation will need to pay that, forever- or at least ass long as that software exists. And if someone gets laid off, do you have the redundancy, resilience, and skill overlap to maintain it?And yes, training new staff becomes an issue when you have custom software- ask any game dev studio why game engines are essential even though custom code is faster, for example.

n3lka0u,"dlt cofounder here: I can explain why you see what you seeMoving data has 2 major bottlenecks: \- Schema inference when goijng from weakly typed data to strongly typed \- network transfer troughput, read/write throughput.if you want dlt to go fast you have the following options \- turn off normalisation and load via fast sql backends like arrow \- go parallel to work around one of the throughput bottlenecks (source, network, destination)The ideal situation is that your transfer is as fast as the bottlenecks allow, so it's quite easy to reach the max speed simply by not doing too much.Also to answer your question, what I would do (i did 10y of DE and dlt is the tool i wish i had) \- use dlt for everything ingestion for standardisation sake \- if any of the jobs are causing **issues**, consider case by case how to deal with itIn your case, \- you have a pipeline that **could be faster - that is not an issue!** \- It **could be cheaper too** (as a function of speed on the same hardware) - that **can be quantified.** 1h/day = 365h/y = hourly infra cost \*365 = **maybe 30 USD per year? That's not really ""worth saving"" because your time will cost more.** If it was more, maybe it would be worth it - but this is the logic i would use to decide these things \- now if you have some **hard requirement,** like data has to arrive by time X, or has to run faster than Z, that could be an issue and that's the moment you look into speeding it up. At this point you could try things like fast backends if you use sql, async, parallelism in dlt. If that doesn't solve the issue, you could write a custom job.

For extra information, this specific pipeline was a glorified select * into our table from a remote oracle db. In this specific case we just 1. Read source table into polars2. Compare with current schema3. Save it into a local parquet file for audits4. Load into SQL Server with csv dump -> bulk insert -> mergewith DLT I skipped the 3rd step, as it was a quick POC. I don't have the exact logs, it was a few weeks ago, but the dlt time distribution was:~10s extract~3,5m normalisation~1.5m insertWhich was weird, since we're reading relational data, and as far as I know normalisation is mostly relevant for nested data. Still, I've tried following dlt optimization instructions, but they didn't help sadly. Here I'd like to note that DLT setup docs for the different sources are top-tier. Even if we didn't end up using it, in a ton of cases we've used their pipeline guides as sources, they're more complete than their counterparts in many cases.Regarding your architect comment - yeah, I feel like I simply don't see all the cost factors, and these are actually quite hard to find. This was the main motivator for the question, currently it seems like I'm one of the main drivers of tech solutions / choices in my team, and I'd like to skip some painful realizations if possible :grinning_face: Regarding cost, you also have these hidden costs with COTS solutions as well, no?1. Integrating these solutions together is usually pretty hard, but the DE space might be better in this regards (AFAIK dagster + dlt + dbt works pretty nice together). Still you now have n systems to maintain, which can break in unexpected ways at the interaction points2.

n37rndw,"Sorry, saw your post yesterday and did not have time to chime in.First let's acknowledge the fact that Kafka with Avro serialisation is a setup for low-latency system-to-system communication.Data exploration is not the right use-case for this. The pains you are encountering are normal, and technology maturity has nothing to do with these.There are a few options depending on size of topic and frequency of user requests. If these are low, then I would suggest giving kSQL a try, I believe it is its initial purpose. Otherwise like another redditor said: writing a little spark tool, like a cli with a --sql option can work.But keep in mind this is going to deserialize potentially all messages in a topic at a time.So if this is too high workload for your laptops, then this is the signal to replicate the data to a system made for data exploration. Your parquet attempts with Kafka connect or Spark are good ones. So keep digging in that direction.The ignoring of tombstones is really strange, it's just a null value for a given key, it should propagate. Is it your experience or is this coming from documentation?Then for the Avro->Parquet with Spark attempt you should not have to use Arrow. Just go from reading the topic (and deserialization) straight to `write.options(...).parquet(...)` There might be some tweaking to allow for dynamic schemas depending on which topic you read, which folder you write to, and some tweaking in the frequency of that job to not write too-small-filesEdit: Additionally: for Avro to Json with Kafka Connect try and set `value.converter.decimal.format` to `numeric` there were a couple of issues like this with Json serde apparently:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-481%3A+SerDe+Improvements+for+Connect+Decimal+type+in+JSON",ManonMacru,2025-07-15 06:06:19,3,dataengineering,t3_1lzx1jg,False,

You are hitting most of the key pieces for a clean modern data stack.**On the architecture:** Snowpipes + dynamic tables is a good combo for simplicity. Just watch out for costs with dynamic tables if you have high refresh frequencies. The integer surrogate keys vs hash keys decision is smart, easier to manage and debug.**dbt thoughts:** Even with Snowflakes native lineage, dbt still brings value for testing, documentation, and standardized transformations. The macro system alone can save you tons of time. Plus if you ever need to migrate platforms, having your logic in dbt makes it way more portable.**Orchestration concerns:** You are right to be worried. Tasks + dynamic tables work for simple stuff but get messy fast with complex dependencies. At DataToBiz we have seen clients start there and end up needing Airflow or similar within 6 months. Consider budgeting for a proper orchestrator from the start, saves headaches later.**Random tip:** Since you are on three separate accounts, make sure your CI/CD handles cross account permissions properly. That's usually where people get tripped up.The biggest lesson from similar migrations is don't underestimate the orchestration piece.

This is in line with existing best practices in Synapse and elsewhere - use Entra instead, e.g. Managed Identity, Service Principals, et cetera instead. So when setting up logins et cetera in Synapse, I'd suggest following that best practice. Here's a doc on this - whole doc is useful, but I've linked to the section on disabling local Auth: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/active-directory-authentication#disable-local-authentication* Ditto on SAS keys and account keys- if you have to, use the user delegated kind. But user passthrough is what we support in both and the modern recommendation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/sql/develop-storage-files-storage-access-control?tabs=user-identity* Dedicated can take a fair bit of fine tuning to run at its best. 500 Gb isn't very large by its standards, which is good, but also, means that you're paying its overheads without getting as much out of it. Fabric Warehouse does a much better job that Dedicated did with that sort of volume, generally* Depending on your needs, I'd consider Serverless as well.

Probably the biggest issue is that it relies on a team having sufficient knowledge of the stack components to maintain the underlying components in production, but this goes back to the packaging and deployment piece. How much of the stack has to be “always on” and how much of it can be spun up and down as needed? The more ephemeral it is, the better it stands as an open alternative.

n3ob076,"Phased rollout and early operator buy-in beat any shiny tech stack every time. When we modernized a steel plant, we started with a shadow pipeline that wrote to a separate lake while the legacy jobs kept running; operators got weekly side-by-side reports, so by the time we flipped the switch they already trusted the numbers. For live dashboards, push events from the line into an Event Hub, land them in Delta, then cache the viz layer (we use Power BI agg tables) so queries never hit production gear. Skip true sub-second unless quality or safety needs it; 5-min windows keep costs sane and still feel instant on the floor. We also set up a burn-down board of manual tasks and let each shift knock one off; that small win loop mattered more than any lunch-and-learn. I’ve run setups with Ignition SCADA for tag collection and Snowflake for fast JOINs, but DualEntry was the piece that finally let finance and ops share one source without nightly CSV fights.

We tried something similar where we let each department pick their first automation win, and yeah the momentum from those small victories was huge.

We've been debating whether to go sub-second on some dashboards but you're right, 5-minute windows are usually plenty and way cheaper. Production systems already have enough to worry about without us hammering them with queries.Quick question - how did you handle the transition period when both systems were running? We're worried about data drift between legacy and new pipeline, especially with inventory reconciliation. Did you automate the comparison reports or was it more manual spot checking?Also curious about DualEntry, haven't heard of that one before.

n3uxa88,"hi op, i have graduated with a bachelors in biotech too! however, i didnt really enjoy it much starting out and the biotech scene here is pretty rough here too so ive pivoted into DE entirely. i pretty much went on a self taught journey + doing solo projects which landed me my first data job as a data analyst. i started off with the very basics where i learned to code with python. i managed to write small python scripts and played around with data using pandas. i've also applied for sponsored programmes where data related courses are provided by the government or scholarship foundations to which i earned 3 data science certificates which definitely helped too. you don't exactly need 3 lol, i was just taking these programmes since they were fully sponsored and they do help prove that i am serious about data since i didnt have a data background in the first place. as a data analyst i got the chance to tackle many projects where i got to work closely with the DE team and eventually started doing DE tasks on my own. due to my DE experience i started applying for DE roles and am currently working as a DE in the banking industry. where im from, age and background doesn't really matter, currently my team members are all much older than i am and also have different backgrounds. as long as you show that you are capable of meeting the job requirements, orgs will be willing to hire you no matter your background, so no worries on that! one thing that i can say that helped me pivot quickly is that i dedicated alot of my time in just learning anything data related. to me it didn't really matter whether i was learning DA/DS/DE, i just enjoyed doing anything data related and nowadays i notice that everything i have learned has had their applications in every job i had, and i'm sure there will be more opportunities where i get to apply whatever i learned in the future too. so don't worry too much on the roadmaps or what learning path you are taking at first. as long as you are playing with data, you are gaining experience to eventually become a DE or whatever data role you wish to have. once you have a strong foundation, you can start to specialize into a specific role. there are definitely data roles for biotech companies too as data is pretty much used everywhere now. i've seen frequent data opportunities in the pharma, agricultural, and food manufacturing industries. good luck !",tooshybums,2025-07-18 18:07:45,1,dataengineering,t3_1m20hlw,False,

But then...Once we create a ""multi-dimensional array"", ie an array where each element is an array and write a nested loop to iterate through each array, no matter how smoothly I tried to guide students through it (which I always tried new things to build up to it and put significant effort into), just about everyone's' minds break and it's like they suddenly know nothing haha.Suddenly they can't even write if statements anymore. :man_facepalming:It was a problem I tried to solve so many times, but I couldn't.My theory of what happens is the following:A multi-dimensional array is effectively the first ever ACTUAL ""application"" or ""practical usage"" of computer science.Up to that point, students learn just raw mechanics (variables, conditions, loops, etc) but don't apply them to anything...It's never easy to leave the raw mechanics world and enter the world of applying your mechanics towards real-world problems.It's like your first time jumping off the high dive. It's always uncomfortable and challenging! And, that's okay!It's when you start to realize that simple logic can get complex quite quickly.

Don't be afraid to experiment. Play around. Break things. Fix them. Practice, practice, practice, and practice more.+ Don't go looking for tutorials for everything. Learn to stand on your own feet. In that line, do a proper fundamentals course and then throw away the training wheels and start building.+ Don't give up too quickly. If you get stuck, go away. Take a break. Do something mundane, something with low brain activity. Go for a walk, go to the gym, take a shower, clean up, whatever. Then, often the answer comes by itself or if not, sleep over it.+ Don't use AI for anything other than explanations.+ Don't put a ""code first"" approach. Code is only the means to tell the computer what we want it to do. The steps before the code, the *algorithms*, the *steps by step solutions* to tasks are what really counts. Sit down with pencil and paper and go through the task. Analyze it. Break it down. Solve it *your* own way, as *you, the person* would do it. Track the steps. Then, once you have a working solution, think about how to *implement* the steps in code. Remember that you can't solve what you don't understand.+ Don't be afraid to ask questions. Yet, when asking, demonstrate your efforts in the line of ""I have researched *this*"", ""I have tried to understand *that* but am stuck at *this*"". Don't just ask ""How to do *this*"" as such questions will not be well received.+ Make the documentation of the language you are learning your best buddy. Make heavy use of it. Learn to work with it.+ Your other best buddy should be good old Dr. Google (or the search engine of your choice)+ Expect to be slow. Expect to run against obstacles. That's completely normal when learning. Only those who do not give up and conquer the obstacles (certain stubbornness is necessary here) can succeed.+ Do not look at how much you have to learn - it is a mountain that you cannot reach the summit. Look at the path, the steps ahead of you and walk one step after the other. This way, it becomes a lot more manageable and less disheartening.+ Be prepared for a lifetime of learning. You will never ""master"" anything. You will become *proficient* and you have to be satisfied with that.**Edit:** something more+ Adjust your approach to *failure*. Don't see it as something negative. It is completely normal to fail. See it as *gained experience*. You now know how not to do something. That is more than you knew before you tried it. It is equally important to know how not to do something as to know how to do something.

I don't say this just to be contrarian, but because this comparison leads to what I think is actually quite bad advice right here in this post. With spoken languages, yes, focusing on precision is a bad idea because they're usually vast, highly contextual, meaning is frequently ambiguous and it can be achieved through other means. For example, in a great many languages a question can be achieved either through the structure of a sentence. ""Am I going"" vs ""I am going"" but it can also be achieved through tone. ""I am going."" vs ""I am going?"". We talk in language learning about something called tolerance for ambiguity, learning to accept speaking and listening without fully understanding everything, because the scale of what you need learn is vast and you're trying to actively fire up a part of your brain that will start working on what currently sounds like gibberish and start building meaning out of it.

n3gsm6y,"Just a bit of a historic tangent note: Back in the late 1970's and early 1980's I only encountered the usage of ""unusual"" characters in passwords that were accessible by keyboard on one computer: The Apple ][e computer! Its OS and built in version of Basic allowed you to press CTRL characters as part of your password. --------------------------------So for example, you could type a password like: monkey123or you could type: m[CTRL-O]nkey12[CTRL-3]Both were completely different passwords. The cool thing about the Apple at that time, was that when you pressed the ctrl character as part of your password, it would do 2 things: first it would register that as an actual character of your password, and then it would next, do the function of the special control character. So if your password had the letter ""g"" and you replaced it with [CTRL-G], well first it would record CTRL-G as a keystroke as part of the password and insert that into the input. But then it would do the function of the CTRL character like ring the speaker bell, or whatever. It was quite a fun and unsual way of handling keyboard input that I don't think I ever seen since. I liked it! --------------------------------ALSO: On the IBM PC at that time, in theory there was nothing really stopping you from doing the same thing... So for example with an extended ASCII character set of 256 characters, including ctrl characters and graphics characters... You could use almost any of it for your password. But... the trouble was the way the keyboard talked to the OS MS-DOS and the BIOS, which was not the same as the way the Apple ][e would handle it. So if you pressed a CTRL character, for example, then the computer would just do the function of that ctrl character, such as ring the bell when you pressed CTRL-G, but not pass that on as an actual input character to the running program. And then as far as special graphics characters go, well the IBM keyboard had no way for you to directly type them, unlike the Commodore 64 for example, in which many of the graphics characters were displayed on the side of the keys, and could be typed with a special function key. --------------------------------Also interestingly: On the IBM PC running MS DOS back then, you could even use graphic characters in filenames which suprisingly as a kid experimenting, I found that out on my own! (None of my other computer geek friends had ever tried that, which surprised them when I showed them.) This would actually add some limited security via obscurity, helping make it a bit harder for people to poke around with your files on a floppy disk, because they could not just simply or directly open or run them by keyboard. --------------------------------ESSENTIALLY: In order to access a file back then with special graphics characters on the IBM, you'd have to write a batch file or Basic program to specifically address those unusual characters. Otherwise again there was no way to type those characters on the keyboard to do what you wanted with it. You could however still copy the files all you want using the command: copy a:*.* b: That would copy them from floppy drive a to b. So it wouldn't give you any copy protection, but still even on the next disk, you had the problem of getting to the files with a keyboard alone. --------------------------------Funny enough: All this to say is that I did use it to build in a somewhat half copy protection security and self-destruct feature! So ya: I was working on my ""big program"" at the time. It was a clone of Macpaint but on the IBM PC. I was using Basic and Assembly language. (It did some of the basic stuff of Macpaint, and visually it looked good! And you could move a pointer around with a mouse or arrow keys.) And so I didn't want my friends to ""steal"" the code (lol! As if they would!) when I gave them a copy to try on their computer. --------------------------------THUS: What I did was make all the files with special graphics characters only, except for the file which you could type to run the program. Next, one of the weird graphics character files was actually a pure text data file that just simply had a single integer. A run counter. So each time you ran the program it would just update the counter, from say, 0 to 1. And then the second time you ran it, it would update to 2, etc... When the program ran, it would check and see how many times you ran it. And if you exceeded the limit I put, it would then perform an ""Erase *.*"" on the floppy disk, and then next start a full reformat of the disk, LOL!

n4150yu,"> So I understand that computers run on bits that are either 0s or 1s. And programming is the manipulation of these 1s and 0s via a programming language. It's a bit more nuanced, but lets say this is kind of true.In any case, at the lowest level that is worth talking about, it's possible to connect some wires to the CPU/microcontroller and directly influence the electricty. But usually people don't do that, because both the computer/environment and the programming part have multiple levels of abstraction.First: The computer has ""firmware"" built in, which is basically small existing software that is part of the hardware components. One of its features is also that, when you turn the computer on, it loads other software from some predefined place (ie. the 0/1, or rather 0-255, that are stored there), and continues with executing this - so that you don't need additional physical wires to control your computer. This other software, that is loaded, can be called operating system (OS). And the OS then also doesn't do ""everything"" with 0/1 directly, but can give some known commands to the firmware (that the firmware understands).This data that is the operating system, you could create the 0/1 manually. But again people don't really do this. There is ""assembly"", which is a very basic, hardware-dependent programming language. There are commands like eg. MOV and PHMINPOSUW, no convenient loops, classes or anything like that. A helper program called assembler translates such a program to the binary data that can be executed.And, for both manual-binary or assembled programs, there's also the question of the environment that it runs in. Should it be an operating system that works directly with the hardware/firmware? Or should it run ""within"" an existing operating system, where it doesn't get to access the hardware anymore, but can access things provided by the OS?As next level, languages like C/C++/COBOL/Rust/.... Here you get compilers that translate this programming language into assembly. These languages are less hardware-dependent, instead you get different compilers for different hardware platforms (producing assembly for their specific platform). Once again, it's important to decide if you want to make an OS, or a program to run on an existing OS like Windows or Linux. The code will be quite different. As you know C, you surely know things like printf - that's not something the hardware and assembly can do, it's part of an existing OS (and it's libraries). When writing C to make an OS, you have to make your own printf too, by using firmware things that allow you to contorl the screens output.ObjC etc. are not C, please don't confuse them.Next level are languages like Kotlin, as you expected. With Kotlin, Java, C# and so on, there is no compiler that directly produces assembly anymore. It's technically possible to create such a thing, but no one is doing it. Compiling to C code is possible too, but again unusual. Instead they have their own compiled program format, that is unrelated to what the hardware can understand. And in addition to the compiler, they need a second helper program (written in C etc.), that during each execution takes this custom binary format and each time ""translates"" it to real native things on the fly. It might sound weird, but there are advantages too (and disadvantages too).",dkopgerpgdolfg,2025-07-19 17:51:54,5,learnprogramming,t3_1m41o5i,False,

There’s a huge global system (the Domain Name System) that manages the mapping from domain names to IP addresses, and your computer relies on that system to resolve any domain names to IP addresses.URLs, or Uniform Resource Locators, are strings that can be used to specify the locations of resources. The host name portion of an URL can use a domain name or an IP address to specify a host (which might actually be more than one machine), but each scheme (the first part of the URL, e.g. `https:`, `mailto:`, etc.) has its own rules for interpreting the rest of the URL. For example, the `tel:` scheme is followed by a phone number rather than host name.There’s no real difference between accessing a machine via IP or domain name; the sending machine resolves a domain name into an IP address using DNS as part of establishing communication.

They work like mailing addresses and just like mailing addresses have nothing to do with whether there’s a locked door or even a building at the site. Also, just as a large building might have an internal mailroom, computers connecting to a local network like your WiFi router will have a local address behind your internet connection’s public one. They usually start with 192.168 or 10.x. These local devices cannot be reached directly unless a forwarding rule of some kind is set up. They can only receive responses to their requests and this affords them a lot of protection from attack. The DNS system is an aliasing system. You can buy or really rent with the right to renew a domain like mysite.com from a trusted registrar. They’ll have a portal where you can specify that mysite.com should direct traffic to a certain ip address or forward it to another domain. There are other entries for email addresses using that domain and several options. Browsing to the site involves using DNS to do a destination lookup and then sending traffic to the final ip. This also allows those IPs to change if needed. The second part of this is traffic encryption using a ssl cert the registrar sells you and verifies on the fly. This addresses most DNS breaches other than the authority itself because the traffic recipient must also have a copy of the cert.None of this is actually securing your computer. It’s just addressing and impersonation prevention and traffic encryption.

Programmers are somewhat similar, we go from project to project, and they often fail spectacularly, so might as well get used to it, by failing early :weary_face:Anyways, I had a lot of crazy ideas as a young programmer, I wanted to make a text-adventure solely from if-then statements, and drew up an impossible mess of a flow-chart. Never worked, but it was fun anyways, and taught me a lot about how not to code. I've also tried to make my own operating system, an 8-bit multitasking microkernel system for the Commodore 64 - never got very far, but learned a lot about handling the stack and memory, and task switching and semaphores and mutexes and so on! I also tried my hand at my own rendering-engine for HTML and CSS - didn't get very far, but got a lot of insight into how CSS is supposed to work, and why it is like it is ...So, if you can accept that you are doing projects, not because you want to succeed with the project and somehow publish it to someone, but because you think it would be a fun learning experience, then go ahead!

Most companies have existing Java codebases and need people to maintain them.But honestly? Pick whichever one doesn’t make you want to cry while coding. I’ve seen people succeed with both. The fundamentals (databases, APIs, system design) matter more than the language.If you’re really torn, learn Java first (it’ll make you a better programmer overall), then pick up Python later.

Learn JavaScript (language) and React Native (framework) and build one app that will run on both iOS and Android.3. Learn Dart (language) and Flutter (framework) and build one app that will run on both iOS and Android.Native apps (meaning, not React Native or Flutter) are almost always better in terms of appearance and performance, but many popular apps use React Native or Flutter, so they're not bad options.If you go with option #2 and learn JavaScript, you will also have a head start on web development (building websites), so it's not a bad idea for a beginner.Either way, you'll have a lot to learn. How you learn is up to you.

n31eaes,"1. What language?This does of course matter but not as much as you think. The real learning you do is learning how to think like a programmer. How you do algorithms, how you solve problems, how to be efficient, how to have a clean structure and style. After you learned with your first language you can jump into most other language pretty fast. I started with C++ and when I had to use Phython I read the documentation and boom. You really only need to learn programming once, the languages are just a tool and you switch tools for different purposes.That doesn't mean you shouldn't specialize. All languages have their own merrits but the thinking you have to do while writing stays the same. Specializing is something you should think about after learning your first few languages.And honestly with languages like Python there is not much to specialize in. But others like C++ people who are really specialized to that specific language are very valuable to some companies. But we are talking about really expert level technical knowledge of a very complicated language. It is dry and the work isn't very interesting, at least for me.My starting recommendations are:- C++I started with this one so I am biased and you need to know that you probably won't ever fully grasp everything about this language. It can do everything, it is used for everything, C is the backbone of programming. If you are good at C++ thats a real thing to be proud of and from there on you will tackle every other language. Still very hard and frustrating to learn. Some even start with C and I think thats also a really good starting point. C doesn't offer the same quality of life stuff that C++ does but that just means that tackling the hurdles that language presents really teaches you that ""logic"" that I talked about earlier. Tho I'm not sure how much that will help in real-life since you will most likely use a more user friendly language anyway. I'd say C++ offers almost the same experience while beeing way more beginner friendly.- Python If you have trouble with C++ (wich is totally fine, as I said C++ is a real challenge) Python is amazing. It is fast to learn, it is convenient and most of all Python is really really fun to start with and that is super important while learning. For real don't torture yourself with C++ too much, just switch to Python and try C++ later!2. What branch?Honestly just try out a few different things.

n42263f,"Whoa there's a lot to be said here. But I'm in a somewhat similar situation at the moment and quite burned out, so I'll try to cover all the important stuff:1. Whatever you want to do (career change, learn new stuff, etc), ensure you have a way to sustain yourself. In this case, ""sustain yourself"" could mean leaving your current job and living off savings for a while... Enumerate your options and pick any option that works for you. There may be multiple correct answers and multiple wrong answers1. Using one extreme case as an example: let's suppose you choose to stay at your current job and try to learn new things in parallel (this is more or less your current situation). Realize that your bandwidth is limited and the more burned out you are, the faster you will subsequently burn out if you don't let up on the pressure. 1. Learning while on the job: if you are able to draw a connection between your current job and programming, you might be able to pitch it as a professional development exercise to gain employer support1. I recently read [an article about Amazon employees reading 1-4h every day][amazon-reading]. Maybe there's something to it and your daily reading could be programming1. Learning programming is less about reading and more about fiddling/tinkering. At least for me, the learning correlated more with practice than reading earlier on. Later in my practice, I was able to learn more from reading than I was previously able to, but tinkering (trying out new ideas that I've read about) has always been part of my learning loop.1. it sounds like consistently finding bandwidth is an issue. Consider that your learning journey could be slow and bursty. So read about a small topic today and practice it for 10min. Practice it again tomorrow for 10min. Maybe you'll have more bandwidth day after, so practice it for 25min. The following week, start the next topic. In this example, I mean ""topic"" to be something as simple/small/atomic as list slicing. Adopting this strategy will keep you within your available bandwidth (and thus avoid/mitigate burnout), but it is slower than (for example) a bootcamp or a structured course.1. Eventually (on like a long weekend or something), try building a side project. Once you start down this path, two things happen: (1) you'll start trying to apply all new concepts to your project and (2) your project becomes your guiding light for what to learn next. This second thing is a super powerful driving force in helping you learn new and useful things.1. Remember always to listen to your burnout meter. You can't learn if you're burned out. It's counterintuitive and difficult to implement, but if you're feeling the early stages of burnout, STOP. Write out your ideas on a whiteboard or a piece of paper... or record yourself on TikTok; find a way to externalizing your ideas so that you're not constantly ruminating over them when your brain is asking for a break (I used a notebook and a pen...

Also just silly little experiments with inputs and branching, like a stupid chat-bot that doesn't really understands what you are writing, but just looks for keywords.I like to think of it as being creative with LEGO bricks - you have a collection of sets, with instructions, and you've seen how you can use the bricks you have to build those sets. Now if you take all the sets apart, what else could you maybe build with the same bricks? Could you make a spaceship or a western town or a ghost train? Just having some vague idea, and trying to connect bricks will get you a long way - and the cool thing about programming is that you never run out of bricks, but you sometime have to learn just a tiny bit more (add a few more bricks to your collection) to build exactly what you want.So start with assessing your collection of ""bricks"" - what kind of problems could you solve with what you have?",peterlinddk,2025-07-14 08:05:14,2,learnprogramming,t3_1lzfbvf,False,

The first stuff I did wasn't coding from scratch, it was playing around with other people's code. I learned in the pre-internet times, so my first code was copied from Gardner's column in Scientific American. I also dissected the sample programs that came with QBasic on MS-DOS (and hacked out the sound so we could play it in class without the teacher noticing).The real blast was when I found a Connect Four implementation written in Pascal on a school computer.

My first project was, I own a lot of movies and series a combination of DVDs, and Blu-Rays. When friends came over they would go, can I borrow this i'd love to watch it. Then maybe 2 weeks to a month later I would get it back. I didn't mind this, but my memory is bad due to an illness, bad enough that I have purchased a movie twice before, because I thought I had lost it only to get it back from a friend later. So I made an app in PHP + MySQL database my preferred language to keep track of my movies, what medium it was DVD or Blu-Rays, actors/actresses, directors and whether it was lend out or not, and who borrowed it from me. Later I found jreklund/php4dvd on Github. It's much much better than what I did, with IMDB integration and a fancy layout with covers and all. But I still appreciate what I learned making my own.Another project I made was my own version of [https://pinboard.in/](https://pinboard.in/) Both of these is something I made to use myself. I did share my movie database thing on Github because I made it before I was aware of php4dvd.I haven't put the bookmarks PHP script on Github because why would I when something like Pinboard exists. I easily could I think, I am honestly not sure, I just tried to code and replicate the features to have something to do, to keep coding and remembering PHP. If I don't code for a while I get very rusty, do we all do that?Anything I make that I think might be useful i put on repositories like Github or Bitbucket with a GPL open source license.

n31no19,"When you are first starting, some people find flowcharts easier to understand. They are a graphical representation so it is ""friendly"" in some way. Explaining procedures that involve branching (""conditions"" in non-techie speak) to non-programmers is also often done with a flowchart and ""not"" pseudocode, by the way. So in some way, flowcharts seem to be naturally are intuitive to all audiences. Personally I think it's due to the uses of little arrows that can point in whichever direction. And I think it's been shown that most humans have a sort of ""spatial memory"" of sorts, so if you're following such a diagram you can think of each box of the logic as a little room in which you are standing. Following another arrow goes to another room, and so on. Also you can add little pictures, colors, etc. to such a digram to make it more fun, if you want.However, when you're actually writing out code, a lot of people don't like to draw that much (at least I don't). If I'm thinking about how to do a problem on a whiteboard, or on paper, then I prefer ""pseudocode"".One time I ""do"" prefer a diagram, though, is whenever there's a ""state machine"" in the code, or if I'm implementing a data structure that has a natural graphical or tabular representation (e.g. lists, trees, matrices, etc.). In such a case, I like the graphical representation but I will heavily abbreviate it in writing. But in the code I will use clear labels at each state for maintainability/""greppability"" purposes.So in summary: you should ultimately aim to learn to read/write all forms of these ways of expressing a program. The flowchart and/or pseudocode are intended to be ""programming language"" neutral and to be read by a human.

Your interview is next week, and there's nothing technical you're going to learn between now and then which will matter more than the things you've learned in the last four years. The prep you do should be focused on refreshing your existing knowledge, not trying to suddenly guess what they might want and cram something new. You want to be confident about what you know, and know well. If you don't know .NET well enough for this job now, you won't learn enough in a week, and you risk picking up some shallow knowledge that you can't back up which will make you look like you're bluffing. You're applying for a junior position, that *should* mean they're not looking for direct working experience. They want to know that you can code, that you aren't lost as soon as you're pushed on something, and that you'll be able to do the *kinds* of work they do if not the specifics. If they set you a technical challenge of some kind, just don't overthink it. Break it down to its simplest form and write it one step at a time.

The way you tackle a problem is very similar if not the same. The languages just give you a couple of different tools to do it but in my experience, my strategy for tackling a problem would be similar whether I did it in Java or C#.One thing I'd offer as advice is that if you're asked to solve a problem and you get stuck, think out loud. Tell them what you know, what you think you know, what you're trying to figure out, etc. It's easier for them to evaluate if they know what you're trying to figure out and they might even ask you some questions that might trigger something to help you solve the problem.

n3fetih,"> I noticed today that if you free(ptr), and forget to set it to NULL, then you have no way to know later, when trying to access or modify it, that it was actually freed! It will keep pointing to the same address in memory, but that address may now be of other, unrelated variables. This may not even cause the program to crash, right?Correct, dereferencing a pointer after the end of the lifetime of the object it points to is [undefined behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior) and technically, the program is allowed to do absolutely anything from that point on.This doesn't just apply to memory allocated with `malloc`. It also applies to local variables, whose lifetime ends when at the end of the corresponding function or block.> Is there any downside to always using this macro, rather than always writing 2 lines manually?Well, the C preprocessor is just a dumb text substitution engine. So in terms of the compiled code, using your macro is exactly the same as writing the statements directly. (The [`do { ... } while (0)` construct](https://c-faq.com/cpp/multistmt.html) is a trick to make the macro behave correctly as though it were a single statement.)The biggest issue I have with your macro is that the name is misleading. It's not really ""safe"" because it doesn't prevent the underlying problem. In particular, if you ever pass around copies of a pointer (which is common) then just setting one copy to `NULL` doesn't affect the other copies. So if you're uncertain whether an object has been freed, then checking whether the pointer is `NULL` is not reliable on its own, unless you also know that nowhere else in your program is calling `free` on a copy of the pointer.And likewise, calling `SAFE_FREE` on a local pointer variable is not *necessary* when the pointer variable is going out of scope. If the variable is disappearing, it doesn't matter whether you set it to `NULL`. (In fact, the compiler would probably optimize out the assignment statement.)If I were reading your code and I saw something like `SAFE_FREE`, I would have to look up the macro definition anyway to see what it was actually doing in terms of memory management. Writing `free(ptr); ptr = NULL;` directly is clearer, in my opinion.In general, C is a language that *demands* you constantly pay attention to memory management at all times. This is just a habit you need to develop. Other languages provide better tools to assist you with this. For instance, C++ has ""smart pointers"" that act as an abstraction layer above regular pointers. The smart pointer is responsible for knowing when it's safe to call `free` on the underlying pointer.",teraflop,2025-07-16 11:24:59,6,learnprogramming,t3_1m19foy,False,

n3fhzgo,"> [A freed pointer] will keep pointing to the same address in memory, but that address may now be of other, unrelated variables. This may not even cause the program to crash, right? You are correct. If you incorrectly try to resuse something that you alread ""freed"" then there is no rule that says that your program will crash. It is however undefined behaviour, so the technique you are quoting here is a fine one, and many programmers do that. It is a well-known technique that is commonly used, which is probably the reason the LLM is giving it to you as if it is something special.As mentioned elsewhere, the benefit of using a macro here is perhaps slim to none. When I've seen this done in code, it's normally just done without a macro, by using an explicit assignment of NULL to the pointer after the deallocation is done. free(my_ptr); my_ptr = NULL;The same thing is done when programming in C++, when using new and delete (many C++ programmers will assign the pointer a value of NULL or nullptr after delete'ing it).Clearly, setting the pointer to a value of NULL should not be needed, but the reason it's considered ""safer"" is because it ""almost guarantees"" the behaviour later if you do make a mistake and try to reuse that pointer. For example, if you ""accidentally"" call free again on that pointer again down the line (I don't know why you would), then free is guaranteed to do nothing in that case.The more important mistake that you want to catch is if your code accidentally deferences that pointer later on as if it were still pointing to valid data. If it's a NULL pointer (because you are using the ""safe"" technique""), then on all systems I've seen, dereferencing the NULL pointer will crash the program. Formally speaking, though, derefencing a NULL pointer is either undefined behaviour or ""implementation defined"". But for all practical purposes, you can rely on a derefence of NULL being a fatal event on most systems (at least on all Desktop systems). It's a bit funny that we consider crashing the program to be ""safer"" than not crashing, but it turns out it's much easier to debug a crash caused by a null pointer dereference (i.e. ""segmentation fault"" on Linux) than it would be to debug accidentally dereferencing a ""stale"" pointer that was pointing to some old data.",chaotic_thought,2025-07-16 11:47:22,1,learnprogramming,t3_1m19foy,False,
n3fj90h,"Consider the following code, which isn't an unusual pattern to follow. Notice where the SAFE\_FREEs occur: typedef struct Foo {     // members     InnerMember* innerMember; } Foo; Foo* createFoo() {     Foo* foo = malloc(sizeof(Foo));     foo->innerMember = malloc(sizeof(InnerMember));     // init inner member     // ...     return foo; } void destroyFoo(Foo* foo) {     // Free inner member     SAFE_FREE(foo->innerMember);     SAFE_FREE(foo); } int main() {     Foo* foo = createFoo(); // Do things to foo.     destroyFoo(foo);     return 0; }In the first SAFE\_FREE case, you're setting innerMember to NULL, which is unnecessary, as the pointer itself will be going away. In the second SAFE\_FREE, you're setting the passed pointer to NULL, and it goes away as well. The pointer that matters is the outer pointer, which is *not* set to NULL.I'd say that, unless you're legitimately writing lots of free/nulling pairs, the macro is not only going to not help, but it's going to give a false sense of security. You need to set pointers to NULL in a meaningful way, and that often means NULLing them some place besides where the *physical* free takes place, happening more where the *logical* free is occurring (e.g. destroyFoo being the logical destruction point).Only you can say whether it will help you or not. It may be a less verbose approach. But I wouldn't consider it a *safer* option if it stops you from actually thinking about who is owning memory and making sure that state is handled consistently, not just looking locally at the point where the actual memory freeing occurs.Edit: if you had a function like destroyFoo, you could make it take a Foo\*\* (pointer to the pointer) and then NULL the outer pointer out at the end.

Enums are generally used as like a switch… lets say you had something with three different states, Running, Idling, or Off. While you could store this as a dictionary or array, this is what Enums are built for. They are a very simple data structure. Arrays are best for lists. Most languages support adding new items to your array, removing items from your array and have support for doing something to every item in an array. While in this case, you have an array of strings, commonly the elements within the array are more complex. Consider storing a list of books… you will want an author, a book name, a genre, for each item in the list. Enums can’t do this, and while a dictionary could, there are some drawbacks to using a dictionary in this way. Dictionaries are great for things like your actual book object. They have constant time access, so it’s easy to store a value and look up a value in this way. You can also assign more complex values to dictionaries, not just strings, which makes them better for anything more complex than an enum. They however are not the easiest to iterate through, and adding values requires you to also have a key to store the value to. For most languages, the keys are not ordered either, which is why for a changing list an array is better. Hope that helps!",LouManShoe,2025-07-18 04:20:57,7,learnprogramming,t3_1m2sgve,False,

n3snlg3,"*Note: I don't know about the specifics of GDScript, so this is a generic answer that should apply to all languages.*The only practical difference between the two versions is that enums uses simple numeric indexes, and dict uses strings (or any other kind of objects) as keys. Enums are technically faster, but that rarely matters.What is a huge difference though, is the errors you might get when compiling and the help your editor gives you in avoiding those errors.If you tried this with the enum version: print(fruitColor[Fruit.PEACH])you would get an error telling you that PEACH isn't defined, and you'd probably discover it early when trying to write PEACH, and autocomplete didn't help at all!But if you tried this similar thing with the dict version: print(fruitToColourDict[""peach""])you would get a print or NULL or Undefined, or nothing, depending on the exact language used. You probably wouldn't be told that ""peach"" did not exist in the dict, and you also wouldn't get any hints from the autocompletion while writing it, that it might be wrong. Enums aren't just ""lists of words"", they should be considered more like a custom variable-type, like a boolean that can be `true` or `false`, you can create your own types, like a return value that can be `true`, `false` or `fileNotFound`. They are extremely useful when writing code, because you always know that you only use values that the rest of the program will expect.Dicts on the other hand, are used more when you don't know all the possible values when writing the program - and you might want the program itself to add more keys to the list of known values.",peterlinddk,2025-07-18 11:06:04,1,learnprogramming,t3_1m2sgve,False,

You can't add to them or remove from them.For Dict vs array, if you want to find something in an array you need to loop through it and compare.This is slow, especially on a hot path (something that is called often, e.g. in a loop)You won't see much of a difference in simple code that doesn't do much, or with small arrays, but as you get into thousands of objects, using a dictionary to store a reference to something that is not an index will be far faster than an array search.As always, it depends on what you have and what you want to do.",rupertavery,2025-07-18 13:01:16,1,learnprogramming,t3_1m2sgve,False,

Generate a random number from 1 to 100 (or whatever range you prefer) 2. Prompt the user for a number guess3. Read user input 4. Convert user input to a number so you can compare it to your secret number5. Tell the user whether their guess is higher or lower than the secret number6. Loop steps 2-5 until the number is guessed, and then exit the loop and print a victory messageIt might not sound the most exciting, but practice is good even for simple ideas. Games can be an engaging way to learn. They can also get way more complex than most ""real"" software for business.

Most find the second language intolerable because it does things differently from the first, especially if the language is quite a bit different. If you went from C to C++, that's like learning more C. If you go from C# to Java, they will feel like similar languages. If you go from Python to Java, Java would likely seem way to verbose and too concerned with types.It's nice to know a few other languages, but for now, getting decent at Python is a good first step.**Learn Selenium**OK, that's out of left field. If you can't build a web page, learning Selenium seems advanced. It's often used to run automated steps on a browser, often for testing purposes. It's a little like learning to fix a car before you learn how to drive.

n2xz8ur,"I think that learning python is a journey. No one course or class will get you to mastery of python. I have seen many students believing that doing a course gets them there. I think going through some beginners books or courses like you do is certainly a good start. I like this book which is available on GitHub for free and you can work on it directly in Colab: [https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/)going through some texts gives you ""muscle memory"" and usually helps. Once you have done the course and worked through a book, it should be much easier to see where you are going. Especially for Python there are lots of great resources. When people speak about ""advanced Python"" it is not a specific course, but rather some ideas/concepts/approaches that you do not see in a beginners course. These could include iterators and generators (e.g. yield), decorators and content managers (with, wraps), typing and packaging (type hints, virtual environments, concurrency (async, await), metaprogramming (metaclasses, \_\_getattr\_\_, descriptors), performance and memory (profiling, understanding how NumPy works).I think that consistency is important. It is a matter of working 1-2 hours every day. After 3 months you should be at a good beginner level. 9-12 months might get you closer to being ready for a job. Of course, everybody is different and times depend on the individual. Using AI to help explain code or comment on your code. If you use it wisely it can act as a personal tutor. (It can also solve most of the beginner exercises, but then you don't learn much.) There is also material you should learn like a web framework, databases, testing (pytest) , git, docker, basic deployment. I would think of this as an ongoing task. There is much to learn and you should continuously expand your skillset. In fact there is so much that each software engineer or programmer develops a rather individual profile as you cannot learn everything. For a new project you might need to learn a new tool or a new skill, which is why after many years you become a more rounded programmer. By the way, it turns out that employers often like experienced programmers at a level that early graduates/beginners can hardly achieve. It is a good idea to work on many different projects of your own, and put them on GitHub to develop a portfolio of projects and skills to show off.

It might be the case that an integer *must* appear at an address that is a multiple of 4.That's what ""Alignof"" gives you. Why would you want that? Honestly, unless you are dealing with low level stuff (drivers and such) you will probably never care about this.As for Kea DHCP, this is a DHCP server. DHCP is a network management protocol and in order to understand what it is you need to know a few things about networks.So I wouldn't necessarily expect you to understand either of these. The documentation likely won't assume you are starting from scratch. It's going to assume a generate familiarity with the domain. Just as a document that describes how to adjust the timing on a Chevy 350 is going to assume you know what a car is and where to find the engine in the car (pro-tip: it's in the front).",lurgi,2025-07-17 21:30:14,3,learnprogramming,t3_1m2jf07,False,

n3pf5zm,"Sorry if this is unsatisfying, but the only general answer I can give you is ""it depends on the situation"".Any tool or library needs some amount of background knowledge in order to understand how and why to use it. If the documentation tried to explain *all* that background knowledge, it would be very very long.Whoever was writing the documentation had some idea in their head of what the reader would want to know, and what they would already be familiar with. If your level of knowledge doesn't match that assumption, then you'll have to figure out yourself where the gaps are.The only real solution is to increase your breadth of knowledge as much as possible. That way, when you encounter an unfamiliar concept, you'll at least have a better chance of recognizing where the gap in your knowledge is, and having an idea of where to research.As for your specific examples:> “Alignof takes an expression x of any type and returns the required alignment of a hypothetical variable v as if v was declared via var v = x. It is the largest value m such that the address of v is always zero mod m. It is the same as the value returned by…”This requires some general knowledge of CPU architectures. If you're telling the CPU to access (for instance) a 4-byte value in memory, then the memory access is called ""aligned"" if the starting address is a multiple of 4, and ""unaligned"" otherwise.Alignment matters because on some CPU architectures, unaligned memory access is just not allowed, and on others, it's slower than aligned access (or has other downsides, e.g. not being atomic). The exact alignment requirements vary depending on the platform and the data type. For instance, if a struct contains any 4-byte variables, then the struct itself must be aligned to a multiple of at least 4 bytes, even if its actual size is different.For that reason, the compiler normally takes care to automatically align the memory addresses of all variables based on their types. If you're doing low-level stuff with the `unsafe` package, it's assumed that you're aware of this kind of low-level detail.> “Designed to Integrate with Your Existing Systems. Kea allows you to separate the data from the execution environment, enabling new deployment options.” In my opinion, this is mostly marketing-speak, not technical documentation. The target audience is a somebody like a manager or CTO.

This could make sense for organizations that already have established ""infrastructure"" e.g. a team that maintains their database servers, and they want to reuse that infrastructure instead of setting up something new.",teraflop,2025-07-17 21:25:29,2,learnprogramming,t3_1m2jf07,False,
n3ss9yi,"I like to say that the documentation usually assumes that the reader knows absolutely everything about the language/API/framework, except for one tiny detail, the one being described on the page they are reading.It often feels like a bit of a catch-22 situation, because you won't understand the documentation before you've learned the language, and you won't understand the language before you've read and understood the documentation!What I suggest is that when you use something - like when a tutorial or other course shows you to write something specific, and you more or less understand what it is doing, *then* go and read the documentation for that thing! See how much of it you understand, and don't worry about all the details you don't get - they might not be important, or you might learn them later.The next time you need to solve a similar task, but with a bit of a twist, so you can't do exactly the same, go back to the documentation, and see if it helps you. Often there are links to other things that does similar things.Example: You've seen someone using .trim() in JavaScript to remove whitespace around user-input, and you've looked at [the documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/trim), and read that ""The `trim()` method of [`String`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) values removes whitespace from *both ends* of this string and returns a new string, without modifying the original string."" - cool - now you need to only trim the end of the string, not the beginning. So you go back to the documentation, and read it again, checking if you missed something, and behold, it also says: ""To return a new string with whitespace trimmed from just one end, use [`trimStart()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/trimStart) or [`trimEnd()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/trimEnd)."" with links to other methods that does exactly what you want.That is how you can use the documentation to learn.I'd recommend against starting reading documentation for a package / module / interface you've never used before, because more often than not, it doesn't actually tell you how to get started just doing ""something"" with it.

n39w2pz,"If you want to leverage your background in software you could: - go into QA. The kind of QA where you develop software to test the main system but that software never gets released elsewhere. Tools that do test setup, stress tests, volume tests, etc. This isn’t necessarily a forever job but one that will let you reset. - find a field far divorced from what you’ve done; if you were in banking go work at a transportation company; different problem set; different vibe. ————Ask yourself what you really mean when you say your ‘work is disappearing into the void’. Describe out loud or in writing where you’d want your work to appear: I would: - loved to have worked on developing the iPhone- been responsible for part of SpaceX program - written the program that detected fraud or cyber attacks - …Now ask yourself what you like doing and whether there is a need for software in that industry. Another thing is to take a few weeks off and then look back at what went wrong at your old job. Write down phrases that capture the culture or how you felt: - too many impossible deadlines- always picking up for other people’s delays and mistakes - sales over promised features; they got the bonus but we got the work - all the tech was over ten years old - no one would embrace new ideas - always got blame if something went wrong but never got credit for all the things that went rightNow ask - what could you have done differently. This is a great opportunity to learn from your mistakes. —————-Personal recommendation regarding getting laid off after all those years: take some time. Add up all the weeks, days, months you worked rather than taking vacation. You’re long overdue. Take a few weeks to disconnect. But first - let a few industry contacts know that you’re available but will be out of touch for 2-3 weeks. You’ll reach out when you return. Of course, you can time the emails release when you’re about to return as well. Just don’t burden yourself with job hunting and interviews while you’re decompressing and handling the change. My best idea for disconnecting was camping around an area I’d never visited. Left the phone in the car so I didn’t look at it all day. Did some fishing, swimming, hiking. Lots of physical activity - very little mental activity. Before you start to feel guilty that you’re not chasing the next thing immediately you should realize that you’re:A) still thinking about the old jobB) stressed out & might leave a poor impression C) dealing with some financial uncertainty All of these are stressors that could affect your demeanor during an interview. ——————-Now that you’re back put together your search plan: 1. Who do you let know you’re available 2. What type of work/environment do you want 3. Has your experience changed the relative importance of ‘things I want in a job’? —- some people realize that stability is far more important to them than they realized—- others see this as breaking chains that held them to a location 4. Consider doing some short term tech consulting - not necessarily programming. During one break I did network installation once the wires were pulled; I did database maintenance and reorganization; did some sys admin cleanup work. Things that were tech related but not development. I always found lots of little things that organizations never got around to that had big impact. Did a full database backupRan the purge routine for old data Re-orged the database Rebuilt the indexes Suddenly the system is 10x faster. Customer was happy; salesman was happier. ——————————————————Set up your daily schedule: 1. Manage list of current jobs being pursued2. Identify new opportunities3. Network with people about the jobs listed in both 1 and 2. 4. Network with people ‘without asking for a job’; just catching up; things have changed; just talking to people while i figure out what’s next; …. Let them suggest others to speak with & prompt them 5. Get some exercise; burn off tension; 6. Take advantage of any programs whether financial or search related ( unemployment insurance, job placement boards ) ————————-WRT wanting out of tech: Think about leveraging your way out. Had a colleague who worked to develop a risk management system for derivative trading. In doing so he learned as much about derivatives as any of the traders. Got an interview and got hired as a trader at a smaller firm. So have you developed any non-programming skills while developing a system? Anything in which you’re interested and can be competitive? Would you want to run a small consulting firm? Lots of other things required other than software development: marketing, sales, contract negotiation, project management, resource management, payroll and other admin. Frankly the repetitiveness of that caused me to dislike that role so I hired someone to run the firm. What’s your personality like? Could you do software sales? Or software sales support? Often ex-developers are an asset to a sales organization because they are more believable due to their experience ( and they tend to tell the truth about what’s possible and what’s not). ——————Best of luck.",PsychologicalCell928,2025-07-15 15:14:29,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1lzkc1a,False,

It comes in two flawors: IT architect in the stile of Amazon / Azure. Basically is a more experienced developer. Not sure if that is what you want. But for someone that is fresh of programming should be easy to get the certifications. There is the second flawor, which is Enterprise Architect. Keyword here TOGAF certification. Good career prospect in big corporations that have to enforce standards across various department and keep in the IT (and shadow IT) in check. Very little, if no, programming in this case.\- IT Service Manager. Basically the guy that ensure that the IT landscape is up and running in an economical way. Keword ITIL certification. Very little, if no programming here.\- DevOps. Still a good portion of programming, but more focused on scripting and testing. \- Legal for IT. This probably would require more than a simple certification. But there is a lot (I mean a lot) of request of people with IT skills and knowledge of the legal aspects associated to contracts, licenses, privacy aspects and their implications. Probably a bachelor may be required to work in this field. No programming needed to do this job though. In any of the previous companies I have worked for (all big corporations), this was usually a very very difficult position to fill.\- Security expert. Keyword ISC square certificate.

n3qfg8y,"Congrats on spotting the burnout before it completely consumed you. A lot of people let it boil over and ditch the entire industry because of itFor future reference, there's a middle-ground between sacrificing your mental health and burning out, and quitting cold turkey: Establishing very clear professional boundaries, and sticking to them no matter what.I value my WLB very much, it's literally the most important thing to me about the team I'm working on. If I somehow ended up on a team that had a bad WLB, I'd start looking for another job. I know I won't change that teams culture, it is what it is.Instead of quitting though, I'd make my boundaries very, very, very crystal clear, and I would stick to them. I'm available 9-5. Hard stop. That's not negotiable. If I'm asked to do something at 5:30, I just won't respond. Or if things aren't terrible and I still have a decent relationship with that person, at most I'll give them a courtesy: ""OK, I'll take a look first thing tomorrow morning"". I don't care if deadlines get missed, not my problem, that's a planning problem. I don't care what insane committments my boss made. I work 9-5.Boundaries are what let you escape work mode. I don't work after 5pm, and I've taught my brain that same boundary, so it doesn't think about working after 5pm. If you lack that boundary, you can't escape ""work mode"" *because you're always working*. Your brain knows you're always working. You taught it that, why would it let you turn that mode off?In the same vein, sounds like your boss was an ass, but I also don't let feedback get to me. I do my best, 8 hours a day. If my best isn't good enough, not my problem. They hired me, that was their mistake, not mine. If my boss hates my guts, thinks I'm underperforming, or using AI? Tough. I'm not thinking about that after 5pm, and I'll just smile and nod during my 9-5, without changing a thing.The reason boundaries like this are so important, and so powerful is it lets you keep your mental sanity, even when you're at an aggresive, fast paced, toxic company.If these boundaries aren't acceptable for your employer, guess what happens? They fire you, and you're *exactly* where you just put yourself voluntarily anyways. But the hidden truth people aren't talking about is it can takes months, sometimes *years* before a company decides to pull the trigger on firing you over this kind of stuff. So you just bought yourself a whole lot of time to search for another job on the side, all while staying sane.Keep these things in mind for your net gig. Props to standing up for yourself, but at the same time remember there's usually a happy middle-ground hiding between the 2 extreme options of quitting vs burning out.",SouredRamen,2025-07-18 00:44:45,85,cscareerquestions,t3_1m2nz4j,False,

Leetcode becomes the gateway through which developers must pass, similar to the CPA exams for accountants or the bar exam for lawyers. Regulation would take this de facto regulation away from leetcode and companies and make it the responsibility of an industry body. The pros would be never having to sit these leetcode test during interviews - if your accreditation is up to date then you are a software developer.

They are trying to kill OpenAI in a war of attrition and stagnate progress in the AI arms race so that they can catch up and inherit everything OpenAI would’ve been developing. To preface this, meta is notorious for poaching talent from competitors just to have them do nothing of consequence. They literally pay people to not work for their competitors. This happened a bunch during Covid in the metaverse era. It happened a bunch more before then as well when hiring was cheap. Hear me out. Meta is poaching all the top talent responsible for the creation of all the top of the line benchmark models and techniques from OpenAI. What do you do with all these people? I don’t legitimately believe that they will achieve anything more than what OpenAI and Google have already managed to achieve. I definitely don’t think their progress will be faster. There’s a limit to how many top people can work concurrently towards a goal. Not going to allege these people have an ego, but a kitchen full of chefs will not operate properly. You need some dishwashers and floor cleaners as well. All of these are chefs.Furthermore, $100M salary is literally more than most pro athletes will ever touch. I can only think that Meta anticipates these people will take the money and eventually retire. These outrageous salary figures don’t make sense for employees a corporate setting. Corporate budgets are lowkey designed so that people will keep working and spending money and work harder so they can spend more money. Paying that high of a salary in a few years is beyond effective to incentivize people to keep working. People will call it a career after they retire with handfuls of millions, let alone hundreds of millions.It might seem outlandish what I am alleging, but none of meta’s moves make sense without ulterior motives in my perspective. OpenAI is burning money at an alarming rate, still not profitable as a software company, and can’t keep researchers as they transition from a non-profit research org to a traditional corporate hierarchy. OpenAI is nothing without its researchers. This is a perfect time for Meta to try to accelerate OpenAI’s spiral into bankruptcy.TLDR; I am alleging that Zuck is paying insane salaries for this AI superteam to basically not work for his biggest foes (OpenAI and Google), and then basically have them retire or lay them off. Furthermore, he is ok if they don’t produce anything consequential because what he gains from his competitors dying (mainly OpenAI) is far beyond what he’s paying this superteam.",ToastandSpaceJam,2025-07-14 08:08:29,40,cscareerquestions,t3_1lzfuk0,False,

n3w0n8r,"Here’s the conclusion I’ve come to: many FAANG grads are struggling to land jobs now because they were hired during a boom when top companies were scooping up talent, even those without real, developed skills, just to meet the demand of a rapidly digitalizing world.Remember, before COVID and the work-from-home shift, many legacy companies were still doing accounting on paper and hadn’t even integrated Excel into their workflows. Modernizing these dinosaur companies in such a short timeline was a massive undertaking, made possible by near-zero interest rates and tax breaks on developer salaries. It created a tech hiring bubble.Many grads hired into FAANG during this time barely had a chance to gain real experience before being laid off. And what does that signal to recruiters? Fair or not, it suggests you were in the bottom performance tier and got cut. It’s rough but not necessarily your fault. You were supposed to have time to grow, learn, and move up or out. That chance was taken away.Now you're competing with other laid-off peers and fresh grads some of whom companies may prefer because they're seen as more malleable and come without the layoff baggage. And if you have under four years of experience, you're often not seen as experienced enough for mid-level roles, but no longer ""new"" enough for new grad positions either.",TastyBunch,2025-07-18 21:22:19,148,cscareerquestions,t3_1m3e0t8,False,

Especially big speedup if you are not an expert at the language.BUT, I have also seen the opposite that it goes well in the beginning and then the LLM introduced bugs it cant find (even latest models and different models). You are then left with a huge body of unknown code you need to understand and find the bug in. Sometimes the bug can be complicated both to find and solve because the whole thing may not have been structured as you would have done it. Even if you are a senior developer you can become dragged into the mess, essentially becoming a 100 percent vibe coder. You get locked into the solutio space the LLM made, and it becomes harder to imagine how you might have done it. There's a temptation to go along and have the LLM fix its own mess rather than taking the plunge into it, creating an even bigger mess. That can waste a lot of time and leave a bad result. Just to be sure, I think LLM-generated code is not usually bad. Often it is very good about naming, error handling, best practices, reuse... Things many humans suck at. But when it gets stuck with something it can't solve it seems to mess the whole thing up again. So you really need to use it delicately. Have a feel for what it can do, when it is on the right track, when it is really understanding an issue and where it is merely guessing. Carefully review and roll back anything that doesnt work. Use dedicated sessions with minimal context for specific difficult problems, to help focus. But it is not easy - something the LLM might do well in one context, it can screw up in another (e.g. using wrong arguments etc. even though it clearly knows the right arguments in other contexts).When building larger systems of lasting value, build it all as you would yourself in smaller pieces one at a time and with unit testing... rather than hoping you can one-shot it all.

The fact that it constantly has to make these ""AI doesn't do anything useful"" type of posts/comments betrays a real discomfort at the way software development is changing. It's essentially an attempt to convince itself that it won't change (e.g. copium).But technology is always changing. Even programming itself has changed significantly in the past 50 years. Computer programming literally used to be done on [punched cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era). And then programming languages came along, and over decades, it became more like English and abstracted away to the point where we now have Python.I think we are seeing something similar with AI in software development. It will become literal natural language being fed into a processor (LLM) to write a program. From punch cards to pseudo-language to natural language sounds like a reasonable evolution of creating computer programs.My advice is to ignore both the AI hype and the AI naysayers who call it a ""grift"". There is a real utility for AI models. It won't be a perfect solution but it doesn't have to be perfect to make an impact. It just has to do enough.If you are worried about your job being taken over by AI, you can avoid that by learning how to use AI tools effectively. So maybe try Cursor or Claude Code. Or Windsurf.

It's someone that another employee, one they already like and trust, is saying is a good employee.

n3teoqb,"Google.I only use LinkedIn to find companies. I think it's a *terrible* way to actually find job postings. It's filters are bad, its search algorithm is bad, it's not always kept up to date by the hiring company, not every company even uses it, it promotes hundreds of paid advertisements over regular postings discouraging smaller companies from posting/appearing, etc. I'm convinced it hurts people relying on it for finding job postings more than it helps them.It does have a decent company search tool though. I've used it for that. No ads, small companies showup, companies with 0 postings show up. LinkedIn doesn't make it super obvious that's even an option, but it's here: [https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/companies](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/companies)Once I find a company, I go straight to that company's careers page to see the full picture of what they're hiring for. Pretty regularly the all-knowing LinkedIn job search algorithm shows me roles that aren't good fits for me, and hides ones that are good fits. When I'm on the company's website, I see *everything* they're hiring for., and can decide for myself what is/isn't a good fit.If they aren't hiring, I make a note of that, and I revisit them in a week. A company hiring 0 SWE's today, could literally be hiring 20 tomorrow. A lot of the job search is timing and luck, and LinkedIn is not good at that.Google is a great company search tool as well. ""Top X companies for WLB"", ""Up and coming companies in \[city\]"", ""Best companies in \[industry\]"", etc, etc, etc. There's tons of different search terms that turn up endless articles out there on Google that list tons companies.

Also try `site:workday.com`, `site:jobvite.com`, `site:smartrecruiters.com`, and `site:bamboohr.com`.

They often have unlisted roles.The real game-changer though is tailoring your applications properly. Most people just spray the same resume everywhere, but companies want to see you've actually read their posting. I doubled my interview rate once I started matching my experience with specific job requirements.Also check out Wellfound (formerly AngelList) and RemoteOK if you're open to startups or remote work.If you'd like I can share tools that can help with CV tailoring and job tracking.

n3fj0ii,"Reading through the comments, I'm going to take a different point of view from others because i think a lot of the comments are from those sitting atop their ivory tower looking down saying this is peasant wages and don't take the job. Funny enough, I am local to ATL too.To put it into context, i graduated 09 during the recession, similar hiring conditions as today. Took me 1 year to get my first tech job, 2 years to get my first development job. When i graduated, no one was hiring, not even for junior developers so it was rough. I took a glorified sys admin job as my first role for 30k/yr in 2010, first dev role was 40k/yr in 2011 and i thought i was living large.\--What i'm about to say isn't advocating for the consulting firm, more adding insight to whats happening/what your seeing as all the comments you are getting are ""i wouldnt take it"" ""go work at starbucks"".So if this is your first exposure to consulting firms, it sounds like they are going to put you through a crash course of how to do things their way, which is fine, and pay you 300/week. At that point in time, they aren't making money off of you while you are ""on the bench"" so this is bench pay...some firms don't even pay for bench time so the fact that they pay anything is nice even though its laughable wages.The 200/week is literally paying you for not doing anything until you are placed with a firm. Again, they could just pay you nothing, but 100/week is insulting.The salary once your placed is also extremely low...for someone with experience. For a first time role, its really low, but you've got to start somewhere and in this market...i'd take whatever i can get. You aren't required to work at this place for the rest of your life, do 1 year and move on or do enough time until you find something else and move on.You aren't in a position where you have the luxury of saying ""yes ill work for you but not you"", you have no experience (if im wrong i apologize) so you've got to take what you can get in a market as terrible and competitive as this one.You can go the high and mighty route and say ""pay me what im worth"" but the fact is, in this market, people are desperate and someone will take that role if its not you.It sounds like you don't have any housing costs because your living with family, awesome, student loans...get on an income base repayment plan. If you make too low of a salary your payment will be 0 dollars. If you make enough but not enough to pay full amount maybe you'll pay 100-250/month...something like that...but you won't be paying 1000/month when your take home is 4k/month before taxes.My point is, the longer you are past graduation / out of the field, the harder its going to be to get into the field because your skills will be stale with no experience. Do you think companies want to hire the person who graduated in 2022 but still works at costco or the person who graduated in may of 2025? They are going to take the new grad 9/10 times.TLDR;Take the role, do the work, look for something else while your working and make a move if/when you can, you don't have to work here forever.",plyswthsqurles,2025-07-16 11:54:12,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1m0z08i,False,

There are physical limitations to how much food any one person needs, so it's easy to see how we don't need too many farmers. You can make the same case about doctors or lawyers or accountants or architects. Their demand scales with the number of people on the planet: Demand ~ PopulationHowever, software is fundamentally different. There's always a new idea around the corner, some service that could be digitized, some new feature to be added, some code to be optimized. The amount of software scales both with the number of people *and* the amount of digital services each person is willing to adopt: Demand ~ Population x Digitalization.Furthermore, there's an idea that digitalization actually enables such a boost in efficiency that it's still a beneficial allocation of resources. For example, suppose you're playing Economy Manager 2025 and you have to decide what to do with 10 college grads with the goal of completing auditing companies. One way is to train all 10 to be accountants. However, if you were to train 1 software engineer, that one SWE could develop tooling to boost efficiency so that even if you have 1 fewer accountant, the remaining 9 accountants could double their speed.This is why many people view the demand side of software to be much more flexible than traditional occupations like medicine or law.

There are stats out there to support this and in my view, it is more like 80%. W2 is a good way to get in the door. Period. Getting a W2 contract into Apple vs FTE Apple/Google/ whatever is a lot easier. The threshold for interview is easier as the headshop already vetted the contractors.

Top-tier schools3. \[Somewhat... maybe changing in the current political climate\] Whether you're from an underrepresented groupThat's it. I'm not making this up. We ran a study at [interviewing.io](http://interviewing.io/) where we had 76 recruiters look at 30 different resumes (for a total of \~2200 data points) and indicate which candidates they’d want to interview. The list above is indeed what recruiters look for. And the ""30 seconds"" estimate isn't me fearmongering or guessing: we measured it in the study: [https://interviewing.io/blog/are-recruiters-better-than-a-coin-flip-at-judging-resumes](https://interviewing.io/blog/are-recruiters-better-than-a-coin-flip-at-judging-resumes)Here's a poignant anecdotal example: someone put up a fake resume, one that literally bragged about ""spreading herpes to 60% of the intern team"", and got a 90% callback rate because it had Instagram, LinkedIn, and Microsoft on it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/qhg5jo/this\_resume\_got\_me\_an\_interview/](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/qhg5jo/this_resume_got_me_an_interview/)The only time resume polishing actually works is if you already have those brands, but they're buried. I had a user with Apple MLE experience who wasn't getting callbacks because he was burying the lead. We moved it to the top - 8x more interviews. No rewriting, just reorganizing.For everyone else? Stop obsessing over your resume and start doing direct outreach to hiring managers (not recruiters!) instead. Why hiring managers? They're the ones who actually care about hiring people for their team. Recruiters just care about looking like they're following the orders they were given... and having been a recruiter, I can tell you that their marching orders are pretty much: ""Top brand names!""Recruiters aren't incentivized to hire good candidates. They're incentivized to hire safe ones. Imagine 2 scenarios:→ Recruiter A: Brings in 10 candidates with top company brands. 2 get offers, but neither accepts. 0 hires.→ Recruiter B: Brings in 10 candidates without name brands. 2 get offers, 1 accepts. 1 hire.Guess which recruiter gets praised? The first one. Data shows this approach is flawed. Top-tier brands are only weakly correlated with engineering talent. Despite that, most recruiters are trained to perpetuate the status quo rather than make great hires. (AI has made this problem even worse. Recruiters now have tools to filter candidates with increasingly specific criteria: ""Show me people from FAANG, on these teams, with this career progression, who know these languages..."")If you're a nontraditional candidate, hiring manager outreach is your only shot at being seen as a human rather than a collection of brand names. I wrote the chapter on how to do outreach in Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview, and fortunately, that chapter is available for free: [bctci.co/free-chapters](http://bctci.co/free-chapters) (see the file with the first 7 chapters, Chapter 7 has the outreach stuff).The resume writing industry thrives on job seekers' desperation and need for control.
