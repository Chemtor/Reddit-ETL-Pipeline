There was another logging interface configured, but stdout was missing from there as well. The only option to see the error message was to rerun the step again directly on Airflow through SSH.

nl1qsxt,"A lot of the breaks occur because of a lack of proper pipeline architecture, unit testing, and organisational controls.The key ingredients of data engineering are the high watermark, unique keys, and key-pairs. If they don't exist, you must create them. The integrity of these three things at ETL, ELT, and reporting are essential.Let's say you're using a CSV as a data source. Have you got a data contract to test for columns, data types, and allowable data values in your ETL process? If not and it breaks, then it was you as the data professional who is reaponsible, rather than the business users who are not data professionals.Do you have a really complex, poorly understood legacy IT system where the unique keys and/or key-pairs are only partially understood? Then, modularise it into bronze, silver, and gold, and introduce unique key unit tests in each place to ensure it doesn't detonate. If you need to do aggregations to enrich a particular gold model, then separate it out and test it as an upstream dependency.Do you have an overly complex, bespoke dashboard where the data layer looks like a squiggly mess of an entire data warehouse imported, with bronze, silver, and gold? Then, work with the business users to develop a proper semantic layer in your data warehouse to minimise the custom code.The unholy grail of broken shit in data engineering can probably be summed up as:+ Confusing surrogate keys as being the same as primary keys, then using them as part of the key-pair. (Hint: At some point you'll find out the data just doesn't join that way when you add one more feature.)+ Combining bronze, silver, and gold into a monolithic stored procedure. (Hint: I broke today, now find where did it break without any tests.)+ Creating identity keys and using them beyond unique keys, but also treating them as primary keys as part of a key-pair. (Hint: If the sourcr system doesn't behave that way 100% of the time across all its data, why are you trying to create a synthetic primary key for a key-pair? See the same problems with derived surrogate keys.)+ Trying to normalise to a global standard without first normalising to a local standard. (Hint: You will end up creating some mutant derived data model that will be almost impossible to extend, because you must treat every source system by the most limiting scenario in that column, even though those problems don't exist for most source systems at that local level.)Honestly, the uncomfortable truth is that most of the breaks are caused by us through sloppy standards, mixed with a lack of management interest in building and maintaining good standards.We are often the problem, myself included.",_SeriousCat_,2025-10-23 23:47:47,2,dataengineering,t3_1oe9gn9,False,

Yea I'm sure it's not needed at an operational level but that's not the level that your execs and ultimately your board is looking for.If you acquire your competitor and say you both share the same supplier but have different supply terms which are more favorable to the company you acquired then you would be smart to use that contract going forward.

Essentially, they send records from both tables to join to the same node in a cluster if they hash to the same value (or list of values) and each cluster would join a part of the data. Repeat that for each join, with a high enough degree of parallelism, and then aggregate at the end (maybe some aggregation along the way would be possible).

In larger orgs it's also a great way to enforce standardisation of calculations like KPIs: without a semantic layer Sue from finance might have a retention rate calculation different from Bob from HR's version, and when the C-suite see two different numbers for the ""same"" thing they either pick on based on whether Bob or Sue has the better reputation, or distrust them both entirely. If Bob and Sue are dragging and dropping a measure from the same model that doesn't happen. And if Bob and Sue both think their one is best, then there can be a process for working out which one becomes the single source of truth instead of them going off into their silo and doing their own thing.Organisationally it sits at a good place too, in that it can be a product of a central data team to enable business unit-adjacent analysts and BI teams to get straight into their value-add (engineers do the engineering, business users do the questioning, presenting and interpretation) .

Data products mean anything that the end users need. One of the biggest challenges any data warehouse has is keeping the data between data products aligned.

As a general rule of thumb, your core layer doesn't specifically address any business need (actually it has to address all of them). You may be asking, why not just query the core? Data products are created to align with the business needs. What finance needs is not necessarily what sales needs. When you create something like a star schema, you are layering on business requirements, processes and definitions that may not be the same across the entire enterprise. Just that one data product.

nkc469e,"I did this at my last job, reluctantly. I was forced to do it as part of an initiative to surface metrics and data transformations back to end-users, and one of the engineers refused to use production data to test the dashboards; it HAD to be a fully separate env, hooked up exactly to the app's staging env. The rest of the company already had a full pipeline but tied to prod.I thought it was a waste of time and money when I was forced to do it because the environment was fully read-only. And after I finally completed the project I thought the same thing. The only good purpose of the separate envs was that it made it a little easier to test security, but it wasn't like that was particularly difficult. It would have been probably just as much work to set up a way to mock production data in localhost, and overall way more useful for the company.So, we got it working ultimately (separate Airflow deployments and separate Snowflake accounts), but it was a pain in the ass. I had a somewhat informal way of managing Snowflake account level changes as migrations / IaC, and setting it up perfectly still took a while. (This also corresponded with a company wide push to formalize migrations of all db's into a new software.) Then the Airflow instance, oh boy. You don't realize just how many assumptions you make about envs until you have to formalize the ability to make an arbitrary multiple number of them. I thought I knew, but I didn't. Oh, also, your staging and prod data will be different in painful ways. Like imagine a JSON field stored as a varchar, but the staging env has some bullshit that's not a JSON. Yep, that's one of many things that happens when you try to run your prod data pipelines on the app's staging environment.Overall, not worth it. The setup I had originally is very simple: there's local and there's prod on a single Snowflake account. When you run commands locally, you hit a separate database for writes and transforms that are handled by the env vars. All reads are exactly from the prod data. All developers have full permissions in the local or dev or whatever you want to call them environments. There were also simple utils to help clone prod into dev for easy development.Moving to the multi env setup was not only months of my life neither me nor the company is getting back, but due to how MWAA works, it significantly increased the costs of the data platform.Shortly after I left, the engineer who wanted this colossal waste of time and money also left. Or maybe he was forced out. Cool.Honestly, at the point you're doing this sort of thing to support multi tenancy across genuine staging/prod envs, my advice is to scrap Airflow and Snowflake entirely. Go to something like Clickhouse and use materialized views to manage your pipelines so it's orchestration free.I also want to note another thing. Not a single internal data end user cared about this. This came from a single frontend app developer and was supported by upper mgmt because it sounds good on paper if you're a conventional SWE. Even though it's completely divorced from how internal data consumers use and contribute to data pipelines. What data scientists do is they train models and do analysis on prod data. They don't care about the developers' staging data because it doesn't represent or cover real usage. As you note in your post, this seems to be what they want to do, right? Except now you're finessing with data shares instead of just some simple IAM and permissions.Lastly, the place I left to, I setup their entire data infrastructure. I'm still on exactly ""local"" and ""prod"" in one Snowflake account, and I have no desire to ever change this. Actually, we do have a ""staging"" env for testing full CRUD being run against our OLAP db in the app's actual staging env. What it is, is: a clone of the prod db, cloned weekly, so that state is preserved within testing sessions but it also up to date with prod. Also, we do have a way to mock user sessions in our app's staging env. That works well enough! I will literally write javascript dashboards myself, or migrate to an entirely separate DB and delete our Airflow pipelines and switch to materialized views, before I spin up multiple envs to assist someone who won't put up with a minor inconvenience for them at the expense of multiple months of my own time.",riv3rtrip,2025-10-19 17:08:46,8,dataengineering,t3_1oajs0h,False,

nksyivu,"Having a clean ETL process that updates non-prod environments with appropriately tokenized/masked copies of production data on a recurring basis should be considered just as critical a piece of infrastructure as having proper CI/CD pipelines and automated test frameworks.It starts with identifying sensitive fields in production data. They should all already be identified and catalogued someplace, as part of a data security framework. If they're not, that's a problem in and of itself. You need to know where the PII actually exists, and ideally section it off into separate, higher-security datastores. Less sensitive datastores should only store identifiers to the records in the secure datastores that contain the actual PII. This step alone can dramatically simplify the process of keeping things secure, and can make it safer to allow production access for developers to debug issues. It's rare that a bug involves needing to know actual PII, even in production.Once you know which datastores/fields contain PII, you can set up automated ETL pipelines to mask or tokenize them during the process of being copied into non-prod environments.A good practice is to have (at least) two non-prod environments: development and QA/staging. The QA environment should be automatically overwritten with a fresh, sanitized copy of production data, on a regular basis. The development environment should have finer-grained controls for overwrites, so as not to erase work-in-progress changes that developers have made to those datasets. Ideally, each team should have some control over whether their data domain is merely appended to by the automated ETL jobs, or overwritten/reset entirely.",xoomorg,2025-10-22 16:33:51,3,dataengineering,t3_1od6qy5,False,

nkxk6br,"I've tried and seen a couple of approaches, usually starting with using open-source [Cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos) to orchestrate dbt Core projects so you can see each dbt model/seed/test as an Airflow task in the DAG for additional visibility and to see the dbt docs in the Airflow UI (side note: this feature will be back for Airflow 3.1 with Cosmos 1.11 that should come out next month).The next ""level"" is to use Asset (in Airflow 3.x) / Dataset (in Airflow 2.x) scheduling for cross-DAG dependencies. That way the Asset graph (exists in 2.x and 3.x but imho is much easier to navigate in 3.x) serves as a proxy-lineage graph. Side note tip if you need both, runs based on time and upstream DAG dependencies, there is a combined [AssetOrTimeSchedule](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-datasets#combined-asset-and-time-based-scheduling).From there, yes, some people implement custom solutions, often based on dependency information gathered from the Airflow API or use the OSS OpenLineage integration to get ""true"" lineage and then visualize it with Marquez. How well this works highly depends on the operators and hooks you use, if they already support lineage extraction (there is a [list of supported classes](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-openlineage/stable/supported_classes.html)) or if you need to add extractors to your own custom operators. Inlets and outlets (so Assets again) are also evaluated by this integration.If you want an out-of-the-box solution there are paid products like [Astro Observe](https://www.astronomer.io/product/observe) which is based on OpenLineage and reads in that information to create a lineage graph with additional fancy features like SLA definition, alerts, cross-deployment lineage etc. There is also a list of potential up and downstream impacts in case of failures. The upside is minimal setup needed and managed service support.Disclaimer: I work at Astronomer :) and a lot of the above was inspired by [this blog post](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/the-road-to-reliability-implementing-pipeline-observability) (and the webinar linked at the bottom of it) from our internal data team.

nkf5ltf,"My ideas on demos have changed over the years. Keep in mind that Agile and the demo they talk about was not designed for data engineering, so you need to adapt. Showing how a pipeline now runs 20% faster, or how you’ve improved data accuracy by 30% is dry as hell and demos terribly. What demos well is actual apps (or web apps) and clicking through them showing shiny features and pictures.In my latest project my team is creating a data pipeline and suite of reports for a new product. Our stakeholders are regulators, so we don’t get to talk to them. We have internal product people that interface with them. One thing we have done is create a crude diagram of each of the models we are building in the DAG. If it was created in the past sprint I color them one way so they stand out. I don’t go into depth on what they do, the point here is for upper management, product, and others to see “oh there’s more green boxes than 2 weeks ago”. Pictures demo better than words, and this shows progress. Obviously this works for greenfield work and wouldn’t work as well for other work.A challenge we have had is that we get different personas joining our demos. Sometimes they are upper management who think they are still technical and they want to get into details. Other times they are product people who are curious about how we interpreted a particular requirement. Other times it’s upstream teams asking things about a particular interaction. Honestly, any interaction is good interaction. However, I have been absolutely terrible at predicting which part of the demo will get the most traction. This is probably a function of how demos operate though. We roll with the punches and answer what we can.I usually have 1 or 2 people demo something we delivered. Usually it’s a particular table/model, but I push for something that is novel. People love novelty. If the report is “select everything from this table and aggregate” then it’s not a good candidate. We recently had a report that had the goal of showing the transaction record that crossed a certain cumulative sum threshold. That’s novel, and so that is what I pushed the team to demo. There ended up being a lot of conversation around that approach and the validity of the requirements. Good, we want conversation and interaction.I try to rotate different people demoing work they have done so everyone gets their time to shine. I make it clear that the goal is to a degree sales. Sell your work. Brag. Explain what you thought was interesting or challenging or whatever. People will engage with that.I also bring up specific challenges. This last sprint we spun out on a particularly ambiguous requirement. Attempting to nail down that requirement resulted in not delivering one of the items in the sprint goal. I made sure to relate those 2 things and called it out. It’s not just about painting a rose colored story, it’s also about showing we do more than just sling data left to right.Numbers also tend to register with people. An old manager of mine used to have a slide for git metrics. “this sprint we added 2311 lines of code and removed 5541”. It seemed a little corny to me at the time, but in reality it adds to the perception of “oh this team Got Stuff Done”On the topic of numbers, mentioning them can also make you sound like you know what you are doing. This can be more useful in non-greenfield areas. For example: “this table has 110 million records in it and grows at the rate of 5 million per month. Each daily run varies from 150k to 175k and runs for 20 minutes” if the goal of your project is to reduce cost then you tie it to that “…and with our new special sauce, we save $20k/yr”. If it is to run things faster you could say “and now we have partitioned it in a way that we have 10 parallel jobs that complete in 2 minutes”. Tie what you are doing to the goals of the sprint or project.Sorry if these ideas are a bit unorganized, hopefully these help you.",raginjason,2025-10-20 03:05:41,6,dataengineering,t3_1ob6d1n,False,

Only times I seen companies with bills like this is when they leave the EMR cluster and all the associated services running 100% but the utilization is only 25% So being able to spin he cluster up and down when your jobs are gonna run will help reduce it quite a bit. But if you are using it for ad-hoc queries and need the cluster available 100% you might try playing around with the spark executors and memory sizes to optimize your instance size.

Here you can have unclassified data, and potentially have it unmasked. The only access to these areas is either the automated system, or users with elevated privileges who are accessing it for the specific purpose of classifying data and setting up automation for ingestion and transform to later layers.You should track the classification for each column to determine what kind of data it has. Is it personal data? Is it PII? Is it generic contact style PII (name, email, phone) or sensitive identity-theft-enabling PII like external identifiers or private information (license number, tax number, birth details, passport, etc). Those classifications help you to understand the security policy you place on the column.With a lakehouse you have the option to also separate the data in the storage layer. You can have separate buckets for pii or sensitive data, so that you can specifically track and audit access to the buckets, and a leak of any kind on the general data bucket does not leak sensitive data.You will need some kind of query portal that enforces column-level security for you. Something like SageMaker, for example. You will need to set up rules for automatically hiding/masking tables/columns that people cannot access. You need to make sure people don't have an alternative for accessing the data.There are tools you could point at your bronze data to scan for sensitive data. They won't be perfect but they're a good start. I believe AWS comprehend can do it, but there's a variety of 3rd party tools you can run.---The main point is your early areas are kept inaccessible to users, so that you can hold the data in an unclassified manner that allows you to do ingestion and classification work on it.

Start by building the MVP (minimally viable product) THEN add features and improvements. Build with the intent that things will get bolted on. They are doing a classic waterfall approach. Deliver the final product all at once. So in this method, building in certain features first might be more efficient to get to the final deadline. Agile is faster, more flexible, and some variation of it is the new modern standard. Waterfall is good for building something with core features that are extremely well defined. Of course, there's the other option that they are just building what they want to build whether it is needed or not. With data scientists, you can't rule that out. Here's the catch, every data scientist I have ever met HATES Agile. I suspect it is because in academia, you design your entire experiment, make your hypothesis, do your research, THEN do the experiments THEN publish your results. To them, Agile is following a poor practice of finding something 80% correct with the end goal of getting something better in the next round. Plus, if they are building a gradient boosting regression with specific variables now, the 90% correct version may require completely different variables with a Random Forest Regression. In other words, a complete rebuild. Data engineers can add features much more organically. I'm not saying that the Data Scientists are right.

I think you are dealing with a smaller amount of data (<1GB). JSON format is also slow. You are running into an old, solved problem. ETL can be expensive. It is one of the main reasons that file based looks so attractive (but is actually data on beer goggles).Let me share a way that has dealt with this issue. First, and most important, how are you using the data? This is the key question and will be the reason for your upstream choices. This should be used to guide all your choices. See which final format fits your SLA and performance needs best. See how I am moving to objective and not subjective reasons?The final form has to also consider flexibility, expandability and scalability. Have at least some good assumption on these so that you can use more information to make the case.BTW, ETL is just the homework you have to do in order to get the data into the final form. Until it is queried, data has no value. Zero. That seems obvious, but you would be amazed the number of people that don't understand this.Is your boss also the data architect?

The beauty of Cucumber/Gherkin us that the human readable phraseology plays well with auditors and business users. It helps build trust in what we produce.Ruff and SQLFluff enforce code style. If I didn't need the DBT plugin I would look at SQRuff in preference to SQLFluff.For DBT we publish the output of DBT Docs to cloud blob storage so clients can download it into whatever internal websites suit them. Again, interactive data lineage comforts auditors and people who query business data.In the past I've used products such as Redgate SQLDoc and Innovasys DocumentX to document databases. As the company I was with went with a plethora of other databases I ended up writing my own version. For any tabular DB my app needed a DB connection and a folder to hold that DB's equivalent of queries whose output was a defined contract. Again, this comforts the auditors.Code quality tools such as SonarQube, Sonarlint are useful. In JetBrains PyCharm there us a ""Problems"" tab that provides code improvement suggestions. I've found these to be useful. I think VS Code has some useful extensions that do something similar.JavaDoc is over 30 years old, most languages have an equivalent. Its only as good as the human content put in, but as a mechanically solved autodocumentation facility, its up to you to avoid shooting yourself in both feet....then reloading and shooting both kneecaps etc.I do a lot of work with AWS. I've found that their APIs, for the products I use, need a lot of calls as an API call answers a question but doesn't always provide the info to feed directly into a related question. Using Mermaid markup allows the relationships between various cloud artefacts to be autogenerated. I'm crap at graphics so Mermaid is about my limit. Again, a diagram comforts auditors. A comforted auditor is a comforted management team.Data testing can be DBT Test, Soda and more specific queries. Its easy enough to generate AWS cloudwatch metrics from the results of a query. From AWS Cloudwatch metrics, its easy ti generate AWS Cloudwatch alarms. An example would be average expected sales +- 1.64 standard deviations as the acceptable range, anything outside of that range needs investigation.In all honesty, the tooling is not the important thing.

(Wouldn't be right for me to go into too much detail.) We worked with many of the leading Pharma. The goal was to help the companies collect regular data feeds and ELT them into a data warehouse, usually Snowflake or Redshift. We used our own PaaS orch platform based on K8s. the main observability tool then was New Relic -- an OTel adopter. (What we did when I was there was basic. DataKitchen now sell an observability tool of their own -- haven't used it but it looks cool). We used NR to monitor data file arrival, data loading job execution, and platform and/or K8s errors coming out of our airflow-like orch tool -- including sql errors. NR captured user who created the job, what the job was for, how much data the job moved, and did every step in the process complete in \~expected time, history of the job over time. We also used NR for basic log aggregation and had alerts for specific conditions observed in log output. We didn't use traces. We wanted that for the steps in the jobs, but didn't have time to implement while I was there. The DevOps team used more sysOps sampling metrics to know how the pods were performing and the health of the underlying nodes and storage.Kind of similarly, I'm currently leading a project to build a data file feed ingestion tool called CsvPath Framework. We support Otel and OpenLineage for observability. the framework doesn't do any sysOps metrics. and it doesn't natively ship its own logs -- you would have to do that, same as for any system you're hosting. What it does is fire data processing events for arriving files registered, validation scripts loaded, runs started/ended, steps within runs started/ended, and validation errors. I.e. we're just focused on the data. CsvPath is kind of like [Soda.io](http://Soda.io) for databases, but totally focused on preboarding flat-file feeds with a lot more opinionatedness about how to do it right. if we didn't have Otel (and OpenLineage) we'd have to roll our own way of doing monitoring and alerting. that would not have been practical.Hope that helps. if it's not off-target happy to say more.",ProfessionalDirt3154,2025-10-21 19:30:56,1,dataengineering,t1_nkm2nzp,False,

nk80q6p,"I don't know how much moolah you all got because it can be expensive, but Google BigQuery is really slick. I have been using it for a project this year and I'm super impressed with its feature set, Python API, command line tools, and web console. It is so amazingly fast performing scans on big datasets, too, and you get detailed information on every query about how much compute it used and how much data it scanned. Big plus in my opinion is that it is a SaaS offering so it relieves you from database admin burden (which I personally kind of detest doing, haha).If you have < 1 TB of data it could be a good solution. A full scan of 1 TB is $6.25, but you can avoid doing that very often with decent table optimizations like partitions and clustering or even duplicate tables with different optimizations, since the storage is cheap. I like it better than either Redshift or Databricks, though I don't have a ton of experience with either.

Put tenantid first in ORDER BY and partition by month (toYYYYMM(ts)) for fast pruning and easy drop/backfill per tenant-month. For custom fields, store a Map for long tail, but promote high-usage keys into real columns; add bloom filter indexes on common filters and a soft\_delete flag with TTL DELETE to keep storage sane. Row policies work well for tenant isolation if you expose direct SQL. Tinybird is great for serving pre-aggregates, but keep ClickHouse as the source of truth and rebuild from staging when mappings change. I’ve used Airbyte for ingestion and dbt for tests/backfills; DreamFactory helped us expose secure REST endpoints over the star for internal tools and partner integrations without hand-rolling auth.

Also worth noting, all the way back then, the game was very simple and didn’t have that much content, it wouldn’t have been that hard to rewrite. It was still in beta, with the really old terrain generation and even basic features like sprinting and the hunger bar hadn’t been added yet. The old, shitty pocket edition version you remember from your childhood was basically identical to Java edition at the time.According to autobiographies about Notch, at this time mojang was still a really small company with probably 10 or less employees and the rewrite was mostly entrusted to a single guy who was known as “the smart one”.Later that year they copied over the C++ engine for iOS, then next year to the Xbox 360, then the year after that to the PS3.

FWIW, iPhone (1) didn't come out until 2007. And probably the earliest recognizable Android phone, the Motorola Droid, didn't release until 2009. Notch launched Minecraft Java Edition in 2009 but it didn't gain traction until 2010. By then, J2ME was almost a decade old, designed for FAR MORE PRIMITIVE CPUs, and no understanding of GPUs.

But one of the reasons is due to all the different ports to different platforms, the codebase became fragmented. There's a Pocket Edition, there's a Windows 10 Edition, and there are the various console editions. Maintainence and bug tracking was eating up a ton of time. And Java... is a big long in the tooth.

There's money there, but you have to be able to suppress any remnant of morality to get that money by promising the sky and unicorns. The actual tech is cool and fascinating but can do a lot less than what sales people promise and unless you can get into one of the big players, you'll be eternally chasing their work. We do get project requests related to that and at least half of them ask for applied magic.- Databases is steady and boring and a bit frustrating. 99% of what people need from databases can be taught in a simple SQL course, the rest comes up if you either need to scale a high performance setup for 100000 users or when the new manager Timmey suggests we move all our data into a MongoDB on his notebook because he can scale with kubernetes or something like that.

nkymgxa,"Well, you're already in CS. Undergrad CS doesn't teach you how to develop software. But the fun thing is that a huge chunk of people who develop software don't understand CS. You already know how to program, too. That doesn't change much. Neither does computer architecture or networking principles. Same for OS design and for parsers/compilers (the purple dragon book is still likely going to be the book you read for compilers and that was written 40 years ago).What you want to do at your stage is to continue passing your math and engineering classes because those are extremely important if you want to do anything with CS that doesn't involve basic software engineering. And the reason for that is going to be that the math classes you take will likely gate what upper division electives you can take. Go through your course catalog and look at the electives for your major. THOSE are going to lead to high-level, interesting stuff that *does* require a college education. For example, machine learning as a college junior or senior is severely more intensive than what you're going to experience through online tutorials aimed at people who don't have a CS background.The important thing is that a lot of interesting stuff that you can learn as a CS major *isn't necessarily CS.* If you want to learn about simulation, you might end up looking at stuff for civil engineers (and realize that you need to take more physics). If you want to learn more about data science, you might end up looking at economics and might need to take way more philosophy. The more interesting networking classes are usually tied into management of information systems. The split info embedded is likely going to land you in electrical engineering if not directly into computer engineering. If your school has an informatics program, you might even want to change majors. If you want to manage software projects and your college doesn't have any sort of specialty in that, then you're going to need to learn the Project Management Body of Knowledge on your own *anyway* if you want to become a project manager... and then software project management is a subset of business management anyway. A ton of tech project managers can't write a lick of code. So at the end of the day, look at your upper division electives and think ""Does this sound interesting?"" If it does, go for it and make sure the path on your curriculum leads to it. As for personal development, I always tell people to just work on something, ANYTHING AT ALL, just for fun outside of their school hours. The only people I know that managed to finish a CS degree but then never did anything with it were people who never wrote any code for fun on their offtime.

Unless it is part of a documentation then stop using tutorials. Learn to read documentation. You should learn how and where to find an information from. And how to verify that it is true. Do not aim for the speed but aim for an understanding and quality of your code/project. Trial and error is acceptable. But learn from your errors to avoid making similar mistakes later on. It all will contribute into your learning journey.Come up with project ideas that have no tutorial for. For example ""Create a system where you are using WIFI signal to detect when somebody is in your home."" How? Which devices? Which approach? I leave it for you to figure it out. Such difficult projects make you look for alternative ways for solving your problems. May it be breaking down the project into smaller parts and implementing these smaller parts one by one. May it be reading different documentation and scientific research papers. Or something else.Stop trying to memorize your code. Try to understand the business logic of your code. Where which part does what? Imagine having to explain your project to your grandmother. She won't know what is an encapsulation, what is a compilation error, what is a nullpointer exception, what is a dependency injection, etc. But she might be able to understand when you are telling that ""This part here turns this photo into a text"", ""This part here sends out an email."" and stuff like this. Photo, text, email - these are words that a normal non-IT person can also understand. Start watching podcasts and other tech talks.

You need to learn to create the discrete steps that make the computer do what you want it to do. I fully do understand that your ultimate goal is to create your game, but that's a *future goal*.

It is a free, textual, extremely practice oriented course that is the current first semester of ""Introduction to Computer Science"". This course will give you a solid general programming foundation and understanding along with teaching you the *Python programming language*.+ Then, move on to [Making Games with Python and Pygame](https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/) - also free to read online. This book will lay the foundation for game programming. Maybe, if your game is simple enough, you can even realize it with Pygame already.+ Then, move on to Godot.

Once that is covered, you'll be able to do a lot of things (still, it will be laborious and dirty.

I could list a bunch of stuff I believe are important to know, but more than likely, miss quite a few in the process.A more broad answer is that the fact that you are aware of gaps in your knowledge is a great place to start! If you find yourself unaware of why an implementation is done the way it is - investigate it! Many of the frameworks you're using are likely Open Source, and likely developed in the open, with open issues, RFCs, etc. that describe exactly the sort of information you're missing.Now I don't know your skill level, so I don't know if you are well adept in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP, etc. But I would add that you should know what the frameworks you're using are doing for you. If it is a frontend UI framework - your first question should be ""Why am I using this?"", ""What problem is this framework solving for me?"" If your answer is ""because this guide tells me to"", then that's an issue.Understanding basic design patterns is also something I consider to be quite important. Sadly I think many traditional methods of showcasing these patterns are quite poor in terms of teaching the way one can internalize the patterns and use them - even if programming in a different language than the one being used to show examples in, and even if the implementation details differ to the way the patterns are shown.So, to summarize, my take is that the fact you're asking questions is half the way to progressing, now you just need to look for the answers. Mastering all of this is a craft, and it is ever evolving. But if you want to look past the frameworks as ""the stuff you learn"" and get to ""I use them to solve specific problems"", you need to be painfully aware of exactly what those problems are. This is also the only way you will ever gain a proper understanding of when to switch to a different framework. Remember this industry moves fast, most of the frameworks in use now either didn't exist or were quite new 10 years ago, and going back 10 more year will yield the same result.

nkub29h,"I mean the first little while is just a lot of nailing down requirements. Spend as much time on a whiteboard as in any particular software, talking to a client, breaking down what functionality needs to be delivered, etc. For an app, you're going to spend a lot more time in something like Figma - or, hell, PowerPoint - than you will in an IDE to start off.People aren't as likely to have a full design of everything these days as they were back twenty years ago - deliver prototypes to the client fast, correct as you go is more common - but still you're going to spend at least a little bit of time figuring out what the app needs to *do* before you start writing code.So, like, a process I might recommend to someone new might be:\* Figure out your major requirements, produce some GUI mockups.\* Figure out what data you need to store and maybe make an ERD (entity relationship diagram)\* Sketch out the parts of the system - what's in the app, what's in the backend? What information do they need to communicate? What tech stacks will they use?\* Once you've got that all figured, write the smallest sliver of one part of it that can possibly be tested.\* Then write another small sliver that connects to the first one you created, see if they work together.\* They probably won't work together, so rewrite as needed.\* Repeat until you have a big enough chunk of functionality you can show/demo to see if it actually meets your requirements.\* Revise your requirements as needed, write more tiny pieces of functionality, test them with everything else, rewrite, repeat.Anyways, don't be afraid of scrapping code and starting over. It isn't a big deal. You'll do it lots and that's *fine*.

nkufb3l,"Not building Apps, but PC programs and Web-apps. Mostly small scale and/or personal projects right now, but I have experience with medium sized project (50 devs, over 1k active users, < tens of millions of datapoints)There is not one perfect order. This is the first decision you will have to make: Where do you start, and what project style do you go with.Since I am currently building a one man project, I can give you the order of operations as I did it:1. Rough outline: What is my project? Why would people care? What problem does it solve? What solutions are already available? Who are the potential users?2. Feature list: Itemized list of all features it should have. For each Feature I wrote down for whom it is useful, and what I need to to technically to get it to work. (Networking, database, things like that)3. Feature details: I then added something similar to user stories to my features: Basically, short descriptions of how a user would interact with it, and what they would expect to happen/see. On my whiteboard, I then drew a lot of boxes, denoting my features, and connected them with arrows: ""Feature A needs Feature B"", or ""Feature C leads to Feature D""4. I took everything I've built up to this point, and made UI mockups. First ""wireframes"" with a pen and paper, to roughly block out what could go where. then I made a single page in detail, to decide on a style for my UI. With those two in hand I went to some potential users, and used them to ""test"" my idea. I put the papers in front of them and asked them to perform a task (and I ended each test session by letting them choose a few tasks themselves) This resulted in me changing quite a few of my designs and intended workflows. It is good to catch errors as early and cheaply as possible. Changing the blockout version of a site costs a few hours in drawing, changing a coded version would take days or weeks.5. Then I sat down with my new UI and double checked, that all planned features are present, and that all parts of the UI are part of a planned feature. If not, I adjusted either side until I was happy. Then I used my feature List to plan my tech stack (yes, I did it this late in the game) Now I knew everything I wanted my (web)app to do and what it needed to do. So I chose rust(leptos) frontend, rust(axum) backend and postgresQL as my database. (shocker)6. With my new tech stack in hand, I made some rough diagrams of the architecture of the front and backend, something like a UML diagram, but much less formal. (because I am alone, as long as I can guarantee that I understand it, it's fine, and I have been using the same ""almost-UML"" since year 2 of university) I also mapped out the DB, but in excruciating detail, every nullable field, every relationship. Then I double checked again, that every feature, both in the UI and my docs, is present in my database.7. Then I started implementing a vertical slice: Meaning a single feature, from the DB to the UI, ""fully"" functional. I took this to even more testers, got feedback and did a final round of adjustments to my UI style plan.8. This is where I am now: I am currently implementing version 1 of my app, in it's entirety. This will be interrupted by testing with real users from time to time, but I am hoping that no major issues will come up, and I am confident that my architecture is strong enough to support refactoring most features.This is not ""the best"" way. But I was bitten by agile too often in the past, so for my free time, I wanted something a little more waterfally. I am certainly not moving as fast as I could, and if I was dependent on external funding, this might not be a path I could afford; but since it's only my spare time, I chose to take the time and try to get it right the first time. If I get it 75% right, I will be more than happy.EDIT: I forgot Step 0: I actually built a prototype. The UI was shit, and I only had 10% of my final featureset, but I wanted to see if the ""demand"" was there. It is. The UI was built sloppily over a few weeks with no plan, and was very unmaintainable.

nkxmvz8,"> I realized I should have built some of these other areas first because now I was back-tracking and making corrections to code I've already written when I wouldn't have to do that if I had just built everything in the right stacking order.Maybe. Maybe not. You should expect to have to rewrite parts of your code as you discover errors in previous assumptions, find better ways to do things, find that your requirements change, or whatever else comes along. That's why you try to have strong separation of concerns and loose coupling between well defined functions (and architectural layers) that can be swapped out at a later dateI would generally advise writing an end-to-end solution as early as possible, including installing your app on an iPhone/iPad to prove that it works in the wild.A good starting point for an architecture is to separate your app into 3 separate layers: data, business logic, and presentation logic. The data and business logic would be in the 'M' (model) of an MVC architecture, while the presentation logic would be in the 'V' (view).Try to think about how easy it would be to swap the components within one of those layers for other components with minimal impact on the rest of the app. The fewer changes you have to make to interfaces between layers, the more decoupled they are.> Can someone please breakdown their typical workflow, do you start with back-end? ground level framework stuff, and then work your way up to re-usable shared features that can nest into full components later?If you imagine your architectural layers as being stacked one on top of the other, with the data layer at the bottom and the presentation at the top, then my approach is to design the architecture from the top down, then again from the bottom up, then finally once more from the top down.I start from the top because that's where the user lives, and it's the user experience that will drive the app. There's always a bit of tension between the the best implementation for the UI and the best implementation for the data, and that tension has to be resolved somewhere in the middle (e.g. at the API); so once you've established your data models from the perspective of the user, it helps to look at the system again from the perspective of the models, make sure you've established the best way store and query those models, then see how your UI will interact with those models. With your new understanding of how the data will be modelled, you might find a better design for the UI, or at least refine how your UI interacts with the models.",marrsd,2025-10-23 10:37:25,1,learnprogramming,t3_1odj3hg,False,

If you're already at a school, shouldn't you just do what your teachers recommend? Specific tech stacks don't matter at all, you're getting a degree to learn how to think, not how to use languages.Data structures and algorithms are often taught in pseudocode because the principle mattes, not the implementation. Sometimes metaphors are used like lightbulbs or searching a phonebook, etc. Nevertheless, the C language is often used for more practical examples because it is barebones. There's not much high-level fluff and it feels closer to the actual memory implementation, which sometimes makes it feel more relevant to learn about sorting algorithms when working directly with raw arrays. A language like Python works just the same, but the ecosystem around it will throw high-level standard libs in your face, which already take care of all data structure and algorithms for you, so it feels more pointless than a lower level language.I've never heard that C++ or Java would be preferred for learning DSA, why would they? C++ is like C, just with classes and more high-level features, which aren't applicable when learning about the fundamentals.

So there isn't a quick and easy explanation I can give you that will make it easy to understand. It's going to take time and effort on your part.To learn about how something like Spring works, you have to read *both* high-level overviews *and* the detailed lower-level documentation. Since you've asked such a broad question, I don't think I can do much better than just pointing you to [the Spring documentation website](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/index.html). For quick answers to specific subtopics, I've found [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/) to also be pretty good.If you can post the code and ask *specific* questions, like ""where's the program's entry point"" or ""how does this function get called"" or ""what does this annotation mean"", then people can try to give you more specific answers. But the answers might not make much sense without background knowledge of how Spring works.As for Kafka: Kafka itself is not super complicated to use -- it just acts like a fancy persistent queue.

I normally start at the entry point (main function if applicable) and go deeper into the project from there, by following used classes, function calls and so on. If the project is big, I always have a whiteboard and / or stack of papers to take notes and draw diagrams of how it all connects. This step will take time, maybe hours or even days, depending on the size of the codebase. I also like to make small changes, like commenting out function calls, to see what breaks.

It’s also useful to get comfortable with Git/GitHub early; version control is super important even for small projects. Once you’re comfortable, branch out.

Here I detail exactly what I want and what it needs to be a success. This help keep things on track and prevent scope creep as I can always focus on what I really need and the real objectives in the background. 3) Plan. First through rundown of how I think I’ll build it. You don’t need to be exact on every detail but figure out what you’re going to need. Login section, landing page, diff options, processing input for ‘x’ or ‘y’ and how it’s done/what the out put should be. 4) Components. List out the big bits you need to do. Parts that need to be put together with key functions and features. It’s to track that plan you did earlier and figure out what needs to be done at a glance. 5) Variables Functions libraries and Header files. List out all the variable you’re using and why you use them, do the same for function. Very basic ones can just be named with type, you don’t need an explanation but if you won’t know at first glance what it does write it out. What are we importing from this library. Why did we make that header file and what’s in it/how does it work. Keep updating as you move along6) Working journal. This one might branch into a different file depending on the size of the project. Start the project, write out what you need to do first and what you’re planning to work on. I usually put the date in but that’s just for me to be able to look back over it. Every day I start by bringing unfinished tasks forward and writing out the next set of tasks I need to finish. Copy across what you’re doing and what’s not working and the final version when it is. Anything important or interesting I need to note for later goes in here. “Had to scrap an entire section and restart it”, throw that in here and explain why. At the end of the session I list out what I did today and what I need to do on the next session (cuts back 10-15 min of figuring out where to start when you sit down next time). 7) Closing Brief.

What would you like to improve further? And finally are you happy with the finished product? 8) Lessons learned, at the end of the file, where did you go wrong and what do you know now about doing “x”, “y” or “z” for next time. .Read Me file:After the project I’ll make the read me file. 1) Update the Concept, Aims, Components and Brief so I have a concise document that anyone I share the project with will be able to understand what’s going on and why it’s built this way. 2) Features:Detail what the project takes in and what the intended out puts should be. If it’s an API detail the call and expected output if it’s a web app follow a trace of how the user progresses through the app. Think of it as a guide on how someone else should use the application. 3) Components:List out the key functions and methods, how they work and how you’ve used them. No need for major details just let people know why it’s important and what you were thinking with it. 4) Closing Statement:Detail what you achieved in making this application. What needs more work and whether you intend to come back and work on anything else. .It’s a good habit to start tracking your projects as you go along even just for your own notes. When you look back at this in 6 months or 2 years are you going to know what you were thinking on April 3rd when you need to fix/plan around a similar issue in the future. The notes.txt file is just for me and I usually put it in the gitignore. It’s helped out in interviews when I was asked to walk through some of my work I’ll pull up my notes file and can quickly find key details on what I was doing and how I did it. I’ve shared my screen to show some of the details or pulled up A specific part of my journal where I figured out a problem. Really helps to have actual example of what you did and how you processed the problem before finding the solution. You can also then say “Well I know about this library now that fixes this for me but I could build it myself again if I needed to”. Very small concept projects or feature test I don’t do this out.

nkgg5f2,"Senior dev, sometimes look at candidates.Just link to your GitHub on your CV, maybe very briefly mention your most impressive project (if you have more than one). Make the repo(s) public (watch for secrets and personal data etc.).If you have a website too I might visit it, but 95% chance I won't. 1% chance I look at any of the code in the repos. We just don't have time for that, generally. I'll just look at the repo README to see what it is, then move on. With this in mind, it's a good idea to spend a bit of time on the README, telling me the details I need to know ""above the fold"" (without having to scroll down) like what the project is/does, where it runs, key technologies used etc. In a few formatted sentences or bullet points. I will never ever ever pull+build+run your projects. Again, I've got tens more candidates to screen, so anything you can do to dial back the bullshit, not add to it, is great. (E.g. I once passed on a candidate that had an obnoxious loading message on his website whilst his unnecessarily large front end bundle loaded and hydrated taking seconds to do all these fancy JS things. The exact opposite of impressive.)You don't need to deploy things, but if there's a convenient link in the README I will probably click it just to see what you built. I won't run through the features or anything unless it's a button push.Saved on your computer is only useful if you're screen sharing for a demo or something, like in an interview. Maybe have a local copy checked out and built in case you get the opportunity to demo or something. I would look positively on a candidate offering to show me a project we are discussing actually running, even if I didn't take them up on it.Doesn't matter for recruiters. Most of them are even less likely than us to look at projects in detail, they just pass these things along to client firms. Occasionally you get a recruiter that will click around but their feedback probably isn't very valuable in all honesty. They'll focus more on your CV itself and experience etc.In general don't worry too much. If we want to see you code we'll set a test (live, take-home etc.) as repo code could have come from anywhere and doesn't tell us much. Honestly, I mostly use projects to gauge the level of interest a candidate has in writing software, not their actual ability, as we expect that to be low at entry level.

nk6hzvt,"If you’re looking to get back into programming and want something practical that you can tinker with, leaning on languages like Java and C# (.NET) is a solid choice. Both are mature, widely supported, and have a lot of libraries that can make building things like a hotel PMS or a roster scheduler much more manageable. Java will give you platform independence, so you could run your programs on Windows, Linux, or Mac without much hassle, while C# and .NET are extremely well-integrated into Windows environments and offer rapid development with a lot of built-in UI frameworks. For your particular projects, SQL is going to be almost unavoidable if you want to store reservations, employee details, or scheduling data efficiently. Learning to combine either Java or C# with a relational database like MariaDB would cover most of what you need, and it’s exactly how most professional systems handle persistent data.For the hotel PMS, even if you already use Opera Cloud, building your own simplified version can be a great learning experience. You’ll get hands-on insight into the data structures and workflows behind reservations, room management, and billing, which will inform your understanding of what a full-scale system does behind the scenes. For the roster builder, the challenge lies more in logic and rules enforcement—handling days off, labor law restrictions, and employee availability can be complex, and practicing this in code will improve your problem-solving skills more than anything else. You could start simple, storing employee information and preferences in a database, then gradually implement more advanced scheduling algorithms as you learn.Here me out though: some of the most efficient POS systems ever made weren’t built on top of an operating system at all—they were written in assembly language. By coding directly to the hardware, developers could squeeze out incredible speed and reliability, especially in environments where every millisecond counts, like retail or hospitality checkout systems. Modern frameworks make development faster and easier, but looking at those old systems is a good reminder that understanding what’s happening at the low level can make you a much stronger programmer, even if you never touch assembly yourself. It’s all about learning how things work under the hood, and how your high-level code translates into actual performance. This also saves a ton of money on client end systems as the hardware doesn't need to support a full operating system since you've built it to be application specific. You wouldn't use a pc for what you can do with a 5 buck Arduino.If you're willing to learn a new language though, I'd recommend c++ as you can compile it for any operating system.",bringrainfire,2025-10-18 18:24:43,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oa2us3,False,

nknw7tp,"I think what you're being confused by is a special feature of unions in C++. When you declare a union starting with a simply typed field like an integer (or an enum, which is just integer values you that have certain names), or multiple such fields at the start of a union, C++ treats then as the ""Common Initial Sequence"" of the union. What that means is that the compiler assumes that all the struct union member types that follow, such as, say, SDL\_WindowEvent, SDL\_KeyboardEvent, and others -- that all of those structs themselves start with those fields/types. If your SDL\_Event event union is in a variable e, it lets you write e.type as a shorthand. What that actually means is ""no matter which member type (SDL\_WindowEvent, SDL\_KeyboardEvent, etc.) I'm currently interpreting my union variable as, I know it starts with an enum SDL\_EventType value (because I've arranged it so all the union struct types start with that field), so just interpret the first four bytes of this variable as the type.""I think (?) when you say 'shouldn't it be e.SDL\_EventType == SDL\_QUIT', what you mean is, 'when I access things from a union, I always have to specify which sub-type I'm thinking about the union as at that moment, so I expect to see e.SDL\_EventType or something like that, just like I would write e.SDL\_WindowEvent.whatever, and I shouldn't be able to access any field directly as e.type"". But you can because of this Common Initial Sequence convenience C++ gives you.On the other hand, if your question really is just about how enums work: An enum is just a way of telling the compiler that certain symbols stand for certain integer values. So when SDL defines the SDL\_EventType, one of the values in there is SDL\_QUIT, which is assigned some particular value (like 5 or whatever) by the enum. Your intuition is right that it's kind of more ""proper"" to refer to that value as something like SDL\_EventType.SDL\_QUIT (i.e., the SDL\_QUIT value as defined by the SDL\_EventType enum. But C/C++ let you just say SDL\_QUIT and it knows that by that you mean 5. It doesn't make sense to say e.SDL\_EventType because that's trying to refer to a field of e using a enum \*type\*. The actual field e is an integer, so it has values like SDL\_QUIT or other enum values defined by SDL\_EventType.",Immediate-Top-6814,2025-10-21 20:31:56,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ocmu53,False,

And you are responsible for accessing it through the field that represents its actual type.Accessing it through a member which doesn't correspond to its actual type is undefined behavior. **Except**, there is a special carve out in the rules that allows access through the wrong member if what you are accessing has a ""common initial sequence"" with the actual type.SDL uses this exception. The first member of the `SDL_Event` union is `UInt32 type;`, followed by a bunch of members of various struct types.Each of those structs must also begin with a `UInt32` so that they share the common initial sequence.

nk7mdp5,"SRP and DRY are just guidelines, not the law. They're fuzzy. You have to decide for yourself when to follow them.In this particular case, splitting out repeated code into a common function created a lot of value for you. Not only did it make your code shorter, but if you ever need to modify that logic you only need to do it once.In terms of the name, I think you're focused on describing how it works rather than what it does. It sounds like you have a function that retrieves data and caches it. You could just call it fetchAndCache. Or you could describe in more detail what API it calls and what sort of data it fetches and we could help you come up with a better name.It's not immediately obvious to me that the one function violates SRP. Even though it does multiple steps, if those steps are all related and all necessary for your code, then that may very well be a single responsibility.Furthermore, splitting it up into three separate functions didn't actually help anything. It didn't reduce your total lines of code. It didn't help reusability.That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, just that there's less clear benefit. Don't do it because you think you're ""supposed to"".>So according to SRP I need to destroy old function and in the place when it was 1 line call I need to past three lines chain in each place instead.I don't think that's what SRP says.Doing three related things that often need to be done together can be a single responsibility.SRP just suggests that if a function is doing multiple \*unrelated\* things, try to split them apart. In this case it doesn't sound like they're unrelated.Either way, whenever you follow a principle like DRY or SRP, the end result should make your code better. If it doesn't, then you don't have to apply it in that case.",dmazzoni,2025-10-18 22:07:23,3,learnprogramming,t3_1oa8oec,False,
nk8noku,"Depends on what you consider ""repetition"" and ""responsibility"", especially when ease of reuse is also a concern.""requestTokensThenExtractThenStore"" is one way to think of it? But so is ""handleRequest"". If the process a particular responsibility is a series of small tasks that *must* be grouped together, there's no strong argument against it, especially if it makes the code easier to reason about and reuse elsewhereIf you find later that you need to move the marshaling/unmarshaling out of that function for some reason you can do it later,  very little actually prevents thisOne thing I have found to be helpful is that DRY can be interpreted to mean ""Don't Repeat Yourself"" but it can also simultaneously be understood as ""Don't Repeat *Information*"" or DRI. So what does this mean exactly; it could be a caution against extracting logic when the information it's working with is very different from other forms of information that might be outbound/inbound to this kind of call. So while having a one-stop function for things like payload validation and Redis caching might sound nice, consider that the language and packages/libraries you're using are already doing that for you, and you adding more function calls as wrappers around those library functions may just be walling off even more utility and making your own code more inflexible",StickOnReddit,2025-10-19 01:58:00,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oa8oec,False,

Because if any of the three changes, it shouldn't affect the other two. So **you are better of with having three separate functions**, requestData, validateData and storeData.And of course you need a fourth function that uses those three, but don't call it something generic like `requestTokensThenExtractThenStore` \- use a better abstraction that fits in with what your application uses the data for. Could be `cacheParseTokensLocally()` or `buildNavigationStructure()` or `retrieveCustomerData()`.Naming is the hardest part - but don't think too much of what the function does, think more about where the function is used: what name would make sense to the programmer using it?",peterlinddk,2025-10-19 10:05:10,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oa8oec,False,

nk64p03,"The most important thing is you program literally anything outside of class. It's kinda like music if you are familiar where the kids who only do the coursework are at some lower level while the kids who practice regularly on their own time improve way way way faster. To me there are two general skills you need to get better at: programming, and building software. To get better at programming you can do competitive programming like that guy recommended, study DSA, or do leetcode problems. This will help you not only prepare for technical interviews but also enable you to tackle more complicated projects in the future.Speaking of projects, a project is any piece of software that you made on your own time. You can look up ""cs projects for beginners"" or just think of things you want to know about. You should do projects because it'll teach you how to solve real problems, how to stay organized and motivated, look good on your resume, and teach you a lot of programming adjacent stuff. For example if you do a project in C, you will have to learn how to compile programs that are composed of multiple files. This will lead you to different build tools like Make or CMake. Another useful thing for projects is it exposes you to all the different specializations in CS. At some point you should build a portfolio website to display your accomplishments. This will show you a little bit about web development. A really fun project can be recreating old games or making original ones. If you want to make more complicated game, you can try using an existing engine like Unity or Unreal Engine. If you want to make a more simple game, just try to figure out how to draw pictures to the screen and do it on your own. If you want to try embedded programming, you can purchase an arduino and try fiddling around with it.Last thing: it's important to differentiate between tutorials and projects. Following a tutorial can be good. It will be way easier and you will learn a lot. For harder concepts like graphics programming or compilers it's probably necessary to learn from some resource before striking out on your own. However, tutorials do not help you practice how to solve problems on your own, which is probably the most important reason to program in your own.

The overwhelmingly large population that is comfortable with programming and the way the development ecosystem is set up suggests that the fundamentals are extremely simple and you can get it easily.You can’t.Unlike calculus or trigonometry which are highly abstract concepts introduced decades into maths schooling, programming, also being a highly abstract concept, is taught immediately. You can maintain what a number is or how an operation works or even how to perform algebra in your head. But you cannot easily maintain how to work with a pointers in C/C++- which if you’re learning C in particular, is a not an advanced topic but is a fundamental topic without which you can’t use even a simple array.So the developer ecosystem has accidentally pushed a false narrative. Indeed, once you’re used to it it’s really easy to get chugging along. But until then, it requires a lot of mental effort in trying to understand- which I believe you haven’t put in yet. I never believed the notion that one can be good at math or programming and vice versa.

It is not the most powerful language, but it is more powerful than Cobol or machine language.> And in fact, our hypothetical Blub programmer wouldn't use either of them. Of course he wouldn't program in machine language. That's what compilers are for. And as for Cobol, he doesn't know how anyone can get anything done with it. It doesn't even have x (Blub feature of your choice).> As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the power continuum, he knows he's looking down. Languages less powerful than Blub are obviously less powerful, because they're missing some feature he's used to. But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn't realize he's looking up. What he sees are merely weird languages. He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well. Blub is good enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.>When we switch to the point of view of a programmer using any of the languages higher up the power continuum, however, we find that he in turn looks down upon Blub.

nl30abu,"This is not a forever problem; this is the inevitable outcome of a field that was in a hiring bubble during the past decade & during covid and which is in the continued process of a correction. People are really starting to grasp the reality that CS is different now, and this realization will only get more apparent as time goes on. Since most high school students who enrolled in CS during the last several years did so for the money, it's pretty obvious that most incoming high school students who possibly would have done so before are now going to pick something else by and large. Hence, we will likely begin to see enrollment decrease year by year, not least because of the upcoming enrollment cliff. Of course, there will still be high achievers, along with low achievers who are too naive to understand that CS has fundamentally changed. But I think that the middle achievers will be largely hollowed out such that in the end, it will become crystal clear who is worth hiring and who isn't worth hiring; and thus, the problem of resumes looking identical will go away, because now the quality distribution for new grads will be more bimodal and less uniform.Also, even though I agree with you that offshoring is a real thing, the way you have characterized offshoring is kind of strange and seems to contradict your views on new grads. Talent didn't just suddenly 'grow' abroad; apart from recently incoming juniors with potential, any people who were talented would have been talented before and it's not like they magically became talented during Covid. On top of that, it's not like talent grows on trees, as you can't just train anyone at all to become talented since there are certain untrainable innate characteristics which make people talented such as high IQ, innovative creativity, visuo-spatial capabilities and so forth. If that weren't the case, then surely all of the new grads could be ""grown"" by domestic companies hiring in-house, just like offshore employees are being ""grown"" by satellite offices. But like you said yourself, the median talent of new grads has deteriorated significantly and by now, they can't even do easy-medium leetcode problems and are essentially unfit for this field, as you also said. So this goes against your other idea that people can be made fit for this field. And as an aside, let's not pretend that talent doesn't vary by location.

I'd say from the beginning. CompE grew out of EE as a specialization in the 90s. Every CompE job will hire EE especially if you dump electives in CompE, but not the reverse. None of the EE work I did would interview a CompE. EE degree broadness is its strength. Power plant work? Power always needs EE/ME/ChemE.*But really, the reason EE is better is because of insane CompE overcrowding*. Same problem with CS. [Sort here](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market#--:explore:outcomes-by-major) by unemployment. Factoring in difficulty, CompE probably is the worst degree of all. Where I went, expected time to graduate is 4.0 years for CS, 4.4 for EE and 4.6 for CompE.***I can give specifics. I went to Virginia Tech when CompE enrollment was 3x smaller than EE and the job market looked equally good for both. Not anymore. [Check out](https://web.archive.org/web/20240813115247/https://ece.vt.edu/undergrad/enrollment.html) our degree and enrollment stats.

CompE job market is competitive as hell and the squeeze is worse if you aren't attending Tier 1.***I'm not saying everyone abandon CompE. If you have to-have to work in hardware then get the specialized hardware degree. Or if you can't handle or hate the ludicrous EE math, very little of which you will likely use IRL.

Don't bother finding out what they don't know, and let them know this say its okay to not know something. Don't let them flounder and meander if they obviously don't know, just move the conversation on. You only have a set amount of time to figure this person out.2. Let them show you what they do know and let them go into depth about it. If they have a project or past work experience this is a good place to start, ask them what they did, what decisions they made and if they might change those decisions in hindsight. 3. Have prepared questions. This doesn't mean a script but you need to be able to move the conversation on if it gets stuck. Hopefully your company has good enough practices the topics for your interview are defined, but if they aren't you should know what skills/tech/aptitudes are important for your job since ideally you have them.4. You aren't trying to trick them, too many interviewers do this where they will ask a misleading question to see if the candidate just takes the bait. The problem is candidates are nervous and will always be hesitant to disagree with the interviewer. Keep questions straightforward and open ended. 5. My most important advice especially if you are an early round interview, you aren't trying to find the number 1 candidate. You are trying to avoid the bottom 90 candidates. At the end of your interview (assuming your company has good hiring practices) you should be able to fill in these blanks about every candidate:I would/n't hire this person.If we did hire them these are my concerns __________ .If we did hire them here is where I think they would excel ________.",Dangerpaladin,2025-10-21 14:11:01,14,cscareerquestions,t3_1ocd99x,False,

The questions go from generically about the tech/stack they used to more specific questions about implementation details. Having rarely interviewed the perfect experience fit, I like to ask as much about their work as their familiarity with our tools to gauge how thoughtful they are as a developer. I think the equivalent of white boarding for UI work is asking to pseudo code a rudimentary application that paginates streams of data or an account creation client app. If you aren't the sole interviewer, take note of what others are asking and try to overlap with the other interviewers are trying to pique.",shade_study_break,2025-10-21 14:09:55,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1ocd99x,False,

Hiring good people (with good skills and high ownership), b.

Weeding out the bad apples - hopefully fast.In a long-term play, a few days, weeks, sometimes months of lean periods do pop up, and that’s the opportunity to clean house (reduce tech debt, refactor, cross-learn from other modules, do hackathons, and have fun, etc). And good bosses keep their own backlog of these things ready for these low periods.Tech work is not as transactional as some other careers. The value generated by good engineers compounds with time as they improve their skills and understand the domain better. 'Keep them busy - no matter what' attitude usually leads to a sub-optimal outcome.So no, bosses don’t look for ways to cut their teams as soon as they run into a low patch.This doesn’t apply to situations like contracting, a dying/loss-making company, bad performers, over-hiring (which happened right after COVID), and teams run by bad management/bosses.",eRajsh,2025-10-23 09:07:28,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1odxic5,False,

Some companies don't spend any time getting on the same page on how to interview people, criteria, etc. They just assume devs will know how to interview people and throw them in there. There are also people who literally do not care. Having worked with some hiring teams, there are devs who care more about their work deliverables than interviews. It's possible the feedback you received is valid, it's also possible it's wrong. That being said, I'm not sure you should be so sure you submitted what they were looking for.

I think you just need to realize hiring is an imperfect process, and some company passing on you isn't necessarily an accurate assessment of your ability to do the work. You have to just forget those who passed on you and keep looking for a job that will fit. Also, don't assume people are spending a lot of time doing a really personalized candidate tracking process.

But it's unlikely to be one that ends in you getting promoted into a leadership role.Few organizations with any sense are going to ""gamble"" on that sort of transition. As a manager/staff+ person your ability to affect the organization increases significantly. That has as much potential to skyrocket the value you provide as it does for you to completely crater important initiatives and entire teams. Organizational leadership will want to see that you are capable before officially putting you into a role with more responsibility. In this case, your best option to move upwards is to find a new job and tell very convincing tales during interviews.Your manager is telling you: They think you have what it takes, and want you to show some initiative.> Obviously I want to continue getting raises, but I'm reaching that mid-high experience point where I become leadership or become a slacker.I can't speak for every org, but mine loves our ""super seniors"" -- ones who aren't quite staff+/management, and have no desire to be, and are happy to continue owning major feature-sets and mentoring newer engineers, and are happy to sit at the tippy-top of that Senior Engineer pay band in perpetuity. There's value in people who are exceptionally good at the ""chop wood, carry water"" work, and who have an inclination to do it.

There was a compiled DBase III (Which Foxbase was based on) language called Clipper. My first job included some Clipper development in a MSDOS environment. In that same position I found that OS/2 and a third party multitasking DOS (which I think was built by the same guys who did Dr Dos) called DRM Dos were able to run the Clipper applications. The closest thing my company had to a ""Server"" application was a restaurant reservation application that I developed that ran on multiple terminals hanging off a 386 running Drm Dos.The oldest thing I've run across since then was a Motif application that a Satellite company was maintaining (*Edit:* This was in 2015). The oldest comments were from the mid 90's and some of the functions still used K&R function declaration syntax. I'd actually experimented with Motif while I was working at my first job, so I had bit of an advantage there.Their code actually generated three executables and shared a header file which declared 400+ global variables -- ALL the variables used in the application, pretty much. There were multiple places where global variables were mirrored -- another variable was created that duplicated the intent of an earlier variable. I was unable to determine if this was because they forgot the other variable existed or they weren't sure they could change the variable safely because some other function might need it set to a specific value at some later point. Probably a bit of both. This meant that you'd have to find the variable that was shared between the various functions of the code you were working on right now and insure that you were changing the right mirrored variable. You'd also have to hope that those changes wouldn't break some other functionality of the application. And yes, that was every bit as bad as it sounds.I went in with a philosophy of never adding another global variable to the code unless it resulted in the removal of at least two others. They were unwilling to do anything major with the code and everyone in that building got laid off a bit later, before I had a chance to really get it under control. Hopefully that entire code base was simply deleted after that. That abomination should not have been allowed to continue past that point.I'd say I'd seen worse code over the years, but only a couple of other cases I can think of where I'd actually define the code as ""an abomination."" All the code that I would describe as ""an abomination"" was developed by developers who clearly didn't know what they were doing in the least, because ""Global variables bad"" was something they were already teaching in college in the early and mid 80's.

These companies are huge with around 100k employees so it’s impossible to have widespread cultural changes quickly). Baked into the agile process is the decoupling from requirements driving code and moving towards user stories. By the book agile means that every user story has an acceptance criteria which resembles a unit test. This means teams (again, not everywhere but it is slowly propagating as a culture) perform test driven development where they inherently do red-green-refactor. Built in the development process, devs usually are presented a failing TDD/BDD style acceptance criteria to get started (red), they write just enough code to pass the test (green), and they (refactor) the code with the safety of the tests performing safe operations from Fowler’s refactoring book that may use GoF patterns. Some teams have a senior engineer or software architect that write user stories or tests that explicitly force software into a particular architecture or forces a design pattern in order to be implementable. So yes, we do refactor but it’s baked into the process. Code doesn’t break because it is common to have projects have a strict requirement for 80-100% test coverage. Unit testing is just one level. We have integration, system, and end-to-end tests with real hardware in a lab. There are projects that try to redo an entire existing system, but they tend to be wasteful and expensive.",Tendou,2025-10-21 12:33:47,12,cscareerquestions,t3_1oc9e94,False,

nkm50cz,">just so you can have easier life with maintainingYou're dismissing the value of refactoring... it's not so I can have an ""easier life"", although that can be a side effect. The goal of refactoring is to make the system easier to extend, update, and understand.When you have a brittle system, actual feature changes are significantly more likely to break production.When you have a difficult to extend system, seemingly simple feature changes can take months (or years!) to complete, costing the company tons of money and time.When you have a difficult to understand system, your employees because a single point of failure. When one person leaves the company, now you have to find their replacement or else the project timeline gets delayed by several more months. But when the system itself is cryptic and difficult to understand/modify, it takes significantly more time to onboard a new employee, easily resulting in a year+ of lost productivity. That high onboard cost can often get teams into a situation where *all* their developers leave, and now you have a fresh team of people that don't understand the codebase. This is how ""black boxes"" get created, by not refactoring combined with turnover.All this kinda plays into retention, which exacerbates everything. A complex, brittle, difficult to work with, system is *not* pleasant to work on. If management has no interest in letting the SWE's improve that system, then those SWE's won't be staying at that company for very long. High turnover introduces new developers, who are significantly more likely to break prod, while also having a very long and expensive onboarding process.So yeah, in critical areas, you *need* to refactor. The costs of not doing it aren't always immediate, but it's significantly more dangerous than not refactoring at all. Any halfway competent engineering manager will be going to bat for their SWE's to refactor against product and upper management. This is the balance of a healthy SWE team. Product is pushing for features, upper management is pushing for results/money, engineering management is pushing for a stable/maintainable/extendable codebase. If either of those 3 prongs get an inordinate say, you're on a toxic team.That said, there are very well defined approaches to refactoring a legacy codebase. Writing a massive PR with +10000/-12000 isn't the way to do it. That's a high risk PR whether it's a refactor or a new feature.

A few things about a masters, it absolutely can help you get a job if you’re struggling to get one now. However, you need to have a complete mental shift if you decide to get a masters. A masters will be entirely worthless if you view it as just more school. You should treat it like a job which means you should take the hard classes intentionally, if you look for easy A’s you’re wasting your time and money. You should also get involved in graduate research (this is also how you might be able to get the school to pay for your degree + a monthly stipend). Doing research is free experience that can help you land an internship and/or a job. Talking about my graduate research during an interview is probably how I got my first job. This means you need to go to a graduate school that is a notable research institution. Also note that Trump has gutted NSF funding so some PhD programs are not even fully sponsored now and they will certainly get sponsorship priority over a grad student. I can answer more questions if you have any but if you wasted your undergrad you’re probably going to have a hard time getting into a worthwhile graduate program and even harder time getting it paid for. You might be able to reach out to an old professor and offer free research labor and maybe work your way into getting them to sponsor you eventually or at least see if you have what it takes to do a masters while getting at least something resembling real experience",WeastBeast69,2025-10-20 03:41:23,18,cscareerquestions,t3_1ob434j,False,

You're bouncing from ego to ego of the full time teaching staff that have never been in the private sector, but are charged in preparing you for it. I wrote essays on the ""Browser Wars,"" traced some algorithms, tried out some new programming languages, but NOTHING from college prepared me better for my fulltime career. I actually did a bootcamp for the time that I had my degree, yoe and still couldn't get interviews because my history was in legacy systems (COBOL + Mainframe). So everyone reading those COBOL developers are drowning in offers, just know that's a very hurtful clickbait lol. But the bootcamp gave me a full stack experience that tripled anything of value from college, since we used a template of Flask. That bootcamp gave me 90% of my modern view of development work. I started working personal projects until I got hired to do API work. There's nothing of any value from my undergrad degree. I answer these because I'm a contrast for some of your worldview. I experienced it in the weird oddball way that OP highlighted. I broke into the career, then got my degree, then continued my career. Calc 2 and 3 didn't make me a better developer, it made me better at test taking and studying. Data Structures and Algorithms were already known, but I didn't know what was available in modern and other languages from COBOL. I was working in procedural languages, so I got an OOP lesson, which was neat, and I probably had the best OOP professor who added in how he uses it practically which is what many of my classes taught by academics were missing. My electives were taught by academics and did not help me apply much of my core studies. A bioninformatics class had given me hope, but the teacher just read from the book and power points and we had a 3-4 week intro to what bioinformatics is and the tools used before getting our hands on anything. My DevOps class opened where the professor asked us ""What is DevOps,"" and started taking notes and building that syllabus on the first day. We didn't touch git until our software engineering final group project and most of the class couldn't figure it out. I solemnly promise that I did not need to get a bachelor's degree and am now Senior level in my shop. The classes were full of old material taught identically for over a decade.

My team recently laid off a new mom after her maternity leave for ""performance"" (the company was not performing well and pushed everyone to work longer hours which she did not do) and it felt very scummy.I feel like you have 3 routes you can go. The first is to find a job at a company that has a relaxed WLB. That's hard to do on command, at any company, in any role. Historically the best option has been government work, which right now is more volatile than it has been in the past. When I've seen this work out for people in the private sector, the situation is usually that they got hired into a ""boring"" company that doesn't pay particularly well, and they stayed long enough that they're performing well and worth more in the market vs. their current job so therefore they have the leverage to push for a great WLB. This isn't your situation. So if you can find a company like this, great! But I wouldn't bet the house on it.Option two is to accept that you're going to end up working longer hours than you want to for a while. I don't think it actually matters whether you stay in software or pivot to sales, PM, solutions engineering, or recruiting (which are the most common pivot options). Those may be more people oriented and may be a better fit if that's what you want in a job, but you aren't necessarily more likely to stay employed, or have an easier time finding work.

Feeling trapped between financial obligations, career dissatisfaction, and the loyalty you feel towards your team, especially with such significant projects on the horizon, must be incredibly isolating. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when facing such critical decisions, particularly when they involve your health, your peace of mind, and your ability to start a family. When you're dealing with such frequent panic attacks and the daily drain of a job you dislike, it's natural for your brain to feel like it's in overdrive, making it hard to see a clear path forward. Prioritizing your mental health is never a sacrifice; it's an investment in every other aspect of your life, especially when you're considering bringing a child into the world. It might be helpful to explore different ways to manage the acute symptoms of anxiety, especially since your current medication situation is changing. Sometimes just having a toolkit of techniques can make a big difference in those overwhelming moments.

nl3aos6,"It's a matter of picking your battles. In my experience ""clean code"" is very much in the eye of the beholder and is more a matter of whether the author and the reader are on the same page rather than any objective superiority of any particular method of coding. Just like any other sort of writing. There are of course some general principles that tend to make things better, and it is certainly possible to make *horribly unclear* code, but past a certain point a lot of it really is a matter of taste.So essentially a person who has strong opinions about specific details of how code should be written is similar to a person who thinks their preferred genre of music is superior to others, or otherwise thinks their taste is superior -- they are wrong, but it's going to be very difficult to convince them of that, and the more persuasive you are the more they will probably dig in and get pissed at you.So you'll need to decide which things *you* care about and which things you don't. If you don't actually care about something, just go along with what they want and smile and nod anytime they try to justify it, content that they're trying to justify it to themselves as much as to you.If you do care, really think again about whether you actually do care. Lots of people don't actually care about things they fight for but rather let ego get tied up in it and are instead fighting over ego. Try to avoid that if possible. So really think about whether you genuinely do care.And if you genuinely do, try to act in good faith. Explain what you think, then invite them to explain what they think and walk you through their thought process and be genuinely open to it. They might actually have good reasons, and so *you* should be open to changing *your* mind. But inviting them to explain will both make them feel like they are valued (which is important to them if they have strong opinions about how the code should be written) and also let them talk themselves out of ideas that are bad (like, if you explain a good idea and ask them to explain theirs, they will have a hard time denying yours is better if they actually have to explain it, and because it is them talking it through and deciding they will be more likely to compromise than if you order them to).Inviting them to explain also gets both of you on the same side -- rather than arguing you are instead both looking at the same problem and talking about it as a thing separate from yourselves. And that change in perspective is helpful -- it makes them feel less like *they* are being devalued if their ideas aren't used.In my experience, most workers do ultimately want to get along and do good stuff, and if you can diffuse their defense mechanisms and avoid getting defensive yourself you can usually find a common ground.But if a person truly is an asshole and can't be reasoned with and truly is my way or the high way, and you really do care about the thing they're digging in on, your best bet is probably to try to go around them. Build support for others / get others to validate your view. After all, if the person is an asshole to you then they have probably been an asshole to others as well, and so you probably will find support.

I think if you're starting with a design pattern, and working backwards, that's really backwards. Sometimes with enough experience you short-circuit the logic though. For example, I'm a big fan of step builder pattern in the main language I use ( Rust ). Why? It's pretty ergonomic and it makes it so invalidly using the API is a compiler error rather than a runtime error. So whenever I have a highly customized struct or state machine, I tend to lean towards step builder off of prior experience.

nktd3e8,"This is kinda like a broad question, but I'll say this.Most the time, in like an enterprise software development environment, you are using some framework that has some design pattern it prescribes to get the job done. So, its probably quite uncommon that most people aren't using design patterns in some capacity.That being said, I think design patterns are a thing you should be able to understand and reason about but I actually think they are overused and can be harmful, hot take incoming and I'm sure I'm gunna get downvoted into oblivion.The problem is design patterns draw your focus away from the problem you are solving and make you focus on the organization of the code itself. Nothing about design patterns makes you're code A) correct or B) performant, and most the time you end up taking what was a really simple problem and making it wayyyyy over engineered and over abstracted. The worst is when people go to build out something and they start with a design pattern in mind that they want to use and the first implementation is driven by that pattern, rather than the actual problem that needs to get solved. Outside of stuff prescribed by a frameworks, starting with a pattern is a terrible idea, you have no idea what functioning code will look like and even worse, you have no idea if a pattern is even necessary for what you are trying to accomplish. Depending on what patterns you are even using, you may actually be affecting the compilers ability to optimize the instruction set because it can't reason about the amount of misdirection you have introduced into the code.I'm not saying there is never a use case for design patterns, but more often than not, if you just keep it simple and straight forward, your life will be easier.
