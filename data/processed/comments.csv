nnfkk05,"I don't think data quality is purely owned by product managers any more than security, availability, and scalability are.The biggest issues in my opinion are: * Data & software engineers and product managers have little understanding of the impacts and contributing factors to data quality issues. * Data engineers build systems in which they copy the encapsulated schemas from source systems into their warehouse to then transform them. Well, yeah, that's a solution that is pretty much guaranteed to cause a ton of DQ problems. As opposed to having the source system publish domain objects that are locked down with data contracts. * Data engineers build almost no quality-control tests, no unit testing, no reconciliation checks, no anomaly-detection, and no field transform audits to track changes over time. dbt and great expectations are generally poor tooling that only address a fraction of this. * Product managers, given zero push from engineering, leave out all considerations of data quality - no SLOs, no dashboards, no investment. Which means it falls 100% on the engineer's heads.It doesn't have to be that way.

The way they do so is perfect for them.Marketing want a single customer view. Neither line of business collect the data in a form that allows comparison. You now have a data quality problem.The only way I have found to improve the data quality is to fix it at source. You do this by making the down stream data vital to the earnings of both lines of business. Customers get pissed off because, as far as they are concerned they are buying from company X. They couldn't give 2 hoots for the fact they bought product line A which is different from product line B.

One large org I used to work for had biweekly calls with representatives from each of our source systems and the warehouse team for that purpose.

One day you will want to add unit tests for the transformation, for corner cases, etc. and having logic in pure functions (functions that takes DataFrame and return DataFrame) will simplify things, because you won't need to mock i/o, but can just write tests.2. Move configuration logic away from transformation logic. You can create a singleton ""context"" class or an abstract class for the ""job"" and re-use it everywhere. When I say ""configuration"" I mean things like partition dates, input schemas or s3 paths. Again, it will simplify both maintenance (anyone who wants just to check a path or a config do not need to dive into transformation logic) and testing (you can test config and transformation separately).3. Do not write a very long chain of pyspark transformations, it is really hard to read. Instead separate logical parts into small functions. Simplify reading the code, transformation and testing.Overall: the main benefit of using PySpark DF API over SQL is that you can benefit from all the Python tooling for working with growing complexity of the codebase (functions, classes, imports, objects, tests, etc.). So, such a migraton, imo, makes sense only if you are going to use this benefits. In other words, you should start thinking about your ETL as about the software product and use the correspondence best practices.

Based on this it appears that new queries take an average of 2 hours to validate we're using the data correctly, given X new queries per month this translates to Y total time and vast friction.

nngmmh4,"The cleanest most ""correct"" solution I've seen on GCP is to switch to the KubernetesPodOperator. The gist is that every single task in your DAG runs in its own isolated Pod in GKE. This is where the magic happens: you can apply labels to these pods: dag\_id, task\_id, and most importantly, customer\_id. Then you just go into GCP's native billing, which can group costs by those labels, and you can see exactly how much a specific DAG for a specific customer is costing you, down to the penny But if a full migration to Kubernetes is too much, there's a ""good enough"" method. Instead of tracking dollars, track resource-hours. Airflow logs the duration of every task. If your workers are a standard instance size (e.g., n2-standard-4), you can build a simple cost model: cost = duration\_in\_hours \* cost\_per\_hour\_of\_worker.

However you can often tag individual 'task runs' of ECS/Cloud Run instances and have those trickle into billing natively. In my experience you do lose out on additional aspects like networking out, which can be substantial, and if you can't find a way to associate that you'd need a top level overhead you append onto each task or maybe by runtime. Regarding non-efficient tasks, what does that mean? Airflows native monitoring shows the Task Duration and Landing times. Perhaps also look at sensor runtimes to subtract from overall runs as they're 'efficient'.My opinion would be that Airflow is a task orchestrator and attempting to patch in some sort of cost observability natively would not work well. Use the systems that are native to billing are the way to go. If your environment is stupid complex per tenant, we used to have terraform project creation to deploy tenant environments and then you can provide permissions for airflow to run compute/etc in those projects.

That setup gives you second-level latency, but it’s a lot of infra to maintain and debug.If you’re okay with a few minutes delay, it’s usually easier to land raw CDC tables in a warehouse using a managed connector and build an incremental dbt model that joins them together. You can re-materialize the wide table on a schedule, and it’s much simpler to manage than a full stream topology. For 500M rows, ClickHouse will handle this fine if you pick a good sort key; BigQuery works too, but watch out for costs on frequent MERGE operations. I wouldn’t rely on triggers in Postgres unless you have a very low write rate. they’re painful to debug and can slow your OLTP side.What kind of latency do you actually need, and are those 7 tables small dimension tables or all large fact-like tables?

nnuzd78,"Genuine question for you OP, or to anyone else who wants to take a crack at it. I find most resources for learning when it comes to programming to be quite frustrating, and they don't explain enough. I was only able to do a semester of computer science, but I was attending a university generally quite well regarded for their computer science / cybersecurity programs. I ended up having to stop attending for financial reasons, unfortunately. Anyway, what I LOVED about their program is that it broke everything down to the fundamentals. It's been a few years so some of the following may be incorrect. This is just an example, but they had us learning C++ and started us off by learning how a computer works. Then they had us learning how a variable is basically just assigning a name to a block of memory, and storing data in that location. Or how arrays are sequentially assigned blocks of memory, so if you know where X index of an array is located in the memory, you can find the other indexes. How you can't dynamically increase the size of the array due to how C++ is reserving memory, how typing works, etc. I find that with most learning resources, they just don't even *attempt* to explain how a particular thing works beyond a basic level. But then when you try to wade into the waters of reading documentation, it's so filled with technical jargon that it's often incomprehensible to a beginner. I don't want to build legos and just slap stuff together. I don't want to know how to USE a particular programming concept, I want to actually know how it works. I recall when I was younger, attempting to build some small projects. Inevitably, I would write a bit of code that I thought understood in one project, and try to re-use the same concept in another project with a slightly different use-case, only to find that it fundamentally was not doing what I originally thought it did. When that happens now and again? Not a big deal. When that's happening pretty frequently? It becomes frustrating, and it makes me think that even when I can re-use a concept in multiple projects successfully, that I still don't totally get what it's doing. That's the issue that I have with trying to learn by just trying to make something. I care a lot less about making any one particular project, and a lot more about knowing how everything I'm doing actually functions. Anyway, huge block of text over.

I was young and inexperienced and stormed in and demanded an explanation why they had ""regressed our performance"". He calmly explained the situation. To get the release out on Saturday night he had to modify the structure of the data slightly...in a way that was incompatible with my traversal. He had spent about half an hour trying to figure it out, writing unit tests to test the old and new structure...old passed, new didn't, the issue he was troubleshooting came down to the algorithm. It had no tests other than the ones he wrote. No comments explaining the reasoning behind it. It was not obvious to him why a convoluted and non standard algorithm was used. He had to fix it, and had to support it, so he did the reasonable thing and replaced it with a well known algorithm that worked with his new unit tests. Problem solved, release shipped.Starting to sympathize with the predicament he was in I explained my concern...the performance wasn't ""optimal"". ""'Optimal'? how do you know yours was 'optimal'?"" I stammered a bit and conceded I didn't actually know...but it \*was\* more efficient. ""Benchmarks?"" ....""no...I never benchmarked it"". ""What cases does it work with""....""oh..this and that and the other...."". His response was ""how do you know?"". ""I tested it!"" .....""No...no you didn't. There were no tests. There are now. We know this works, when it works, and how it works."" I responded indignantly ""but it's slower"". ""By a couple milliseconds, a few dozen times a day it runs. Do you care about that? Why? Isn't it better to know it works because it is tested with cases we expect it to handle?""""Yeah. If I write unit tests to fix the trivial issue with the original algorithm can I replace it?"" .... ""I guess you can....but is a few milliseconds of execution time a dozen times a day worth the effort? Don't you have actual bugs to fix?"" ....""Yeah....""....""Then do it the next time you change that code"". It never had to change. I never put it back.If I'd written unit tests showing the conditions the traversal handled, what it's preconditions were, etc he would have fixed the trivial issue with it and gone about his way, me none the wiser. Because I did a shoddy job it became his problem, and he fixed it the most expedient way possible...reasonable while the entire release team is twiddling their thumbs waiting for a critical fix.If you don't unit test your code it doesn't really work. It \*might\* work. But you don't know that. You don't know what it is expected to handle. You don't know how its author was intending it to be used.

nogcy1t,"I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering.Computer Engineering is a sub-discipline of Electrical Engineering that branched off in the 1960s and 1970s. It focuses heavily on electrical theory and its application to digital systems. Main focuses are electronic components, signalling systems, control systems, circuitry, embedded and integrated systems, logic design, and system programming. Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering students will typically have a high degree of common courseload.Computer Engineering students at most universities will do a lot of VHDL/Verilog programming, as well as a lot of C programming. CE programs often include a number of compulsory Software Engineering courses focuses on operating systems and data structures; at some institutions these courses may fall under Computer Science.Computer Engineering is not for the faint of heart. It is brutal, but if you enjoy the guts of computers, you will love it.Software Engineering is a fairly new Engineering discipline and is still not as widely accredited as Computer Engineering. Software Engineering is an endeavour to apply the principles of engineering (ethics, public interest, safety, principled design, etc...) to what has historically been a tradecraft.Purist arguments aside, Software Engineering focuses almost exclusively on the practical aspects of programming and software development with a light dusting of multi-discipline studies.A spate of high-profile and high-casualty structural failures (bridges, buildings, viaducts, waterworks, etc...) during the early 1900s taught us that traditional engineering disciplines needed to be carefully regulated to ensure that members of the public weren't put into danger by people who had no idea what they were doing.A spate of high-profile and sometimes high-casualty software and/or control system failures (Therac-25, Cherynobyl, Three-Mile Island, the entire company of Boeing, Mars Climate Orbiter, etc...) during the 1970s through 2000s taught us the same thing about software development. Everyone involved in critical design and decision making needs to have their eye on the ball at all times; failing to do so can result in death.Computer Science is a field of applied mathematics and is more concerned with theory and abstract concepts than practical application of those concepts. I once worked with an individual with a PhD in Computer Science who hadn't done *any* actual programming; his interests were largely data driven business analytics.Whereas Computer Engineering and Software Engineering are accredited Engineering programs with a fairly standardized level of instruction across institutions, Computer Science is not. A Computer Science program at one institution may be radically different than a Computer Science program at a different institution.In Summary,If you think you might enjoy Computer Engineering, buy yourself an inexpensive FPGA development board such as the [Terasic DE10-Nano](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=167&No=1046) or ask for one for christmas. If you enjoy mucking about with that, then Computer Engineering is the field of study for you.If you think that you might enjoy Software Engineering, start biting your teeth on C and C++ if you haven't done so already, do some tutorials in Qt (or any other application development framework), and get familiar with POSIX operating systemsIf you think that you might enjoy Computer Science, study the differences between binary search trees, B-Trees, and B+-Trees.

nnn4ojv,I think a free course like the Odin Project is far better suited for learning coding (or web development). What is very important is direction. You need to know what to learn and at what point. Then once you think you got it by reading the theory you must prove it to yourself by doing a project and using the theory to build something. Here the Odin Project also does a great job. You learn the theory and then you build a project they provide where for each project you need all the theory you were supposed to learn prior. The course is hard and takes a long time to finish but imo is far better than a 5 hour youtube tutorial. Just watching someone code or just copying a project is not the same as creating your own version of a project which you will be required to do in the Odin Project. It reads like an ad but I did use it to learn Web Development and I just legit think it's a fantastic course if you are ready to put the time and effort in.,sandspiegel,2025-11-07 18:54:28,5,learnprogramming,t3_1or1yds,False,

Make things work. Break things, then fix them so they work. You can spend 10 years learning the theory but until you actually code something it just won't really click.

Just do the best you can in the time and the resources you are given. It's a job and you and your job are replaceable, your mental wellbeing is not replaceable. There is no point in beating yourself.2. As a lead developer it means honest communication towards your boss is paramount. Do not lie and be real. Don't be afraid to say ""I don't know."". If you do not know something, your answer also should be ""I will try to find out."". If you land in a dead end for a problem, just be upfront if anyone asks. It's also a learning experience for you, no one was born a master and mistakes happen. The best employee is someone who is honest with his bosses so they can make the best business decisions. When you are stuck do not be afraid to ask for help.3. Build prototypes and MVPs (minimum viable product) if needed to test things out before diving deep into frameworks or libraries. That way you mitigate the risk of making bad decisions, which are only noticed weeks or months later.4. Since you are working alone you need to be really self organized. Write notes, write documentations, make todo lists for yourself (e.g. a small scrum project management, a kanban board). That way it's also easier to get a grasp on what your goals are, what you are doing.

And it doesn't get easier. I *think*, but I'm not sure, that we get faster at it.My steps.1. Reproduce the problem, if possible. Get to the point where you can make the problem happen every time. If possible. Understand the inputs and other things that cause the failure. There are some bugs that are intermittent. Those are the worst. You can learn about [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) someday, but not today. If it's your thing write a test case which generates the bug.2. Try to figure out exactly which line of code caused the bug. If you get a traceback or other error message, it can tell you this. The top line of the traceback (bottom line in Python, why, Guido, why, did you do this backwards?) probably shows you the source file and line number where the problem occurred.3. Eyeball the code and the error message. Read the error message three times carefully; it often tells you exactly what is wrong in a language you don't quite understand.4. Learn to use a debugger to step through your code line by line. Start stepping (set a breakpoint) a few lines before the suspect line and do step step step. 5. Try putting in a fix to the problem.6. Repeat these steps.7. If you get frustrated after doing all this, take a break. Get a good night's sleep. Sometimes the answers to my bugs have come to me in dreams.

What kind of int it is depends on the platform- could be a 32 bit pointer, 16 bit pointer, 64 bit pointer, etc. ‘\n’ is the newline character, it’s not a pointer to a character array. So when you try to assign it to a char * you’re attempting to tell p to point to the memory at 0x0A, which is an invalid memory location. The compiler senses that you’ve done an implicit cast and is warning you that you’re probably not doing what you wanted.

Pointer stores adresses, not primitive values, so you get an error. Correct thing here would be allocating memory (excuse my C++) like `char* p = new char;` and then dereferencing it to assign the value to the memory block that you just allocated `*p = '\n';`The thing with text in "" "" works because thats a string, and string type is const char* which is the same as char* so there is no unkown conversions.

In this moment i’m learning python, but i really hated the dependencies and setting up the venvs and the testers and testing. So i went a little deeper to really understand that part and automated it. So now if i start a new project i run a makefile and it sets up the venv, main dependencies, linters, and a basic unit test. So i can start a new project or tutorial without worrying. While i learned a lot about dose parts. Next up ( i’m a devops engineer ) is setup the same thing for a basic CI/CD to eventually get my python code up into docker on my local homelab. These things i spend about 20/25% of my time on, i learn something for my job, i learn more about python and in the meanwhile i make my own life easier.Main get away is, enjoy the process! Have fun!

You’re asking about a data structure, i.e. a specific implementation detail, while the text you’re referencing is explaining an architectural detail.In this case, a stream processing system just means a system that is continuously processing data as it is produced - in other words, the job is never “complete”, the system may just be idle at some point waiting for the next chunk of data to come in. Data is pushed to this system rather than the system pulling data into it.The implementation of this can certainly use a queue, and in reality a system like this will likely use multiple queues and/or stacks along and way.TL;DR a stream and a queue are really just different things, not necessarily a replacement for each other. A stream is some data coming from a source which may or may not have an end, whereas a a queue is just a FIFO mechanism for processing data. Consider an example outside of programming:- A “stream of people“ would describe many people passing through some point at some rate without necessarily defining a start, end, or quantity- A “queue of people” would describe a line for people to wait in a FIFO fashion. There may not even be any people in the queue at some point in time- A stream of people may be entering a building to go wait in a queue, to go wait in one of many queues, or do something else entirely- A long and fast moving queue might be described as a stream",TheRealKidkudi,2025-11-09 20:48:17,25,learnprogramming,t3_1ostgm4,False,

Like when you play tic-tac-toe, you both see the actual board with Xs and Os, and you imagine how the board will look once you place your next mark.That is also how software works, there is some sort of output, if not explicitly graphical or visual, at least observable in some way, and there is an invisible internal representation, that you can't experience, but that the program ""knows"" and uses to decide its next move, or determine who won. And in both games and programs there's input that manipulates the internal model - often with very different results, depending on the previous state of that model.And of course, games have rules - often you follow an actual algorithm when playing a game, or at least you have some fixed pattern of steps to perform, and there is, if not an algorithm, then a fairly strict way of determining a winner or loser, or if the game should continue.And most important of all for learning - there is a lot of repetition in games, both as a player and a developer you are iterating a lot, gradually improving, and always trying various combinations.

Have you seen the problem or a similar one before? How kind were the interviewers for that particular loop? How desperately do they need a role filled?However, I reject that there was ever a problem with testing how someone does under the pressure of being reviewed by another. In practice, that's what professional development is all the time. Pair programming, collaborative problem solving, and explaining your reasoning to people who are both technical and non-technical. If you freeze up during an interviewer because the interviewer is seeing the code you write as you write it, that's not a problem in the interview process. It's working as intended. Could interviewers do a better job of putting their candidates at ease? Absolutely, but we shouldn't write that skill set off as 'not relevant'.It's been a while since I've conducted an interview. But given the recent advancements I'd be inclined to allow my candidates to use coding assistants. A good interviewer was never testing if you solved the problem in the perfect way. They were testing your reasoning and communication skills. And the coding assistant doesn't change that in any way. If you can use the AI in a way that is simply beyond asking it to solve the problem for you, show me that you're capable of reviewing and understanding the code it produces, then communicating that solution to me clearly and engaging in a thoughtful discussion about the solution you'll get a pass in my interview.",RonaldHarding,2025-11-10 19:29:45,3,learnprogramming,t3_1otmr5n,False,

Setting out to build a huge system, which is what you have envisioned, is likely to result in feeling like its too big and burnout. I would encourage you to pick one small component of what you want to build and do that. Skip the fancy UI, make it a command line utility so you don't get bogged down with building a fancy interface. Stay very focussed on it and only it. Don't worry if it feels like you can't visualize it, you can add that later once the core is working. For example, ""signal processing"" is very general. What inputs do you want to process to produce what outputs? Pick one, say the ability to accept stereo audio and determine which side of the space it is on. Not where it is, just which side, ie left or right. Test it, first with unit tests, then using live data. Get it working, very well. Feeding unreliable data to the next step in the processing pipeline will create pain as you have to determine which component is unreliable. Then add multiple sources of input, ie two people having a conversation back and forth. Extend it to identify that there isn't a single source. Get that working. Then extend again to identify which side the sources are on. Get it working. Unit test everything so you don't accidentally break stuff that you had working. I could go on and on and on...but that is how you build a complex system from the ground up.Expect your project to take years working on it full time. What you have laid out is a \*massive\* undertaking. Spend ample time evaluating existing libraries and tools that do the things you want...it's almost always easier and faster to use existing components than to build your own. Beware of the licenses...don't use anything that you don't want to be restricted by in the future. You can always replace components with others or your own if you determine they don't work. That might be reasonable to get you past a hurdle, but can also be a waste of time if you try to use something and it just isn't suited. Rack it up as a learning experience and move on.Break everything down into manageable chunks. Days or maybe a week...longer than that does not provide enough structure or confidence in feasibility. Don't know how to do something in order to know how long it will take? Break it down into chunks that you can research until you know enough to have a good idea of what is involved and how long it will take.Did I mention breaking things down into manageable chunks?

nns2uxn,"Yep, this is one thing I think a looooooot of execs either underestimate or don't even think about when they decide on a layoff.When I was laid off in early 2023, half the engineering department was let go, so from 16 people down to 8. Had a final meeting with my boss the day before my last day, and he told me they were told it was for two reasons:1) Rising interest rates were cutting into the bottom line and they were concerned about runway (they had at least several years at the burn rate at the time).2) They lost their CTO, VP, and Director for the engineering side of things, and the rest of the executive board didn't want to handle a team of 16 engineers directly, so to make things easier they decided cutting the team in half made sense.In the few months after the layoff, half of the remaining engineers left for other opportunities, taking the org down to just 4 engineers. Apparently this led to some panic with the execs, and they finally did what I and others wondered why they didn't just do in the first place: they promoted they very capable and well liked lead engineer to VP, giving them their delegation point.One of the staff engineers who remained (who I worked with at my job before that one) said they were considering seeing if folks who were laid off might be interested in returning, and flat out asked me, ""If we offered to bring you back, would you?"" Told him I'd really have to think about it, but given the reasons for why the layoff happened I would have a hard time being willing to trust the company wouldn't do it again. He understood and that was the end of that conversation. Sucked too because if I would have been able to just slide back into my job there, as it was before, it would have been a $20k pay bump compared to the job I'd started a few weeks before that conversation took place.Layoffs lead to further attrition, and it's usually the most capable folks in the org who have avenues they can explore to leave. My manager, for example, gave notice a week after the layoff to go be the founding engineer of another company a buddy of his had started, and had been bugging him to join.The entire reason I was at that job was the place I worked before laid off 20% of the company in early 2022, and the attrition afterwards was big. I survived that layoff, the first one I ever survived, but it sucked watching folks I absolutely enjoyed working with leave. Many of them ended up at one or two other companies, and I ended up at one of those companies when one of them suggested they reach out for me to expand engineering. Frustrated with the promotion process and not liking the new landscape of things, being able to interview for two hours (system design and leadership rounds to assess level, no coding) for a $25k pay bump was too tempting.There are mental aspects to these things that linger, for everyone regardless of whether they were the ones let go or if they got to stay. I'm not saying layoffs should never happen or are never necessary, but for all the ones I've been through they definitely felt too reactionary and didn't consider the aftershock among those who remained.",ModernTenshi04,2025-11-08 15:38:28,149,cscareerquestions,t3_1orqj3y,False,

Like pull up some messy production data and ask them to write a query to find something specific. Then watch how they think through edge cases, ask clarifying questions, handle nulls and duplicates. For Python, give them a small script you actually use - maybe something that parses logs or transforms data between formats. See if they can extend it or fix a bug you introduce. The best candidates will ask about the business context, not just dive into coding.Also consider splitting the time - 15 minutes on a practical coding exercise, then 15 minutes discussing their approach to debugging, testing, code reviews. Ask about a time their code broke in production and how they handled it. Or show them a piece of your actual codebase and see if they can understand what it does.

This way, if you deliver stuff, perfect move on to the next thing. If you struggle and let them know, you will get the help you needed and everyone will still be happy because they know they can trust you.And second part is learn to be independent and you need to carry some of the burden the team have. Your existence should not be a burden for someone else but rather help them to carry it. Few examples of this could be, actively review pull requests.

no37w9k,"60 hours a week is a solid chunk of time to become good at anything, which equates to about 3120 hours yearly.Now here's the kicker, you either like your job or you don't.If you do, then you need to apply 20 extra hours to working more (if you're salary, if not then up to you),or if you don't like your job then apply that 20 extra hours on another subject. If you choose not to apply that time to your job then you're looking at roughly 1000 hours a year, which is what you need to ""master"" or ""grab the hammer"" I call it. Some guys spend 20 years in C++ optimization and still find new things out today, so they are ""masters"" or ""able to drive nails in one hit"". That's truly how I look at it, can you walk into an environment and within 10 minutes narrow down a root cause. If you can't find something that quick then you haven't spent at least 1000 hours studying.If you choose to apply those skills to your job then you also need to make sure you aren't a slave to it, then people can control you and make your life a living hell. If anyone questions why you're there so late/early, or you login for a lot of time, then you can gently slip in that it's part of your ""professional education"". Literally use those words.If you're Indian or Asian (in those countries) then I would be careful with what you give your boss, they could become abusive. If it's an American employer then feel free to work for free. Why? because you're not working for free, you're making yourself look better (job security) and you're progressing your skillset. The Key:Do not think that your devotion to the company will result in that job security or professional progression. You're using them for education while paying your bills. Companies will chew you up and spit you out so be careful with how you practice things at work. The Middleground:Study outside of your job things that will make you useful then either grab tickets you know you can do, or communicate that you want to try this because you've been working on it alone. Why not just self-study and keep it private? Well a homelab isn't going to teach you how to upgrade pods and update images in a production environment, you can mock something like it, but when your boss is breathing down your neck and crap is running down your leg then you'll be glad you worked in a real env. The Takeaway:Take advantage of having a job and a place where you can see things break live, that's where the money is made, not when everything is running well.If you are truly just a curious individual then forget everything I said and protect 20 hours a week to explore whatever you want. Having a job means you can buy GPUs, electronics, hardware, etc. maybe not the best but something for you to work with.

I've literally had to tell people ""don't tell me the number you think I want to hear"", for example, when I smelled a ""going through the motions"" estimate.On the code quality front, ""letting them failing"" is another way of saying to give people autonomy to potentially shoot their own foot (and then own up to it).

EM does a lot more in the realm of fielding requests for work coming from other teams. Understands our capabilities, commits us to work that is in our ballparkand so our tasks to start are usually very broad in definition, something like ""Add Drawer Login Component"" with really just the design files attached and some bigger acceptance criteriait's on us to break that down to the smaller manageable tasks, and point them as a group. Then they're just added to the queue for the sprint, that's what we've committed to. All unassigned.and so now, anyone can pick up any of those tasks, let's say given an assumption we all have similar skillsets. Maybe a junior picks up a task that is a little more difficult; they can either take on the challenge, or maybe a more mid or senior stops them and says - ""oh hey this might be a little more involved, but you can help me build this part of it"" and create another ticket.So now we're all trusted to get the job done by doing all the discovery and now we have to work a little bit more together, and everyone has an idea of who's taking what. Junior A is prob waiting on bigger design things from Senior B before they can start. The senior would be inclined to prep the junior on what they have to do. or get them to focus on something else while Senior B finishes.You, just kinda make sure that you're aware of the progress, and the more senior engineers are there to identify risks.

nnzzpeh,"Hey, I’ve been through similar experiences and have a few opinions to share.1. You’ll improve code quality on the job. The alternative is to look at more code (open source) but I don’t recommend that unless you’re really passionate about it. Otherwise, it might add more stress. So, just try to criticize and improve your code base at work. Practice articulating what looks good and what looks bad, and why. Experiment with new ideas and you’ll learn faster. There are many signals to look out for in a codebase: does any part of your dev flow slow you down when building new features, are any parts confusing if a new dev were to work on it, do you have to update multiple places in code for a simple feature, etc. If you have few complaints then maybe your structure is solid after all. If you do identify issues, chances are that it’s something someone else ran into and found a solution for, so it’s always worth searching for how others approach things.2. The only way is to study and to practice. There are tons of online resources. One that I’ve used is GreatFrontEnd, but try googling or searching this sub to find some structured learning resources. Also, ChatGPT is a great tool to ask dumb questions and get good feedback. Chat is also a great tool to ask your exact question : “how do I rebuild my fundamentals in a structured way.”3. Similar answer: study and practice, using online resources. I’ll bet you know a lot more than you give yourself credit for, but maybe don’t have the language to articulate ideas. Again, you can treat AI tools as a dev buddy: before developing a feature, create your rough design idea and ask Chat for feedback. (Typically this would be done with colleagues, but if you don’t have other devs as resources, AI is a solid tool imo.)4. I recommend stopping your weed consumption until you feel less anxious about your career. If you can’t cut it out completely, I recommend reserving it for a specific time and in smaller doses, like at night after all responsibilities are done for the day and you’re ready to wind down for bed. This is a nice middle ground because quitting cold turkey can lead to relapse and a negative spiral. Reserving it for night time only is a guilt-free window for you. This way, you’re using weed as a reward rather than a coping mechanism. Just make sure you have a solid and consistent waking schedule. :)5. This is more life advice than just career advice: we’re human beings with finite time in this life. You’ll never have time for everything so a good skill to learn is time management. With this career revamp you’re working on, write out everything that’s on your mind, and then choose the ones of highest importance (it’s subjective and only you can decide that). For each item that you’ve prioritized and deemed important enough to focus on, break it down into smaller chunks. Rinse and repeat until you have less overwhelming and more actionable tasks. And most importantly, do the tasks! If they’re small enough to complete, it helps you psychologically build momentum. If tasks seem daunting it’s usually because they feel more ambiguous and that’s when our minds resort to coping strategies (like smoking weed or scrolling on your phone). In these cases it’s okay to dive in and try things out until it feels less ambiguous, and from there you can continue the process of identifying and breaking things down into a todo list (aka backlog).One last thing, I’d recommend looking into therapy as an additional resource. I know that it can be expensive and might feel useless, but here’s my take on it: it’s not some sort of silver bullet solution to all your problems. If you can consider “cutting down on weed and strengthening my SWE foundation” as a long-term project, then therapy is a great resource to use along the way. It’s similar to what you did here, you posted how you were feeling and some advice and strategies were recommended. But with consistent therapy, each session is like a check-in: here’s what we talked about last time, here’s what I tried, and here’s where I struggled. It’s a continuous, iterative development process, much like how we build good software products!Good luck, you’ve got this!",ConceptOfWuv,2025-11-09 21:22:33,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1oskmf5,False,

Pair programming helped me a ton - you get to ask questions in real time and it actually makes both people more productive. If you ask your manager or even just another dev to pair with you on some tickets, most people would probably be down. And when you're stuck solo, timebox it - give yourself 30 minutes to struggle, then ask.You're 9 months in. That's still early.

no8apmg,"Big tech interviewer here. Although some interview questions lend themselves to specific architectures, we don't necessarily ask you to design systems with anything in particular, you're supposed to put your best foot forward and design a system that makes sense given the requirements.Prep guides love to tell you to list FRs and NFRs and put an api gateway in the middle of the fucking diagram etc etc, but you'd be surprised at how frequently people don't actually know what they're talking about beyond the initial keyword vomit. Getting caught bullshitting is an easy way to get disqualified.I usually ask people to sketch out the system end to end, and then dive deep on some area. Frontend folks sometimes treat the entire backend as a black box, and we focus on frontend things, up to API layer. But not always. There are plenty that can speak backend too, to varying degrees.Often it depends on the specific requirements for the job. Some teams want a strong frontend expert, others want someone who's more full stack. General bar for us is ""we want a software engineer, not a react dev"". Mind you, also, this is for high pay roles. Other companies with lower pay bands often have easier bars, especially for frontend, whose interviewers tend to not be as strong in full stack, end-to-end system design themselves (not throwing shade at anyone, just my observation from having spent a lot of time in this space).",lhorie,2025-11-11 04:23:29,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1otyucm,False,

There were 3-5 engineers most of the time. No dedicated QA, no pipeline or deployment process. We'd take our app to install on the client's infrastructure on a flash drive. And I'd feel silly and hilarious to wear a suit.The place was laid back, very informal. We would always go out to lunch together. Occasionally working until late at night during deadline crunch we would share a beer in the office. I learned and grew a lot. Got promoted a couple of times while there. They would sometimes fail to pay our salaries on time, always on the cusp of failure. But I was having fun and it fit my life as a 24yo. I would absolutely hate that place today.The second job I'm going to mention is my current one. Healthcare industry related. Chill, remote friendly. Very few meetings. I get to work on my tickets at odd hours, so I can be present for my family. But there is some good engineering happening and opportunity to stay sharp. I've worked at other chill places where after a year or two I felt like I'd have to be very creative to write a single bullet point about that job.",alleycatbiker,2025-11-10 17:16:18,15,cscareerquestions,t3_1othxya,False,

His first question was always ""how do we prevent this from happening again?"" Not ""why did you mess up?"" That psychological safety was everything.Here's the thing though - the work itself was an absolute shit show. The technology was this custom mess that practically functioned as its own language. Hard to understand, impossible to debug, nightmare to optimize. The product team was perpetually confused, and we were constantly building the wrong thing.But my team? We were in it together. We kept trying, kept pivoting, and most importantly - we all had each other's backs.I'm at FAANG now and have been for the past 6.5 years, and I'm grateful for it.

If it's a large company, a fast-moving company, or both, it can take closer to a year.Two: We are all our own worst critics. We see all of our deficits and fuckups. Meanwhile, when we see other people's work, it's because they landed something, solved some problem, gave some slick presentation, etc. Don't compare yourselves to others. You will invariably be comparing your messy practice sessions to their greatest hits.Three: When the great jazz guitarist Pat Metheny was asked by an interviewer how he got so good, he responded ""easy, I made sure I was the worst guy in every band I was in."" Talk to the people whose work you admire. Ask them how they think about problems. If you see a slick piece of code or a clever solution, give it the old \`git blame\`, figure out who wrote it, and message them saying it's cool and asking how they came up with it. Pay attention in code reviews. Get a mentor who is more senior in the same org and role as you. Even if you are the worst guy in the band right now, *that's the position where you do the most improving*.I've been where you are now, and it sucks, but it doesn't suck forever.
