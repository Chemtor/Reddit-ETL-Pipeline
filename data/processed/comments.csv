Although for smaller writes the data is stored within the database itself, so it is doing the planning for that. Obviously under the hood duckdb is querying for the metadata and then executing the query. I thought you were saying that when using duckdb you had to attach to the Postgres, then write the metadata query, then use that info to write your main data query. So what I was saying was that you just attach duckdb to the Postgres db and then you can start writing queries in duckdb as if the Postgres db actually contained the data.But yes even that might be too much for less tech savvy users. Plus other db formats that are able to read parquet files could implement the ducklake format more natively so that they are both the repository and the query planner.

I personally am a huge fan of their data lineage tool. Unlike other data platforms creating a pipeline or a DAG can be done in a few mins. They have thought through all these concepts way ahead and in my opinion their platform is way ahead of other solutions. Foundry had this concept of table format way before Iceberg or delta got popular. One take away I have is if your organization needs a data platform that needs traditional data warehousing alot Foundry sucks in that area. This is a great solution for Extraction and Transformation but if your organization depends on datasets mostly for creating charts and dashboards with strict SLAs.

mvy96hh,I am going offer a different perspective one that is centered around permissions. Lets say you put your ETL logic inside your orchestrator for 2 use cases1. Extracting data from an RDS instance2. Extracting data from an external API endpoint You have to give permissions to the orchestrator (most likely ECS task) to access the RDS instance and also secrets such as API key and RDS password. But let us say the ETL logic lives outside (separate ECS tasks) then the orchestrator essentially only needs permissions to kickoff those tasks. The individual tasks get separate permissions to access their specific instances. This is in line with the least privilege principle often recommended for defining permissions.Giving the orchestrator too much permissions is exposing you to a lot of risk. There are some newer approaches like the ETL logic is defined in the orchestrator but the flow/task itself runs in a specific pre-defined compute which seems like a better balance. So if you do want to put it all in the orchestrator make sure you leverage such an approach.,anatomy_of_an_eraser,2025-06-04 13:49:02,9,dataengineering,t3_1l327w2,False,

Another way to potentially manage access changes is with GitHub. GitHub feels a little hacky and more work than either of the two above. Another way is to connect access requests with a jira (or something similar) ticket and the ticket parameters map to specific snowflake roles.

mwhkdlw,"Great question, thanks for asking and giving me a chance to explain a bit more :)Just to clarify up front: Heimdall isn’t trying to replace Airflow (or Dagster). It’s meant to complement those tools, especially in big data environments. We actually use both -- Airflow and Heimdall -- and each plays a different role in our system.In our setup:* Airflow handles scheduling -- the ""when"" something should run (""run this job daily, but only after X completes"").* Heimdall handles orchestration -- the ""what"", ""where"", and ""how"" something runs (""run this Spark job with version X on cluster Y, with these configs"").So why build Heimdall for orchestration instead of just using Airflow for everything?A few reasons:**1. Consistency:** We want a single, unified interface between all tools and data systems (Spark, Trino, Clickhouse, etc.). Heimdall abstracts away infra details -- our users just submit workloads the same way every time (from user's p-o-v, the way they submit SparkSQL and Trino query and get results is exactly the same). We can manage things like version upgrades, logging, error tracking, etc., in one place. Similar to what Netflix’s Genie does -- it creates a clean boundary between clients (humans and systems) and infrastructure.**2. Security:** Engineers can run and test jobs locally -- even against prod data -- without needing shared credentials (we integrate with many systems, zero creds for those on laptops). They just use their own identity, and Heimdall enforces everything (RBAC, logging, etc.) in one place. Airflow submits jobs *through* Heimdall, so we get a centralized entry point to everything.**3. Simplification:** By offloading orchestration to Heimdall, our Airflow operators got *really* simple -- each is maybe 10-20 lines of code, no matter how complex the job is. This helps us avoid the usual “infra logic leaking into pipeline code” problem. Heimdall gives us reusable building blocks that keep our DAGs clean.There are other reasons too, but those are the big ones. Happy to go deeper into any of them if it’s useful.And just to be clear -- we still really like Airflow. :) It’s become much more lightweight for us now that it only handles scheduling. We’re even looking at turning Heimdall-based operators into lightweight sensors, so we can run thousands of DAGs on a small Airflow box.",Pale-Fan2905,2025-06-07 13:36:19,5,dataengineering,t1_mwglt0m,True,

You'd need to do the overlap joins then, but you'd only need to pull in the `starts_at` for each table where there's an overlap.If you have dbt macros, or can use jinja templates to help build the sql for you, or you're using a dataframe library, you should be able to make something adaptable to multiple tables being included.The benefit is you'll still get the full grain of every change across all tables, and you won't have to create dummy entries for periods where nothing changes, and you still get to use equijoins out to the original dims when using the table.

Union the valid_from and valid_to from all of the source scd tables to create a “spine” of every state change timestamp and person ID. The reason you have to stack the valid_froms and valid_tos vertically is to handle gaps in the source scds’ time ranges for cases where dims were deleted. 2. Join each scd table to that spine on person id and where the state change timestamp is within the scd time range, e.g. scd.valid_from <= spine.timestamp < coalesce(scd.valid_to, ‘9999-01-01’). 3. The spine timestamp becomes the new valid_from, and use a lead() window function to add a valid_to. To make it incremental, you’ll need to add a surrogate key built from person id and valid_from in step 3. And use that as the “id” in the incremental config to prevent duplicates. The incremental clause should filter each scd table to only include rows where the scd.valid_from is greater or equal to the max valid_to for each person in {{ this }}.I could dig up an example query if that would help.",chestnutcough,2025-06-07 10:54:26,2,dataengineering,t3_1l4ksvs,False,

First, it sounds like you have good/smart people even if they aren’t familiar with modern platforms and technologies (public cloud, etc.). Someone mentioned “data mesh” and that came to mind to me as well. Specifically, the principles around ”data as a product” and “self-service” as these are largely about organizational empowerment and alignment more so than technology choices.It sounds like the teams need some guidance on how to organize and get work done. I recommend looking into the following.. the teams and company may be doing some of this already but it’s hard to tell from a short narrative. Each of the topics below embody principles of modern data teams.1. Agile2. DataOps (the modern data value chain and how to build data capabilities and the operations around them)3. Data as a product - creating things that matter and generate value for the business. The tech is not the point.If you want to go deeper on organizational design ideas for technology teams, I recommend the book “Team Topologies.” What you read in the book is helpful and insightful but it’s not a blueprint - in my opinion - to simply go and follow. Instead, take what the book teaches, overlay it with your company, teams, and culture, and determine what your own organizational next steps should be.Hope this helps give you some ideas on where to start.",trajik210,2025-06-07 21:41:21,1,dataengineering,t3_1l4zcne,False,

This greatly reduces cost of cloud computing, but still allows you to take advantage of certain cloud native tooling, such as Power BI connection to database without gateway middleware. There are also some advantages on the data security side of things. I would not be surprised to see more companies approach data infrastructure this way in the future, as we see cloud computing cost skyrocketing, and a mass emigration from the cloud.Other than allowing for half the data infrastructure on prem and the other half in the cloud, I can’t see why anyone would implement this approach on a strictly cloud based environment. Generally, OLAP based systems are faster and more efficient at data transformations than OLTP, so you might not be getting any cost advantages. You are also managing yet another pipeline, and likely need another DBT project implemented with incremental models. This approach also reduces visibility and traceability of your pipelines, and complicates CI/CD. There are plenty of reasons NOT to do this.

Sounds like your upload speed may be pretty slow as an organization if you're thinking about compressing before moving to the S3. Questions I would have:- How much time are you actually saving between uploading raw files vs time compressing and then uploading? Are you really saving time between running a compression, uploading then having spark load compressed files?- Are these daily files appended into your target tables or are you doing upserts? - What's the likelihood of needing to reload your tables from scratch? - Is the data easily partitioned outside of the daily extract? Generally, I recommend trying to keep the files as I receive them but there are reasons to do slight modifications. Reason being storage is cheap, compute is not. That first time you have to reload from your raw storage, even after just a couple of weeks of daily storage, you're probably ahead of the game in terms of cost running spark against gzip files. Again assuming you're using some kind of pay as you go system.Personally, for something like this I'd probably split the difference and convert the csv to parquet with snappy compression. That should give you a sizeable storage savings while still giving you performant reads if you need them down the line. Again a lot of this depends on what you have available to you, converting to parquet, depending on the data, will likely be more time consuming than just gziping the data but your reads should improve. Honestly, I'd benchmark all 3 and then evaluate them against what changes you expect in that source system for an extracts and how quick it will happen.",Pillowtalkingcandle,2025-06-07 13:03:11,1,dataengineering,t3_1l5iv1q,False,

(also are you sure you want a row oriented file type over columnar) IMO you should look at sinking Parquet or even ORC as binary formats (especially columnar formats) will leads to better compression and faster query performance (remember that SEEK is literally one of the most expensive operations to perform both in terms of memory but also in runtime)",Surge_attack,2025-06-07 15:26:43,1,dataengineering,t3_1l5iv1q,False,
mwkx0ro,"> it's taking longer than I *feel* it should takeGZip compression isn't inherently ""splittable"" (mentioned already by another), because it doesn't provide a way to 'jump ahead' in the data and know where you are to start decompressing. This means you can't get the decompressed data any faster than a single node decompressing it.If you're doing dynamic schema it also has to do two passes over some portion of the data. So it will read a certain amount to figure the schema, then start back over again once it has the schema it has come up with.> (Option) Add a step to decompress the files before we read themThis is probably pointless, spark is doing this for you on-the-fly. The only reason to do so would be because you are reading the source multiple times. Even then, the extra file size and resulting network transfers will offset some of the gain, and you'd have to pay the 'cost' of fully processing the data at least once just to get to that point. If you did anything like this, you would have spark just take the original CSV data and save it to compressed parquet, so that later stages can work off of that for faster re-runs or recovery from a node failure.---There are some other things you can do, but anything effective will involve having the source do something different, because they're the ones producing the files.Uploading uncompressed will be faster for you to process it, since spark can split the read across all of its executors. If you have a lot of cores in your cluster this could be a significant speedup. The tradeoff is that storage costs will be ~3x higher, and it will take ~3x longer for the provider to upload the data.A potentially easy change for the provider is to upload multiple gzipped files. Since it is a CSV, if they don't have newline characters inside the data (it really should be replaced with an escape sequence), then they can split the file by line count and then gzip each file. You still get the compression, and when running the ingestion job you can give spark a glob (or list) to read multiple files as a single dataframe. That will let you split up the decompression work. Note that this is not about splitting *after* the compression, as that will cut off csv lines in the middle -- you want to split the raw CSV by line count *then* gzip each of those files.Another *possibly* easy change is to swap the compression algorithm to bz2. Iirc this one includes the ability to jump to blocks automatically, so spark can properly split the decompression.The best way might be to see if they can grab the [DuckDB CLI](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/overview.html) -- it is a single standalone executable, so you wouldn't need any special installation scripts or anything, and as a CLI they just need to run a duckdb command instead of gzip. You can send [commands as arguments](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/clients/cli/arguments.html#passing-a-sequence-of-arguments) for the CLI, so you could make a command that will read the original CSV file then write it to parquet (with compression applied by default). The command would look like `duckdb -s ""COPY (SELECT * FROM read_csv('your_input_file.csv')) TO 'your_output_file.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);""`. If you read into the DuckDB docs you can also see how to specify the CSV schema so all the typing can be done correctly at the outset, which is handy for you because parquet will have actual types for its columns, which in addition to being compressed and splittable, will make the ingestion job faster.",azirale,2025-06-08 00:49:23,1,dataengineering,t3_1l5iv1q,False,

mx42w9t,"I've had experience with multiple clients with similar use cases -- specifically dealing with many single tenant use cases (same schemas) and aggregating into a warehouse for analytics.A few questions you have to ask yourself: **What are you optimizing for downstream?** \-If your use case is dashboarding and analytical queries across large datasets, Redshift will scale better than Postgres. It’s columnar, optimized for scan-heavy queries, and handles large joins better. At 2.8TB and growing, Postgres will get painful for historical analysis.\-Syncing data into Redshift with 5-10 min lag is fine using CDC, we have multiple customers doing that at terabyte scale and we are consistently getting <5 min latency even after taking into account the time to run Merges.**Is it important for data to get into the ""warehouse"" quickly and it's ok for analytical queries to be slower?** \-If this is the case, CDC to get data into Postgres will be faster (seconds, instead of <5 mins). But the tradeoff is analytical queries will take much longer to run on Postgres vs Redshift. **As for your questions:** 1. Depending on the use case downstream, you might want to think about fanning in from many single tenant DBs and writing into large multi-tenant table. Separately you could do a 1 to 1 sync and then use dbt to transform and combine the tables. Our CDC pipeline ([Artie](https://www.artie.com/?utm_source=reddit)) can either fan-in in-flight or do 1:1 syncs, so we've done both. 2. Postgres vs S3: very diff roles. When you land in S3 in parquet files, you'll have to write the logic later to Merge delta files and recreate the current table view - that's overhead you need to consider. 3. Redshift will be easier to manage long term IMO. You’ll likely outgrow Postgres for analytics. Redshift can save you a future migration.4. DMS is great to start off, but at certain scale it becomes unreliable. We've observed that it starts causing problems with data consistency and latency when you start doing mid-to-high 100s of millions of rows a month. That's when we see a lot of DMS customers migrate over to Artie (disclaimer: I work there) for a CDC pipeline that they can trust to scale with them. 5.

When you as a programmer include someone else's library, you would be advised to interact with it through defined apis. If you don't and instead use reverse engineering techniques to find and interact with other internal points like internal methods, services, or data tables, the library publisher may change these at any point without notice and you may have unexpected emergency fixes.Note that something being an api is about the stability and change notification promises not about a particular format, spec, or connection method. An api is often a set of service layer or business layer web services using rest/json or soap formatting, but it certainly does not have to be. There are UI layer apis, which are usually js, iframe, or css interaction points. There are apis that are simply methods you call when you add someone else's code to your project. There are plugin apis where you code an extension that implements a published interface and register it using a published json or xml config file. There are data layer apis which are usually sets of tables, views, and stored procs you are to use when extending a product's data model.It's not all about web services and not every web service is an api.",Far_Swordfish5729,2025-06-04 19:45:14,104,learnprogramming,t3_1l3ekbs,False,

There was still a pretty decent learning curve moving from C to C++ but I was already familiar with doing shit with pointers and memory management.That being said, something I love about newer languages is not having to mess around with all that.

mw8ar7t,"C++ gives you an enormous amount of control over memory (manual allocation/deallocation), performance (fine-grained optimization) and system resources (via low-level access).This makes it a go-to for game engines (see Unreal), high-frequency trading systems (super important!), embedded systems, real-time applications, major parts of operating systems and browsers (like Chrome, which uses C++ heavily).But that power comes at a price, as you can easily shoot yourself in the foot.Because C++ does not force best practices, good C++ code often means that you need to know what not to use, to master idioms (e.g., RAII, SFINAE, Rule of 5) and to understand UB (Undefined Behavior), which is more common than you’d like. This fuels the mythology: you’re either a wizard or doomed.Unlike Python or JavaScript, you don’t get guardrails. Crashes, memory leaks, and security bugs are easy to write. Meanwhile, Rust, Go and others provide modern alternatives with safer defaults for many tasks. Python and Java are easier for most high-level work.

mw9621n,"I'll provide a contrasting point of view since most people are trying to convince you there's nothing special about C++. I believe C++ is very problematic for newer programmers because a huge list of reasons. The general dismissive advice is to just program in the ""safe"" areas of C++, but there is no way for a beginner to know where that is.There are basic problems right off the bat for a beginner.1. No real package management system. If you want to use libraries in C++, you'll often need to download someone's .hpp and .cpp file and figure out how to compile that into your program and use it. That directly leads into2. Compilation. No other modern language has a system as complicated as C++, you are going to struggle with your program finding your headers, things are going to compile and not link the right libraries, these words don't even make sense to beginner programmers in other languages. But of course C++ programmers have tried to solve this and that causes problem number3. Build systems, C++ has 3 popular build systems, and they don't necessarily work well with each other. You got make, cmake, autoconf and just regular writing the compiler arguments yourself. These systems are extremely complex, introduce a whole new language to learn, and are often impossible to debug. People will tell you that a newbie doesn't need to know about any of this, well they do if they want to be doing anything substantial using existing code instead of implementing every single thing themselves.So all of that is before you get a program running, so once we've figure out how to compile code, what happens when we write code and try to learn stuff from online?4. C++ is extremely fragmented. C++ has gone through multiple incarnations, from C with Classes to C++11 to more recent versions. The way you write C++ code differs dramatically between pre and post C++11. By default the majority of the code you write based on basic examples will be considered incorrect. For example, you'd think you can generate random numbers using `rand()`. You'd be dead wrong, C++ developers do NOT suggest using `rand()` to generate random numbers, it's not guaranteed to generate a uniform distribution or numbers that are sufficiently random. People will even tell you off if you use iostream, the basic recommended way to handle input/output in every tutorial, because C++ code is supposed to be fast, and iostreams are considered slow. Basically C++ does something wrong in some initial implementation, and has to maintain that for backwards compatibility forever, so they implement a whole new different correct way to do it, but a newbie has no way to tell if they are looking at outdated and bad code or new code.5. Standards vs Compilers. Suppose you are super keen and keep up to date with new language features. You see that C++23 has some cool new feature you want to try in your own code. Well too bad, it probably hasn't been implemented yet. The standards committee are independent from the people that write the compilers. So the committee declares that the new version of the language has this new feature, and it's someone else's job to actually implement that feature into the compiler so it can actually be used in code. This is done bit by bit, so your compiler will support some C++23 features and not others. Hell, some features are in the spec and NEVER get supported. So if you're a keen beginner and see people present cool new features and code patterns you want to try, bad luck, try again in 5 years and pray that compilers have caught up.6. C++ data structures are heavily memory focused. This isn't the memory management that people usually talk about. These are the standard vector and collection types that manage the memory for you like in other languages. Except in almost every case, you interact with these objects via iterators, which dips down a level of abstraction and makes you think about memory anyway. So where in another language you might run `sort(s)`, in C++ you run `std::sort(s.begin(), s.end());`. That seems ok, until you start using references and pointers, and `sort` shifts the values in memory and you end up not pointing to what you thought you were pointing to. That's just a rookie mistake, but most algorithms do things in-place in memory and it's an easy mistake to make. On top of that you get pointer invalidation, where sometimes the automatic memory management just takes your data somewhere else and all your previously declared pointers are now pointing at nothing. The simplest way to accidentally do this is when you are using `push_back()`, when the allocated vector fills up it'll relocate somewhere else.I could go on. But the overall point is that1. Compilation and library management in C++ introduces significant complications to beginners that simply do not exist in other highly used languages.2. C++ has many conflicting ways of doing something, and there does not exist a single agreed upon set of teaching material for beginners to learn best practices.3. C++ has MANY hidden pitfalls that will cause beginners to write broken programs. Almost by default any code you write intuitively will be considered wrong in some way. The simple `for (int i = 0; i++; i < s.size()) { s[i]; }` should be written as `for (const auto& v : s) { v; }`, note the additional syntax and operators that might be unclear to beginners. Also you were meant to use `size_t` instead of `int` for the first loop, but that's almost never presented in basic teaching material.C++ has more complicated language constructs than other languages, worse developer support, has no single high-quality resource for learning, and online resources are litered with bad practice that beginners have no ability to distinguish.",TonySu,2025-06-06 03:14:19,4,learnprogramming,t3_1l4d5gi,False,
mw9seo1,">I understand that you need a ton of understanding and experience to write performant C++ code. And that even decent Python code will outperform bad/mediocre C++ code.Wait, what? This isn't even true. The only situation where this might be a thing is where you're copying around data needlessly, but using references in C++(just like Python does by default) is an idiomatic language feature. Barring those cases, C++ code can be like 100 times faster than Python, unless you use Numpy arrays or something(which is written in C, so hardly counts as Python code).>I also understand that there's a huge responsibility in managing memory safely. Yeah, except if you use smart pointers, C++ even has automatic memory management. People who say memory management in it is this super hard and difficult thing probably never heard about C++11. The language's complexity is greatly overblown, of course, but there is some merit to it. For example, template metaprogramming is functional programming, while your normal code tends to be object-oriented / imperative, so you need to learn two programming paradigms to properly program, which indeed is a lot. But most of people's problems with the language aren't really a problem if they use the right solution.

C++ is also unmanaged, not running in basically a VM like C# and Java, so it's a little more efficient in that regard. Also, you're relatively unrestricted in what you can do with C++, so if you know what you're doing, C++ is a very powerful language.Since the C++11 standard, C++ has gained a lot of more modern features too.

No way is programming dead, trust me. The idea that AI will wipe out coders is a myth. Tools like GitHub Copilot are like having a brainy assistant—they make you faster, not replace you. Coders who skip AI might lag since it cuts problem-solving from weeks to hours. You’ll learn quicker, debug faster, and tackle big stuff, but AI needs your creativity to work. Coding’s been around forever (before you were born!) and isn’t going anywhere—it just evolves. Use AI to level up, and you’re golden. It’s totally worth jumping into in 2025. The industry needs solid coders who solve real problems. Stay curious, keep learning, and you’ll stand out, no matter how many others code.Learning paths depend on you. Self-taught is awesome but tough—you need discipline to avoid scams or getting lost. A mentor, even paid, can save you tons of time by guiding you right. Tons of top devs are self-taught, so it’s doable with grit. Bootcamps are great for fast, practical skills—3-6 months and you’re job-ready if you pick one with mentorship and job help. Check Course Report for legit ones to dodge duds. A CS degree gives deep theory for stuff like AI or systems coding and looks great to employers, but it’s pricey and takes years. You don’t always need it for jobs like web dev But remember that if you don't learn the deep theoretical stuff like systems design, algorithms, data structures, computer architectures and operating systems, and only the final technology like web development, you will reach a stage where you will not develop, and you will not move up the career ladder until you have comprehensive knowledge and experience in all aspects, not just simple technological skills like html, css, etc. Whatever path, you’ll need to self-learn, so try Coursera’s “Learn How to Learn” to master studying. Tech’s got endless free resources—use them! I’d start self-taught to test the waters, then maybe a bootcamp or degree if you’re hooked. Just know bootcamps focus on jobs and might skimp on theory like algorithms, which you’ll need.Please do not be tempted by crash courses, all of them aim to teach you how to use the programming language only or just a basic understanding, and do not teach you deep programming concepts, the least professional course may take more than 50 hours of learning, and time is not a condition on the professionalism of the course, but for example, you will not find an in-depth algorithms course of 10 hours ...First, see if coding’s your thing with Harvard’s CS50 on edX—it’s free and a fun intro to programming with bits of C, Python, and JavaScript. It’s not a full course but a taste of what coding’s about. You’ll know if it clicks and get a sense of next steps. After CS50, don’t jump straight to a track like web dev—focus on building core programming skills, like algorithms, data structures and solve a lot of problems on websites like hackerrank,leetcode,codeforces, and so on... . These are the foundation of coding and crucial for any field. You can learn them while exploring a track (like web or AI) or before picking one—it’s up to you. Python’s a great first language—easy, versatile for web, AI, or data, and super in-demand. But it’s not about the language; it’s about getting loops, functions, and logic, which apply everywhere. Think of coding like swinging a hammer: easy to learn, hard to master. Start with computational thinking to grasp how computers work before diving into languages. To gain a solid foundation in your level, I suggest reading books that will develop your way of thinking. It can be read while you are studying CS50. There is a great book called Computational Thinking: A Beginner's Guide to Problem Solving and Programming by Karl Beecher. I really like it and still read it from time to time, even though I am experienced but it's really a great book.Expect bumps—coding’s all about solving problems. Don’t quit when you’re stuck; take a break, hit Google or Stack Overflow, or use AI to explain (but don’t let it solve coding challenges—that’s cheating and you learn nothing). Everyone learns differently—some pay for courses to stay motivated, others grind free stuff. Stay consistent, even 2 hours a day. You’ve got this! Finish CS50, then focus on algorithms, data structures, databases , operating systems, programming with C++ and OOP, and any programming fundamentals that didn't covered in CS50(because 8 weeks not enough to know what you should learn ) (try free resources like FreeCodeCamp or books like “grokking algorithms”).

mx0yvcs,"I have thought about this a lot lately. I disagree with you when it comes to students. They absolutely SHOULD NOT use A.I. A.I. destroys your ability to think. It may not happen immediately, but it does. I've read countless stories from developers that lose their ability to not only think critically, but can't even remember basic syntax over time. This isn't just happening to programmers. This is happening to other fields as well. The brain is a muscle and if you don't use it, you can't develop it. Now, I'm not saying that its not a valuable tool. It definitely is, but if you are a student or still in the process of learning, A.I. takes away the process of learning that develops your critical thinking skills and the repetition that you need to learn syntax when you are learning. This is also why you take so many math classes. Are you going to use Trigonometry or Calculus out in the real world? Probably not, but that's not the point. The point is that the process of doing it helps develop your critical thinking and analytical skills. The same goes for programmingI'm speaking from experience on this. I'm a 3rd year CS student. My first year I made the mistake in using A.I. in my Computer Science 1 class. Its essentially the 1st class you take that teaches C++ and programming fundamentals like OOP, abstraction, and recursion. Halfway through the class, once we started working on anything remotely more difficult than defining a function, I used A.I. I didn't realize how much I didn't learn anything until I got to Computer Science 2 the following summer. I couldn't write anything beyond basic console apps. I turned off all A.I. including Intellisense, and went through my Computer Science 1 book and did all the projects from that class again. I actually retained the information that time.I have seen so many posts about people who are on the last year of their CS degree, or even graduated, and they don't know how to code. I don't know how this is even possible if you aren't just copying code for projects. This summer I'm in Data Structures and Algorithm Design. Last weeks project was to write algorithms for linear sort, merge sort, quick sort, and selection sort, and print to console the running time along with their Big O Notation to prove their runtime complexity.

Use it to figure out the problem rather than solve it. This is sooo hopeful.But on the negative, I had to stop half way through school and turn all my auto complete off, I had to take the productivity features away, because I wasn’t learning the proper syntax and way about setting things up. When it came time to do tests and I wasn’t allowed to use these, I was helpless. That got me to thinking, for coding interviews, the same was going to happen. So I did, I stripped away the AI portions of what I was working on, and things got slower, but then they got quicker, and I started making better decisions.It’s a double edged sword!

How long does a randomly generated alpha-numeric GUID has to be in order to ensure it's collision-proof? It sounds like you're thinking about this the same way I did when I first looked into the subject. ""So, I'm supposed to generate a big-ass random number while jillions of other devs are simultaneously generating big-ass random numbers and just hope that none of us bump into each other? What's the logic here besides 'Trust me, bro'?"" The secret, at least for [Version 1 GUIDs](https://guid.one/guid/make), is that it's actually not entirely random, and that's a good thing. The idea behind a GUID is that it should be unique in time and space. With that in mind, it's pretty easy to deliberately avoid collisions by incorporating spacial (physical or logical space) and temporal components in combination with randomness. Identifying the exact latitude and longitude of the device generating the GUID is often infeasible, so a common practice is to use the machine's MAC address, or a hashed namespace (e.g., company/app URL). Basically, you're saying that this particular GUID was generated by *this* computer at *this* time, down to millisecond precision (or at least, as accurate as the onboard clock can be). That's probably good enough for most uses, but to kick it up a notch, we also generate a pretty good-sized random number, *and* check it against ones we've already made, and increment it if, by some miracle, we managed to come up with two of the same random number in the same thousandth of a second. The thing to take comfort in is that you don't actually need to be unique in all of time and space in the universe. You don't even need to be unique in the history of computing on Earth (although you almost certainly will be). You *probably* don't even need to be unique within your organization. What you care about most of the time is being unique within your application, or, really, within the primary key column of one single table. With that in mind, you can be confident that the pretty good-sized random number generated by Mike's computer at 3:14:15.926 PM on June 10th, 2025, to be used strictly for identifying records in sale_item table in SysCorp's home grown CRM, isn't going to conflict with any other GUIDs in that table.

mwrxnah,"A lot of concepts will carry over, but some language features are a bit ""unique"" to each language. As a simple example, in C and C++, there is a preprocessor step, and there is nothing like that in Python. It is not a ""huge"" concept in and of itself, but it does take some getting used to, and to learn how it can be used effectively, and when to use and not use it, for example.Another peculiarity of C++ is that when doing OOP, member functions are not virtual by default. You must ""opt in"" to make a function virtual. In almost all other languages (including Python), methods (that is, functions placed onto a class) are always virtual. And because they are always virtual, you might not even yet know what the difference is between a function being ""virtual"" or ""non-virtual"", for example. But you will learn this when you learn C++.C++ also has function overloading, which Python does not have.C++ has templates (generic functions), which Python does not have.Python also has some stuff that C++ does not have, or which is hard to do in C++. For example, ""generators"" in Python are pretty useful. Maybe you can do something similar in C++ but it will not be so convenient. Python and most dynamic languages have an ""eval"" facility which lets you evaluate code ""on the fly"" but this kind of thing does not exist in C++. Again, it can be done but you will have to implement it yourself (e.g. by calling out to a compiler to compile code, or else embedding your own small compiler along with your executable).",chaotic_thought,2025-06-09 04:09:54,3,learnprogramming,t3_1l6uevt,False,

Moreover, if you try to switch from a high-level (abstraction-oriented) language such as Python to a low-level (system-oriented) language such as Rust or C++, you will have to learn a lot of additional theoretical material such as memory management and data mutation safety rules.

Software development is not immune to economic downswings unless you luck out (there are some jobs out there that are more ""essential"", but not most), and we're in one right now. The current job market, plus all the AI advancements in the news, has everyone worrying about AI, but it's a scapegoat to larger issues over-hiring from Covid, interest rates, and tax laws (Section 174 being a big one).And in regards to AI, if software development gets to a point where a non-technical person can use AI like a ""cheap high-quality on-demand agency"", nearly every job is getting replaced. Put ""will doctors"" into Google search, the first result is likely ""will doctors be replaced by AI"".Being concerned about AI ***right now*** is pretty ridiculous. I've not seen any major instances of ""AI replacing developers"". There have been some decent showcases of AI reducing workloads (AirBnB did some interesting work in regards to testing migration), but even those are pretty limited. In general, it helped cut out some of the mundanity with repetitive boilerplate code, and helped people who have never written code to get things started, but that's about it.Being concerned about AI in 20 years is perfectly reasonable though. We've seen major advancements over just the last two years, but we still are not completely sure if there's a ""ceiling"" that might cap what AI can do, or if those advancements will continue to accelerate.Overall, if you're passionate about something, especially at such a young age, it's worth investing some time into that passion.

That role is absolutely critical, since AI can't take over management, and someone needs to be responsible for ensuring the technology get built and solves the problem you think it does.So how has AI changed out life? I write code faster (for some things), I get better search results, and I can have in-depth conversations about parts of my life I wouldn't otherwise talk about, with an agent that is willing to walk through very specific scenarios for hours and hours.As for other people, my job is to basically use LLMs to save costs.

This kicked my ass thoroughly, but I managed to join a closed source project for an old MMO game emulator. There was another one that was the competitor around 2003 that was open source. We had decided to merge but they made an interesting choice during the merger. This strange language called C#. This was a very early version of it. But I couldn't believe how cool and approachable it made things. I personally loved it. Others hated it and said nothing serious could ever be built with it. But me being new to this, I loved the idea of removing so much complexity behind things like memory management, it was like magic. You could get so much done by doing less. This decision fractured the team. The C++ diehards refused to work with it and eventually left to continue the C++ version, I stayed on the C# version. Fast forward some years, the C# version was pumping out more and more features while the C++ version couldn't keep up. Eventually the C++ version of this project died out, but the C# project is still alive today (sort of, it's gone stagnant since about 2018 or so). But it's incredible to see how far C# has come over the years. It's what I use in my current job (the little bit of coding an architect does anyway). I think it's important to know how languages like C/C++ work as they provide a better understanding of what's going on under the hood.

mw38jzi,"Hey, first off - it's awesome that you're already this deep into programming at 18. The fact that you can zone in for 9 hours straight? That’s a real sign you’ve found something you’re genuinely passionate about. A lot of great devs started the same way - just getting lost in code.Since you're learning C#, that’s a strong start. It’s used in tons of real-world applications - especially in enterprise software, game dev with Unity, and even backend web stuff (with .NET). So don’t think it’s a “just-for-school"" language - it’s got legs in the industry.If you're eyeing cybersecurity and want to branch out smartly, here's a quick breakdown of useful languages based on where you might go:For Cybersecurity:Python – absolute must. It's everywhere in cybersec (automation, scripting, tooling, etc.), super beginner-friendly, and has a massive library ecosystem.Bash/Shell Scripting – essential if you're going to be dealing with Linux servers or writing security automation scripts.C/C++ – if you ever want to understand exploits, memory management, or reverse engineering.For General Dev / Building Stuff:JavaScript + HTML/CSS – if you ever want to touch frontend or build tools with a GUI.Go – gaining traction in cloud & network tooling, really nice for fast and secure backend systems.Since you're enjoying it already, I'd say:Stick with C# and get comfy building small projects.Start Python next - you’ll love how fast you can get stuff working.Maybe check out TryHackMe or Hack The Box once you’re comfortable with the basics - great intro to hands-on cybersec.Also, shameless plug, but I’ve been using this app called BootSelf lately. It gives you an AI mentor that helps explain code and quiz you with flashcards. Pretty helpful if you're learning solo and want to stay on track. There's a free version if you're curious.You’re on a great path - you don’t need to have it all figured out right now.

My first advice is to go in knowing your audience and what they expect and to tailor your level of detail to that audience. If the audience is non-technical or time is short, it's best to just give a recommendation or answer and let them ask questions. Maybe list the possible choices with a few pros and cons first. If it's an hour long review of said recommendation with a client technical team, be ready to go through the twenty considerations that led to that recommendation as they want you to be thorough. Teaching really does help. After you've explained polymorphism to freshman a few dozen times with a worked example, you can do it with an interviewer who already knows it pretty easily.My other suggestion is that you want to keep a conversation going but at the same time it's fine to pause and frame your answer. There's a video of Tim Cook taking a question at a shareholder meeting where he literally sits at a conference table for almost a minute thinking before giving a twenty second answer. It was complicated and he wanted to check all the angles in his head and decide how to phrase his answer succinctly.It's fine to use a whiteboard or paper if needed as long as you're not being rude. I get interview questions about how I'd design something complex and I'll do that with the interviewer. We'll basically sketch the landscape and they'll add things and ask questions as we go around.I will also stress that BSing technical interviewers usually doesn't work. You may be able to lie to them, but your answer will still be technically wrong and they'll just think you're confidently mistaken. I like people who say they don't know and tell me how they'd find out as long as the question wasn't too foundational. I say a lot of things like ""I've never used that product, but I assume it has X/works like X/can integrate using X/runs on X, right? If so, I'd find the docs and plan to implement it using \[high level approach that works with the underlying tech\].""

Replace X with Python, Java, Springboot, Javascript, React; whatever you think may be relevant based on the job description.

If not, you can work something else. Maybe strengthen your unity skills, one good indie game can make you hell lot of money. You can try freelancing and other things.Also, as you said that your are finding new things everytime you learn something, don't get overwhelmed. I've been a unity game dev for 7 years and everytime I open Unity documentation almost always I find something new. Coding is such a thing that would not fully end even if you die.

mwazsv0,"I’m a senior developer with around 15 years of professional experience. I too learned OOP and the MVC pattern (which was touted as the prime example of SOLID) at my university. Well, those patterns never really resonated with me and using Java helped solidify to me that OOP cannot be the simplest way to organize things in a maintainable way.In my career I’ve seen a lot of patterns, and the one that really clicked for me was pure functional programming. Working with a language that doesn’t have mutable objects, null values, or even a semblance of classes was such a revelation: nearly all the problems the golden rules try to mitigate come from mutability and complex hierarchical state. Pure functions always return the same result, given the same arguments, which makes testing them incredibly easy and fun. And if the language has nothing but pure functions, then all applications built with it are incredibly easy and fun to test.My point is, it’s okay if some aspects of programming don’t click. Maybe they will later on, when you’ve seen how following it avoided issues or cutting corners lead to issues. Maybe you’ll come across another way of looking at things (like FP for me) that finally makes sense and helps put everything else in a new perspective.Just build things you want to build, that’s the only way programming is going to start making sense. Try following the rules and try breaking them. Come up with your own solutions and once done, analyze if what you did actually followed a common pattern, just in a roundabout way.

Dependency injection means some external body knows all about the internals of an object and injects other objects into that object as needed.Now the OOD model still works if you think IoC as some kind of God object that has control of the construction of every object in the system.

The exam is unknown so you'll need to use your best judgement and logic to put together a solution. Problem solving logic takes practice of similar questions to really perfect, but once you do it becomes a universal skill.1. As an exercise that combines these topics, I recommend making a small hangman program. Try reading the word from a .txt file, handling the guessing part in the console, and outputting your final answer + the amount of guesses it took to a new .txt file. This will cover comparing matching values between an answer/guess array.2. To cover some basic math and parsing, you could also try reading a string of numbers e.g. ""15326"" from a .txt file, then calculating the average and median (requires sorting), and outputting that to a .txt file.Good luck on the exam!",CafeCoffea,2025-06-11 00:56:23,1,learnprogramming,t3_1l8dzrb,False,

I can't speak to how it compares to other codebases but for someone who has only worked on small projects for classes, it's pretty daunting. Plus, while I have basic familiarity with Java, I don't know C# at all.I looked at a bunch of other mods for the game and decompiled the source code to get some starting points, but it wasn't long before I ran into roadblocks that no amount of Googling would have ever resolved. Normally, I'd probably have just given up. Being able to make tangible progress has been hugely helpful in keeping motivation up and frustration down, and I feel like I've learned a ton about C#, Unity games and even certain OOP concepts I wasn't super familiar with.Being able to say, ""Okay, here's how this other mod did Y, can you give me some ideas on how to implement similar idea X?""

So I would say, ""No I'm pretty sure you're wrong. I can see a bunch of methods in this source file that may be applicable to our situation, maybe we can find an alternate path?"" And then we found a better solution together. The AI didn't solve the problem for me, it just saved me the frustration of having to parse thousands of lines of unfamiliar code in the hope that I was on the right track.It definitely leads me astray sometimes, it hallucinates methods pretty regularly but *conceptually* it's implementation plans are usually pointed in the right direction.

What “date” should I be using and why?Learning how to define the success factors and set realistic goals is vital in coding.

I don’t need to fully code them now but I need to make sure I have everything tight for when things get complicated later.

You won’t be able to feed full applications into an AI to read them out to you when you’re on a team. I also put a lot of work in before I started college and got advanced entry into Y2. At Christmas I was miles ahead of most in the class and took the foot of the gas looking at other languages instead. Come April I realised I’d slipped too much and had work my balls off to catch up. Yes I had a basic understanding of what we did but I couldn’t use it effectively. The best example was SQL. I could read SQL, I knew where the query was going how things joined but I struggled trying to fix it together myself. I used AI while making my database connections and had to constantly look back to do them from scratch myself. Eventually I just stopped using the AI designed methods as this is something I need to be able to do. We had interviews presenting our final projects at the end of the year and they asked “You have well designed methods for database queries in the first 4-5 frames but you don’t use them later in the project. Why?” I explained that while I would be using those methods from the helper files in real world conditions, I wasn’t happy with my understanding of them. I couldn’t do them from memory and kept making errors, so I decided to drill them in by typing them out each time. They loved that answer. It showed I was able to use helper files and methods to keep code clear and concise making the project easy to read, but I also knew how to make and adjust the process to perform custom tasks. They asked me to isolate certain conditions and how I would pick out individual combinations and I was able to do it on the spot because I knew the system and understood how it worked. Some of the others struggled with that as AI had done all the thinking for them. When it came to exams I flew through the test because I A) understood how I would do it. B) was able to identify what they were looking for and how to trace back to it. And C) I made the mistakes and worked my way through them so when they happened there I knew what I was looking at. TLDR:Don’t use AI to design everything. Yes it’ll spit out loads of lovely code that works for this window of the project but it won’t improve your skills or work when you only have this small section on larger projects.

mx1gprf,"> SQlite cant process 2 requests at the same timeThat information is somewhat outdated. What sqlite cannot do, is process multiple *WRITING* requests at the same time, as this requires exclusive access (either locking of the WAL (Write Ahead Log) or a pending db lock). sqlite does support multiple concurrent *READING* requests### WAL ModeSince WAL was introduced, if it is activated (by default sqlite uses the older rollback-journal), readers and writers do not block each other any more, and reading doesn't block other readers.So sqlite, with WAL enabled, supports multiple readers at the same time, and supports reading and writing at the same time. The only thing it doesn't support, is multiple writers at the same time, those are forced into sequential access, because they need to lock the WAL.https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html### Rollback JournalIn this mode, which is the default unless the journal pragma is set otherwise, sqlite still supports multiple readers and only one writer, but; other than with WAL, readers in this mode block writers, and vice versa.What this means (since sqlite version 3): If someone writes to the database, the DB goes into a `PENDING LOCK` mode...allowing current reads to finish, but disallowing further reads from the DB. As soon as the last read finishes, the database goes into `LOCKED` mode, the writing access does its thing, and then the lock clears.This means, with the older journal mode, if a lot of writes happen on a DB, read performance suffers.https://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html#rollback",Big_Combination9890,2025-06-10 16:19:22,3,learnprogramming,t3_1l82ohn,False,

mx1k6ne,"## Concurrency considerationsMore specific to the concurrency issue: sqlite does indeed support concurrency within an application (aka. accessing the database from multiple threads), since the necessary serialization (db locks, journaling), is being taken care of by sqlite itself.This depends on whether sqlite was compiled with the `SQLITE_THREADSAFE` option or not. I haven't seen any sqlite distribution that wasn't for a loooong time.Good code should check however, wether the sqlite compilate used supports this, and if it does, which thread safety mode it uses. The catch here is that there are 2 different modes:`SQLITE_THREADSAFE = 1` means multi-threading is supported, but auto-serialized. This is slower, but safer.`SQLITE_THREADSAFE = 2` means true multi-threading is supported, but there is no auto serialization. If this is the case, and in many sqlite distros this is the default now, *threads cannot safely use the same connection concurretly*. In this case, a connection-pool is usually the way to go if you have multiple threads accessing the DB.https://sqlite.org/compile.html#threadsafe",Big_Combination9890,2025-06-10 16:35:47,2,learnprogramming,t1_mx1gprf,False,

(In SQLite, a ""connnection"" does not actually correspond to a network connection like in many other databases, but the terminology is the same.)Transactions are associated with particular connections, so you don't want to share a single connection between different user requests. Otherwise, one user would be able to see partial incomplete updates from another user's in-progress transaction.And locking happens at the granularity of connections, regardless of whether those connections are used in different processes, or different threads of the same process (as long as `SQLITE_THREADSAFE` is used, as you said).

Unless 2 people are working on similar things, or the exact thing, programming ""together"" kinda just sounds like being in the same room and typing....Im not saying that you shouldnt find your tribe of course, just that it may look different than you expect, but not in a bad way. Meetups can be fun, and theyre full of like minded people who desperately want to talk about what they're building over drinks or whatever, all without any computers or actual code. I drank the Vim kool-aid after meeting up with a bunch of programmers at an event held at a brewery where an Emacs vs Vim debate broke out, cause i heard a bunch of cool stuff and went home to try it lol. But, if Im programming ""with"" people in a room stuff like that doesnt come up as much and it always seems to devolve into the ""best"" coder of the bunch being -unintentionally- assigned the role of ""bug fixing tutor"". Every group is different so maybe you find what youre looking for, but in my humble opinion (which is not law, do whatever lol) I would look for events where programmers meet up near you and do stuff like rock climbing or bar hopping instead of meeting up to program. Trust me, programmers are super annoying and they will talk about programming while you're bowling or whatever.... after you've found some homies, THEN go make a discord where you all can program and chat together. Doing a meet up also means you will be interacting with programmers who have at least a single additional interest other than programming... Bless those savants who live and breathe code of course, those geniuses are above us all and doing stuff that is always more advanced than my dumbass could do...... but..... people whose only interest is programming can be a little difficult to mesh well with for a lot of personalities lol If everyone in this sub all joined a discord to hang out, how many of us do you think would stick around long term given that right now the only thing we have in common is programming?

(ammortization is the same in the long term- but getting the full break that year is the difference between 20% cost reduction and 4%. If not for the previous years of instant ""refunds"", they'd have stacked 4 years of ammortizations and have the same effect right now.)**The loss of the tax advantage for R&D and the hike in interest rates would have suppressed wages, but not diminished the demand for employees.** What we're seeing is collusion between major tech employers to time their layoffs with the DOGE cuts to create a glut of desperate, highly senior, non-pay motivated talent in the market. The longer they can perpetuate it, the more desperate those people will get, and it creates a hermit crab conga line of companies firing their less senior staff hired when times were good to bring in more senior staff who've finally gotten desperate enough to accept lower pay.There is an argument to be made that because other companies are laying off tech staff and the abundance of tech graduates is creating an environment where wages are so severely depressed that it becomes in the interest of companies to also layoff their staff to rehire cheaper replacements *without direct collusion*, but **when that sort of behavior occurs in the banking sector or stock market, there are regulations in place to prevent the situation from becoming a feedback loop that tanks the institutions.** **This cycle of mass layoffs will repeat every time companies think they can get lower wages, more experience or both from a new hire over their current staff until the US gets serious about passing labor protection laws.**",Kalekuda,2025-06-07 14:24:51,79,cscareerquestions,t3_1l5kbzs,False,

mw5zduj,"* There's extreme pay disparity of SWE just in the US. Compare us to other countries, and the differences get even greater. Pay is not solely based on merit. A rockstar SWE living in bumfuck nowhere Montana might be making a very ""normal"" salary at a normal company, and a dumbass SWE living in the Bay Area might've weaseled their way into a top-paying SV startup. And we *certainly* don't make ""2x or 3x"" what ***most*** other white collar fields make. Maybe if by ""most"" you include working in fast food, but definitely not white collar.* For one, this isn't an inherent trait of a SWE career. It *never* has been. There are lots of fully onsite companies, even top tech companies. But it's also not unique to SWE. It's a trait *of a company*, not of a role. At every hybrid/remote company I've worked at, ***everyone*** is hybrid/remote and is afforded that same amount of flexibility. Marketing, sales, legal, IT, etc.* It's genuinely interesting to you and me! But to a lot of people out there what you just described is more boring than watching paint dry. Different strokes for different folks.* Variety also exists in many other careers... You know those prestigious companies you're talking about? And the exciting startups you're talking about? Guess what they both also hire? Non-SWE's.* Now you're just saying ""White Collar careers are the best careers by far"". This has nothing to do with SWE.* If you work for a large, well-known company it's just as likely (I'd argue significantly *more* likely) that you'll be working on some boring internal tool that has 20 internal users. Scale is also not inherent of this career. ""I work for Google"", ""Cool, what do you do there?"", ""Oh.. uhh... I manage a dashboard that lets a small team of internal users track internal budgets between departments"".It's a great career, don't get me wrong. But all of what you're describing isn't inherent of a SWE career, nor is it unique to a SWE career. There are billions of people. When you use words like ""best"", you're forgetting that the overwhelming majority of humans out there don't care at all about the things you care about.*Your* ""best"" career is someone else's living nightmare. Someone else's ""best"" career that makes them love waking up in the morning (someone who *enjoys* a manual labor job and like working outside, in extreme conditions for example), might be ***your*** living nightmare.If you enjoy SWE, pursue it.

mvx6tt8,They do and they are. Wages haven’t kept up with inflation in many industries in the US since the 1970s. Every year people are being paid less. It’s a slow process because if they don’t pay good employees enough they jump ship to a competing company which is why today in a lot of white collar roles in the US it’s common to work 24 months at a company then switch. Larger companies like FAANG have attempted to address this through vesting. You don’t get fully paid unless you’re there for 4 years. On year 4 you’re getting paid for your first year of work. Leaving is like losing 4 years of half of your pay. In Europe wages are lower in part because people are far less likely to jump ship due to pay so they can just low ball everyone from the get go.

In practice, it means that the law says an employer has to post a job ad for a role that had already been filled and ramped up a year+ earlier.The undertone of these kinds of exposes seem to be that some cohorts are more ""deserving of the opportunity conferred by the law"", but arguably the immigration lawyers involved are actually going by the spirit of the law (even if it may technically be malicious compliance) when they ask the H-1B worker to provide job descriptions with excruciatingly high level of detail to construct these job posts. It is already hard enough to get candidates to match nice-to-haves in a regular job post, so who else can check every checkmark in a huge and highly specific list other than the person that is already doing the function, and with zero ramp up time, to boot?

mwclx25,"Few things to unpack:First is understanding why there's a sense of urgency, and whether it is warranted. If something isn't literally on fire, you probably don't need to drop everything else to do it today. Normally you agree on milestones and delivery deadlines upfront, or at least in advance.Second is deconstructing delivery timelines based on whether it's due to technical complexity or due to scheduling. The former presumably means you've done some due diligence before estimating, and you should be able to articulate what the time consuming parts are with some degree of granularity, and their respective estimates. The latter is about what prior commitments you already have, and you have to decide how negotiable it is to make changes. Maybe you can deliver things faster by dropping/negotiating other things that have lower priorities or charging premium to work overtime or hiring a subcontractor, maybe not. If you can't, then be transparent about having other commitments. In other words, urgency is a feature, and you can charge money for it.If it's a question of perception, you could try to explain via analogies, e.g. in law movies everything happens very quickly, often within the same day, whereas in reality, they drag on for months/years because in the real world things just take time.

So your response to these questions should be a date you'll have that feature complete. Once you give a deadline, you'll get many fewer of these questions and if you do, just refer them to the aforementioned date.The other part of this is just that non-technical people just don't know how hard things are. They've been taught, through drag-and-drop website builders and, sadly, AI-marketing, that things are easy. A new form should take an hour to add, right?? It can also be helpful to explain, as part of the communication providing them with the estimated timeline, what goes into the feature you're building. If they ask for a button to send a report to their email, for example, you can explain that part of your work means preventing security issues, handling permissions, formatting the report, testing it, making sure the email doesn't go to spam, etc etc.As for the full-time job part, if they knew you had a full time job when they contracted with you, you can remind them of that, but I honestly think that's unnecessary to include.

There are ways to stay, but for a lot of those people they need a legitimate job that pays legitimate money, and if they can't get that, then they end up having to leave because of not only immigration status but also finances.>Also, could this hiring freeze combined with the layoffs be intentional to make the foreigners leave the country without overstaying illegally on an expired visa? Basically slowing down hiring for 90 days until the foreigners on visa have to self deport?Hiring freezes and layoffs are company-driven decisions. Those companies have no incentive to drive foreign workers out of the country - that would just make the cost of labor for them go up. Most companies want foreign workers to be available.So this makes no sense. Companies are doing layoffs because layoffs = higher profits, and that has always been true.>If people on those visas do an unpaid internship, for example, can they stay in the country until they find a real paying job, even if it takes more than 90 days to find the job since they're not unemployed technically while doing an unpaid internship?Yes. As long as it's a valid unpaid internship - i.e., an internship that is consistent with their field of study/profession. Like, on OPT you can't go get an unpaid job as a janitor and have it count. But you can, for example, work as an unpaid researcher for your former grad program (I've seen this done several times).Again, the problem with that strategy is that you need to then have the finances to float you until you do find a job, which isn't something everyone can do.

That's a win, regardless of the stack you're using.Also, especially this early in your career, companies won't necessarily require an exact 1-1 match of their tech stack expectations. You know Java. That's big. You can learn Spring on the side, or even on the job, it's not that hard. Just because you haven't worked professionally with Spring doesn't mean you're unqualified for Java/Spring positions.Anecdotally, I've switched stacks completely many times. Companies aren't DQ'ing me because I have no experience in their stack. They know I can learn on the job, and my resume paints that picture. One company I was talking to used Java/Micronaut, which was a completely new concept for me. That interested me, I had some great conversations about it with my interviewers, its pros/cons compared to Spring, etc. I got an offer. My confidence, and my interest in learning the new tech, made up for lack of experience in a core technology that company used. You can do the same, swapping out Spring/Micronaut with GWT/Spring.All that said, right now you're disqualifying youself without even trying. You've made this whole post freaking out about starting to find jobs... *but you haven't started lookign for a job*. You have no idea how it's going to go for you.

But that doesn't change the fact that if it's an expectation, then from your employer's perspective you're not meeting expectations.Another side of this in addition to employer expectations is your own professional boundaries. Did you clearly communicate your working hours? When contacted after hours did you make it clear that it was *after hours* for you and that you'd get back to them first thing in the morning?Especially in a distributed world where people may be in different timezones, and where a lot of people are setting their own hours, some people just don't realize if it's after hours for someone else. That may be insensitive to not consider that before firing off messages... but it's not uncommon.Even on teams with a good WLB though, after hours messages happe from time to time, for various reasons.

mw3i43j,"Short answer: While I want to say ""YES, it will open doors for you!"" the reality is more akin to avoiding a penalty than actually helping you. Most people in the field have a degree, and it puts you on a level playing field.Not having the degree is going to close doors -- there's no way around it. That doesn't mean that there are no open doors for you, but it's going to limit you. Particularly if you ever think you might want to work in another country, your visa may hinge entirely on having a CS degree.When changing careers to software engineering, I went and did exactly what you are considering and got a Masters in CS. I have never even once had regrets, and many of the opportunities I've had wouldn't have been possible without it. If you have the time, and can afford the expense (I received a partial scholarship), I cannot recommend it enough.Additionally, considering the current job market, it is so competitive for new grads right now that I don't think companies are taking risks on giving someone their first CS job with no work history and no degree. At this particular moment in time, I think it would be incredibly difficult to get your first job in the industry unless you already have personal connections to do so (getting the first job without a degree and proving yourself is the biggest hurdle) or are prepared to work for absolutely abysmal pay or conditions (which may have lifelong career repercussions -- people will probably know exactly how your previous employer paid you and treated you, and it can be a struggle for your wages to catch up even as you move to better and better companies). Getting the degree also gives time for the current job market to possibly improve, though I don't know I'd put money on it getting better so that's neither here nor there.",wouldprefernot,2025-06-05 07:32:28,12,cscareerquestions,t3_1l3rnlk,False,

That said, you as the candidate, have little to gain from personally name dropping your connections. It can come across as a crass request for favoritism.

It's why we call it an *estimate.*What's important is how you *handle* those things.When I'm asked to do something ad hoc, I respond with something like ""Sure thing! I'll have to shift focus away from X in order to do that though, so X won't get done"".I have 40 hours in a week. My manager/PM is in charge of deciding how I use those 40 hours, they get to choose my priorities, so if they want me to address something immediately, I will. But *I'm* in charge of setting expectations, and enforcing my professional boundaries of a 40 hour work week. So the question goes back to them, they can trade one priority for another. They don't get to tell me ""Everything's gotta get done"", that's just a sign of poor management if they try. Luckily for management though, a lot of SWE's are scared to establish professional boundaries, so they just decide to quietly do everything and inflate their hours beyond 40, which is not sustainable.When unknowns pop up in tickets that I've estimated, I very clearly communicate those things as early as possible. ""X, Y,and Z came up while doing this ticket. We can either make a 2nd ticket to tackle next sprint and close this one out partially complete, or we can include that increased scope as a part of this ticket and it'll carry over"".It's all about how you respond.

It might also be helpful to track how much time is being spent either not fixing things the right way or poor planning. Some of what you're describing sounds like requirements might be inaccurate, which adds to these issues popping up. There could also be an increased culture of testing. There used to be a practice back in the day that whoever broke the build was the new buildmaster until the next person. Or, you can rotate the role. It may give people more appreciation of what they are committing (realistically, there are some people who will never care). But if you go with a per-sprint role, maybe that can be a pointed ticket/story to cover that work. Sounds like your manager might not like those ideas because they just want to push features, but it's worth at least having the discussion. It's real work, and it may help the team find ways to be more efficient in the long-term. Another huge advantage of these rotations is spreading knowledge across the team.

Don't let the incentives of your academic-minded colleagues and advisors (i.e., publications) to take precedence over your priorities (i.e., developing proof of skills that are valuable in the workplace).",dfphd,2025-06-05 15:00:21,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1l3ueaa,False,

mwutiey,"PhD programs in the US don't usually have masters degrees are a prerequisite, and certainly CS PhD programs won't care about a masters in philosophy. They'll be looking at your academic background, research projects, letters of recommendation, statement of purpose, fit with the program, GRE (if required), and stuff like that. I took a look at your philosophy of mind writing. It's... not good. You'll need to stop using chatGPT to help you write stuff. Even if you think it's your own voice and ideas, having an LLM rewrite your stuff will invariably introduce semantic shift as well as ideas that aren't your own. Using an LLM to help you write like this at all will instantly torpedo any academic aspirations you have. You're going to need to learn how to express your thoughts on your own. Chatting with LLMs can make you feel like you're learning a lot and that you're making deep insights, but that's the sycophantic nature of chatbots. But it's actually very shallow because it doesn't understand anything. It's just good at generating sentences and paragraphs that looks good on the surface. It might seem deep to someone who's deep in the Dunning-Kreuger well, but it's mostly just superficial repetition to an expert. You didn't engage any other thinkers at all, didn't connect anything you're saying to any published work, and there's just zero rigor. Be careful ""self-studying"" philosophy in this way. It's not preparing you for an academic program in philosophy. This is the equivalent of someone self-studying about CSS and learning how to change colors and themes on a webpage, and thinking that they've made some insightful leaps in the theory of computer science. So just be careful with that. If you want to learn how to do philosophy, you need to deeply engage with a large catalogue of serious literature. LLMs, pop writing on Buddhism, and Sam Harris won't cut it past a 100 level undergrad philosophy class.",ilovemacandcheese,2025-06-09 16:28:41,2,cscareerquestions,t1_mwqsw4v,False,

I do engage with big writers in the field and want to do more formal writing(without LLMs assistance) so that’s why I want to go back to school. I think being in an academic setting and engaging with real professors and classmates would allow me to step past the stage I’m at currently which I agree is not very good. I do believe in my capability of growing to write more academically as I have a strong argument against simulation theory that I have talked to both cs professors and philosophers professors about and got good feedback. I bought all the relevant existing literature(Dennet, Bolstram, Chalmers) so I can reference and engage with literature.

mwlnl5z,"It’s going to be so case by case that it’s hard to answer definitively. I am currently at a ~2,000 person company that is slow, has too much process, and imbalanced staffing for their goals. We plan way too much (in halfs,) don’t stick to it, then thrash. Very compartmentalized as if whole sections of the company are external vendors. The best thing they have going for them is a supposed blameless culture, but this often manifests as a lack of ownership/responsibility for actions. In the past I was at a company that grew from 50 to over 1,000 and they were basically the opposite. Fast, not much process, pragmatic staffing. We planned more flexibly, often week by week, and later monthly as we grew. Culture was very open and encouraged cross functional behavior and leadership. The only thing I didn’t like here (besides stress that built over years) was the subtle blame games that happened behind your back. So like I said, complete opposites. Both are political but often this behavior came from career big tech people. Try as we might to start fresh, people bring their baggage and it impacts the culture throughout the industry, for better and for worse.",Which-Meat-3388,2025-06-08 03:49:12,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1l621kp,False,

mwj1oqr,"I would take it if you think you can keep a portion of your current clients, otherwise I'd only consider it if you felt like it was a *very* stable contract. Slightly more money isn't worth the risk of moving to a single client, imo, but if the consistency of a single product is enticing then I would say that's a good reason to consider the offer.Food for thought: most ""full time"" roles don't actually take up a full 40 hour week. You'll need to align with their schedule more rigidly, and give them priority, but there's no reason you can't keep your easier/smaller clients. Some people take on multiple full time roles, even.If you think this is definitively a 40+ hr/wk workload for that single client, though, then that would probably be the dealbreaker for me without a more significant pay bump. You've already accomplished the hard part of freelance--finding clients. I wouldn't leave the flexibility behind for an almost-equivalent salary.
