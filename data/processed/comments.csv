There are perhaps three, at most five, major players in the data warehouse space. Many vendors have started to just build push-type integrations with each of them; this isn't that difficult to maintain and has numerous advantages over some external service running big extractions on a schedule. They can point to what Fivetran would charge to shift that data and make it a selling point.Where does Fivetran fit into this? They don't. They're being cut out.Worse, they've got much cheaper, open core competitors with cloud offerings whose main disadvantage is that they don't have the long tail of connectors. But this advantage is constantly being eroded, and the long tail is, by definition, less marginally lucrative the further you push into it.So what's the play? Seems to me that their plan is to- take advantage of existing lock-in: jack up prices- accept the resulting churn; it'll happen anyway if nothing changes- use the windfall to power a set of acquisitions that amount to a land-grab of other, more defensible parts of the data stackThoughts?",PaddyAlton,2025-10-02 04:25:26,3,dataengineering,t3_1nulrd5,False,

Prefect is nice if you want something lighter with better DX.Honestly, even GitHub Actions or cron works fine for simpler setups if you’re disciplined with retries/alerts. Hosting wise, containers on ECS/Kubernetes give flexibility, but I’ve also seen folks run Python EL pipelines on Azure Functions or AWS Lambda when workloads are small enough.The headache is always secure on-prem access.

nhidt3r,"I've found the best way to understand your data requirements (and therefore table requirements) is to understand what your reporting requirements are. Once you understand what you need for your reports, you can then build the data to fit those needs. Typically if youre designing data models for Power BI or a lot of other tools, you need to have a model built on Kimball best practices for ingestion into your reporting dataset (i.e. a star schema as much as possible - this sometimes isnt possible due to data or reporting restrictions and you'll need to snowflake).You also need to understand what fact and dimensional attributes you need in your report, and appropriately build facts with the appropriate columns and dimensions with the appropriate columns where attributes directly pertain to one another.The three layers of ETL can vary from this, but this is what I would do:- Staging data - as is from source (or structured into parquet files in a data lake)- Enterprise/silver data - this can depend on what youre planning to have. You could do a inmon style data model, data vault or directly into a kimball structure. Inmon and Eata vault give more flexibility but require a lot more work in building them. While straight to Kimball is the simplest and quickest way of building data. It depends on your businesses skill sets and time constraints. - gold layer - kimball data models with surrogate keysIn terms of pipelines youre main aim is to have the easiest estate to maintain and manage. This to me means having minimal pipelines. This can be done by building a metadata driven ETL making your pipelines parametised and driven by configuration tables. In my experience its best to have configuration tables stored in an Azure SQL DB to allow easy transactional data changes, and ease of inserts and updates. With Azure pipelines you can typically do one extract pipeline (or a couple of parent child pipelines) per source system type and authentication type (e.g. Oracle and Windows auth).Enterprise/Silver pipelines you can have one pipeline.Presentations a pair of parent and child pipelines.",Quiet-Range-4843,2025-10-03 08:05:04,18,dataengineering,t3_1nwp1wp,False,

In cloud stacks you trade that GUI clarity for scalability, and sometimes the trade doesn’t feel worth it.If you want something closest to that old-school feel, Coalesce is probably the best “modern PowerCenter” I’ve seen. You still end up with SQL under the hood, but the GUI gives you traceability that’s hard to replicate in pure PySpark. Matillion works too but the lock-in stories are real, and Informatica Cloud is… still Informatica, so you know what comes with that. Apache Hop is worth a look if you want open source with a GUI—less polished, but flexible.The reason folks keep pushing dbt is because it hits the sweet spot of modularization + lineage + testing in SQL. Add dbt’s semantic layer or a canvas-style GUI (dbt Cloud if you’ve got budget) and you get part of that PowerCenter experience without losing code discipline.If your gold models are the bottleneck, I’d maybe pilot Coalesce on a hairy one and compare cycle time + auditability against your current PySpark/dbt flows. Sometimes just seeing the impact analysis in a GUI saves hours of detective work.Curious, are you leaning toward vendor-backed tools (Coalesce, Matillion, Informatica) or would you consider open source like Hop or even something hybrid?

nhbo7r7,"CDC is just another way of getting changes from a database. It is especially useful for scenarios where the database does not have timestamps, and you don't have other application-level events.Databases store every change that happen to them in some form of a changelog, roughly a file that has the changes applied to a row, sth like this:* table: `users`* operation: \`UPDATE\`* id: 42* email: [`old@example.com`](mailto:old@example.com) → [`alice@example.com`](mailto:alice@example.com)CDC is the idea of using this change dataset and replicate the same events for analytical purposes in other places, e.g. your BigQuery or Snowflake.There are various ways CDC can be implemented, the most common open-source software for that being Debezium, which reads these events from the database changelog and publishes them to other destinations such as Kafka. This allows people to start consuming the changes even if there's no domain events being published from the application.This way of retrieving the data is especially useful when you do not have reliable timestamp columns, which is very common in enterprise settings.

At the simplest level, it just means capturing row-level changes (inserts/updates/deletes) from a source system and pushing them somewhere else.How it’s done depends on the tech. Some databases expose their transaction logs (Postgres logical decoding, MySQL binlog, etc.), and CDC tools read from those. Others use triggers or periodic queries. So you’ll see CDC as both a *concept* (keep downstream systems in sync with source changes) and a set of *implementations* (Debezium, Oracle GoldenGate, Fivetran, Estuary, etc.).Compared to microbatches: microbatching polls the DB every X minutes and compares timestamps, which is simpler but usually heavier load and not real-time.

Each persons changes remain separated (in their own branch) until they are reviewed and merged to Prod. For #2, it doesn't work that way for our environment.

If you are new, having strong fundamentals is a lot more important because somebody who can quickly pick up how things work is a lot more likely to be somebody who is a valuable contributor than somebody who is sleepwalking through certificates and courses, not really being sure what to do.Only ones I do recommend is do the free AWS cloud course.The next question is - well, how do I stand out? Get on the phone and speak to recruiters. Go and build rapport and sell your experience that way by showing you know more than your CV lets on. At the end of the day, everybody needs each other. They're the gatekeeper who wants to let people in so they can get paid, so it's in their best interest to place you provided you meet the criteria.More often than not, it's giving the recruiter confidence to put you forward more than being 100% qualified for the job. Nobody in the job advert will ever say ""Will take somebody who can program, lives in the UK, and isn't an utter bellend"" although sometimes that's exactly what they're looking for.

The Dev environment needs to have prod data. My team uses dbt for our sql models, and we configure our dev environment to pull in prod dataOkay, so now you have a dev and a prod SSIS environment. You need to configure your environment variables in the SSIS project. This will allow GitHub later to switch between environments based on the git branch.You can use Github actions to build the ci/cd. The action is just a yaml file that gives github a list of instructions to perform. Here is the workflow. You push code for your local repo, les call it ticket SSIS-001. The ticket changed the column name in a table. When you push the local changes to the remote branch, aka SSIS-001, on the remote server. The Github actions will kick off the instructions. The goal of the instructions is to confirm of the deployment is worked as expected. You will probably want to run some test that check if any of your transformations fail. If any transformation fails, the entire pipeline will fail. When this happens, the ci/cd will stop. This means you can't merge SSIS-001 into prod.So, now you go back on your local branch and fix the issue and push the changed back to the remote SSIS-001 branch. The pipeline passed, and now you merge into master branch. The master branch will run a pipeline that is the same and then push the dtsx package to ssis server and done.Checkout Azure DevOps that might where you want to handle the ci/cd.

nhrck4t,"Off the bat there really aren’t universal “best practices” - Data Engineering has historically been a very “dirty” area in IT. You will need to be able to adapt to kind of whatever your company throws at you/wants from you. It’s definitely getting better, tools like Dagster, dlt, dbt (R.I.P. this open source project…) together with [PEP 318](https://peps.python.org/pep-0318/) (and associated RFP) have really helped to push DE closer towards SE in design and implementation. As such you are best looking at best practices around software engineering principles and adapting to your work.To answer your questions, please see below:1. This VERY much up to you as the DE to decide. The OLTP -> HDFS/S3(-like) storage is a very common use case and as such has a lot of choice for you as the DE. In saying that it’s easiest to usually use what you have on hand/in production already. Have SSIS - you can start with that, only have Python - use that. What you are really asking here is how do I ETL - just google ETL OLTP to storage etc.2. For you (or your architects/plats guys if you have them) to decide, but I personally would want separation of services since I’m not trying to deal with noisy neighbours etc. You really don’t want to add more ways for your Production OLTP server to crash/underperform IMO. So I would recommend a seperate VM/dedicated file server/service with proper subnetting etc.3. Will once again depend on use case, but almost always will be read-replica if they exist in your corp. (You can take this as - Yes, use your read replica(e).4. You will need a VPN gateway (unless you are running some ExpressRoute etc). Also you will need to give the cloud storage a Private IP address (and check subnetting/peering etc) Your network guy(s) will know what to do/should really be doing this for you.5. Just more ETL - this time file system to cloud storage. Once again you decide.6. :person_shrugging: Up to you. I personally don’t use them as they quite expensive and don’t seem worth it to me and my practice, but if your company is on board and you feel more comfortable using them go for it.Edit: I want to point out that it entirely possible to this all on-premise (and open sourced :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:) if you need/the cloud aspect is the most frustrating portion.",Surge_attack,2025-10-04 18:22:44,6,dataengineering,t3_1ny091v,False,

Commercial solutions like fivetran or open source systems like tabsdata could be used. Try not to have your own managed staging area as that creates complications and management overhead.> Would the file system be on the same server as the database or on a separate server?If you still do that, don't put data on the system where the db is, use a spearate system.> Is it better to extract the data from a replica or would it also be acceptable to access the production database?Depends upon on the db load profile. Use the replica if it is readily available unless the load on the production database is low enough that you can query it directly for data extraction.> How do I connect an on-premise server with cloud storage?There are data movement systems you can and should use for this. No point in reinventing the wheel as it will get complicated very fast.> How do I transfer the extracted data that is now on the file system to cloud storage?

You will have a very wide base of knowledge, just deep enough to know what you actually need to do.The most useful in real life for most people is probably DSA. At university, you will learn way more complex DSA than when you are self taught. (I personally also did multiple advanced DSA courses, because I liked the topic)I implemented a partial merge sort (just the merge step, we had pre-sorted data in our database (as JSON, don't ask)) twice. I had to implement a version of A\* to run on a huge dataset (which was not in a graph database, it was a mess but worked) and I had to write a maximum-flow-algorithm.I am sure a programmer without prior knowledge could have solved all of these issues, but I already knew how to solve them and what I needed to look up (because I didn't do all that by heart) in advance. That's the real benefit: I know what to look up, and when I need it.Other topics that I know ""enough"" about to gain a massive speed boost, should they become relevant, include how operating systems work, how the network stack works, basically all math that will ever be relevant to me, how compilers/interpreters work, and probably a lot more passive knowledge I forgot about.EDIT: You absolutely CAN learn all of that by yourself, but generally people don't (and it takes quite a while longer without good lecturers, tutors, fellow students, dedicated time and pressure to learn things you don't particularly enjoy)",Beregolas,2025-10-02 13:49:46,187,learnprogramming,t3_1nw3zzv,False,

nhdqa99,"So the *biggest* advantage is getting past the HR filter: In most companies, long before anyone with any coding knowledge even glances at your resume, it goes through HR. Let's say they get 2000 applications for an open posting. They need to cut it down to, say, 10 to call in for an interview. If half of those 2000 don't have a B.Sc. in Comp Sci on their resume, it is easy to toss them in a bin and cut your search space in half. Will you throw away some applications from great candidates? Absolutely. But their priority will be whittling down the pile of resumes to a more manageable number as fast as possible so anything they can filter on is great.Next to that hurdle, there's just that university comes with lots of networking skills. You'll make contacts - especially if you do an internship, but even if you don't if you have a good reputation in your program the other good students are going to remember you. And might give you a recommendation if you try to get in where they work. The whole ""it isn't what you know, it is who you know"" is at least partially true in every field.Okay, social/employment considerations aside, what actual learning advantages does University have? There's a few.First is time. Between classes and studying and assignments, you'll probably spend 5000 hours over 4 years on comp sci as you go through the degree, which I think is probably the bare minimum you need to get competent. A lot of self-taught people are trying to cram in all their learning into just a couple hundred hours and that's super unrealistic.In addition, when your work is being evaluated by others it helps you figure out if you're actually learning anything. Good professors (and they aren't all good) will design assessments that are really testing if you understand the material deeply. Whereas I see so many people ""self-teach"" themselves and learn *nothing* because their knowledge is never put to the test and they never realize they've just been copying tutorials and never actually internalized anything.In terms of actual subject matter, yeah, fundamentals, data structures and algorithms, that type of thing self-taught people tend to miss out on. But there's like a *million* books you can pick up that'll teach you those.

nh5tolv,"I am by no means a savant coder, but as someone who learned a bit in his teens and then went back to college in his mid twenties for CS degree I think others here are offering the perfect advice. Theory of code is great. It’s nice to understand concepts. But truly understanding code comes from writing it. Seeing the same error and then eventually clicking “oh it’s because I put this here, or oh, I see how to refactor this into less spaghetti”Additionally, while C is a backbone language it is considered low level, and you might benefit from taking what you know and applying it to another language. Some are much easier to learn than others. For example, writing a webpage with basic functions (like say writing a blog post) is significantly easier in my opinion than the majority of things you could build in C. Not only is the syntax easier to understand and master, but you get immediate gratification in seeing what you’re doing as you work and change things. E.g. changing the size of text or a container can be immediately seen when you reload the page or even faster if you use a plugin like Live Server. (Refreshes page every save so you don’t have to manually reload the page). Anyway, my point is don’t fret on not understanding all of the conceptual stuff. Some of it will come in time. There’s still theory far beyond me and I’ve been employed and coding projects for about five years now and again I need to note I didn’t return to college and pick coding back up until my mid twenties.

You have to apply to get one of those if you want it to be public, and it's a whole process.By _default_, everything on the internet has an IP address. This address allows the computer to figure out what other computer to talk to.Most (home network) LANs have an NAT (network address translator), which takes all the requests sent to it that are destined for the WWW, and translates them so the data gets sent back to said NAT, and translates it back to the LAN address. This NAT is usually in a Router (a connection between two different networks.)Without this router, you cannot connect to the LAN from the internet, so it is not public.With this router, the stuff on your network is only public if you change the router settings to allow incoming connections (usually with Port Forwarding/Triggering)Thus, routers have two different IP addresses. One for ""the internet"" to communicate with it, and one for the LAN, to communicate with the LAN.Any computer connected to the LAN can talk to any other device on the LAN with its IP address. This LAN address usually starts with 10., or 192.168., depending on how the router is set up.So if you save the website on a local computer, then use the computers LAN IP as the URL on any other computer in that LAN, you get what you want.",Nerketur,2025-10-05 15:47:28,7,learnprogramming,t3_1nyr14w,False,

The current LTS are Java 21 and Java 25.And similar version changes have happened also to Spring Boot and other things.But as we know, the real life shows that companies are still using old versions because most of the development funds go to adding new features and fixing bugs. Infrastructure upgrades are of lower priority for the management level.Maybe somehow big thing was Log4Shell vulnerability that affects Log4J versions between 2.0 and 2.15. If you have any projects using Log4J from these versions then update your stuff. That Log4Shell was a catastrophe level vulnerability. Or, just learn to use vulnerability checking tools like OWASP Dependencycheck or Trivy scanner if you are not doing it already.Other than that, the world is quite same in 2025 as it was in 2017.When it comes to an AI then that is what you need to learn to use.

Imagine doing a code review to a Junior developer.

It tries to rely mainly on its training data (which can be outdated). It also hallucinates when it does not have an exact answer to something. It starts generalizing stuff and making up answers.So, be critical with what the AI is telling you. It is a useful tool but do not fully trust it. The same way how you do not fully trust Google Search results. Verify over, when possible.You can also use Claude Code that can work with your projects in your own machine. But all the pros and cons of AI apply also to Claude Code. You will tell it to do things and it will then display code changes with a git diff.

Only one packet can be sent by one host at any given time, since there’s only one wire to talk on.Rather than send EVERY packet on your local lan to EVERY host on your local lan, a switch pays attention to the traffic (including some special packets) and figures out who’s on which physical outgoing cable, and sends packets only to their recipients.

Layer 2 is about connecting the physical devices together on the local network.Real, physical devices that you actually use, almost always operates at ALL layers. A router will have a physical connection to other devices, it will will have to be using something like Ethernet to connect, it will have a networking protocol like IP, IPX or something obscure for its primary functionality.

Many devices that are called 'routers' and used for home networks include a switch.

A 'switch' is basically an Ethernet only thing.It used to be very common to have a T1 (serial), or frame-relay, or some other type layer 2 network connect to the router, and maybe a token ring network on the 'local' segment.For people with a cable internet connection (DOCSIS) they will have a router with a cable interface and an ethernet interfaces.

The Internet Protocol accepts the fact that network operators won’t always agree on what devices and protocols to use, and that new network innovations might occur in the future. The Ethernet protocol is actually younger than the IP protocol. There were other types of networks in use when IP was developed, some still in use and others not.

Take 2 equations: f(x) = 100x + 10, g(x) = x (the simplest function we can represent with the same degree as f(x)).The largest exponent for both of these equations is 1, so we can apply the above rule. Let's choose a constant of 105 for c.For some values of x, f(x) > c * g(x). Take x == 1 for example. F would be 110 and g would be 1. 110 > 105 (1 * C). However, at larger values of x, this doesn't stay true. At x == 10 we get f is 1,010 and g is 10. So, for these values, f(x) 1,010.Basically, this just sums down to the idea that a functions growth is capped to its largest exponent, which is why Big O notation always ignores constants (except for O(1)). So, even something like f(x) = 1,000,000,000x, the Big O notation would be O(x), because there exists a constant C and a value of x X0 that f(x) < c * g(x).",Alarming_Chip_5729,2025-10-05 04:46:36,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nyeko4,False,

Java will run on desktop and natively on any Android device. Python has frameworks and tools that will also allow you to do it. If it’s a web app like browser base JavaScript can get it going. My advice pick something you’d like to do with plenty of tutorials and find a language that matches it. Stick to it until you have a good grip and you’re able to build a fairly robust app. After you can look into other languages and specify into what you want. It’s not crazy hard to change later once you know what you want to do with the new language. Personal recommendation:If you want to build mobile apps go with Java and Android Studio. It’ll do a lot of the heavy lifting for you and it has a drag and drop GUI builder. If you want to go the longer route and get the basics down start with C. Try CS50x (Harvard’s free course), that’ll bringing you through C fairly well (to start) and cover a bit of html and Python, I think it uses flask towards the end but I can’t remember. I like Python alright but I wouldn’t recommend starting there, you don’t need to define types and it’s an interpreted language so you don’t compile to find errors which is a big lesson in learning early on. Also it is a bit different from how key features work (tuples, indentation, for loops). I’d stick with a more traditional one to start. JavaScript unless you want to go full web-dev I wouldn’t go there either (not really a fan). Again like Python it’s interpreted.

Syntax isn't difficult, what is difficult is problem solving and that's what programming is at it's core.

nh5fgt2,"There will be remote internships advertised also but it can be a lot more difficult as they’ll be open to everyone. I’m currently working remotely in an internship but it’s a challenge, I meet my mentor once or twice a week but it’s only a team’s call here or there. It’s hard to see what’s actually going on and fair it was more frequent towards the end of summer but it’s still not great. Having someone physically beside you where you can see and more freely chat about what’s going on would be a lot better. A lot of the internships advertised around me are hybrid, 2 days in the office and 3 remote. They’re advertised exclusively to college student going to Uni in my city (supporting the local Uni’s). So while there is competition for them it’s a much better chance of securing something. How I got my remote internships:1) I joined the local GDG group (I actually joined the 3 nearest, within a 2 hour drive) and spoke with people nearly any chance I got. Not just about coding but open conversation during intervals or asked what they thought of the talks after. 2) I got lucky and met someone from the same area I’m from, I think it was at a careers event not directly tech focused. He went to school with one of my uncles 20-30 years ago and we had a brief convo about back home. 3) the next time I met him I mentioned it’d be great to just see “What it’s like day to day or the general flow of what devs do? how the online meetings go? What their day is actually like?”. He takes my number and said he’d ask if I could join a meeting with them some time. He’s in management so not directly linked but sat in on some meetings. 4) 2 months mass with no response and out of the blue I get a text asking if I’d like to join an update meeting. 5) from there one of the devs offered to wait on the call and have a chat after. To be honest that’s all I expected to get from it and it was nice just to get that introduction. A week later he offered me some unpaid work just to get a taste of it, I jumped at the opportunity. 6) that was 3 months ago and now they’re on about maybe being able to offer me a paid internship. It wouldn’t be amazing money but roughly equivalent to part time work so I could probably quit my other job and get some real experience. .It’s not easy and I still have another job alongside Uni and the remote work currently. 1) I’m in college 30hr per week. 2) I work 20-30hr per week. 3) and the internship is 16-20hr per weekIt doesn’t give a lot of time off for anything else but ya the experience is invaluable right now.

ni37at5,"This sounds like a situation where a bit of profiling and measurement will help with your system design.My guess is that the time taken to scan a file's header and figure out what codecs it uses is a tiny fraction of the time taken to actually re-encode it. And the time taken to traverse the filesystem and open the file is even tinier. (Profiling will tell you just how tiny.)And as a counterpoint, whenever you go from having a single source of truth (e.g. the filesystem) to multiple separate data stores (the filesystem + a separate database), you increase the number of opportunities for complexity and bugs to creep into your system.For *interactive* use, it might well be desirable to maintain a DB with metadata and indexes, so that you can quickly search for individual files. But for a big batch reprocessing job which is going to be slow anyway, I think it makes sense to just treat what's in the filesystem as authoritative, instead of relying on a DB that might potentially become out of sync if there's a bug. The difference in performance is likely to be small.If the performance does actually matter (e.g. because you want to re-run your reprocessing job frequently) then what I would probably do is just maintain an index of paths/timestamps/checksums which are known to be ""good"" (don't need re-encoding). This allows you to avoid repeatedly scanning files that haven't changed. But the index itself contains no important data.

If it is a relatively simple CRUD application then it does not need microservices. If it has distinct independent parts that function separately from each other and serve a specific purpose, then you can consider building microservices. You can go first with multimodal monolith and see how it works out. If one of the modules becomes too big and starts having way too many that-module-specific-only functionalities, then you can take that module out from the monolith into a separate microservice.You can have your monolith running from inside a Docker container and be maintained by Kubernetes. You do not need multiple microservices for that. MQs or Kafka are needed when you are having separate microservices/monoliths. Although, by an idea, you can set up these also between your modules within one monolith.gRPC is not always needed. It is much less needed than the other things you mentioned. You are more likely to use REST and then SOAP (with older systems).In terms of what you should learn, then pick all but gRPC. And use MQ only when you need it. You can have your senior project running as a monolith inside a Docker container and be managed by Kubernetes and you'll do fine.There is a good likelihood that you will be using Docker. It is a must to have. Kubernetes is also a good pick because even with older systems these can be migrated over to Kubernetes when the client is willing to put money in it. With multiple microservices/monoliths and/or multimodal monolith, you are also likely to encounter either some of the MQ tools or Kafka. But as I said, use it in your project when it makes sense to use it. Do not just drop any and all kinds of technologies into your project. It will be an unnecessary technical bloat.

Freedom which could be abused.The point of something like Flash is to run code from external third-party sources, which are by definition potentially untrustworthy. Abuse prevention is part of the bare minimum requirements.If I go to a website, and a plugin automatically loads some content, and the plugin gives too much ""freedom"" to **some other developer's** code to do what it wants with **my** computer, then the plugin is not fit for purpose.Modern browsers like Chrome and Firefox have put a lot of work into sandboxing HTML/JS code so that it can run *safely* even if the code is untrustworthy. Modern HTML-based webapps give just as much ""freedom"" to developers to make actual content as Flash did -- the existence of [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) is proof of this. But that freedom is kept safely within a high-quality sandbox.The difference is in the implementation, not the overall architecture. Macromedia/Adobe *could* have put as much careful work into sandboxing as the browser developers did. And then they would have had an equally high-quality, secure system.

My impression is that Adobe did a friggin amazing job of the rework from AS2 to AS3, but that was another nail in the coffin, because all the old AS2 programs could not be converted. I coded some things to convert from AS2 to AS3 and it was a nightmare.(C# seems to suffer from the problem AS2 had where there was not enough uniformity with web service calls and event handler delegates.)Adobe Flash through AIR did work on the iPad as an app, so it did have its little security sandbox there. It had terrible performance on the iPad 1, but it was totally fixed on the iPad 2. I made many apps with it including a 10 point touch app that was on a floor to ceiling monitor where multiple people could interact with it. A heart rate monitor app in a fitness studio with time synced looping video on 16+ iPads displaying the composite heart rates on a 70"" screen all timed with music programs that the owners made on the server.I made about $100,000 from that job.

nhkbp7b,"The `inline` keyword has very little to do with 'inlining' as an optimisation nowadays. (It used to, before C++98)Compilers have very good heuristics of what to inline and where, and functions may or may not be inlined, independently of if they are marked inline or not. Now, `inline` specifies the function linkage. The exact meaning is complicated, but you can think of it as ""multiple definitions are permitted as long as they are in separate translation units"". [See the documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/inline.html)",CptCap,2025-10-03 15:46:03,3,learnprogramming,t3_1nwzef5,False,
nhkqbt2,"The One Definition Rule says there can only be one definition of a function or method. `inline` grants you an ODR exception. C++ also recognizes ""normal"" functions and ""inline"" functions.Beyond that - `inline` doesn't actually mean much. It's SUPPOSED TO hint the compiler that call elision is preferred (don't generate a function call, just instead integrate the inline function body directly into the point of the call), but the compiler absolutely does not have to honor that. Hell, even non-standard compiler extensions like `__forceinline` STILL won't guarantee call elision, simply because it's not always possible.In practice, the compiler internally maintains a list of the two different function types, and when using heuristics to determine if a call should be elided, it will pick either a more conservative or more ambitious value. These values are always adjustable as a compiler parameter, so you could just set both of them the same, so that EVERYTHING is elided just as aggressively as everything else.Yes, this implies that even normal functions ARE candidates for call elision, `inline` doesn't grant that like a special power.I should also point out that a shitload of function types are all implicitly inlined, so an `inline` decorator is strictly redundant. Template functions and methods, for example.So why do you want an ODR exception? Because C and thus C++ do not have whole-program compilation. Every Translation Unit is an island, wholly isolated from all others. If you want the COMPILER to elide a function, then the COMPILER needs the function definition visible IN THAT TU, in order to decide whether to elide it or not, and also just to HAVE the statements that it is eliding there and then at compile time.In order to get the function definition into every TU, you need an ODR exception.And suddenly templates make a hell of a lot of sense, because when you `std::vector`, or whatever, you implicitly instantiate that template in every TU as a concrete type - it's compiled into object code into every object file - how else could you do that without an ODR exception? (Hint: there are ways - advanced programming techniques that also cut down compile times.)---So normal functions are considered for call elision, too, and you can fuck with the heuristics without fucking with the source code.Also - since C++ doesn't have whole-program compilation, that means we don't get TYPICAL Whole Program Optimization. But we DO get A version of WPO, and it's called Link-Time Optimization. It's strictly inferior. What the compiler does is it decides to bundle the compiler flags and source code in the object file. When the linker comes across these bundles, it invokes the compiler. With the linker's perspective, the compiler can decide whether to elide a call or not.So now you don't even NEED an ODR exception to get the benefit of call elision, even across TUs.But I can do you one better: unity builds. Basically, you configure your build system so that ALL your source files are included into ONE source file, thus making a SINGLE TU. This has the effect of putting all the source code in the same scope at once. The compiler can do a much better job at compilation, heuristics, dead code elimination, and reduction than you can get with a link step. The machine code and object code is superior to an incremental build with LTO, and less error prone. Unity builds are preferred for smaller projects ~20k LOC or less, and that number grows with faster hardware, and they're preferred for release builds, since you're always going to build a release from scratch - no cached object files. Incremental builds are ONLY useful for dev cycles on large code bases.So this basically renders `inline` useless. For every reason you would want it, there are always better ways to leverage first. Always configure a unity build - and in 30 years I've never seen a reason not to. Do prefer to fine-tune the compiler from the configuration, not the source code - what is good for one compiler is bad for another. Let the optimizer do its job and don't assume you're smarter. If the optimizer can't figure it out, your code is more likely bad than the optimizer is dumb. Don't be hinting the compiler from the source code. YOU don't know WHAT compiler I'm using, so get outta here with that shit.Oh, and we have profiler driven builds, where performance is measured from a test build and the heuristics is catered per function. At that point `inline` heuristics are irrelevant.So the only thing we can guarantee about `inline`, the only thing we know it's good for, is an ODR exception, and so you have to ask yourself why do you want that? What technical problem are you solving for by turning off safety, that's better than being protected? So far, I've never seen a use case.If you see `inline` in source code, you've got some developers with some dogmatic beliefs, because indeed, there was a time - in the 80s and 90s from which I hail from, that compilers and optimizers were indeed FUCKING TERRIBLE, and YOU WERE smarter than the algorithms. But that's just not the case anymore. Even new developers come up incorporating what they're being told without EVER critically thinking about it or reading about it or looking into it whatsoever.And yet people are attracted to C++ because they ""really care about performance"" but cannot accept that this belief in particular is dated and wrong.

I suggest you don't)* C++ -> low level stuff* PHP -> Web BackendThere are a lot of other languages, but in my experience, those are pretty common examples. So yeah, Python is a good choice, if you are interested in one of it's applications.Video game modding is heavily dependent on the game. You can probably, technically, mod any game you want in C... but that's beside the point. Most games have a modding API, either officially, or inofficially. Most often, those APIs are meant to be used in the same language as the game was written and/or scripted in. C++ is the most common, as most major enginges are written in C++ under the hood. C# works for Unity modding, iirc, and some smaller game engines use lua or GdScript (Godot specifically).So, in both cases, freelancing and modding:It's not about one language being better than all others. That's just not how it works. That's like saying ""The saw is the best tool ever!"" and then attempting to drive a nail into wood using it. If you want to do a job, there are tools that are better suited for that specific job. But, as I said above: If you really want to, you can probbaly mod any game using C (after copious and unnecessary amounts of reverse engineering), just as you COULD use C for Data Science, Web Frontends (WASM), App Development, Automation, etc. It's just not the most ergonomic tool to use, and that's understating it.EDIT: Also, don't fall into the wrong assumption most people have, that programming languages are hard to learn. They are in fact, not. If I (or any developer with only a little experience) want to learn a new language today, it will literally take me a weekend. They all pretty much work the same, and once you understand all key concepts, you can switch langauges as you please. Sure, the tooling will be unfamiliar, and some conventions will be too, and you will take a little longer to get into a groove, and the first few weeks your code quality might suffer a little, but it's really not hard. The reasons most people assume it's hard (I think), is because they think it will be like learning their first programming language(s). When in reality, the first langueage(s) you are learning are not hard, because languages are inherently hard to learn; It's because you are learning to program. And programming is hard.

I also have terminal ADHD.I firmly believe that almost anyone, including those of us with ADHD, can learn almost anything with the right resources and learning strategies. Those resources aren't guaranteed to be available to you, and you aren't guaranteed to find the right learning strategy if you go looking, but there is a very good chance that you are capable of this.Random notes in no particular order from what you've said:* You're ""supposed"" to learn TypeScript, Rust, JavaScript, Python, React? Why? It is far more valuable to be a good dev in one tech stack than a novice in 10. I strongly suggest picking one set of technologies that you feel suits your purposes and sticking with that. Jumping languages and frameworks every 5 seconds is exhausting and doesn't really teach you anything useful in my experience. It's also much easier for a good Python dev to become a good C# dev than it is for a polyglot novice to become good at any language, IMO.* Find a practice/learning style which suits you so that the endless learning doesn't become too much of a chore. For me, implementation is everything. I don't often ""get"" things unless I practice them myself, so if for example I'm learning some new data structure I'll usually hand-code an implementation of it rather than importing someone else's and prove to myself first that it works as I expect, and second that I've gathered enough information to create it. I also use this with programming for other things - my mind is a sieve when it comes to calculus, for example, but writing programs that *do* calculus really helps me crystalise the knowledge.* Respect the ADHD. A lot of people aren't going to get it and will give you advice that amounts to ""just keep trying"". Ignore them. I strongly believe that banging your head against a wall or burning yourself out trying to force your mind to act neurotypical is a net negative for learning. If you find yourself struggling for more than, say, 15 minutes on a problem you're quite possibly reinforcing the struggle rather than the progress. Learn when to be gentle with yourself, when to give up and look up the answers. There is such thing as trying too hard.* Drink water, sleep, exercise, socialise, rest and relax!

Syntax is just the tool we use to bring our solutions to life.So, you want to build a workout routine app? Perfect. What’s the big problem here? It’s something like, “Creating a program that allows you to track your workouts and even generates workouts for you.”But that sounds pretty overwhelming. Where do you even start?That’s where breaking things down comes in!!!!1. Creating the ProgramAlright, now we’re getting somewhere. Fire up your IDE and create a new project folder. Maybe call it WorkoutSmart, or whatever the heck makes you happy.2. Tracking WorkoutsOkay, so how do we track workouts? Are we taking user input? Sure thing! Let’s build a simple flow.User flow example:1. The user types a workout into the input field (for example, “Push-ups”) and clicks Submit.:down_arrow:2. The workout is added to the program, either in the background for now or visually on the user interface.:down_arrow:3. Add buttons for Sets and Reps, each with an increment counter.Nice! Step two is coming together well. Push your progress to GitHub and call it a night. :ZZZ:3. Keeping Workouts on RefreshThe next day, you might notice something. When you refresh the page, all the workouts disappear. :frowning_face:Bingo. That’s your next problem to solve.Now it’s time to make the data persistent.You might start Googling something like “how to keep data after page refresh JavaScript” and build from there.As you gain more experience, things start to click. You’ll begin to recognize patterns and might even plan out an entire project in Notion or on paper before writing any code. The plan will change as you go, but it gives you a solid blueprint to follow.I hope that all made sense.Honestly, I think this approach is a beautiful metaphor for life itself.

Let's look at an example: class weight: std::tuple { static bool valid(const int &value) { return value >= 0; } static int validate(const int &value) { if(!valid(value)) { throw std::invalid_argument{""value cannot be negative""}; } return value; } friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &os, const weight &w) { return os (w); } friend class weight_extractor; public: weight() = delete; explicit weight(const int &i): std::tuple{validate(i)} {} weight(const weight &) noexcept = default; weight(weight &&) noexcept = default; weight &operator =(const weight &) noexcept = default; weight &operator =(weight &&) noexcept = default; auto operator (const weight &) const noexcept = default; weight &operator +=(const weight &w) noexcept { std::get(*this) += std::get(w); return *this; } weight &operator *=(const int &i) { std::get(*this) *= validate(i); return *this; } explicit operator int() const noexcept { return std::get(*this); } explicit operator const int &() const noexcept { return std::get(*this); } }; static_assert(sizeof(weight) == sizeof(int)); static_assert(alignof(weight) == alignof(int));This only tells us what a `weight` IS. It gives us the semantics of a `weight`. The definition of a `weight` is not itself an instance of any one particular `weight`. class weight_extractor: std::variant { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &is, weight_extractor &we) { if(is.tie()) { *is.tie() << ""Enter a weight: ""; } if(int v; is >> v) { try { we = weight{v}; } catch(const std::invalid_argument &e) { is.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit); if(is.exceptions() | std::ios_base::failbit) { throw; } } } return is; } friend std::istream_iterator; weight_extractor() noexcept = default; public: weight_extractor(const weight &) = delete; weight_extractor(weight &&) = delete; weight_extractor &operator =(const weight &) = delete; weight_extractor &operator =(weight &&) = delete; operator weight() const { return std::get(*this); } }; static_assert(sizeof(weight_extractor) == sizeof(weight)); static_assert(alignof(weight_extractor) == alignof(weight));The semantics of a `weight` describes all that it can do - you can add weights, you can multiply scalars, you can insert weights into a stream. But extracting weights directly from a stream is problematic; if extraction fails, you can have an invalid weight. This extractor helper class cannot be instantiated by you directly - only the `std::istream_iterator` has access to the only valid - default, ctor.The `weight_extractor` is an example of ""encapsulation"", aka ""complexity hiding"" - we hide the complexity of extracting and validating a `weight` behind a simple type. ""Data hiding"" is a different idiom not demonstrated here - that the class members are `private` is NOT data hiding. weight operator +(weight l, const weight &r) noexcept { return l += r; } int main() { weight my_fat_ass(190);See? Now we're talking about a specific `weight`, `my_fat_ass`, as opposed to anyone else's... Let's get your fat ass into the picture here, too. if(std::input_iterator iter{std::cin}, end{}; iter != end) { weight your_fat_ass = *iter;You will likely never have to use a raw stream iterator in your life. Instead, the standard library has views, like `std::views::istream`, which itself is implemented in terms of stream iterators. You can `std::views::take` 1 or you can use `std::views::single` to get just one value. auto a_whole_lotta_ass = my_fat_ass + your_fat_ass; std::cout << a_whole_lotta_ass << ""lbs.\n""; } return std::cin && std::cout << std::flush ? EXIT_SUCCESS : EXIT_FAILURE; }In C++, we don't use primitive types directly - they are there so we can describe our own types and their semantics. We make types and behaviors and implement algorithms to create a lexicon that describes our problem domain, and then we describe our solution in terms of that. An `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`.So to address your question directly - you need to distinguish between your phone book vs. my phone book vs. any other phone book. If the whole program is to have just one phone book, you'd make it `static`, but often that is a very poor design decision.",mredding,2025-10-02 17:26:05,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nw7t19,False,

If you're using C++ in an object oriented way, the memory for those objects will need to be allocated somewhere.

This post is not saying ""all young kids suck"", but rather explaining how so many people completely unable to do any CS work are getting degrees. They aren't slipping through the cracks, admins chiseled out a crack and swept them towards it.By the way, those great students? To a T, all of them were eager and hard working. Not all of them were obvious geniuses - they just worked really hard on a lot of things because of the love of the craft.---College CS professor here.In the last 10 years, we've seen an absurd increase in the amount of pressure put on us to just pass students by admins chasing retention and graduation statistics. I had a student who literally never showed up to either of my two classes he enrolled in a semester, never turned in a single assignment.So I failed him. So he filed a civil rights complaint. I then had to spend a total of roughly 60 hours defending myself from this, having meetings, collecting every email I ever had with the student and their advisors (plural), recalling dates of the two conversations we had, and rebutting outright laughably obvious lies like the student claiming that I locked them in my office and said they weren't allowed to leave until they did their work (the student didn't even know where my office was) - work that was never completed and he couldn't produce.More than a few professors, would I relay these stories, tell me , ""just don't fight these battles, give them what they want"". Which is even more frustrating because it means when those professor students get into my class, they can't write a for loop by themselves in an advanced software design class.Also, (noting I'm teaching faculty and not research faculty), teaching evaluation is almost entirely boiled down to student evaluations and student evaluations are negatively correlated with the difficulty of the final exam. And let me tell you, they put no effort into this analysis. They just look at in a 30 question survey, the average of one question. And my 700 person undergraduate class is treated as apples to apples to a 12-person grad level research team course. They only look at above average or below average, nothing else. So, your incentivized to make the class as easy as possible so the students give you five stars. It is the yelpification of America, and it creates the worst possible incentives. Like, my student evals can average to 4.1 out of 5, But the average for the entire department is 4.3, so therefore I'm a bad teacher. My average being brought down by a very large number of one-star reviews from shock of all shocks people failing the class.So we've created an entire incentive structure where students seek out the easiest classes they can to get the piece of paper that says they're entitled to a job, and faculty are pushed towards making those classes as easy as possible rather than actually teaching, and anyone who bucks that trend will have an admin ride their ass at the end of every semester because their student evaluation score is .02 less than last year, and "" maybe you could try bringing cookies to class"" (serious suggestion made by someone with a six-figure salary)Basically, goodhart's law remains undefeated.",DBSmiley,2025-10-01 12:00:53,226,cscareerquestions,t3_1nv27jt,False,

nh6c1up,"Part of the issue, I believe, is a lack of understanding of shifts in technology. If you’ve been working in technology for long time you’ve been exposed to lots of things, lots of languages, lots of libraries, lots of methodologies, etc. and then you zoom in on one very, admittedly simple thing like basic understandings of JS for someone who has been working in JS or any arbitrary simple thing that isn’t necessarily cross cutting between technology implementations.On the surface that seems simple: why doesn’t this person understand this thing when they’re working in that space? In reality, you’re looking at it from a biased view. You have a huge repository of internal knowledge and experience. Meanwhile on the daily basis, they may be doing their best to understand baseline assumptions across dozens of technologies and implementations they’ve never been exposed to. Things you take for granted likely, maybe they need to deal with managing certificates, or connecting to a remote Linux system, or something else. Everyone’s going to have varied levels of exposure over their education and careers to certain things. There’s a good chance they have a *firehose* of things they’re trying to understand that they’ve never dealt with before.In addition to that, if you’ve been in tech for say 15+ years or longer, software wasn’t a huge space the further you go back. There was a point in time in the 90s and early 00’s where pretty much everyone alive used Apache HTTPD. Fast forward today and there’s all sorts of HTTP server implementations, but during that period of time simply knowing Apaches HTTPd server in and out gave you baseline knowledge almost anywhere you went, which was learned experience, so new problems you had in that work environment could get more focus vs having to understand a layer of some service on-top of understanding the actual unique problem at the workspace (I’m just using this as an example, there are lots of domains where some almost monopolistic technology reigned supreme, and things didn’t shift that often).Today I can think of probably a dozen popular implementations out there people use, sometimes even library based services, SaaS options, so on just for HTTP hosting, all of which with all their own little idiosyncrasies and domain specific knowledge around them. Again this shift is true in many (most?) technology spaces (e.g. databases, etc.). Software variety and knowledge surrounding those popular concrete implementations has exploded.As a result, all sorts of businesses out there are likely to use some unique mixture of “base” (to them) services “the whole world should understand.” Someone experienced these days may even struggle shifting between environments because of variation in tech. You know some things, but there’s some variety of tech you simply have to learn, in addition to doing your actual job, which isn’t accounted for, it’s just assumed you know it. It’s a very common bias in tech I’ve seen.If you’ve also been working a long time you’re picked up a lot of these things and expanded your pool of knowledge. You’ve seen and used several database systems and services, you’ve seen and used several http servers, front end libraries, so on. You had the benefit, to some degree, of watching these things grow in popularity and catching up as they became popular. None the less, it’s not possible to know all these systems anymore due to the growth rate of tech implementations. So even experienced engineers have issues with these now.I see this bias often with people who tend to work in one or two technology spaces and have the luxury of garnering deep understanding of something. You tend to forget that things that come “simple” or should be “basic” to you aren’t inherently as simple or basic to other people. These kids have little to no experience and are jumping in a pool that doesn’t have good discrete skill specialization (software engineers should be broken up into multiple disciplines when you consider the range of knowledge assumptions, in my opinion).So all this is to say, give the kids a break. It’s like they just finished med school and are applying for open medical speciality positions ranging from cardiologist, to neurosurgeon, to dentist, etc. and being judged as if they had “base” specialized knowledge and experience around each profession yet they have to apply to all of them just to attempt to get employed and hope for the best. It’s especially true in today’s market where you cast a wide net (they’re applying to anything and everything, they need to eat). Thankfully medicine isn’t like that or your dentist may be like “oh I usually do hearts but let’s get this root canal underway, should be similar, veins n such!” Maybe all their past experience was on embedded systems work and all of the sudden, they need money to eat, so they’re now doing their very best to do React frontend work. In software businesses do this in an attempt to reduce labor costs (there’s also practical reasons specializing doesn’t work, your specialty may be dead in a year) and because the impact usually isn’t someone’s life… it’s some not so life threatening feature or service being unavailable, so whatever.

For context, I’ve had similar situations with startups where I’m hired for a project, I complete it successfully, and then I’m laid off to “stay lean”. This has happened multiple times, good feedback, good relationships, good work ethic and productivity, it’s just market shifts and the company trying to be strategic. I had to get clear about what I wanted… and that’s stability. I started looking for opportunities in stable, but growing sectors, i stopped taking interviews with small companies or companies known for their leanness or competitive firing practices. I reached out to people at the company to know what type of culture I was signing up for. During the interviews, when they asked me what I was looking for, I told them… a stable place to grow in my skill and to develop a long-term relationship with a company. This may sound sexist, but I looked for companies that had a lot of women and parents on their team and good paternity leave… to me, this is a signal that the company cares about investing in people rather than the bottom line. If they’re willing to hire women (who may be out an extended period after/around pregnancy) or parents (who have stricter schedules and can’t do the 9-9 grind), they believe in investing in people rather than the short term setback of human life being inconvenient. I looked for companies that didn’t do boom/bust hiring waves. How long have jobs been posted? How many jobs are posted? How frequently do they post? Does this company have a history of downsizing?

The reason is bc a company can just decide to pivot or cut a digital product too easily. Therefore I was looking at companies that have a physical product. The other thing to look for is companies that operate in highly regulated industries especially where what you will be doing will help them meet regulations, esp new ones. Businesses that get their revenue from making sure their customers can meet regulations always have work if those regulations change frequently.

A couple thoughts that may help from what I’ve seen:Need to look at companies that are solving macro problems such as smart mobility, health insurance, public utilities or even large consulting that operate at a large city/state/country scale. The tasks that you excel at are typically handled by “data scientists” in the research or engineering subteams of the broader product team. Most of the time it’s run through a platform like snowflake with some basic trendy algos applied and then call it a day, with little interpretation or understanding of the results.As strange as this sounds you may want to hunt for UX Researcher roles. If you dig into the requirements a lot of what they are asking for there is a lot of overlap and it at least is adjacent to your skill set. One of the hardest things, as this thread has shown, will be articulating your value. Most hiring managers for these roles will have come up through a more vanilla CS background so having a paragraph ready about what the current state of the industry is, why it’s leading teams and products astray and how your deeper understanding makes a difference will be critical. You are a PhD level data scientist who looks at the world through a sociology lens and that brings inherent value.Lastly, the job market actually is pure ass right now.

They work for WITCH companies, insurance companies, oil companies, etc. They are modern-day indentured servants. In this case, if their employer can’t easily replace them by sponsoring someone else, it would stand to reason their wages would rise, not fall. They already couldn’t get sponsored by other companies. Not how it works for this caste. On the other hand, there are H1B recipients who already worked for Big Tech directly overseas. They get sponsored. They insource their job with them. They were never begging for table scraps. They’ll just self deport and outsource their job with them if they get a $100k paycut. Moreover, people like that create other jobs. We’re outsourcing an entire team’s worth of jobs with them. You’re also ignoring the consensus amongst economists as to why SF became the tech capital of the world. Why it outcompeted the hub around MIT in MA. Because non compete agreements are illegal in CA. You presume competition is a bad thing. Maybe it is for entrenched, enshittifying monopolies in isolation. But even those monopolies had been paying a premium to bring the world’s top talent to the place where they weren’t a big fish in a small pond. If they wanted to entrap their higher tier H1Bs, they would’ve done what all the employers of lower tier H1Bs did: moved them out to some godforsaken shithole in TX or NC, refused to sponsor applications for green cards, paid them below market rate, etc. At some level, even the monopolies realize competition is good.We issue under 100k H1Bs per year. That’s it. And they don’t all go to IT/CS jobs either. India and China have nearly 3 billion people between the two of them. Do the math… We’re only getting the top 0.01% of them, for the most part. There are some serial abusers. The WITCH companies in particular ought to be permanently barred from H1B. But really, the problem with H1B is how abusive it is to the recipients. We should be more like Canada and just give them green cards when they arrive. Unironically. Why do we make it so fucking hard for talented people to come here and pay tens of thousands of dollars a year in taxes, while some barely literate economic migrant from Venezuela just says the magic word “asylum” and they can come stay for years in a free hotel, no questions asked?

ni52agv,"I think a big problem is multi-layered. Ill try to tackle it from a few viewpoints:\- We are the techies of our social circle especially from a young age. The ones who make it to big tech companies that burnout their employees are usually the ones that did really well in school, exceled at every level and their community assumed theyd make it far. Then when we make it to that big time company that overworks us, we feel like the top o fthe world but then when we see how many hours we have to put in, we dont want to feel like we failed because we have never failed. I worked for microsoft azure, i remember sturggling with not doing enough and the thought that i might get fired. It slowly creates a bad work culture where everybody is doing 60 hour weeks. Checking shit at 10 pm, etc. I remember i underperfromed and my manager said i underperformed because my teammates had nmore work to show than me. It's not like i had no work to show, i just wasnt pulling the 60 hours some people wer epulling and i wasn being compared to that. Quitting almost seems like failing. \- We join these jobs for the fame and fortune. You can go through this sub. Some people think making 120k in base pay is laughable pay because the big tech companies pay 200k in base, with 100k extra in RSUs and bonuses. But compared to other jobs 120k is amazing. What i realized when i joined MSFT, i was kind of selling my free time for that money. Companies will throw a ton of money in bonus and RSUs to get people to join. They see that number and think ""OMG that's more than ive ever seen"". \- our jobs are never secure. My GF is in healthcare. Something her and i do is talk about how our respective industries are. She gets shit benefits compeared to me so my job looks amazing. But i tell her that she will forever have a job even if she underperforms, as for me it can go either way. Just because one year is good, the company can have a bad year the following year and now im jobless. Whenever the economy is doing like shit, techies are the first to go due to our high paychecks. \- remote work has made it easier to be on the clock more. Remote work is convenient but now people can get on their laptop at 10 pm to quickly check up on something. Then they see something brkoe and work on it for an extra hour or two. \- since we always have gotten ourselves out of trouble we think that this is just a new challenge we can figure out. But the burnout is real. Many of us go to these companies in our mid 20s when we are still just leanring and being really hopeful but then we realize that we are missing out on things that we really want to enjoy. I work for a different company now and one of my co-workers went to vegas for a weekend. He told me he has a friend that works in big tech that could not go because he had to work in the weekend to catch up on work. That he was afraid because many of these comapnies have put in a system that at year's end they will fire the least productive employees.",Broad-Cranberry-9050,2025-10-06 21:28:09,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1nzuot8,False,

Sometimes it's because father passed away and they need to take care of their mother who is alone in China, etc.Anyways I replied in one of the comments but just so that it's more easily accessible for other high school/college students to see: why do you think people jump off the bridge and all?Some jobs literally kill you. Mental stress is no laughing matter. Just because you never experienced it does not mean it is not real.At the most stressful time, I literally woke up at night and could not even feel my legs let alone move them for a few minutes. And that happened twice. Shits scary as f. Suddenly the world view changes and you care nothing else at all when your legs might stop functioning. Your body actually breaks down from stress itself. You tell me if money is worth losing your legs.People vastly underestimate how scary extreme mental stress is. I know in one of the startup talks one of the founders stated that he had a period of time in which suddenly his eyes stopped working and he had trouble seeing with his left eye from all the stress. And that's when he stopped everything because anymore stress and he would lose his left eye functionality.So yes. People leave stressful jobs all the time. Stressful jobs can legitimately destroy your body. Just because stress is mental does not make it any different. Human body will legit break down after a longer period of extreme stress.When you are a college student and never actually worked these stressful jobs all you see is numbers. You have this delusional belief it's high pay or basically homeless (wtf?). That's not how reality works.You only live your life once. Don't waste your life chasing solely money. Money is important to function in life but once you are in comfortable means of being able to provide yourself, food/healthcare/shelter/etc, then other things take priority. It's great if your job pays a lot and you enjoy it and all but that's not the case for everyone. For others, the high paying jobs are legitimately destroying their happiness.

nhrshfk,"Not a CS PhD, but I did elect to leave academia for an industry SWE position after a year as a postdoc, much to my old advisor's disappointment. Like you, I was burned out and had gotten tired of the publish-or-perish race, even though I'd been told that if I were to stick it out a while longer, I'd have a really great shot at a TT position. There were some other factors for me that you likely do not have to deal with, but I don't regret pivoting to industry. To directly address some of your concerns:* On flexibility: * Yes, most industry jobs will afford you much less flexibility in how you schedule your daily life. However, industry also pays you a fuck ton more money so that you can actually enjoy your time off. I don't know about your finances, but when I was in academia, I basically didn't take regular vacations; my ""vacations"" were always tacked onto conferences and involved me blowing off one day of talks and/or staying a day longer before flying back. * It is also much easier to change jobs in industry, which affords its own flexibility; I know people keep moaning about the industry job market, but it's still way easier to jump jobs than to jump institutions if you happen to hate where you're forced to live. TT positions are not a dime a dozen, and you may need to take what you can get; if you don't like the location, then you're likely gonna be shit out of luck for at least a few years. (This is assuming you don't have to do the postdoc hazing ritual that involves moving every 1-3 years.) * WLB in industry is much better than in academia, and at the end of the work day, you can disengage from the work. Even if you're on-call, you don't really need to waste brainpower on it. In some ways, I feel that while I have lost some flexibility during the weekdays, my time off is much more my own. Being able to spend time guilt-free on my hobbies has improved both my physical mental well-being tremendously, which itself feels like freedom; I honestly didn't even really know how unhappy I was in academia until I left. * At $400k-500k, a high savings rate, a smart investment strategy, you will have the option to retire in less than a decade, which would afford you the maximum flexibility.* On being able to work on what you're interested in: * I won't lie. Some of the work can be **very dull**. However, as you get promoted, you'll hopefully find yourself in a position where you'll be addressing larger business questions and architecting solutions, which I have found to be relatively engaging. I mean, I don't really *care* about the subject deep-down, but I also can't say it's boring. * With a CS PhD and a specialty in a hot field, you can keep applying to jobs and try to pivot to a research-focused industry position, which may be more up your alley.* On teaching and mentoring: * Not gonna lie. I really miss teaching. Mentoring new hires doesn't scratch the same itch. With your degree, you do have the option to pick up an adjuncting gig, and I've considered it, but I'd feel bad about taking a job away from some poor sucker who actually needs it. I've thought about going back into teaching once I have enough FU money. But another option might be teaching or tutoring folks for free at local libraries if you've a mind to do it and don't mind teaching basics.I have many friends and a sibling who have remained in academia in TT or postdoctoral positions. I chat with them regularly. Academia does have its pros, but having spoken with them, I don't think I would've been happy even at a TT position.

Think about it you can be the engineer who gets good reviews from other Jrs. Or the engineer who gets good reviews from Jrs and Srs/Principals. Guess who is getting the promotion if they only have enough for 1 more person\- Find out the go to people and ask them questions. Your first few months should be figuring otu the right teams to ask questions, maybe you have a mentor who helps you find those people. Once you figure it out, cut the umbilical cord yourself and just go to those teams and ask those questions. Dont go striaght to the mentor anymore so he/she can baby sit you.\- Take as much shitty tasks as you can. If a principal is working on somethign that sounds cool, ask him for even small tasks about it. Let him know that if there is anything you can do even if it's small and tedious youll do it. You want to dip your toes in everything you can.\- Make sure you are known by other people on other teams. One of the biggest things managers appreciate is hearing someone's name in another team that has nothing to do with you. because it says you have become a go to person for your own team. If upper management keeps hearing your name from other teams or how they went to you and you helped, that goes a long way. Basically the key is making sure your name is always mentioned when your boss has meetings with his bosses.\- Be good at getting yourself unstuck from situations. The biggest issue Jrs have is they get stuck and just sit at their desk for 2 days and say nothing. Dont fall in that trap, you get stuck, give yourself an hour to figure it out and if you still dont have it ask even a small question. In stand up, bring it up from the start and expalin it well.\- If you work on something learn it back and forth. You can become an unoffical SME of your part of the codebase. The larger the section you master the more irreplaceable you become.\- Make up your own work if you have to. Find something in the code that could use refactoring but nobody had time to do it. Suggest it to your manager like ""hey i saw this in the code and i felt it could use a bit of refactoring, mind if i work on that on the side?"".\-Dont just get good at coding, get good at leading meetings. This is probably one of the bigger ones. Because JRs tend to be in the background and wait to be told what to do. if you want to move up quickly, start making meetings and presentations to display to your teammates. One advice i got was, if you complete something ask for 10 minutes post-standup to display it to the team.

These people are usually talking out of their ass and have not lived in multiple countries. Generally health care in U.S. is through the employer and most corporate a jobs have reasonably good health insurance and often better many ways in Europe i.e. specialist visits and the like. What America's problem is the the quality of health insurance is entirely a function of where you work and what plans they offer and generally poorer people do not have access to high quality health insurance either due to it beign cross probhibitive and for small businesses they may not offer it (for example a small restauarnt does not have to offer health insurance to their workers if they employ fewer than 50 people). What you will find in America is if you are in teh top 1/3rd you are substantially better off than anywhere in Europe or Canada, and if your in the bottom 1/3rd you are substantially worse off. The middle 1/3rd is ???. Software engineering is one of thsoe occupations where you are generally in the top 10 percent.4.

However, I can say that today, every Salesforce developer I know has no problem getting a job, even in this shitty job market. When Google lays off 1,000 people from their engineering teams, 998 of them are software engineers and 2 of them are salesforce developers. You're competing with the 2, not the 998 that everyone else is competing with. Those 998 do not want to go anywhere near Salesforce, they see it as a downgrade that is below them.Additionally, the Salesforce development talent in India / overseas is notoriously horrible and you'll interview literally 100 people before you find one that isn't a net negative for your business, so there's not much overseas happening (also, Sales people want to talk to onshore, english-speaking Salesforce developers, they don't want to be talking to Indian developers at 2am). AI models are really mediocre with Salesforce concepts because Salesforce codebases are very rarely public and are not often represented in training data, so AI is not a big job risk either. Salesforce themselves can't even produce good AI tools for their own product. But again, nobody knows, that's the reality.

ni39dcx,I can give you rough numbers for the legacy big tech company I work for.In the last couple of years when we post a new college grad position these are the numbers I've been seeing:* **Applicants in the first ~24 hours**: 2K - 3K (at which point we close the application* **Automated Filtering**: We automatically filter those down to 100 applicants (by excluding anyone who isn't a US citizen and then filtering based on keywords/degree* **Phone Screens**: 20. Managers will manually review the 100 applicants down to 20 they are interesting in doing phone screens with. The phone screens are ~15 minute conversations where the manager asks some very basic questions.* **Interview Stage**: 4 - 6. Managers will conduct phone screens with the 20 applicants and from that pick around 5 +/- a one or two that they want to interview* **Interview Rounds**: In my group we usually do two rounds of interviews. First one is typically remote unless the applicant lives nearby but the second one is always mandatory in person. Each round is pretty similar but with different groups of engineers. The managers will sit in and watch but let the engineers do all the actual interviewing. The actual interviews are about 30% behavioral/personality and 70% coding checks. The coding checks are pretty simple. Nothing from leetcode. Just basic programming questions or prompts to write simple functions. We are mostly just looking to see if you actually know how to code and didn't cheat your way through college. The questions barely get harder than fizz-buzz level and yet still like 50% of the applicants fail massively at this stage.So if we use 2K as the total number of applicants. Then ~5% of resumes are actually looked at by a person. ~1% make it to phone screens. ~0.25% make it to interview stage.

nhng5op,"The portal application black hole is real for these traditional companies because they're often using ancient ATS systems that filter out anyone without exact keyword matches.Your best bet is bypassing those portals entirely and going direct. For banks and insurance companies, look up their local branches or regional offices and find the IT managers on LinkedIn - they're usually more responsive than corporate recruiters. Credit unions are actually goldmines for this stuff, way less bureaucratic than big banks and they're always looking for people who can modernize their systems. Manufacturing companies are another sleeper hit, especially if you can stomach learning some legacy systems - places like John Deere, Caterpillar, even local manufacturing firms need people who can bridge the gap between old school operations and modern tech. The key is positioning yourself as someone who can work with existing infrastructure rather than someone who wants to tear it all down and rebuild it. Also don't sleep on government contractors - they move slow but once you're in the ecosystem it's pretty stable. For getting past the portals, try reaching out to people with titles like ""IT Manager"" or ""Systems Administrator"" at these companies, they're usually buried in work and would love to have someone competent join their team.

nhnxffy,If you can launch a project that makes some $ or gets a lot of users that can give you an edge.I got 5 interviews in the last 6 months at really cool companies just off of cold applications where I mentioned my project / traction in the cover letter section. My [project](http://grepjob.com) is a job board for software engineers and even though it barely makes any $ it still helps me stand outI am yet to get an offer though so I can't help you with that I'm afraid,illicity_,2025-10-04 03:59:41,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1nxb2gf,False,
nhmfhpe,"Can be anything, but it must be something other people are actually using. A simple thing with hundreds of GitHub stars beats a “complex” project that nobody uses.If after 200 applications you don’t even get interviews then the project won’t make a difference unless you go viral or semi-viral. Your goal with the project should be to “network” that is for some recruiter to look at it and see you are also looking for a job and thereby give you a chance.",FailedGradAdmissions,2025-10-03 22:06:38,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1nxb2gf,False,
nhod5ut,"Seems like nobody is giving you a straight answer.I used to contribute to an open source project where they built a hospital management software for underdeveloped countries, like those in Africa. I helped writing tests and fixing front end bugs for that project, which I talked about in my internship interview. I think the interviewer really enjoyed it.Regarding your question, I think any projects should be fine, but it should show a depth of understanding of how software dev works in tech companies. For example, let's say you will build an Amazon clone. Some basic functions will be the front page, inventory page, how you do filtering, sorting, etc. How do you build login page for users, authentication, etc.With the help of AI I think you can do that under an hour, but here's the thing: You have to understand what's your code is doing, because people will drill you about that in your interview. Now you can do all of that through a public repo, where you can create pull requests, write tests, setup CI to run tests if possible, and deploy them to a public site where others can see it.I guarantee if you can do that, the chance of getting an interview is significantly higher",coder9795,2025-10-04 06:17:23,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1nxb2gf,False,
nhqb7kw,"I’m a junior and got a job recently without a degree, so I want to share my 2 centsTo be honest, I don’t think many people care about projects nowadays. I think when I was interviewing for the job I had now, they did briefly ask me to talk about it. But it was much later on, early into it I was mainly being tested on ability (lots and lots of tech interviews and a take home)Don’t pick a project to impress recruiters. Help yourself out and pick a project that’ll help you improve. The more it grows the better, because that’ll help prepare you for when you do get a job and have to learn a gigantic codebaseBut focus on improving for now",ProfessionalRock7903,2025-10-04 15:18:12,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1nxb2gf,False,

nh6xinl,">He asked me, what do you wanna work with ""IT customer service or programming"". I said both are something I love. I don't mind working with both roles but I am always open for programming because I wanna grow in that field but customer service is also part of my retail job I enjoyed while working so to me combining them is great and I open for any role. He said we are not looking for programmers, we want IT customer service but I will write your name down and get back to you as soon as we need programmers. No way of knowing for sure why they passed, it might be something totally unrelated, maybe you were giving off bad vibes, but here it sounds fairly straightforward: the job was IT customer service, and you said you wanted to do programming. You also seem to have given off mixed messages: ""I don't know what I want to do, except I sort of do, but I also don't really care.""What you do instead: you figure out what the recruiter wants to hear, and match that unless it's a complete lie or dealbreaker. If the recruiter wants someone to do customer service, and you're open to whatever, then you tell them you also want to do customer service listing XYZ reasons. If you have a slight preference for programming but are OK with customer service, you tell them you want to do customer service, with the understanding that that's what you're signing up for. If you don't really want to do customer service but will do it if you have to, you still tell them you want to do customer service, leaving out the ""because I have to"" part. If you absolutely don't want to do customer service, then the role wasn't a fit anyway.Based on this post it sounds like you might have missed some signs that the recruiter wanted to hear customer service stuff, and you could probably have pushed for more details on the job, if only to stall for time.",motherthrowee,2025-10-01 14:32:35,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1nv9a7h,False,
nh6vcrg,"Next time, politely open with “Thanks for calling—could you remind me which role/company this is?”, pick ONE lane for a 20-second pitch (e.g., IT support) with 2–3 quick examples, and keep a simple spreadsheet/notes app of applications so you’re never caught off-guard again.",CourseTechy_Grabber,2025-10-01 14:21:54,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1nv9a7h,False,
nh7smql,"It's extremely likely that they weren't calling about anything you applied for. I'd say it's more likely that they found you via a keyword search hit and cold-called you. Just to hit their numbers. Otherwise they wouldn't have led with ""I loved your profile"" and they would have talked about a specific job title/description.",alinroc,2025-10-01 17:04:07,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1nv9a7h,False,
nh7vgwc,"They never clarified who they were calling on behalf of....? Or even their name/title? They just opened that phone call with ""I love your background!""? That's pretty strange.I don't recall *ever* being unexpectedly called by someone representing a company I actually applied to. When I've applied to companies, the initial outreach is always an email from an HR person asking to setup a call with me. Just calling me out of the blue would be crazy.The only unsolicited calls I've ever gotten are from random 3rd party recruiters that are spray & praying phone calls in the hopes that someone bites. Same as they do with emails. I don't bother with 3rd party recruiters at all, I don't answer phone numbers I don't know, unless they're calling specifically around the time I already have a scheduled interview at.So that's who I would assume you were talking to. A 3rd party recruiter that didn't have a single specific job they were calling you about, or that you had applied to. You didn't miss out on getting hired, you just missed out on getting picked up by a 3rd party recruiter.But to directly answer your question, it wouldn't be unusual or rude at all to immediately ask: ""Hi! Thanks for reaching out. I don't recall having a call scheduled for right now, could you remind me who you are?"".As for a mistake... I don't think you made a mistake per se. You were just honest about your preference for programming over IT customer service, even though you said ""both"" your preference was still clear. The recruiter probably didn't want to try to jam you into a role that wasn't your intended career path.",SouredRamen,2025-10-01 17:17:35,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1nv9a7h,False,
nh77mpx,"Yeah he said IT something, I don't remember exactly. I have applied to many IT jobs that said that they want someone that is great with tech and customer service and I have searched some that is more of customer service and some more towards tech. I think many people use the term IT so randomly it can mean anything at this point. I really couldn't tell which this was until he spelled it out at the end. I wanted to say what he wanted to hear but he wasn't really straighforward with his question but I think I should have picked up on it when he mentioned my retail job that it is IT customer service.I do think I gave bad vibes because I think it is due to the fact that I have never recieved any answers so when he called about a job I didn't know what to think and I was like ""uuuhhh"" and stuttered and I knew right then I fked it up. I do appreciate your comment and will keep it mind for next time.",What_eiva,2025-10-01 15:21:50,1,cscareerquestions,t1_nh6xinl,True,
