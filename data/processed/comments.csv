It says that everything in the table should be about the *whole* key, not just a piece of it.* **Rule:** Be in 1NF and have no partial dependencies. This means that all the information in a row must depend on the entire primary key.* **Example:** Imagine a table for pizza orders. The key is the `Customer` and the `Pizza Type`.**Messy (Not 2NF):** | Customer | Pizza Type | Customer's Favorite Topping | | :------- | :--------- | :-------------------------- | | Sam | Pepperoni | Olives | | Mia | Cheese | Pineapple | | Sam | Veggie | Olives |The problem here is that the ""Favorite Topping"" is only about the `Customer`, not what kind of pizza they ordered that day. To fix this, we can split the table into two:**Organized (2NF):****Orders Table:** | Customer | Pizza Type | | :------- | :--------- | | Sam | Pepperoni | | Mia | Cheese | | Sam | Veggie |**Customers Table:** | Customer | Favorite Topping | | :------- | :--------------- | | Sam | Olives | | Mia | Pineapple |Now, the ""Favorite Topping"" is in a table all about the customers.### **Third Normal Form (3NF): No Secret Information Hiding**This is about making sure that the information in your table is only about the main topic (the key) and not about other things in the same table.* **Rule:** Be in 2NF and have no transitive dependencies (in other words, each cell on the row should *only* depend on the key, not on other cells)* **Example:** Let's look at a table about your favorite Disney characters. We'll throw in their first movie appearance for good measure.**Messy (Not 3NF):** | Character | Movie | Movie's Director | | :---------------- | :------------------ | :--------------- | | Buzz Lightyear | Toy Story | John Lasseter | | Woody | Toy Story | John Lasseter | | Elsa | Frozen | Chris Buck |Here, the ""Movie's Director"" is really about the `Movie`, not the `Character`.

E.g. you have the patient name, age, gender, etc. The doctor's age, name, gender, specialty, license number, job title, etc. You could store all this data in one table, but it's not very efficient and it may end up causing issues later. Imagine what that table looks like, every time person A sees a doctor, you're writing to the database all the data about Person A, their name, their age, their gender etc. so if person A has 100 encounters, you're storing their gender 100 times. Same with the doctor. Every time the doctor sees a patient, if you store all the data about the doctor, you're storing their name every time. In addition to being very inefficient from a space perspective, it's harder to modify data later. Let's assume the doctor changes their name. Now you have to go back and update the doctor's name at every instance it was recorded in the database. Instead if you normalize the data, you have one record in a patient table to represent a patient, and one record in a doctor table to represent the doctor.

For 2NF, consider what would happen if you don't 'select distinct' (and how performance is worse if you do). For 3NF, consider how it would be difficult to understand the relationship between the PK and the transitive dependency. If you looked at the data of a table with a transitive dependency (TD), you wouldn't necessarily be able to understand how the TD column relates to the rest of the columns.

If you kept that information in one table you'd have to update every single order that customer entered. Now imagine you stored user data in other tables. You'd have to change multiple rows of multiple tables. What if another dev made a take that stored user data like that that you didn't know about?

Do spend the time to learn git though. That is life changing. And always keep an eye out for what best practices are in any given situation, but balance it with real world pragmatism.

However, you still need to lead in some way.In practice, all senior/lead engineers (even non-managers) must do two things:1. **Mentor** – If you’re highly technical, people will naturally come to you for help. You need to guide them effectively so the team isn’t overly dependent on you. otherwise you become a liability, not an asset.2. **Drive Technical Improvements** – Being “senior” isn’t just about doing tasks. Anyone can “just do the work,” even outsourced labor. What sets you apart is exploring new technologies and processes, then implementing those that bring value. This continuous improvement is what justifies senior/lead pay over time.You might reach a lower-tier senior role without these skills, but it’s rare and you won’t progress further (lead/principal) without them.The one real exception: niche legacy tech experts.

Hadoop/Spark/Hive experience is still okay, but it’s much more “legacy enterprise” skillset. If you want options in NA or EU in a few years, cloud-native experience will open way more doors.2. **Customer-facing product experience:** Working on something that thousands of companies actually use is huge. It shows you can handle scale, real-time systems, and impact—stuff recruiters notice. Internal ETL for business ops at a big company looks nice on a resume but doesn’t scream “can build product-grade systems.”3. **Fast-paced, growth environment:** Yes, it’s stressful and work-life balance might suck a bit, but that’s exactly where you learn the most. You’ll get exposure to data validation, lineage tracking, fraud detection pipelines—these are highly in-demand skills.4. **International opportunities:** The tech stack + product experience will make moving abroad far easier than internal enterprise ops work. People hiring in NA or EU will instantly recognize those skills.If you want a chill ride and don’t care about moving internationally or building the “modern data engineer” skillset, A is fine. But for leveling up, B is the one that actually sets you up for the future.Basically: stress now → way more options later.

nfyipp7,"I've been designing DW solutions for 30 years. Up until recently, surrogate keys were always defined as int or bigint and to generate them you used a sequential number generator or similar. This meant a couple things. You almost always had to process your dimension before facts (because the dimension table contained the mapping of the business keys to the dw surrogate key assigned). When processing fact tables, for every fk, you would need to lookup the associated surrogate key in the corresponding dimension table. In the old days when we were all using OLTP based database systems like Oracle and SQL Server (on-prem because that is all we had), using integer based surrogates added in performance at query time). Later Dan L came up with Data Vault methodolgy. That is a very different way of modelling with one of the often listed benefits of being able to process in parallel entities that would be come dimensions from those that were facts. To do this, he used hashing (of some sort) so that you didn't necessarily have to process data in a certain order (apologies if I have some of this wrong....I only worked on 1 DV project 14 years ago). The other thing which occurred was columnar database solutions, the cloud and elastic and ultra scalable dbms solutions like Snowflake (and before that Terradata and Netezza). These systems reduce/eliminate the need to worry about defining surrogate keys as integers and using a hash methodology works fine so hence, you now see many practitioners use a fixed length deterministic hash column as the surrogate.BTW: one of the lesser known reasons for using a surrogate (based on a sequential number generator) was that you build in some isolation from the source system. While not common, systems of record have been known to change the key of a source record (probably seldom happens now) so using a surrogate key meant that it was possible to only need to change the relationship of the dimensional business key to the existing surrogate (no need to update the FK in all related fact tables where it occurred. By using a hash, that won't work anymore since the source key fields which might change, will result in a different hash. But since these new systems are so much faster, probably not a big deal (I don't recall ever running into that situation but I recall Ralph Kimball mentioning this in one of his books...I think)apologies for rambling on.",GreyHairedDWGuy,2025-09-24 15:01:52,6,dataengineering,t3_1np45xe,False,

This allows parallel processing that isn't dependent on load order (warning: it can also lead to including a foreign key that doesn't actually exist)* Prevent having to do multi-column joins. For example when you have to do a diff or merge for incremental load, you can join on the hash key. * Records from the same source data will have the same key in all environments.

nfyonvl,"Op here. Summarizing based on what I read here and other sources. Please add or correct. Advantages of using hash function to generate a surrogate key over creating surrogate key from sequence 1. During table load into distributed system, generating sequence could become a bottleneck where as if we use hash function based on business keys, they could be loaded independently parallel much faster. 2. Anonymization: Hashing protects sensitive data by creating a oneway, non reversible key. By using hash keys, you ensure that the vast majority of your data warehouse users—who are simply analyzing metrics—can't even see the sensitive data because it's not present in the tables they access. Usually dimensional tables hold sensitive info like ssn, credit card etc. 3. Efficiency while doing data lookups and data integration. Use of hash keyed surrogates avoid the need for what they call pre-join. Using a sequential key requires a lookup against the dimension table to find the correct key for a given business key. But if we are using hashed surrogates, we can derive this directly from the business keys and avoid pre-join. I think what they mean is an application querying with business keys does not need to go to the dimension tables first to find the sequence number foreign key and then use that to fetch fact table details. Instead, the application querying can directly generate a hash from the business keys that the user entered and query the fact table directly. 4. If data is sourced from different source systems, the hashed key approach ensures the same key will be generated for say the same customer whereas if we use sequence, that will end up creating multiple records for the same customer causing data integrity issues.",tinkerjreddit,2025-09-24 15:30:39,1,dataengineering,t3_1np45xe,True,

I know at one point this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for.One thing I'd suggest is trying to avoid a fixed requirement on docker containers or having a sprawl of dozens of individual components needing to run in tandem again for the smaller places/one man bands. They might not have capabilities to run Docker (IT blocking etc) and if the alternative is 15+ individual components all needing to be run at once then it'll be overwhelming.Your package avoids this currently so definitely worth sticking to that in my view. Outside of that some way to choose the destination DB engine would be good, Postgres is great and all but again smaller teams/OMBs might not get a choice and might be required to use MSSQL server or Oracle, or even just have a section within a larger warehouse like Teradata/Snowflake/Databricks that they get to use for operations.

nfye951,+1 on this from experience. Current company started with the direct pipelines but had to hire someone (me) to fix it all. I started evangelizing Snowflake as the “single source of truth” which helped with adoption. Now we have a dedicated snowflake schema for each external integration so permissions are handled at the schema level rather than table level and all I have to do is create secure views when they request more. Another benefit that I have seen is that when you share via snowflake you tend to have more data that can augment the raw platform data.

There are two main challenges in migrating it to modern systems:* First - modern systems do not speak the language of structured datasets - so you will have to break it down into two parts - ingestion and transformation, and* Second - that typically there are a ton of infa mappings that companies have created over a period of time that becomes a pain to catalog and go through one by one - so bulk migration almost seems like the only way out.Thankfully there is a system that is fully capable of taking on Informatica mapping style pipelines - it is called tabsdata and is an on-prem system that you can run on bare metal or on k8s clusters on the cloud. Bottom line you own it and and run it. This system offers the pub/sub for tables model for ETL. Here is how you use it to migrate infa pipelines:* Step 1: for every input port in the infa pipeline, you create a publisher that reads the input table and creates a tabs data table.* Step 2: for every transform in the infa mapping, you can create a transformer in tabsdata that will take one or more tables within tabsdata and do your join/aggregate/filter etc.* Step 3: once you have created the curated dataset, you add subscribers to it so that they can be loaded into the target platform.While this sounds like more work than one-to-one migration of infa mappings, you will be surprised at the ease and reusability that this approach produces and that itself could cut the pipeline complexity and count significantly.

Iceberg has more functionalities that enable you to write efficient tables and queries to access their data: z-order, bloom filters (supported to some extent in hive table format) and hidden partitions are a few of them, but now that I think about it not a lot of people used them to get the most out of the hardware. You can achieve great results while optimizing large tables if you use them in the right way (good sorting to improve compression, adding bloom filters for columns often used in equi-wheres, use the right type of merge (CoW/MoR) depending on how the data lands in the table and is queried, etc)I would prefer iceberg because of the extra functionalities to manipulate data, but without snapshots or at least a very simplified version of it.",crorella,2025-09-26 22:57:41,3,dataengineering,t3_1nqu1v9,False,

ng30dme,"Using iceberg snapshots as a means to perform data trending is not a good choice, in my opinion. I'd approach this from two perspectives: technical and practical/human. Technical: having snapshots that go a considerable time back will lead you to using up a lot of storage (well, that really depends on the table specifications - number of rows, columns, data types etc.). Sometimes even having snapshots up to 2 weeks back may be too much. Every snapshot will have data files associated to it and I expect that running this query to do trending with snapshotted data will be quite slow after awhile. Eventually you will have to expire your old snapshots to optimize the table and you will lose data useful for trending.Practical/human: writing a query that does trending will be quite messy. You do not want to do trending on data that is ""hidden"" inside some snapshots that do not show up in the simple SELECT *. At the end of th day you should write queries that are simple to communicate to the business and could easily be taken over by other team members if needed.

I condone the idea of 'vibe' coding ie copy/pasting what you see and not digesting (reading what the AI spit out doesnt count). But I do recommend asking thoughtful questions that are small queries to AI (how to do print statement, why is ('hello' + d) not working etc...). And when you get the response back, think about why it is telling you the error is happening. So if ('I said hello' + 10 + 'times') threw an error then the AI might respond you cant add a str to an int. Now think about why that is ie you are adding two incompatible data types (string, int) which should lead you to asking what kind of data types are there and why data formatting is important etc...Work on the proof of concepts, small building blocks first.

If you want to be a REAL engineer, then that usually means gaining certifications from accredited organizations and/or governments. Think about it this way: A software engineer is, ideally, the type of person that creates software systems for things like nuclear power plants, utilitiy companies, hospitals etc.I look at it as you're working on aserious infrastructure projects and your code cannot break under any circumstances because the consequences could be catastrophic, costing people lives and stuff It always needs a failsafe if bad things happen.

Not saying you 100% have to like all these things, but if you are lacking, you better do them like you love them. Here’s what you need to do, even if you don’t like it.Leetcode is a terrible assessment of ability, but I do believe you could get up to speed in about a month of regular study, at least enough for interviews. Go to neetcode, learn the algorithms first for the section you are about to try, then go do them. 30 mins is your max timer, if you get there, look up the answer, and move on. At the end of your session go back and do the ones you missed. It took me about 2 weeks to get up to speed. Pick a language, and “master it”. What I mean by this is find a language you actually enjoy, who cares if it’s the most practical. Learn the basics, tips and tricks, become familiar with the standard library, build a pair with it, connect to a database with it, etc etc. roadmaps.sh is a good resource for what order to learn things. Being very capable in one language does help as you are aware of what is possible, then you can go translate it into another language. You like frontend? Pick 3 popular websites, and remake them. For each use a different frontend stack if you don’t know what you like. I’ll choose them for you, tailwindcss with svelte, bulma with React, and plain CSS with vanilla JS. Don’t stop until you have a working homepage and links. Add to GitHub and repeat. Obviously go expand on this as you go but these are starting points. Along the way take the time to explore and learn. Since it seems you’re still in school, get a tutor, join clubs, make friends to program with, go to hackathons, go to game jams, job fairs, etc etc. If you really want to do this, write down a plan that would make it seem silly if you didn’t make it and then go execute.

nfkx4oe,"What the other commenter said. ""Efficiency"" like you describe is what managers see to juggle scrum points and velocity. It's a useless metric for actually working on code.Imagine programming as a gigantic space of possibilities. You're searching for positions (programs) in that space that fulfil certain functional (the thing the program should do) and usually some non-functional requirements (memory/time constraints, being readable and maintainable). There's not one solution but many, but they are far out (as far as lines you need to write to get there). Each line you write gets you closer to some solutions and farther from others.Unless you have decades of experience and the program is quite small, it's usually not possible to just ""see"" a good solution and write it down in one go. You need to iterate on it, write parts of it you know will likely be part of a good solution. And even identifying those is lots of experience. Often you'll have to rewrite parts to make it work.The first running prototype is usually garbage because it shows the meandering path you took to get there. Restructuring and cleaning up your solution is still expected when you work on large programs, so that the overall commit history doesn't look like a rabbit on acid typed it. This is something that is discussed in professional settings as well. If coders think refactorings are necessary, who will pay for them? Some teams just silently do them as part of other tasks, others try to communicate the need to higher ups.> I've tried the Algorithmic thinking tip from the FAQ to help me plan the processes, but I don't notice classes and objects immediatelyThat part of the FAQ is not for planning programs. It's for translating doing something into a series of steps that a complete moron (i.e. a computer) can follow and not missing anything in the process. It won't help you with planning ahead.

nfdwzo3,"There's a concept called the Entity Component System model, or ECS which solves this issue in a way that also makes writing high performance code much easier. The idea is that instead of having discrete classes for different kinds of creatures, items, or other game entities with all sorts of complex logic attached to them, you create simple data structure called an entity. An entity is usually nothing more than some kind of ID value, like an integer, UUID, or even a string. You then ""attach"" additional small components to that entity which give it additional properties. It's these components that hold the data that would have been held in the class. So the `hasHealth` component would hold maybe 2 numbers, max health and current health. All of the logic for the various components is handled by a set of ""system"" classes. Their job is to handle the logic associated with the various components. For example, the health system would handle adding or removing health on entities with a health component.Typically the way ECS are written let you query the world for entities with specific components (or the components of an entity and such), or sometimes more complex conditions like ""has components x y and z, but not a"". This query then will find the components that match and produce a list of entries which can then be processed by the system.This is probably complete overkill for what you're doing, but it's becoming a very popular way to write games. It gets rid of the awkward problems that come from a more object oriented approach, and completely strips all dependencies between components and entities. This allows you to build up unique entities simply by combining different discrete components. Of course, for unique interactions you would occasionally still need to make 1-off components, but a *lot* can be done with only a small collection of basic components when you can freely mix and match everything, and implementing new kind of entities is often just a matter of figuring out what components they need.This roguelike tutorial in Rust does a great job of explaining/teaching how you might use an ECS in a roguelike game: https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/chapter_2.htmlRoguebasin has a very basic Python implementation of an ECS: https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Entity_Component_SystemThere's a ton more information on ECS out there, this was just meant to give you a very very rough idea of the overall concept. There are quite a few ECS libraries out there in a whole ton of languages, but it's not that difficult to write your own either (at least as long as your not trying to squeeze every bit of performance out of it).Here are a couple blog posts that explain ECS and implement one:C++ - https://www.codingwiththomas.com/blog/an-entity-component-system-from-scratchC++ - https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/C# - https://matthall.codes/blog/ecs/Here's an ECS FAQ: https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq?tab=readme-ov-file",Bobbias,2025-09-21 08:23:15,27,learnprogramming,t3_1nml899,False,

nfwp5bz,"A few that I have enjoyed:Human Resource Machine - simple block/visual programming, enough to grasp some of the concepts of how things work. Can't remember if it's on Steam, though...Shenzen I/O - Has you build some gadgets - programming is in an Assembly-like language. IMHO good for training problem solving and debugging skills, as well as some logic (AND, OR, etc.).TIS-100 - Somewhat like Shenzen, but more simplistic. Has you program the fictional TIS-100 chip for various purposes. Uses an Assembly-like language.While true: Learn(); - Primarily visual programming, teaches AI and neural networking concepts.Grey Hack - Very nice hacking game where you can build your own exploits and helper programs. Uses its own scripting language, but does teach you problem solving and how to help yourself with code.Then there's the real kicker - try to program simple games in C# yourself while learning. One of my firsts was a simple hangman/wheel of fortune game that I made as a console app. Trying to render simple console stuff and text graphics is a good way to start out learning the fundamentals of graphics programming.Another good start could be making a simple 2D engine for a shoot-em-up, which can teach you how to manipulate graphics, make sprites and move stuff around. My first one back in the day ran inside a C# form using GDI - it was a b\*tch to program, but included a very simple AI, parallax scrolling and some other neat stuff.Back in CS class, I had a semester project (actually two), that consisted of a tile engine running a sort of educational RPG. It was written in C# and ran on the now-dead XNA framework...It's probably the harder way to go about things, but it's something you can do as side projects while learning the basics of C# before moving on to Unity.",Potential_Copy27,2025-09-24 07:03:35,5,learnprogramming,t3_1nol44l,False,

If your URL contained a space, your `os.system` call wouldn't work correctly because URL would be split into two arguments. It'll also need to pop open a command prompt window if you're using pythonw.Stick with one of either `Popen` or `subprocess.run`. Preferably `subprocess.run` with `check=True` so that any errors that occur will get raised into exceptions. Using `Popen` directly is useful if you don't want the function to block while the program is running, so it's useful for opening a program for the user that will stay open for some indeterminate amount of time, like opening a text editor, the calculator, etc. (if this is your intention, do NOT use Popen in a with statement, just call it directly.) `subprocess.run` is probably what you usually want for command line utilities because you'll actually be able to see the results. There is also `subprocess.call` and `subprocess.check_call`, these are okay but the docs describe them as an ""older API"" meant for use by ""existing code,"" so I'd probably just stick to `subprocess.run` for anything new*also, `Popen` and `subprocess.run` will let you pass strings as the first argument like you can with `os.system`. Don't do this, because then you're back to that same problem you get with `os.system`. Stick to passing them sequences like tuples or lists, and don't use them with `shell=True`.If you feel like you have to hit the shell, you probably can work around it. One time I thought I had to hit the shell was for a cross platform way to run the ""default program"" for a file, via `start` on Windows, `open` on Mac, or `xdg-open` on Linux. However, the latter two are actual binaries and not shell commands so they can be opened via `Popen`, while the former has a dedicated Python function, `os.startfile`, so in all cases it is possible to avoid hitting the shell.",tomysshadow,2025-09-26 01:20:56,6,learnprogramming,t3_1nqm9kh,False,

All non-trivial programs that we are making nowadays are essentially algorithms to solve problems for which we (almost never) have a truly complete specification. The ""Algorithms"" in algorithms books are simply smaller problems which have been studied thoroughly, for which complete specifications exist.For example, we know 100% what we mean to say whether a sequence is sorted or not, so it's easy to specify that a sorting algorithm takes a sequence for which that property may or may not be true and produces a sequence for which that property is true. Though even in that problem there are sometimes overlooked edge cases. For example, occasionally the difference between stable sort and unstable sort crops up naturally.

nfzr24t,"Massively simplified analogy: You need to find the email of Professor Dan to beg him to let you into his full class next semester. There are a number of ways you can go about getting that:1. Ask your current CS teacher what Dan's email is. He says ""I don't know, Professor Smith might know though."" So you go ask Professor Smith what his email is and she says ""I don't know, but Professor Stevens might know."" You go ask Professor Stevens and she says ""I don't know, try Professor Jones."" You keep going down the chain, each person telling you to go talk to someone else, until you reach someone who knows what the email is, and who knows how many people you're going to have to talk to and you just don't want to do that.2. So you realize that oh wait, you can just look him up in the staff directory and find the email that belongs to him. You know he's a CS professor so you can just start with the CS directory instead of scanning down from Dr. Aarons in Academic Advising, and you already know the guy's name is Professor Dan so you can just jump to D.That's basically the difference between finding something in a linked list vs. hash table In reality it's a bit more complicated:3. Suppose you go to the staff directory and it's not in alphabetical or department order -- it seems totally random. Also, it's split into 20,000 pages. So you have no idea where Dan is and you're thinking you've got to just work your way down, and you really don't want to do that. But then you see that the directory is maintained by the department weirdo Dr. Bryant. You go ask Dr. Bryant, who tells you almost immediately ""Dan? He's on page 56."" You ask, astonished: ""You just memorized that???"" Dr. Bryant: ""Nah, I just multiplied the letters of DAN, so 4 \* 1 \* 14 is 56.""4. You go to page 56, and sure enough there's Dan's bio and email. Problem solved! But then the next day you have a realization and go back to Dr. Bryant: ""Wait a minute, what if you hire another guy named Dan? Only one of them can be on page 56, your system won't work anymore."" Bryant goes ""Uh..... wait, I know, his employee ID is 4LBA8F, and his ID is unique so I can just use that instead!""5. Satisfied, you leave his office, then 2 minutes later turn around and go back in. ""But that's not gonna work either, what if you have employee 222 and 22B? Or 2BB? What about 6666, 666F, 66FF?"" Dr. Bryant says he needs to think about that.This is also massively simplified and obviously the actual calculations are more complicated, but that's the general idea: since your data is probably not going to be perfectly ordered, you need to come up with a function to map each item to a numerical value, and that value will be the index to the ""bucket"" of memory that data will go into. You don't want that function to come up with different values because that makes things complicated, but unless you have an infinite amount of space, it's impossible to prevent that completely. All you can do is try to limit how often it happens; there's mathematical theory for the best ways to limit that and various implementations for how to handle whatever collisions do happen.""OK, why not make it ordered then?"" You could do that, but then you'll have to continually fix the order every time you insert new data, instead of just crunching a number for where to insert it.

Tye point is that a linked list gets slower the more items you have. So, for that matter, does a binary tree. A hash table takes the same amount of time no matter how many items you have. So if you need to process or look up a few million items, hash tables are hard to beat. Plus, who cares about performance when you’ve only got a few hundred item?

Very sophisticated CPU caches do have the ability to notice that you're chasing pointers (they correlate values previously loaded with the addresses fetched) but that's most helpful if you repeatedly access shallow data structures.There just isn't much that can be done to hide memory latency when the data structure is really deep.If a linked list is the best choice it's probably because you need a LIFO or FIFO queue and search is rare.Other points in favor of linked lists* concurrent LLs (multiple threads will access at the same time) are easier than concurrent hash tables and compete with concurrent ring buffers* The objects you intend to link are members of some other data structure and the LL acts as an alternate way to access them.

Since there are conflicting views of how advanced AI is now and how quickly it can learn and develop much further, I wouldn't stop learning just in case the idea that AI will take over everything in 5 years is wrong.Besides, there is not enough fresh water in most countries for the water needs of AI facilities in addition to supporting humanity. That may slow things down. Since the facilities need more land area but also cool temperatures, why can't they be built at least partially underground to conserve both land and water?Perhaps u could focus on building things that would help build up city services or get things modernized for underdeveloped areas.I understand that everyone wants to make lots of money, but since u have found a full-time job already, u have set yourself on a good path to make a life u want. Maybe your idea for using IT could help u work with non-profits and places that can't pay hundreds of thousands up front, but that u can help because u want to serve the public.

Case in point, my entire cycle has been spent refactoring something that was written in January (I'm guessing with AI tools) that is beginning to break in subtle ways.Though the job has undoubtably changed with these new tools at our disposal, I think there will continue to be software engineers for the foreseeable future. So from that perspective, there's still a value to learning your craft.As for the market, there's nothing I can say but I feel for you- I hope openings for juniors open up again. I think the decision to stop hiring juniors is incredibly short sighted, but it is what it is. Do your best to network and turn non-leads into leads. Listen to whatever career progression framework your bootcamp offers.As for burnout, take a break if you can- try and think about this from a long-term perspective and try and enjoy learning and making things for their own sake.

Hell, when I’ve tried to make a script to teach a topic, I’ve found the code suggestions to be exactly what I was going to write for my tutorial/guide. Amazing! For really basic, cursory stuff. Stuff that you’d find on a blog or YouTube video where you have to assume the viewer knows next to nothing and will stay for 5 minutes.Anything more complicated than that, and AI breaks down. Writes way more code than you need to solve a problem, solves the wrong problem, solves the right problem in the wrong way. It’s important to be concerned about it in the “I should know about this” sense. It’s currently not important to be concerned about it in the “this is going to change my whole career trajectory” sense.At present, AI is really just a better version of intellisense, the automatic code completion. Serves the same function, and that tech has been around for a decade.You can never hurt yourself by having more skills. Stick with it, but I think it’s important to have a source of intrinsic motivation: some project you want to do for you. Maybe that means making a website for one of your hobbies/interests, but being able to be proud to say you built the whole site from scratch. That not only feels good, but it is something you can put on your resume too.It’s probably too soon to think of switching career paths altogether.

Plus W3 schools pretty much had every creative thing covered - so much so that our tutors if they got stuck copied and pasted W3 school code.I kinda burnt out and now restarted with a passion with Python.

nfovzv1,"Repositories are self-contained dependency trees of commits. Every repository has an index or staging area which is where you add the changes that you intend to commit eventually. The staging area acts as a temporary safe space that is not a full commit and to which you can restore your tracked files if for some reason you aren't happy with the latest changes, and the changes saved to the staging area can also be restored. When you make a commit, only the changes tracked in the staging area are used.Commits in a repository are uniquely identified by hashes, which look like long strings of random characters that are in fact generated from all the information that they save. Commits contain the hashes of their immediate ancestors, the differences in the code between them and their immediate ancestors, the names and E-mail addresses of their authors, a timestamp, a message explaining what they change and why so that other people in the future can gain a deeper understanding of why specific changes were made, and optionally a digital signature to reinforce their authenticity. Commits represent snapshots of branch states at specific times.Since commit hashes aren't easy to remember, git provides the ability to tag them with more remarkable names. Tags are often used to record milestones, like the official version of a project at that point, but they can be used for anything you want, and can always have descriptions independent of their respective commit messages.Branches represent distinct and possibly concurrent development paths, and every git repository has at least one conventionally named main these days or master in the past, however branches can have arbitrary names. Branches are simply alternative HEAD pointers, you can create a branch from any commit in the repository, which will result in its HEAD pointing at that commit, and after that every commit you make to that branch will have the original commit of the branch as an ancestor in its history. Branches are typically used to avoid cluttering the main history of the project with irrelevant versioning information related to refactoring, bug fixing, feature development, or even to continue developing old versions of the same project concurrently to the main branch.Remotes provide the ability to name external repositories, and are intended to synchronize with the work done by other developers. Each branch can also track a single branch on a remote repository, which is typically used to synchronize with an upstream source of truth, and doesn't really need to have the same name as the local branch. Pushing to a remote branch attempts to append your changes in a local branch to the remote branch, whereas pulling attempts to append the remote changes of the remote branch to your local branch. If this succeeds then the resulting trivial merge is called a fast forward, otherwise you will be required to resolve the conflicts before the local and remote repositories can be synchronized. The HEAD of a tracked remote branch is pointed at by REMOTE_HEADMerging is a process in which two divergent branches, both local or one local and one remote, are synchronized by a commit that addresses all the conflicts. Since only local branches can be written to, the merge commit is always created locally. After a merge all the concurrent commits are added to the history of the local branch, which can make the commit history rather confusing to understand. A different option to merging is rebasing, where all the divergent changes in one of the branches are added on top of the other branch, but this too can mess up the commit history, because if both branches have been getting concurrent commits, the timestamps in the resulting history where all the commits to one branch are logically applied after all the commits to the other branch will result in a history of commits that are not progressive over time, so git also provides the ability to squash commits, which can be used to coalesce a range of commits.Reverting is the process in which the changes made by one or more commits are applied in reverse to a branch, effectively resulting in those changes being removed from the code. Reverting commits does not alter the commit history of a branch, instead a new revert commit is created specifically to remove the changes, at which point the author of the reverse is given a chance to address any conflicts that might prevent the operation. Switching is a process in which git is instructed to go back to any commit in the repository. If the switch is made to a branch then the local files will be updated to the HEAD commit of the branch, otherwise the switch is considered headless and no commits can be made until a branch is created to track them. Resetting moves the HEAD of a branch to any commit on the repository, which can result in some commits becoming unreachable and eventually garbage collected.Stashing is the concept of committing your changes to a local commit tracker and restoring everything to how it was in the previous commit. Stashes are global and as such are completely independent of branches.Other concepts like pull requests, forks, and releases are specific to GitHub. Pull requests are just regular posts to a repository linking to a branch on your own repository whose changes you would like to get merged with the remote repository. Forks are just other developers cloning your repository under a new repository on their own account. Releases are essentially tags on steroids that you can use to provide ready-to-use builds of your project.Git is also quite versatile when it comes to rewriting history, however this is a fairly advanced subject that I'm not going to touch on here since it requires a good understanding of its fundamental concepts. Rewriting history can sometimes make commits unreachable from any branch, and These commits are kept around for a while but eventually git's garbage collector gets rid of them, however this grace period makes it possible to recover them, so even if you completely mess up a repository it's almost always possible to manually recover everything back during this period.Hopefully this comment covers all the basics with enough detail but without being overwhelming.",Fridux,2025-09-23 00:31:03,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nnyadm,False,

ng7hkna,"It's not really a ""flaw"" in Logisim, it's just that doing a low-level simulation of logic gates is inherently more expensive than a high-level emulation of the same architecture. They're just doing different things.For example: take a look at what a [""full adder""](https://www.electrical4u.com/binary-adder-half-and-full-adder/) logic gate circuit looks like. You need quite a few gates just to add two 1-bit numbers. To add 32-bit numbers, you would need an array of 32 full adders.If you were to simulate this 32-bit adder in software, you would need to iterate over each of those logic gates, fetch its inputs, compute its output, and then pass that output to the next gate(s). Your simulation would need hundreds or thousands of CPU instructions to accurately simulate the behavior of the logic circuit.But if all you care about is the *result* of the addition, you could get that with a single `ADD` instruction that's executed directly by your CPU, which would be hundreds or thousands of times faster.In other words, if you're designing a CPU out of logic gates, and you want to make sure that your hardware design will actually behave the way you expect, then you need to use a slow, expensive simulation at the logic gate level. If you just want to model the *desired* behavior of your CPU, you can just write code that emulates what each CPU instruction is *supposed* to do, and that emulation can be much faster.

ng8rk9d,"I'm glad it was helpful. Just to clarify, I'm not some kind of genius, this is all pretty standard stuff that would be covered in digital logic and computer architecture courses in a typical CS curriculum.To thoroughly answer your questions I would basically have to teach one of those courses, and I'm not going to try to do that. Instead I'll just try to clarify my previous comment a bit.You have to distinguish between the *simulated* CPU (the custom 16-bit design that the Youtuber you linked came up with) and the *real* CPU that is being used to run the simulation.A real CPU is made out of many millions of physical logic gates. All of those logic gates operate simultaneously. But they work together so that the real CPU executes one ""instruction"" at a time. (This is a massive oversimplification, but it's good enough for this discussion.)Let's say that the simulated CPU needs a few hundred logic gates to make a 32-bit adder. If you write a gate-level software simulation on the real CPU, the simulation will have to process each of those logic gates one at a time. So like I said, it will take many hundreds or thousands of real CPU instructions to *simulate* a single addition operation on the simulated CPU. That's what I meant by ""iterate"". The simulator has to go through each logic gate one at a time to compute its result.If instead, you write an emulator that runs on the real CPU, then when it needs to add two numbers, it can execute a single `ADD` instruction. Now, *physically*, that `ADD` instruction is still implemented within the CPU by many logic gates. But because those gates are real physical things, all operating simultaneously, they don't have to be simulated one at a time. They all happen in parallel. So the execution is much faster. (But the physical arrangement of the CPU's logic gates is fixed in hardware. You can't customize it the way you could customize a gate-level simulation that's performed in software.)I'm just using addition as an example, but the same principle applies to other things too. The 16-bit CPU has lots of other control circuitry that decides *what* instruction to execute at any given time. That control circuitry is made up of many logic gates. But the work that is done by a large number of logic gates can alternatively be implemented by a smaller number of CPU instructions on the real physical CPU, doing the same work directly, without simulating the behavior of all the individual gates.> And why does the guy’s actual processor itself get to skip over all of those logic gates that logism can’t?They're not ""skipped over"". But when you take the logic design that was being simulated in Logisim, and build it out of real physical logic gates, then those gates are all operating in parallel. So you don't have to wait for a software simulation to process them one at a time.----If you want to learn more about this topic, I would suggest going through the free self-guided [Nand2Tetris course.](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)",teraflop,2025-09-26 03:01:54,1,learnprogramming,t1_ng8m6x8,False,

ngdhruo,"A lot of people on this sub say to ""Just do projects"" and it's not bad advice, but for people who are very new to coding, it can often be frustrating. The advice I would give to a beginner would be something more like this:1) Have a specific goal of what you want to accomplish by learning programming2) Make sure that what you're doing is moving you towards that goalSo many people skip (1) when they're asking for advice on what to do, but it's super important. Why *specifically* do you want to learn programing? Is it to make video games? Or is it to automate business processes at your accounting firm? Or is it to hack your smart-fridge? Those are all vastly different skill sets, with different paths you'll need to take in your learning. Knowing what you want to do is so so important to making sure you're learning the right things.Once you've figured out (1) step (2) is a lot easier (still hard though!). Usually, step (2) starts with following one comprehensive course on the relevant programming language / framework / environment. Make sure it's a high quality, modern course on the topic. As you go, make sure you're doing exercises, and writing code independently to test that you're following along. **Once you've finished this course, you should have the ""vernacular""** that you're talking about in your post. At that point, you can start building (small) projects.Oftentimes where people get stuck on (2) is that they jump around between too many different tutorials, they don't learn things on their own, or they don't focus on the learning that will actively help them achieve their goals. But doing a single, high quality course is definitely not ""tutorial hell"".People who suggest doing projects are right that the true, deep learning comes after you've taken the training wheels of a course or tutorial off. There's a lot of important and valuable struggle that comes from putting the pieces together yourself. But you really want to go into your first projects with a decent understanding of the fundamentals, otherwise it will be hard to see the forest for the trees.",allium-dev,2025-09-26 21:05:37,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nrbxvb,False,

You get 80% of the benefit from just picking up heavy shit and putting it back down, and 18% of the remaining 20% from doing the easiest optimizations (alternating which muscle groups are worked + watching your calories).The obvious thing everyone can agree on but gets lost in the argument is that it's pointless to focus on your diet, get perfect sleep, and buy the right supplements... but never actually go to the gym.We can (and do!) argue on and on about if it's optimal to build projects, watch presentations from industry professionals, focus on languages versus abstract CS ideas, learn through integration or building from scratch, if you should focus on learning functional and declarative paradigms, philosophies of state management, keeping up with industry standards...... and the advice of ""go *practice*"" gets lost.Go.

Since you have an Arduino, you could start with a simple programme that uses the Arduino to control an LED.Here are some things you can try in order:- Make the LED switch on after a second (a basic ""Hello World"")- Make the LED flash on and off (teaches loops)- Add a push switch to the circuit and have the switch cycle the LED between on and off states every time you push it. (teaches you events)- Use the push switch to turn a flashing LED on and off (combines events with loops)- Add multiple LEDs and build a binary counter from 0 to `n` (teaches `for` loops specifically)- Pushing the button resets the counter.- Add a second button that changes the behaviour of the LED (e.g. switches between flashing and counting; teaches functions/separation of behaviours).Everything you do with the LED, you can do with a servo, relay, transistor, or anything else that can be connected to a circuit.Once you've worked out how to control output with a button, you can think about using different kinds of input, like using a thermistor to react to a temperature change, or an LDR to react to light levels.",marrsd,2025-09-23 10:44:49,4,learnprogramming,t3_1nob8pb,False,

ng2ra7s,"This question is so extremely common nowadays that a simple search through the subreddit would have given you more than plenty answers.When you get an assignment, don't directly start programming. **Plan** before program. Sit down with pencil and paper and work over the assignment. Analyze it, break it down into steps. Solve each of the steps **your** way, don't even think about programming at that stage. Track the steps. Once you have a working solution, test it. Then, when the solution is confirmed, start *implementing* it in code. Ideally, when you've done the breakdown right, the code should come naturally. Use whatever you can think of: bulleted lists, flow charts, pseudo code, anything to write down what the program has to perform.Code is the end, not the beginning. Analysis, breaking down, planning, solving are the beginning. Code comes later.Just *reading* completed code will not help you building the ability to solve problems. Reading code is like looking at a complete car in order to learn to design a new car. You miss everything important: analysis, decisions, considerations, compromises. You might get an understanding of the *immediate* solution, but not the skills to apply this to even slightly different situations.Build your own projects starting from something as small and simple as Tic-Tac-Toe and working your way gradually up to larger and more complex. Yes, this will take time, effort, determination, discipline, and patience, but that's the way to go. Not the easy road to use google, AI or tutorials for everything.Programming is lifelong learning.

So at the implementation level, the current value is all that matters, and the OS doesn't even bother to remember the initial value.The only purpose of the semaphore is to prevent the *current* value of the semaphore from going negative, by blocking when the value would otherwise drop below zero. Aside from that, it's up to the application programmer to decide what the semaphore's value ""means"" and to increment/decrement it correctly.See, for instance, the ""producer-consumer"" example on the Wikipedia page I linked. In that example, you use two semaphores tracking two ""resources"": `fullCount` for the number of items in the queue, and `emptyCount` for the number of available slots in the queue. If the queue is initially empty, then the `fullCount` semaphore is initialized to zero, but its value can later increase when items are added to the queue. It doesn't make sense to limit the semaphore to its initial value, because it would prevent use cases like this.If there is only a single resource being managed then it's up to the application to ensure that it never increments the semaphore above 1.",teraflop,2025-09-26 14:39:50,5,learnprogramming,t3_1nr2mav,False,

It's always been like this and probably always will be, because *ML work is difficult to evaluate from the outside*.* From the POV of someone not deeply familiar with ML, it's hard to distinguish ourselves from people less qualified, who might be liable to commit rookie data leakage/confounding/etc mistakes, and be none the wiser until the model is in production. Without stars and citations, GitHub repos and arXiv papers are laborious to evaluate and are indistinguishable from slop.* Our work inevitably requires some research, which usually doesn't pan out. If a manager makes a bad hire, and they're not competent in ML themselves, they have to wait through a long string of failures in order to decide ""okay this person is incompetent"" and finally fire him.So hiring managers have to be very, very careful. In such murky circumstances, it's rational to resort to costly social signals. Publications in conferences, placements in Kaggle competitions, and of course experience at prestigious companies are reliable signals of competence, only because they are so costly to fake. They'd rather overpay for a highly-qualified candidate (not you or me) than gamble on someone less-credentialed who passed their interview (which they know isn't terribly high-signal to begin with).This is all many times more extreme for researchers, for whom a PhD is mandatory.>But i see people doubling their salaries all with just taking a single course on basic ML....how???This would be news to me.",XTXinverseXTY,2025-09-21 22:02:57,39,cscareerquestions,t3_1nmys4f,False,

nfwk09s,"Some companies have a formal process to graduate engineers to senior and beyond as individual technical contributors. But I feel like many go based mostly on feel and perception. If you feel you are stuck and will have a hard time being thought of as senior by your peers because you can't keep up in architecture and design discussions that might hold you back and force you to job hunt.I agree you should talk to your manager and try to feel out how likely it is you can meet their expectations to stay on assuming you enjoy the work aside from the new hoops they want you to jump through.I saw some others suggested asking more questions to keep improving your skills. Many people are afraid to ask dumb questions too often as it can make you seem too dependent on the other engineers. But these days honestly you can try talking to an AI about technical details. Most software design and architecture is very well understood and the AI can easily walk you through design questions and help you understand any parts that don't make sense so the next time you have a discussion you are more clear about what is happening.Just a month back there was a discussion at work explaining a mesh network setup for one of our products. And my networking is super rusty. An hour conversation with the AI and I was following their mesh design much more clearly and asking their team good questions, not the dumb ones where I was unaware of basics or some lingo. Most designs in software aren't super novel or deviant from knowledge the AI has.The AIs can still lie so I do recommend double checking it's statements if you are going to put your reputation on the line defending a claim it made. But I feel like there has never been a better tool to help drill down on some ""dumb"" questions we all have.I will say I am generally perceived as very good at my job and I love software and design discussions. I am totally not immune to feeling stupid or inadequate. Especially on newer projects. Imposter syndrome creeps up on most people unless you have a godly ego. So it's hard to say how you feel really equals no hope of reaching senior in your current role. Also I don't do side projects. Clearly they are great if you can. But software is just a job and I love my kids more than I love my work. Most people I work with take this stance. I put in extra time to make sure stuff works during crunch time.

nfbftw1,"I've been on both sides of this. I started my career as an 'ambitious overachiever,' burned out hard, and then tried the 'maintain boundaries' approach. Here's what I learned. **As an Ambitious Overachiever:** From my personal experience, going above and beyond only **works if you're able to ""showcase"" your work.** That is, people in the company need to actively **see you as someone who goes ""above and beyond""** in order for it to matter. You should also make sure to **document your achievements and positive feedback** received so you can later present them to management when discussing raises, promotions, and so on. I would also say, though this is also another personal experience thing, that **going above and beyond in every category is both ineffective and leads to burnout.** It's better to **have one project which you own/lead and excel** **at** at a time, and do the ""regular"" amount of work on your other projects. In addition, it is important to build rapport. You don't have to be an extrovert per se, but **people should leave feeling positively after talking with you.** On the downside, **career progression** at any one company inherently **depends on how much room there is for promotion** and the budget of your department. Plus, overperformance makes you advance faster but rarely do you ever skip progression tiers. You may be a truly stellar, outstanding, junior engineer, but you won't get promoted to senior engineer immediately. You'll likely just spend one year less in junior, one year less in mid, and so on. It also only partially protects you from layoffs--**you'll be the last junior engineer laid off**, but if they're **laying off all junior engineers you're still gonna get laid off.**Something I learned the hard way is that no matter how much of a ""go above and beyond"" employee you are, **one period of poor performance**, even if do to extenuating circumstances, **can very quickly destroy your reputation** as an overperformer. If this happens, you should immediately look for a new job unless you really love your current workplace. I also found that **opportunities to truly excel can be difficult to find and sometimes even be gatekept.**It is important to remember that much of **your excellent performance will evaporate** when searching for a new job **unless you're able to show public artifacts** which showcase it. Maybe references can do this too, but you need to tell the new employer to actually contact them. I got laid off without any public artifacts to show off, and it made job searching ***much harder.*****Do great work but maintain boundaries approach:**I took this approach after burning out, though that burnout was partly due to a toxic coworker. I found it to be less stressful and often my outcomes became more consistent, which many employers value more than someone who does overall better work but in an inconsistent fashion. In general, it's only seen as a bad thing at (healthy) companies if it's the kinda role where overtime is inherently expected or a startup. How your work itself is recognized largely depends on your manager and how well they understand it. I'd say your manager's **subjective perception of your work matters far more than the actual work quality.****Advancement** felt like it **depended** more **on the state the economy**. Good economy, relatively normal advancement rate. Bad economy, slower advancement rate and layoffs. **Summary/takeaway:**Brute-force 'tryharding' is rarely worth the investment and often leads to burnout. If there's a project you can take ownership over, do that and make sure to 'show it off' like a salesman. Make sure to have evidence to support your skills for both internal promotions and getting jobs elsewhere. **Be an intelligent, strategic achiever who works to own and lead projects while building the skillset you want, rather than an overachiever for the company you work for.**",Luke_Ghostblade,2025-09-20 21:44:59,56,cscareerquestions,t3_1nm908c,False,

nfbln86,"More is more obviously, unless you're blatantly doing the wrong thing. The question should be more nuanced though- people (especially engineers) LOVE to microoptimize on a single variable when that isn't actually productive because our lives are multifaceted (e.g. either minmaxing saving money, or being a yolo spender). My practical recommendations are 2 things1) oscillate based on priority. Some projects are important, high-vis, high-impact and will leapfrog your career more than the rest of your work combined. Spending a bit more effort here pays dividends. Similarly, if you're close to a promo you care about, it's worth doing a bit extra. Rest of the time, it's okay to just do enough.2) understand the rubric better. Unlike school where assignments are graded 0-100%, work is very ambiguous. Understand who controls your career trajectory (usually your direct manager and maybe skip level), and optimize for success. Find ways to proactively make your manager's job easier, and make your manager look good to their management. This will do the most. One anecdote I've shared a few times: I grinded really hard when I joined this job, manager denied my promo again and again based on random nitpicks from career ladder doc.

It's difficult to tell the difference between early career and experienced commenters, and good advice is often counter intuitive. There are two pieces of bad advice I am constantly trying to correct. First is learning more skills won't lead you to being overworked. People complain about the rising popularity of full stack development. They say they refuse to learn frontend or backend because that will just lead to your employer expecting you to do two jobs. That's not true. Learning more skills will make you more efficient at your job, saving you time. It will also make you more competitive on the job market, meaning it will be easier for you to find a job with good WLB. There's more than enough dedicated frontend or backend work. If an employer is going to overwork you, they're going to do it regardless if you know full stack or not.Second is becoming more senior destroys your WLB. That's again not true. The things that destroy your WLB are getting a senior title before your ready and getting a senior title at a mismanaged company. Some people get thrust into a tech lead role 3 years into their career. These people are usually stressed AF because they don't have the experience to do it effectively, and the fact that they were promoted means the average level of experience is lower then theirs. That means they're going to be even more stressed trying to bail out all of the people on their team, because they also don't have the experience to do their jobs effectively. Don't try to avoid promotions. Avoid premature promotions and take on a senior/tech lead title when you feel comfortable you can do the job in <40 hours per week.",spline_reticulator,2025-09-23 16:14:58,9,cscareerquestions,t3_1nodphs,False,

nffepxg,"For anyone wanting a career in anything, it is very important to highlight your accomplishments for this very reason. Keep conversations up with your manager (ask for skip level 1v1s) to ensure you stay in communication so your manager can continue to gauge how you are doing vs. what your lead is saying. That then allows your manager to know how to work with the lead to make them a better leader as well. It is not being arrogant when you say I’ve worked on this and this and this and these are the outcomes. If you mess up, own it and say I learned my lesson and don’t do Y again. That goes a long way and gains lots of respect, which helps with stability.It doesn’t hurt to put feelers out there for other jobs, but each job has his own crap to deal with. I would evaluate the opportunities you have and get vs. this lead being a pain. This lead may not be here for forever either. If the lead is your only problem, do skip level 1v1s and go from there. Remember, everyone is learning. The lead, yes is being not a great lead, but likely it’s their first time being a leader and trying to figure it out and needs some guidance. Just like you when you first started. Try to highlight the wins with the lead too! Maybe that will get them thinking more positively as well. And maybe the lead is thinking of you as more senior than you are due to the work you are doing. So reminding them how young in your career you are can help.Regarding leaving the field, this is more of a corporate life issue than the field. I deal with this in cybersecurity (got a degree in compsci so why follow) too. You will run into these issues no matter what field you are in. Unfortunately school doesn’t teach you how to traverse corporate life. I say it sounds like you are doing a great job and have a lot of opportunities to grow. Do skip level 1v1s with your manager, communicate what work you are doing and the outcomes with both your lead and manager, and see what happens.

ng5a2pw,"I went to college for math/economics—CS minor—and worked for a FAANG for two years before going to law school and spending the most miserable/depressing year of my life working many 85+ hours a week at a NYC biglaw firm doing mostly M&A. I sprinted away from law to keep my sanity and got lucky enough to group up with 2 friends from work/school to cofound a legal tech startup—no, it's not an LLM wrapper—that, while still early, is showing promise as we start to get demos in a few smaller firms' hands. I'm handling a lot of the software architecting/engineering/review and do a fair amount of QA since I have an (limited) inside perspective of what lawyers like/need. Now, as I approach 30 I feel happier than many of my friends in other fields, especially law/medicine where everyone I know seems absolutely fucking miserable. I typically work about 50 hours a week, have ownership in something I believe in, and still have plenty of time to raid on FF14, play tennis, or read. However, many of the people I know in tech also seem happy, and I caution people in the field against assuming the grass will always be greener on the other side. For example, a lot of the complaints people on this Reddit often echo—annoying/incompetent managers, unreasonable deadlines, leadership with no vision, etc.—are present in virtually every industry; I got lucky with the partners and senior associated I worked under in law, but others at my law firm would routinely get screamed at by partners for minor issues.",saulgitman,2025-09-25 15:50:51,11,cscareerquestions,t3_1nq4pqy,False,

ng10ad7,"I live in LES ( a neighborhood in NYC). 120k sounds good very good entry level and fintech is a good space to be. Almost every major fintech has an office here and its the 2nd largest tech hub. It also is the largeast finance hub. Also NYC the sky is the limit so you can really use this as an oppurtunity to spring board.Its very likely you will be making double to tripple what you are currently making within 5 to 8 years.What life style is like in NYC at that salary? 120k in NYC is around a 6500 month net salary (due to city taxes).1. If you want to live somewhere fun for singles in their 20s, you would need to eitehr pick between living alone, living somewhere nice with roomates. You'd qualify a miximum of 3k a budget rent and at that price you can live alone. But you have to choose between living in a nice apartment in jersey/outer areas or in a pre-war shoe box in the nice trendy neighborhood. Nice in NYC is 'mid' in other cities. Its usually means you have a building with some amenities like laundry room or laundry in unit (rarer) and a dishwasher. NYC is a story of under consturction. Most apartments here are 100 years old (prewar) and lack modern conveniences like laundry, dishwasher and central AC. I picked the shoe box, its more fun to be in a good neighborhood if you like to go out and party.2. A lot of people your age would choose to live with roomates in order to be in a nicer apartment in a good location. Generally apartments are a lot mroe cost effective in a 4 bed 2 bath or 3 bed 1 bath situation. If a studio in an apartment building is renting for 4000$, there is a good chance the 3 bed is only 8000$ and the 4 bed is 10,000$. So a very common strategy for young professionals is to just have roomates to live in a nicer apartment in a fun location.3. You can afford to live alone and somewher nice, but it would generally be in outer neighborhoods that are either gentrifying or in places like jersey city, a part of New Jersey that is connected by Manhattan via a subway called path.The biggest cost in NYC is rent. Almost all of the cost of living is real estate. That effects things like entertainment and other stuff, because bars/coffee shops/ restaurants and gyms are paying even more per sq feet than you are. But outside of that the cost is the same its not like Amazon charges more here when they are deliving goods to you. Groceries can be all over the map, but trader joes generally is cost effective as they use national priceTo give oyu some idea what prices are like. Manhattan (you can take off 20 percent for other areas1. Hair cuts 40 to 75$2. Gym depends on which but 50 to 300$. 125 would be mid-tier3. Fast Casual lunch 15 to 20$4. Street food from a take out only operation 8 to 12$.5. Specialty Coffee from a cafe (6$ - 7$ before tax)6. Dinner at sit down casual restaurant with a waiter 40 to 80$ per person. You can easily spend 150$ per person at more upscale. This is assuming no alcohol.7. Alcohol 6 to 10$ for beer, 10-20$ for wine, 16 to 25$ cocktails. Non-alcoholic options will be offered at most bars. NYC has a BIG drinking culture. Tech community in particular has a lot of happy hour networking and social events that they host through apps like Luma, Posh VIP, Super Momos, Partiful. So even if you don't drink a whole lot, its in your interest to go to bars and get some non-alocholic drinks.8. Ubers 20$ per mile in Manhattan south of 96th street, 10$ per mile in Brooklyn/Queens/Bronx without manhattan entry.The other thing thats nice about NYC, because the city is so expensive you won't have pressure to be extravagent which happens in middle cost of living cities. This is a place where people who make 300k a year might live like college students and no one would bat an eye.TLDR: 120k is a great salary for someone your age in NYC in the fin-tech space. You will ahve enough money to go out quite a bit, save adequately for retirment and you can essentially pick where you want to live. It is a place where you will need to budget some and not be extravagent, but you can enjoy some luxuries. From a career perspective its also great, the only city that is better for Tech is SF and NYC is good at multiple industries. Fin-Tech space there is always the option of just transitioning into tech roles in finance and NYC is the capital of finance.

For leetcode I check out the question, see if I can solve it within 20 minutes or at least think of the optimal data structure or algorithm to use, and then watch a video on how to solve it. Then I go back and implement the solution, try to do it from memory from the video and then come back to the same problem the next day. System design questions I paid for hellointerview premium, and used the guided practice. I’d go through the practice first and obviously it wouldn’t be perfect, but afterwards I’d read the solution to see where I went wrong and why. The why here is important since tradeoffs is a big talking point in SD interviews. I think I ended up doing around 75-80 leetcode questions before stopping since i got some offers.

nfd2ed2,"I actually gave a short talk about this last week. My short opinion is ""yes, but a bubble doesn't mean the technology is worthless"". Right now what most people call ""AI"" (which is really just a small subset of generative AI) is almost definitely in a bubble. There's an unbelievable amount of investment in it, a ton of business ventures that use it without a clear plan or analysis, and a lot of integration in places where it doesn't add much value. There are also a lot of people banking on it doing things in the future that it doesn't do right now, and putting money into it based on an assumption that ""it'll do everything we need soon"".There's also an issue at the very top. Companies that provide the service are not making money off it yet, and they will need to either raise their prices or lower their costs to make it profitable in the future. They're all hoping to win a market share and then hike up the prices. This is disastrous for businesses which are, by-and-large, planning as though their current rates will be stable forever.Unlike blockchain/crypto, however, AI does show many profitable use-cases. AI does work that would cost money, and it provides services people will pay for. Business analyses DO show that AI is successfully being used by businesses sometimes. It's just that most businesses don't know what works or doesn't work, and are using the technology blindly.I would liken it to the ""Dotcom Bubble"". The internet as a business technology was absolutely in a bubble in the 90s, and that bubble crashed. It wasn't because ""having a website for your business"" was a bad idea, it was because people were trying to do it without a good plan. Nowadays every business has a website, but unlike the 90s we've established clear use cases which provide value instead of just guessing what works and what doesn't.I expect AI to be the same. AI will ""crash"".

Whether you would call that a bubble depends on what you think will happen when the market for the technology moves beyond hype into a mature, useful stage. There are many realistic and valuable business applications for LLMs, computer vision, etc. These tools are incredibly powerful and will only get better as the models get refined and as more skilled developers work on them (whether they are newly trained in an ML-specific context, like me, or they're crossing over from more rigorous, traditional SWE backgrounds).I'm currently a manager in a non-technical role but taking point on some exploratory AI projects, and I'm looking for a role as an ML engineer down the road. What I'm paying attention to, both in my current role and in my job search, is whether the product brings real business value. Investors and execs don't understand this stuff, they see how quickly and confidently chatgpt spits out text and they believe it's magic that's going to relieve them of the burden of workers. Dishonest hype men are more than happy to take advantage of that. But if you actually understand how these models work on even a rudimentary technical level then you can smell the bullshit from a mile away. I'm not going to peddle bullshit and I'm not going to go work for bullshit except as a last resort.

They can even say ""Great!"" and not be lying, because what a ""Good WLB"" is is very subjective. They may genuinely think their WLB is great because they only have you working 60 hours instead of 80.So instead, ask them about stories. In the exact same way they use ""tell me about a time when..."" questions on *you* to gain insight into *you* as opposed to directly asking. ""When was the last time the team was missing a deadline, and how was that handled?"", ""How are deadlines decided, and who decides on them?"", ""When do most people generally come in/leave for the day?"", ""When's the last time the team got an after hours support call and how was that handled?"", ""What's considered 'crunch time', and how often is the team doing that?"", ""What are your expectations of \[role\]?"", etc, etc.There are many, many different answers to those questions. It's up to you to decide if you think their answer demonstrates the kind of WLB/culture you're willing to join.If from any of the questions it sounds like this is a ""work hard play hard"" team, you reject them.I've worked for 2 startups, and they had amazing WLB's.

Because a lot of the Mediums are generalizations of Easy problems, and the Easy problems give you a good foundation of key techniques.Once you find a solution to an Easy, take around 10-15 minutes and think if you can find a faster solution. On Leetcode it is usually to tell if there is a faster solution by the speed/memory distribution.Once you get the hang of Easys, then start doing Mediums that are semi-related to the Easys you've done. (For example, if you did an Easy in strings, do some Mediums in strings. If you did Easies in arrays, do some Mediums in arrays.)

You can't really drill these like you would technical coding questions, but you can practice explaining your thought process out loud and getting comfortable with saying ""I'm not sure, but here's how I'd approach it.""Jane Street's bar is high and they're looking for a specific type of analytical thinking that either clicks with you or doesn't. But the uplifting part is that if you've made it to round three, they already see potential in you. Focus on being genuinely curious about the problems they present, don't be scared to ask questions, and show them how your mind works rather than trying to guess the ""right"" answer. The topics can range from basic probability and statistics to market dynamics, so having a solid foundation there helps, but your reasoning process matters more than perfect recall of formulas.I'm on the team behind [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically to help with these kinds of challenging interview scenarios where you need to think on your feet and articulate complex reasoning clearly.",akornato,2025-09-21 05:59:18,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1nm695j,False,

Greater than 1 YoE, resume can be 1 or 2 pages, or 1.5 is okay white space kind of looks bad. Use a big font if 2 pages. Honestly, big font is underrated.

nfjgsq3,"Wanted to give some perspective as a SWE that left Squarespace earlier this year (based out of the NYC office). Squarespace definitely has a pretty chill wlb and has a good engineering culture + you should have a very supportive engineering manager. There were regular company-wide panel meetings for engineers to showcase their recent work and share interesting news and upcoming tech. However, from my own experience, the product management and roadmaps can be a little shaky and if you are the type of dev that prefers autonomy and moving at your own pace, you might feel bogged down by all of the meetings and politics between different teams & departments.As the other commenter said, options are definitely a crapshoot and thats part of the reason I left for a startup where my options would have a little more upside + I could have more eng & product ownership. By the time I left I had a few years of stock refreshers that were worth about 75k a year in straight up equity which were then converted to plain cash payouts after SQSP went private. The change to options was def a downgrade for me given that any potential value hinged on growth in valuation and going public again or doing a stock buyback/other liquidity event. At the time that I left a lot of people viewed the valuation target from the company leadership as a bit aggressive but who's to say that they can't meet it with some aggressive catch-up against their main competitors (eg. shopify with a current valuation \~25x that of Squarespace when it went private).I'd say to not make the jump just because of the potential value of the equity, but if you're looking for a good engineering culture and interesting product to continue your career growth I would definitely suggest considering Squarespace",steiner26,2025-09-22 03:30:05,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1nlw0dz,False,
nf9swh3,"For software development, the languages that companies value most right now are Python (super versatile: backend, automation, data science, AI, security), Java (still huge in enterprise and backend), C# (popular for backend and enterprise systems), C++ (more specialized, but strong in systems, embedded, and performance heavy apps). You might find backend, automation, or even systems programming a better fit. Python is especially powerful because it crosses into both software development and cybersecurity. For cybersecurity, it’s useful for scripting, automating scans, and working with security tools.If you’re interested in cybersecurity, focus on Python scripting for automation. Networking basics (which you’ve started on). Linux security and command line skills. Certifications like CompTIA Security+ or CEH (these can help open doors). If you’re more interested in software development, building a few solid projects (maybe a command line tool, an automation script, or a backend system) will help you stand out.EU companies often look for flexible engineers who can do multiple things. Stick with Python as your main tool, add depth with either Java or C#, and build some focused projects. Also, check out [Cloud Strategy Labs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) for more clear roadmaps and step by step guides for both software development and cybersecurity.",Content-Ad3653,2025-09-20 16:40:42,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1nlu07s,False,

So even if you’re not into web dev, both still have strong non web uses.For projects you can still build things that stand out without touching frontends. Automation tools to write a Python or C# script that automates boring tasks (like cleaning up files, organizing data, or generating reports). System utilities to build a command line tool for network scanning, log parsing, or monitoring resources. Cybersecurity mini tools which are things like a password strength checker, simple intrusion detection script, or vulnerability scanner. Data focused projects to parse large datasets, visualize trends, or build small machine learning models. Game or simulation projects using C# with Unity or even Python with Pygame, create a small but complete game or simulator. Make the project useful and complete not just half finished code.

So I made 1800% in two years. You're not going to get that kind of return at a public company, though the value of the stock would be available sooner and guaranteed. Personally, young people should take more risks. The really small startups might be such a gamble they're not worth it, but I think going for a private company that has a good trajectory and is well established is a fantastic idea and a risk younger folks should be willing to take.
