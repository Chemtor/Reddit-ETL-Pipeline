It goes without saying this was well before the advent of AI and also chemistry is a field where all of the answers aren't on Google.One of the reasons I wasn't improving was because I didn't like the field I was in. I didn't have passion to improve and felt like I was entitled to more than I actually deserved just because I had X years of experience on paper. In the meanwhile, people who were much younger and less experienced came in and were smashing it purely because they had drive, passion, and a desire to improve.Lost my job during the 'rona pando, attended enough interviews for a chemistry job and didn't get any offers even though I felt the interviews went well.I thought I was a great chemist who was underappreciated. In reality, I was discovering in real time that I was a subpar, disgruntled chemist at best. Thought I was faking my way through the interviews, getting all of the technical questions right, but in hindsight, none of it mattered because even though I knew all of the answers, there's no point hiring somebody who doesn't want to be there which is the energy I gave off subconsciously.Offering this as an alternative perspective because sometimes the answer isn't necessarily trying harder.Paraphrasing although a famous MMA coach once said that there are a lot parallels between life and your style of fighting. Loads of people in the martial arts community start trying to emulate their favourite fighters without considering that style might be unsuitable for their physiology, essentially training on ""hard mode"" by doing something they aren't designed to do instead of putting energy into discovering their own style.

It is an end-to-end *lakehouse platform*, that integrates ""storage engine"" capabilities (much like a DBMS) with a table format (the metadata) on top of open file formats such as Apache Parquet.Hudi offers built-in services for ingestion (like Hudi Streamer), table management (clustering, compaction, cleaning, rollback), and catalog syncing. These services are deeply integrated and natively supported, allowing for fine-grained control over write-side performance (with the ability to run asynchronously/inline), recovery, and data quality. Work is also underway to add a multi-tenant caching layer that bridges fast ingestion with low-latency querying across engines.

n4b6sky,"Disclaimer: I like SQL and I will die on the hill that most pipelines are more succinctly represented in terms of SQL than in imperative code.I've never had to pay for Snowflake but out of the three it's the one that feels like an actual SQL database. Everything is SQL-first and it's full featureset is exposed via SQL. It performs well and behaves just like you'd expect a database to behave. I hear they know how to charge though.BigQuery is nice in that its fast and  supports a wide range of operations but it's super annoying in that its concept of catalog / database is an entire GCP project which you can't just issue a `CREATE DATABASE` call to spin up a new one. So you're mostly limited to schemas and tables to structure your data. Also a bunch of operations are only available via its API instead of via SQL which grates me.Databricks is the PHP of data platforms, it feels like a bunch of random shit thrown together. SQL support is an afterthought (although to be fair improving all the time) and if you're going to use DataFrame's then you're going to need to spend more time understanding the nuances of Spark and optimizing your code.

n44cwdj,"Howdy! I’m an Aggie (grad school in stats, not DE) and a Sr. DE working in Dallas. I was actually part of the industry DE group that A&M was talked to when they designed a bunch of the DAEN classes. I was one of five who chipped in on DAEN 323. They wanted folks who had industry DE experience as well as advanced stat training, which is actually a pretty small pool.The DAEN major is… fine. The small group of junior/mid-level CS faculty who pushed it to completion haven’t worked in industry, and they *really* wanted it to be more data science-y, which is why there’s a weird amount of semi-niche statistical topics (I love bayesian methods, but they’re generally a grad-level topic for stats, and they’re not really useful at all for a DE to be familiar with), and mandating that the DE students take the two required ISEN classes is silly. There’s too much statistical/ML methodology (which is awesome if you want to go into ML enablement, I’ve done it and can tell you that it’s a ton of fun) for the average DE, and especially the entry-level DE, and the tradeoff is that there’s not as much cloud education in there as I and most of the others thought there should be. They get you into databases early, which is key, but I’d like there to be more database coursework. Fortunately, you can do those extra DAEN technical electives.That said, you’ve got a few classes in there that rock for developing your practical skills. The DAEN project classes are a high point that have some good projects that would shine on any junior DE’s resume that I’ve reviewed in the last three or four years. I would strongly recommend augmenting those classes with more database coursework than the one required CSE 310 class. Overall, I’d say the program is about as good for getting you into DE as just doing a CS degree, and I’d strongly note the dual caveats that:1. your first job almost certainly will not be in data engineering. This is not an entry-level field, your first job will probably be in data analytics, and you’ll progress into DE like most of us did.2. This is a new program, and they’re still working out the kinks.

However, as you mentioned with DE not providing a solid cloud computing foundation, do you think it would be sufficient to add CS cloud computing electives. I have majority of the core curriculum taken away with AP classes which leaves decent spots for me to fill up? Also, you mentioned data engineering not being an entry level role. My original thought was by committing to a data engineering major I would be better suited to building infrastructure/data pipelines, but if that’s not an entry level role where does that leave me in the job market?

n43ok82,"One way to handle this data is like this:Start with your first full dataset, probably in CSV or Parquet format, and load it into a database table. When you do this, add two extra columns: start_date and end_date. Set the start_date to the day you ran the first scraping job (let's call it D), and set the end_date to something far in the future (like the year 9999) to indicate it's still ""active.""Now, when you run your second scraping job (on day D+1), compare it to the data already in the table:* If a listing is new (wasn't in the first file): insert it as a new row, with start_date = D+1 and end_date = 9999.* If a listing no longer appears: update the existing row in the table to set its end_date = D. This marks it as no longer active.* If a listing is still there but has changed (e.g., price or details): treat it like a delete and reinsert. That means: Update the existing row's end_date = D, AND Insert a new row with the updated values, start_date = D+1, and end_date = 9999.If you already have a historical mass of scraped data, you keep going day by day until your current date. You then schedule your job to run right after the scraper to update the table with your new data.If this sounds confusing, look up Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (SCD Type 2) It’s a standard data warehousing method for tracking changes over time.

Then you need to carefully think through your BI architecture because you are paying to move data off AWS to Azure, so you want to minimize that as much as possible. If you do it by caching on the Azure side for performance, then it requires you to move all the potential data that people could use across to make it available.

Some management did, C levels definitely had it, except for technical C-suite who held PhDs instead.Imo spend your time on something else, and working at a place like that is really not as difficult as you expect, but your best path in would be going to a good school, doing well, interviewing well and living nearby.

Get your view definitions under version control on GitHub then use GitHub actions to push them to postgres when you make updates. If performance starts to become an issue, then look into an orchestrator as you might need to start materialising these into actual tables.- make sure your view definitions are under version control.

The goal here is to make sure you accomplish something, have a defined finish line and don't just resell them back the same used car they were driving with a new coat of paint.1. Make sure there is total agreement as to WHY you are doing this. You need this before you use any brain cells on the technical or tools side of the house. This needs to be in writing and preferably signed off by all stakeholders. None of these reasons will be technical. They will all be business oriented. This step needs to be very well documented and agreed on. Don't let anyone push you to rush this one. I usually take 3-4 weeks for this. Sometimes it takes longer. These are all of your project success criteria. Why was a decision to replicate what you already have made? The longest path to anywhere is a shortcut.2. Now that you have that, figure out WHAT they don't have that they need. Every single one of these needs to tie back to a WHY. If it doesn't tie back to one, discard it or update the WHYs and get sign off again. I'm talking reports, dashboards, messaging, etc. Do not start coding yet. This is also where to start to identify if you have the data to achieve these items. Don't limit yourself to the current state of affairs. I cannot emphasize how important it is to tie these back to WHY items. ""Because we've always had them"" is not a reason. Validate existing data products to see if they are sufficient or even needed. This is where you start to clean house on all the crap that data warehouses collect. This stage will also start to get you thinking about the relationships between the types of data. Not a data model, but a bit higher than that in conception.Nothing up to now has been technical but these are by far the most important parts of the projects. It will be very tempting to jump into the weeds, don't do it. Your post already suggests you are starting at the wrong place.3. Now you can start to design the data warehouse. I would start with the data model. Figure out what type of model you need. Don't take what is already there unless it can be heavily justified. An operational data store is not the same as a data warehouse. You don't get too many opportunities to do this in any one company. Throw away all of those marketing terms. They won't help you. A traditional three tier DW has never steered me wrong. Activities, like data cleansing and data standardization, tend to happen as you move the data from one tier to the next. Stage is used for landing data. I tend to make my core in 3NF and any data products (stars, materialized views, etc.) in the semantic layer. You do not need to have everything built out before you start using it but do have as much as possible planned out and written down.

n4s63t6,"Alright, this post can make good use of additional clarity.- Is primary_hash just a fancy way to say ID?- I hope you understand the implication of hashing, because in this context it is a trap, and you’re jumping right into it. First, order sensitivity: {a:1, b:2} and {b:2, a:1} can spit out different hashes depending on your algorithm—hope you’re normalizing inputs. Second, collisions: no hash is truly unique, so your primary_hash or payload_hash could, in theory, screw you over with duplicates. Third, compute cost: hashing big payloads (especially JSON blobs) chews up CPU. For large datasets, you’re burning cycles when a simpler key or checksum could do the job. Also, good luck debugging when someone tweaks the algorithm. Do stick to lightweight identifiers or deterministic keys unless you’re solving world hunger.- Your source system just yeets full or incremental loads at random? You're really telling us is just a coin flip? Scour their docs for a pattern—there’s got to be one. If it’s truly a coin flip, build a check (like record count or metadata flags) to detect load type. Then branch your logic: full load = overwrite or merge, incremental = append or upsert. A simple if-statement saves you from nuking 95% of your data.- Why the urge to slap a boolean is_current on everything? Your UPSERT logic already yells “this row’s alive!"". Regarding your last_loaded_ts: you just called it business_ts few words before!- Detecting deletions always come down to one of two. Check if the source emits delete events (docs, again). If not, periodically poll for IDs and just IDs. Another news: although a row is being deleted from the source system, it's not mandatory you have to delete it as well: just flag it (aka soft deletion). Overall, if you can ingest incrementally and poll for just IDs, you are saving money and drastically simplify the process.- Data retention: S3 (or Fabric’s storage) is dirt cheap for raw data and time travel queries (i.e., SELECT * FROM table VERSION AS OF '2025-01-01') have been invented in the 90s. If storage costs creep up, archive old partitions to cheaper tiers like S3 Glacier. Keep Silver/Gold lean for business logic and aggregates—don’t make them history dumps.

n48r3gw,"So we have a data feed that’s not exactly real-time due to the complexity, but it is continuous. Our official SLA is 3 hrs but in reality we process the data in around an hour tops end-to-end. The input is approx 500 JSON files a minute, essentially a new version of each business object in each file, and the output is 280+ delta tables. We use only custom-built pyspark notebooks to accomplish this, no DLTs, with a combination of continuous batch job workflows and ADF-triggered readstream workflows that run for 24 hrs then time out using a query listener to recycle and restart during off-hours.The first crux of the data feed is to transform the incoming JSON into a collection of 280+ tabular and relational “bronze” tables. This first crux is the essential schema transformation from an object-oriented data view to an analytical and relational-database view of the data. No data contents are modified, only the schema representation.The second crux is the creation of a merge statement from the collection of “bronze” tabular tables to the final collection of “silver” tables. We have 6 workflows that run this second part with about 75 tasks for the big ones, 20 for the smaller ones, that all use a status table as a readstream to know when parsed, tabular data is ready to merge into the final silver tables. Each task is responsible for keeping one final silver table updated.

If a single column fits within memory (say <32 GB) this should run extremely well on repeat queries on similar data (eg when a dashboard is loaded). The data used so far is \~100GB per example (individual columns are a fraction of this).It's not designed for truly massive datasets (> TBs) yet, that'd require NVME raids and/or distributed nodes.

I suggest reading some database literature; definitely room for innovation and quality of implementation improvements, but no need to reinvent all the theory. And there's different philosophies of design (""in memory"" or not, distributed or not, etc, etc).Some (many) algorithms degrade poorly when the amount of data is larger than the system's available memory. It's not just about the size of data; it's also about whether there's a performance cliff (or a point where you outright start failing).You're not wrong, a single machine can do a lot.

n4dy17a,"What is it that people generally struggle with? It took me about a month (full time) to go from understanding practically nothing about programming, to being a passably competent junior developer, back around 10 years ago.I did spend a lot of my teen years building and tinkering with computers, and I was able to make static websites, but that was all I knew going into it. Perhaps having that basic understanding of how the hardware worked helped.I knew I had to learn C#, and that I would be doing web app development for work, so I just set myself the goal of building a social network site, not one that would be live anywhere or with scalability, just one that technically worked.I wrote out the list of features I wanted, profiles with personal info, picture uploads with compression, posts with comments and likes/dislikes, a friend list with the ability to add or remove people, and a search to find people on there.I looked up how entity framework worked, and followed about 30 mins of a tutorial for setting up a code-first database, but made models for my own project instead of copying the tutorial ones. I do remember having a little confusion on how to store and model references for comment chains, but google and a stack overflow post helped with that.Then I did something similar for authentication, integrating it with the models I had already made. After that there was some googling on how MVC worked, and how to pass models around. I’m pretty sure I went overkill on that, as I didn’t know just how much ‘just worked’ and how much I had to manually implement.After that it just sort of snowballed. I’d move from feature to feature, working on each, and googling very specific things when stuck to find stack overflow or random blog posts, which I could just read through and then implement myself. The second half of that month was a lot of fun seeing everything come together and work. I’m sure if I could find the codebase today, I’d shake my head at the quality, but at the time, I was very proud of it.Honestly, I never found any struggle at all when it came to learning the basics and putting something together. I didn’t hit a brick wall until I was getting into things like trying to implement algorithms directly from academic papers, and that’s mostly because I don’t always follow the terminology or notation correctly. There’s also usually a couple of times a year I come across some incredibly elusive bug that takes me a week to figure out. I find the hardest part of the job is looking at large projects written by other people with a differeng style, and having to unpick everything and figure out how it works. I know when I was a teenager, I always wanted to learn, but never did because I wanted to do everything perfectly first time and not waste even a second of time by picking the wrong thing, but as soon as I needed it for work and just had to figure it out look for a new job, it turned out to be so simple I wish I could have gone back and slapped my younger self for all the delaying.I’m curious, which part in the process is the challenge that makes it harder? This post is interesting, but it definitely feels like there’s a degree of overkill to the process!If someone can really verbalise what makes the whole thing a challenge to them, perhaps I can help? I know it sounds weird, but I’ve been doing it for so many hours now that it’s hard for me to imagine not being able to, but I would very much like to help if I can somehow!As for your conclusion about shifting mentality, that is one thing I do try to reiterate to people, nobody in tech support or software development really ‘knows’ it all, we just know that if you sit down and do some searching, as well as thinking through each problem step by step, you’ll get there in the end, there’s not much to it. Yes, some stuff gets passively memorised over time, but other than a handful of keywords and simple logic, you don’t need anything else to start working on a project. You’ll be slow, sometimes it takes a while to find the correct answer online, but overall, you can fundamentally do it.I do think some people believe we’re joking when we say that 50% of the job is figuring out what to google, but it is mostly true. Programming languages are not actual languages, you don’t need to converse in real time, and therefore you don’t need much stored information to do it. It’s far more like a trade skill, like plumbing or carpentry, anyone can do it, the difference between a new learner and an experienced developer is simply how quick and how well polished the result is. If I give you some wooden planks, a saw, a hammer, and some nails, you can build a table. It might be a shit table, it might collapse as soon as you put weight on it, but you can do it. After you do it once and find the flaws, you’ll do it again better the next time. The same is true here, if you have an IDE installed, and have a web browser and a list of keywords, you can build an app, it might crash, or be slow, but you can build it, then you go again and you’ll do it better and faster next time.",Kezyma,2025-07-21 18:34:49,3,learnprogramming,t3_1m5lmth,False,

I’m hearing more and more from career services and from friends in the field that these kids are getting fired, if they are even getting jobs at all. I know the peer pressure must be immense, but keep away from that shit. At least while you are learning. Making use of tools that are magnifiers are really only going to help experienced software engineers. You can’t amplify nothing and expect that to go well. College assignments are designed to be bite sized and have rails. We design them so most students can figure it out and learn. Of course AI can do an ok job at those. Your classmates are losing the chance to learn how to learn and believe me, look at what tech looked like in 2005 and see if you don’t agree that the one skill you need to get in college more than any other is learning how to learn things on your own so you can adapt.

n4npcdv,"If AI can write code, it can run a company.If there's ever a point where you lose your engineering job to AI, everyone in almost every industry that touches a computer will.Currently AI writes dog shit code and the people that love it write dog shit code.The issue with the job market right now is that the economy is absolutely fucked and particularly the CS industry. A lot of venture capital dried up post covid and the value of the american dollar was cut in half almost overnight.There's also billions if not trillions in AI startups that haven't even turned a real profit yet. That money invested in AI isn't going into proven tech like solar, wind, electric cars that are a future trillion dollar industry.So it's really convenient for large companies (like amazon, meta, and microsoft who all have gigantic investments in AI) to say they layed off 20k employees because ""AI could do their job."" If that's true, show me a video of AI doing all the coding and customer service. I don't believe it.These companies are probably tightening their belts in a bad economy, pinning it on how awesome their AI investment is doing, framing it as profit and saving money, boosting their stock price. And when interest rates on loans go down, they can hire everyone back.A lot of these companies were also ""benching"" people. Hiring top talent employees just so that they don't go build a competitor product.Realistically they probably laid off a ton of benched talent and other people they didn't need. The economy is awful so it will be harder for them to find a job. There's less access to capital so they probably won't be able to find investors. They can blame it on AI, watch their stock price shoot up. Save a ton of money on paying humans, and make their minimum corporate loan payments.Meanwhile your classmates are drinking the AI kool aid that startups have been pumping out for decades.If an LLM can code better than a fresh graduate, there will be no reason to hire young computer scientists. I doubt your friends are thinking this far in advance.That said, there are tons of papers on how LLMs and ML are close to the limit on how effective they can be. I think all large AI companies summed together are taking about 1 Great Britains worth of power to run. That's an insane amount of energy. Elon is using coal to power Grok which is mind blowingly stupid. It's causing health problems in the surrounding community near his data centers.I think every time you want a significant improvement you need an order of magnitude training data increase, as in add another 0. 1b > 10b > 100b > 1t. One trillion is 1 thousand billions. It's not just a big number. It's a number so big that there may arguably not be enough data to train it at a certain point.When AI trains on data that AI generated it fucks itself and starts outputting shit. This is a theory as to why so many giant LLMs like claude and chatgpt are getting worse. One reason might be that the nicer version is behind a paywall, but the other is that these llms might be consuming so much AI generated text that it's degrading them permanently and there's no real way to separate human from AI generated content on a platform that has billions of users.You may actually get to watch an entire industry enshittify in under 5 years, which is pretty cool IMO. It might be a once in a lifetime event.Advances tend to be S curved in the sense that you logarithmically increase a plateau of improvement, and then you get a material advance in conditions or approaches that allow you to exponentially increase towards another limit. Vaclav Smil's book on growth is basically like reading the back of a screwdriver but it's great at illustrating this point. It's almost a law of progress given enough resources.Realistically AI will increase, but it's largest limitation is energy consumption and training data requirements. These two things are kind of inherent in ML from what I understand and a lot of what people are doing to improve ML is incrementally improving it.My theory is that there will be a new AI paradigm that will be cheaper and require less input. Remember your brain can pitch a baseball, play chopin, cook a 5 star dinner, drive a racecar, and fuck elons mom and it only runs on the amount of power it takes to run a lightbulb.My recommendation would be to recognize that your friends are idiots, the hype is a smokescreen, and to just get good at coding and pass your classes. You will more than likely struggle more than your peers in school. As the problems get harder, you will struggle less and they will struggle more. And when it comes time to get a job you will be extremely rare in that you can actually code and your peers cannot.

n4150yu,"> So I understand that computers run on bits that are either 0s or 1s. And programming is the manipulation of these 1s and 0s via a programming language. It's a bit more nuanced, but lets say this is kind of true.In any case, at the lowest level that is worth talking about, it's possible to connect some wires to the CPU/microcontroller and directly influence the electricty. But usually people don't do that, because both the computer/environment and the programming part have multiple levels of abstraction.First: The computer has ""firmware"" built in, which is basically small existing software that is part of the hardware components. One of its features is also that, when you turn the computer on, it loads other software from some predefined place (ie. the 0/1, or rather 0-255, that are stored there), and continues with executing this - so that you don't need additional physical wires to control your computer. This other software, that is loaded, can be called operating system (OS). And the OS then also doesn't do ""everything"" with 0/1 directly, but can give some known commands to the firmware (that the firmware understands).This data that is the operating system, you could create the 0/1 manually. But again people don't really do this. There is ""assembly"", which is a very basic, hardware-dependent programming language. There are commands like eg. MOV and PHMINPOSUW, no convenient loops, classes or anything like that. A helper program called assembler translates such a program to the binary data that can be executed.And, for both manual-binary or assembled programs, there's also the question of the environment that it runs in. Should it be an operating system that works directly with the hardware/firmware? Or should it run ""within"" an existing operating system, where it doesn't get to access the hardware anymore, but can access things provided by the OS?As next level, languages like C/C++/COBOL/Rust/.... Here you get compilers that translate this programming language into assembly. These languages are less hardware-dependent, instead you get different compilers for different hardware platforms (producing assembly for their specific platform). Once again, it's important to decide if you want to make an OS, or a program to run on an existing OS like Windows or Linux. The code will be quite different. As you know C, you surely know things like printf - that's not something the hardware and assembly can do, it's part of an existing OS (and it's libraries). When writing C to make an OS, you have to make your own printf too, by using firmware things that allow you to contorl the screens output.ObjC etc. are not C, please don't confuse them.Next level are languages like Kotlin, as you expected. With Kotlin, Java, C# and so on, there is no compiler that directly produces assembly anymore. It's technically possible to create such a thing, but no one is doing it. Compiling to C code is possible too, but again unusual. Instead they have their own compiled program format, that is unrelated to what the hardware can understand. And in addition to the compiler, they need a second helper program (written in C etc.), that during each execution takes this custom binary format and each time ""translates"" it to real native things on the fly. It might sound weird, but there are advantages too (and disadvantages too).",dkopgerpgdolfg,2025-07-19 17:51:54,21,learnprogramming,t3_1m41o5i,False,

It was/is essentially the same as other higher-level languages we see today.Newer languages like Kotlin don't have other languages like C/C++ under the hood.

Sometimes you need to use an existing language like C/C++ to write the first compiler for a new language and then you can use that first compiler to compile a compiler written in the new language. This is known as bootstrapping.Keep in mind that some languages are ahead-of-time compiled directly to machine language.

I don't say this just to be contrarian, but because this comparison leads to what I think is actually quite bad advice right here in this post. With spoken languages, yes, focusing on precision is a bad idea because they're usually vast, highly contextual, meaning is frequently ambiguous and it can be achieved through other means. For example, in a great many languages a question can be achieved either through the structure of a sentence. ""Am I going"" vs ""I am going"" but it can also be achieved through tone. ""I am going."" vs ""I am going?"". We talk in language learning about something called tolerance for ambiguity, learning to accept speaking and listening without fully understanding everything, because the scale of what you need learn is vast and you're trying to actively fire up a part of your brain that will start working on what currently sounds like gibberish and start building meaning out of it. Programming *isn't like this* and, I think, one of the major mistakes learners make is thinking it is, or should be. You are correct that in programming you don't need to know everything, or understand everything. Limiting your toolset is, in fact, a strength, but you do actually have to know the pieces you're using well enough to put each after the other in a purposeful way because there is no other party trying to infer your meaning in good faith.

n4caz8g,"It's definitely a shift when you go from an intro programming tutorial where you to have a sequence of things to learn to building a project where you learn as you go. I'll give an example:My first project was building a game. This wasn't web (I used Python), but the same idea should apply. A bit of Googling led to me learning there was this nice Python library called Pygame. I poked around at tutorials just enough to figure out how to display stuff on the screen, and then I started designing my game - thinking about how I needed a hero, platforms, monsters, etc., how to represent those in classes, and how to draw things on the screen. A bit more Googling revealed that a game typically has a ""main"" loop with a delay at the end where the goal is to get user input, update various things (hitpoints, etc.), and draw the next frame. So I mostly figured out how to do that but had to turn to tutorials for a few things like animation and how to make jumps actually look like jumps.So you're still using tutorials, but you're using them **as needed** rather than following a long tutorial beginning to end. I do find when looking at a tutorial to help with a project, it's useful to first try out a few simple examples in a small program before incorporating into your project. So in the example I gave, maybe I'd make a small program to display images or even little filled-in circles on a screen and then try to make them move in some pattern.If you want to try full stack, Flask and sqlite are pretty beginner-friendly for the backend if you don't mind picking up Python.

n4tf4j7,"I've tutored coding for almost 10 years (both as main job and as side gig). Here's some of the things I found from students who were in similar situations (1 hour a week schedules).I saw a comment below that said to teach them ABOUT the world of programming and computing, rather than actual programming, and I think that is the way to go given the constraints. That being said, here are some opinions/advice for IF you have to go through the programming route:\- Language Choice: Don't use Unity if they aren't going to be doing things on their own time. I tried with a student once, who specifically asked for it. The result was that nothing got done, and nothing was learned because there isn't enough time to understand concepts without homework / self learning. Sure, he could memorize some scripts, and make something move, but at that point, is that really programming? I eventually convinced him to move to Python.\- I would center my approach around the concept of ""how computers work and how to think systematically"". If you make the content of the class enjoyable, and make the learning fun/interesting, then they will want to do more on their own time. Instead of making a curriculum around ""how much can I get them to learn in this time frame?"" (As other users have said, that is no where near enough time), make it be ""How do I get them to learn a few cool stuff and develop an interest in wanting to learn more?\- The above point is why I would pick something like python, or even html/css/javascript (yes, 2/3rds of those aren't ""programming"" languages). The reason being the lower hurdle of entry to getting something they can make working, and they can see they made. I used to believe that if someone wanted to learn properly, start them in C. Nowadays, my viewpoint has changed to ""Start them in python so you can hook their interest with a lower bar of entry, and THEN dump them into a language like C#/Unity/Language of choice once they understand the basic concepts and are interested in the next steps"". Heck, if they are interested in AI, staying in python is great.\- You said you tried before and it was too confusing for them. I don't know how you explained it, but I'm going to give 2 extreme scenarios as an example. Look at this from a students point of view. \- Scenario 1: You go to class, you need to either learn what int main(int argc, char \*argv\[\]) means, or be told to memorize and learn it later. The former means needing to learn functions, args, arrays, return types, and more. The latter is encouraging not critical thinking. After that, you do printf(""Hello World"");. Then you need to learn what compiling is, and how to run the program. All that for Hello world. \- Scenario 2: you go to class, you type print(""Hello World""), and it shows up on your screen the line below. You made something. Your teacher can now introduce concepts one at a time, each with you making something. For example, maybe you introduce variables next, and create a Hello, name. Then functions, and create a print\_spam. So on. Since I was tutoring, I was able to tailor projects to each student's interests (Instead of random number generator, I can do random kpop member or something), but for a classroom, it should be more generic, and maybe more open ended as a project.\- Going to say this point again: with so little time, The best curriculum in my opinion is one that gets them interested and learning how to think critically, rather than one that dumps as much info as possible that they may or may not retain.",MagicHatJo,2025-07-24 00:46:36,3,learnprogramming,t3_1m7okmf,False,

n4gr972,">my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going onThis sounds like what people call a ""mental block"", and I think learning to defuse that involves a lot more learning *how to learn* than it does learning how to do computer science. Heads up, this is probably going to sound more like I'm trying to give you therapy than anything else.**Step 1:** Validate yourself. *It is totally normal to struggle learning this*. It's a hard fucking topic, half the resources online are dogshit, and significantly more than half the people you meet online trying to talk about it are probably going to call you dumb and/or lazy. You're not. You're allowed to struggle, and in time you'll come to learn that failure is positive; but I full appreciate that it doesn't look that way right now.I'm a senior dev and data scientist. I've dropped out of multiple degrees. There are some leaderboards on leetcode-esque sites where I'm in the top 100 in the entire world. Sometimes I make mistakes that a child would laugh at.The struggle is just part of the journey, and comprehension will come with practice and time.**Step 2:** When your mind is settled and ready to be curious/compassionate, think back to that feeling of ""my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going on"" - what's *actually* going on there?What's going on is your brain throwing up barriers; an anxiety response, not necessarily a cognitive one. ""It's better to stop trying than to risk failure"", or something along those lines. I bet you do know a bit about programming. I bet you could tell me what a variable is, how to make one, probably what a function is, and so on. Remind yourself of the things you *do* understand and try to connect them to what you're currently struggling with.We beat anxiety by breaking things down into tiny little pieces until they seem surmountable. We win by starting very very simple, and going very very slow, if we have to. Every time you don't understand something, every time that ""I don't get it"" response pops up, *stop struggling*. Tend to it. Take a breath. Talk it through with yourself - break it down into the smallest, silliest subproblem you can. Address just that one tiny subproblem. Didn't work?

Learn the wrong way to do things too, it'll help you figure out the right way to do things. Write shitty spaghetti code. You'll improve over time.Try something simple like building a number guessing game. Add features to it: make it so you can select a difficulty which sets how wide the range of numbers are. Implement a limited number of guesses. Etc etc.Take what you learned from that and do something more complicated. Try making a shopkeeper for a fake rpg game. Add items to buy. Make them have descriptions, and a cost. Give yourself an inventory. Give yourself a wallet. Make it so you can list items in the shop. Buy said items. Maybe use CLI-style commands to buy the items. Make it so you can buy multiple at once. Add ways to earn money. Make them more complicated. Eventually turn it into a playable CLI game.There's just so many ways to learn how to code that are better than staring at tutorials all day. Learn how to think like a coder first. When you have all these requirements/constraints, sit down and think about how you might write code to make it happen. Look up how to actually do that thing you need. For the guessing game, clearly you need a random number, lets say between 1 and 10. Look up how to generate a number between 1 and 10 and store it. Look up how to get user input. Look up how to compare values. Look up how to let a player guess again if they are wrong (aka how to loop). Etc.

n42263f,"Whoa there's a lot to be said here. But I'm in a somewhat similar situation at the moment and quite burned out, so I'll try to cover all the important stuff:1. Whatever you want to do (career change, learn new stuff, etc), ensure you have a way to sustain yourself. In this case, ""sustain yourself"" could mean leaving your current job and living off savings for a while... Enumerate your options and pick any option that works for you. There may be multiple correct answers and multiple wrong answers1. Using one extreme case as an example: let's suppose you choose to stay at your current job and try to learn new things in parallel (this is more or less your current situation). Realize that your bandwidth is limited and the more burned out you are, the faster you will subsequently burn out if you don't let up on the pressure. 1. Learning while on the job: if you are able to draw a connection between your current job and programming, you might be able to pitch it as a professional development exercise to gain employer support1. I recently read [an article about Amazon employees reading 1-4h every day][amazon-reading]. Maybe there's something to it and your daily reading could be programming1. Learning programming is less about reading and more about fiddling/tinkering. At least for me, the learning correlated more with practice than reading earlier on. Later in my practice, I was able to learn more from reading than I was previously able to, but tinkering (trying out new ideas that I've read about) has always been part of my learning loop.1. it sounds like consistently finding bandwidth is an issue. Consider that your learning journey could be slow and bursty. So read about a small topic today and practice it for 10min. Practice it again tomorrow for 10min. Maybe you'll have more bandwidth day after, so practice it for 25min. The following week, start the next topic. In this example, I mean ""topic"" to be something as simple/small/atomic as list slicing. Adopting this strategy will keep you within your available bandwidth (and thus avoid/mitigate burnout), but it is slower than (for example) a bootcamp or a structured course.1. Eventually (on like a long weekend or something), try building a side project. Once you start down this path, two things happen: (1) you'll start trying to apply all new concepts to your project and (2) your project becomes your guiding light for what to learn next. This second thing is a super powerful driving force in helping you learn new and useful things.1. Remember always to listen to your burnout meter. You can't learn if you're burned out. It's counterintuitive and difficult to implement, but if you're feeling the early stages of burnout, STOP. Write out your ideas on a whiteboard or a piece of paper... or record yourself on TikTok; find a way to externalizing your ideas so that you're not constantly ruminating over them when your brain is asking for a break (I used a notebook and a pen... I guess I'm old school like that).I'll stop for now (my brain needs a break), but feel free to ask followup questions and I'll be happy to answer to the best of my ability[amazon-reading]: https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/former-amazon-principal-engineer-says-he-spent-1-4-hours-reading-daily-and-it-s-part-of-the-company-s-secret-sauce/ar-AA1Iw4QO",inspectorG4dget,2025-07-19 20:49:53,3,learnprogramming,t3_1m3jiom,False,

GitHub personnel does not access private repository information without your consent except as provided in this Privacy Statement and for:> - security purposes> - automated scanning or manual review for known vulnerabilities, active malware, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service> - to assist the repository owner with a support matter> - to maintain the integrity of the Services, or> - to comply with our legal obligations if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law.> GitHub will provide you with notice regarding private repository access unless doing so is prohibited by law or if GitHub acted in response to a security threat or other risk to security.And there's no mention anywhere else in the privacy statement about them training Copilot on your private repositories. So unless you believe one of the most valuable companies in the world (Microsoft) is outright lying in their privacy statement, then you can not worry about this possibility.Legal policies can't play games like assuming everyone knows Copilot training on private data is part of ""the integrity of the Services"" - they have to be explicit.If you think they are outright lying or twisting words, then I guess you should immediately stop using any Microsoft products, and consider any information you've ever entered to be public.Similarly, GitHub once mentioned that ""no human eyes"" will ever see the code from your private repositories. A lot of people immediately assumed this means that they are obviously training Copilot on your private data (not human eyes). But again, it's not worth the risk to a company as valuable as Microsoft to play these kinds of games. Your private repositories are reviewed by some kind of machine, because that's how GitHub indexes your repositories for you! That way you can search for keywords and symbols, and so on.

The encoding UTF-8 has variable lengths, and some of them are 4 byte long.- Unicode is much, _MUCH_ more than just the assigned characters.

And a block always start at a number divisible by 16, meaning that the last hex-digit is 0. So if a block doesn't have a multiple of 16 characters, there will be some empty spaces. Often there's a system within a block of some sort, so that characters either match between lower and upper case, having the same number of codes between them, or so that variations of a character have numbers close together, and if one character has 8 different variations, and another only 7, then the eightth character might be left empty (or ""reserved"" to allow for the system to make sense.I have no idea about the specific ethiopic characters, it could also be that there were some characters that weren't added, because there were ""controversies"" in how they should be interpreted, and rather than wait forever, they just added all the characters around them.Remember that unicode is a living standard, and new characters are added all the time, sometimes in existing code-blocks, sometimes entirely new blocks.It would be a terrible mess if they just started at 0x0000, and added a new character to the end of the list everytime they encountered one!",peterlinddk,2025-07-21 11:53:58,1,learnprogramming,t3_1m5g9ls,False,

Accordingly, U+1E7E7 may later be populated with a HHYWA or HHYOA syllable if its availability is later found to be required by another language. The remaining unassigned positions, U+1E7EC, U+1E7EF, and U+1E7FF have correspondence with syllables still in use from the prior orthography that might have otherwise occupied these syllabic and code positions (U+1380, U+1383, and U+138F accordingly).",OldWar6125,2025-07-21 12:00:31,1,learnprogramming,t3_1m5g9ls,False,

This is an important rule because you don't want the code point U+0045 to mean the letter E in Unicode Version 3, but the letter W in Unicode Version 4. Code point reassignments would invalidate all earlier documents.If you accept this rule, then the following three desirable properties are incompatible:1. Related code points are grouped together in sets.2. Sets can gain characters in future versions.3. All assigned code points are contiguous beginning at 0.If you break rule 1, then you lose sets.If you break rule 2, then it means that if you need to add a related code point, you have to start a new set (which will probably have just that one code point in it). This basically makes sets pointlessSets are useful because they let you check things like ""Does this code point require a font that supports Cyrillic?"" more conveniently, as well as allowing those checks to continue working even when a new version of Unicode is released. Any new Cyrillic characters will take a previously-unassigned spot in a Cyrillic set. You need to update your code only if a new relevant set is defined, like ""Cyrillic Extended-B"".Sets are also useful for parallel development. If Team A is working on a new Cyrillic character, and Team 1 is working on a new Ethiopian character, they can each choose an unassigned code point from their respective sets and start writing documents with it to see how well it works. If you didn't have sets, then maybe Team A gets unofficial number N and Team 1 gets unofficial number N+1. But Team 1 gets their code point approved first, so now they have official number N, and this disrupts both Team A and Team 1 as they both have to go back and re-encode all their documents. (And we don't like re-encoding documents. See first paragraph.)Rule 3 isn't important. You shouldn't be rejecting unassigned code points anyway (except perhaps for those marked as ""permanently unassigned""). The Unicode Standard has recommendations for [Unassigned Characters](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L1999/99191.htm), namely, to treat them as generic characters with default properties. This allows your code to continue working when previously-unassigned code points become assigned.So the question is based on a false assumption: That it's important to be able to reject unassigned code points.You don't want your program to reject a person's name because it uses a newly-assigned CJK character, or to reject a product description because it uses the newly-assigned Rupee symbol *₹*.",dontwantgarbage,2025-07-23 15:39:35,2,learnprogramming,t1_n4bo25a,False,

n3rdbq5,"While in this situation there’s not much difference, each has very specific use cases. Enums are generally used as like a switch… lets say you had something with three different states, Running, Idling, or Off. While you could store this as a dictionary or array, this is what Enums are built for. They are a very simple data structure. Arrays are best for lists. Most languages support adding new items to your array, removing items from your array and have support for doing something to every item in an array. While in this case, you have an array of strings, commonly the elements within the array are more complex. Consider storing a list of books… you will want an author, a book name, a genre, for each item in the list. Enums can’t do this, and while a dictionary could, there are some drawbacks to using a dictionary in this way. Dictionaries are great for things like your actual book object. They have constant time access, so it’s easy to store a value and look up a value in this way. You can also assign more complex values to dictionaries, not just strings, which makes them better for anything more complex than an enum. They however are not the easiest to iterate through, and adding values requires you to also have a key to store the value to. For most languages, the keys are not ordered either, which is why for a changing list an array is better. Hope that helps!",LouManShoe,2025-07-18 04:20:57,6,learnprogramming,t3_1m2sgve,False,

n3snlg3,"*Note: I don't know about the specifics of GDScript, so this is a generic answer that should apply to all languages.*The only practical difference between the two versions is that enums uses simple numeric indexes, and dict uses strings (or any other kind of objects) as keys. Enums are technically faster, but that rarely matters.What is a huge difference though, is the errors you might get when compiling and the help your editor gives you in avoiding those errors.If you tried this with the enum version: print(fruitColor[Fruit.PEACH])you would get an error telling you that PEACH isn't defined, and you'd probably discover it early when trying to write PEACH, and autocomplete didn't help at all!But if you tried this similar thing with the dict version: print(fruitToColourDict[""peach""])you would get a print or NULL or Undefined, or nothing, depending on the exact language used. You probably wouldn't be told that ""peach"" did not exist in the dict, and you also wouldn't get any hints from the autocompletion while writing it, that it might be wrong. Enums aren't just ""lists of words"", they should be considered more like a custom variable-type, like a boolean that can be `true` or `false`, you can create your own types, like a return value that can be `true`, `false` or `fileNotFound`. They are extremely useful when writing code, because you always know that you only use values that the rest of the program will expect.Dicts on the other hand, are used more when you don't know all the possible values when writing the program - and you might want the program itself to add more keys to the list of known values.",peterlinddk,2025-07-18 11:06:04,1,learnprogramming,t3_1m2sgve,False,
n3t5ism,"Your example isn't really using dictionaries for what they are intended.A dictionary is useful for associating some unique key with some object at runtime. You can add stuff to a dict out of order, remove stuff, and any time you need to get something you don't have to scan the dictionary.Enums of course are constant. You can't add to them or remove from them.For Dict vs array, if you want to find something in an array you need to loop through it and compare.This is slow, especially on a hot path (something that is called often, e.g. in a loop)You won't see much of a difference in simple code that doesn't do much, or with small arrays, but as you get into thousands of objects, using a dictionary to store a reference to something that is not an index will be far faster than an array search.As always, it depends on what you have and what you want to do.",rupertavery,2025-07-18 13:01:16,1,learnprogramming,t3_1m2sgve,False,

This is not too difficult; any scalable, modern, hosting provider — like Vercel — should be able to handle this with no issues. You'll simply want to check that you can afford whatever they are going to charge you, so this simply involves being familiar with their pricing structure.Finally, we come to what you said — ""10k concurrent users"". This is a *really* rare situation — this is going to be getting close to a really popular website on the Internet. At this point, there's no guidebook on a guaranteed, step-by-step way to handle this.

Once you know that, you can start figuring out solutions to speed up those specific slowdowns. However, it's important that you know *where* the slowdowns are first, because it's a bit waste of time to optimize something, only to find out that that wasn't the true slowdown.To test this, you can use one of the many load-testing software tools out there, once you have appropriate logging in place.",abrahamguo,2025-07-20 20:49:40,1,learnprogramming,t3_1m4yhzw,False,

Let's look at his assertions**Learn this language and you're set for life**Python is popular and it will get you far, but much like learning a second (or third language), you gain a better appreciation of the first language and its quirks when you learn a second one. Most find the second language intolerable because it does things differently from the first, especially if the language is quite a bit different. If you went from C to C++, that's like learning more C. If you go from C# to Java, they will feel like similar languages. If you go from Python to Java, Java would likely seem way to verbose and too concerned with types.It's nice to know a few other languages, but for now, getting decent at Python is a good first step.**Learn Selenium**OK, that's out of left field. If you can't build a web page, learning Selenium seems advanced. It's often used to run automated steps on a browser, often for testing purposes. It's a little like learning to fix a car before you learn how to drive. I suppose it can be done, but it seems advanced.I wouldn't worry about Selenium for now.**Taking a Course**There is a free course here: https://programming-25.mooc.fi/This is a real college course and there are some quizzes and such.

There is obviously a web server involved, but it only serves front end code (aka static content), it can't run custom Python code or a database or anything like that.Instead what you need is a web server that supports Python code.

n44qfp8,"Let me tell you one thing about salary, it’s not about the capability you have but rather the leverage you have against the company. Sure the capabilities you have will land you the job. But once you have the job, use everything at your disposal to own some serious projects at the company. Make it so those projects practically rely on you for development and would cost to bring anyone to replace you. This gives you leverage and the ability to negotiate your salary to what you need.Now in terms of either learning MERN or data science or AI/ML, do all three. MERN gives you the ability to create apps. Data science gives you the ability to analyse and use large quantities of data. ML/AI gives you the ability to create more autonomous applications. You can combine all three and having all three gives you more leverage and flexibility when you want to land jobs.I speak from experience, I did an AI and robotics degree at uni. I’ve done ML and worked with current LLMs. While doing my degree I learnt the MERN stack. However my current job is a senior full stack software engineer where I use primarily next.js with sql and other tech stacks. But it can shift from different languages like Python some times too for data analysis etc.I mainly learn the MERN stack from Brad Traversy on YouTube he has great free tutorials.I believe everyone in the tech world should have at least one front-end and back-end tech they’re comfortable with so they can build stuff quickly and MERN can be the one for you. Don’t limit yourself to one stack though. Try to learn the basics for a few others so you know what you like best. For example Angular, Vue, etc.(My bias is for react and next.js though :squinting_face_with_tongue:)",FaisalHoque,2025-07-20 07:44:41,4,learnprogramming,t3_1m4gzyz,False,

n47f0rw,"I have worked at Microsoft for around 20 years. I have one child because of the hell i went though, and honestly, the career tradeoffs I made to get here were massive. I got into computers in the 80s and 90s because I loved tech. It wasn’t for money. It was about building real things. My first job I made very little with a master degree, and houses were 700k in my market so what choice did i haveToday, it feels like that’s mostly gone. The environment is toxic. Long hours. Metrics over mission. Leadership focused on checkins and politics. AI is treated as a silver bullet, but it can’t support production systems, do system-level architecture, or even explain tradeoffs. Meanwhile, junior devs are skipping fundamentals.The deeper issue is consolidation. I’ve been saying since 2010 that tech consolidation is killing innovation. Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia — they’ve absorbed everything. These companies hire away the best talent, buy or kill their competitors, and dominate infrastructure, tooling, ads, and now AI.And it’s not just technical. These same firms dominate lobbying. They block regulation, slow down privacy reform, and sideline competition. The result is fewer paths for meaningful work, less room for diverse ideas, and an industry stuck in its own gravity.If you are early in your career, ask yourself — what are you building? What will still matter in 10 years? What kind of work do you want to look back on? I’m almost 50 and only now able to pivot toward something more meaningful. Not everyone gets that chance.Big Tech is locked in a late-stage consolidation loop. The real risk isn’t that AI will take our jobs — it’s that these companies already own everything that matters.I recently spoke to an intern that quit biotech to come to microsoft because of the money. Bio tech was too long of an education for a small payoff. I did the same thing i told him decades ago (ironically it was machine learning at the time for me). Examples of consolidationMicrosoft buried Netscape in the 1990s and early 2000s. They bundled Internet Explorer with Windows and effectively crushed Netscape. The DOJ sued Microsoft for antitrust violations.Google crushed the independent web between the 2000s and 2020s. They bought DoubleClick YouTube and Android. Promoted Chrome through their services. Changed SEO and AMP to shift power away from independent websites.Amazon destroyed retail margins between the 2010s and 2020s. They used AWS profits to subsidize logistics. Cloned successful sellers. Took over cloud pricing and APIs.Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014. These were classic defensive acquisitions bought to prevent competition.Apple locked down iOS during the 2010s and 2020s. The App Store became a monopoly channel. A thirty percent fee was enforced. Alternative payments were blocked. Global antitrust cases are still happening.Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018. They took over a neutral developer platform and deeply integrated it into VS Code Copilot and Azure. This ties directly to the subject here. Google Meta and Amazon now dominate digital ads. They control over seventy percent of US ad revenue. Independent publishers lost funding. This led to lawsuits and legislation.In the 2020s the AI land grab began. Microsoft gained exclusive rights to OpenAI. Google folded DeepMind into its core cloud and search. Meta released controlled open models. Open labs cannot compete on compute or data.Regulatory capture and lobbying is widespread. These firms lead global lobbying budgets. Amazon and Google each spend around 20 million dollars per year in the US. They consistently resist antitrust data privacy and right to repair efforts.These companies buy all the AI tech. Absorb the talent. Fold it into their own platforms. The same thing happened with general tech talent. They inflated salaries and pushed smaller companies to the margins. This is not just a tech problem. Comcast charging for Netflix access is the same idea. This is why we had to fight for net neutrality.At some point hyperscalers need regulation. I am not anti capitalist. I believe in markets. But capitalism only works when it is balanced. Capital should flow to where it creates value. When one player has too much it is like poker.

n3qfg8y,"Congrats on spotting the burnout before it completely consumed you. A lot of people let it boil over and ditch the entire industry because of itFor future reference, there's a middle-ground between sacrificing your mental health and burning out, and quitting cold turkey: Establishing very clear professional boundaries, and sticking to them no matter what.I value my WLB very much, it's literally the most important thing to me about the team I'm working on. If I somehow ended up on a team that had a bad WLB, I'd start looking for another job. I know I won't change that teams culture, it is what it is.Instead of quitting though, I'd make my boundaries very, very, very crystal clear, and I would stick to them. I'm available 9-5. Hard stop. That's not negotiable. If I'm asked to do something at 5:30, I just won't respond. Or if things aren't terrible and I still have a decent relationship with that person, at most I'll give them a courtesy: ""OK, I'll take a look first thing tomorrow morning"". I don't care if deadlines get missed, not my problem, that's a planning problem. I don't care what insane committments my boss made. I work 9-5.Boundaries are what let you escape work mode. I don't work after 5pm, and I've taught my brain that same boundary, so it doesn't think about working after 5pm. If you lack that boundary, you can't escape ""work mode"" *because you're always working*. Your brain knows you're always working. You taught it that, why would it let you turn that mode off?In the same vein, sounds like your boss was an ass, but I also don't let feedback get to me. I do my best, 8 hours a day. If my best isn't good enough, not my problem. They hired me, that was their mistake, not mine. If my boss hates my guts, thinks I'm underperforming, or using AI? Tough. I'm not thinking about that after 5pm, and I'll just smile and nod during my 9-5, without changing a thing.The reason boundaries like this are so important, and so powerful is it lets you keep your mental sanity, even when you're at an aggresive, fast paced, toxic company.If these boundaries aren't acceptable for your employer, guess what happens? They fire you, and you're *exactly* where you just put yourself voluntarily anyways. But the hidden truth people aren't talking about is it can takes months, sometimes *years* before a company decides to pull the trigger on firing you over this kind of stuff. So you just bought yourself a whole lot of time to search for another job on the side, all while staying sane.Keep these things in mind for your net gig. Props to standing up for yourself, but at the same time remember there's usually a happy middle-ground hiding between the 2 extreme options of quitting vs burning out.",SouredRamen,2025-07-18 00:44:45,91,cscareerquestions,t3_1m2nz4j,False,

In this case, you were working under an aggressive (and frankly unrealistic) timeline:\- Boundary 1 is not putting all the blame on you. Super-tight timelines? Hmm...maybe you could do something more, or maybe your boss overpromised to his customer, or maybe you're incredibly understaffed and asking to do work that one person alone shouldn't be responsible handling. \- Boundary 2 is knowing when to switch off work when you log off your computer. It shouldn't keep you up at night. We are not surgeons, where one wrong mistake means that someone dies. We write code to make products. Like...the world will be ok.

Then I got into the interview and the hiring manager asked how I would interpret COBOL code if I needed to on the job.

n3w0n8r,"Here’s the conclusion I’ve come to: many FAANG grads are struggling to land jobs now because they were hired during a boom when top companies were scooping up talent, even those without real, developed skills, just to meet the demand of a rapidly digitalizing world.Remember, before COVID and the work-from-home shift, many legacy companies were still doing accounting on paper and hadn’t even integrated Excel into their workflows. Modernizing these dinosaur companies in such a short timeline was a massive undertaking, made possible by near-zero interest rates and tax breaks on developer salaries. It created a tech hiring bubble.Many grads hired into FAANG during this time barely had a chance to gain real experience before being laid off. And what does that signal to recruiters? Fair or not, it suggests you were in the bottom performance tier and got cut. It’s rough but not necessarily your fault. You were supposed to have time to grow, learn, and move up or out. That chance was taken away.Now you're competing with other laid-off peers and fresh grads some of whom companies may prefer because they're seen as more malleable and come without the layoff baggage. And if you have under four years of experience, you're often not seen as experienced enough for mid-level roles, but no longer ""new"" enough for new grad positions either.",TastyBunch,2025-07-18 21:22:19,158,cscareerquestions,t3_1m3e0t8,False,

This is a good thing, as programming workflow is getting better and more human readable.

But it's also not networking.Our network is made up of our *friends, family, and colleagues*.That's it. So in order to ""network"" you expand upon 1 of those 3 categories. The family category's tough to expand, you're kinda stuck with it. The colleagues one you expand throughout your career as you work with people. The people you've met and worked closely with in college also count as colleagues (even if they're *both* friends and colleagues). The professor you saw weekly in office hours, or the TA you had a good connection with are colleagues.The ""friends"" category is by far the easiest to expand. You expand this category by.... making friends. That's it. There's nothing more to it. They don't need to be technical either. Someone working in sales is able to refer someone to SWE. They're character checks for the company, not skill checks, that's why they still interview you. Hiring unknowns off the street is risky for companies, because character-red-flags are easily hidden and don't come out for months. Hiring someone that an employee they already like is vouching for is significantly safer.The reason meetups are so commonly suggested is because getting into a room with a bunch of people that all have a shared interest is a great way to *make friends.* If you go to those thinking you're gonna get a LinkedIn connection, you're not going to make any friends *or* connections. Go into those because you're interested in X, and the friends will follow. Doesn't need to be technical either. Go to a rock climbing meetup, go to a model train meetup, hell, go to your local dive bar and buy a stranger a drink and get to chatting. I've made life-long friends that way.The bad news is none of this is a quick fix. Making friends takes time. We're not disposable one-time use napkins that you toss in the bin as soon as you get what you want from us.

I'd go so far as to say it's only a matter of time at every company.It's a very common pattern for management/upper-management to get replaced, and for a company to tighten the belt and shift their culture to the toxic-side.That part's out of our control.What's in our control is how we react to it.WLB is my #1 priority. Even if a company tries to turn up the heat, and introduce toxic expectations.... I don't let it alter my WLB. I do the best work I can from 9-5, M-F. That's non-negotiable. Management can scream about deadlines, ping me after hours, etc all they want. Doesn't change anything about how I behave. At most a 5:30pm text will get is a ""OK, will take a look tomorrow morning"".There's an extremely clear divide between my work life and my personal life. This divide lets me disconnect after 5pm, no matter how much BS is going on during the work day, no matter how stressful it gets. That stress waits around for 9am the following work day.I've had companies ""tighten the belt"" before, but I've always stood my ground. If they fired me over it? Oh well, the culture was toxic anyways and I was already looking for another job. But in reality they never did. The last time this happened I even got a pretty massive *raise*.Toxic management *loves* to take advantage of people that don't establish any sort of boundaries. Really they'd be stupid not to, it's free labor. But when you establish boundaries as the employee, more often than not, nothing's going to happen.So whenever this happens to your company's culture, firstly establish boundaries and stick to them in the short-term to keep yourself sane.

A contract role as a consultant may be easier to land in this environment, and can help you build exactly that kind of experience.At the same time, starting a side project or business, something where you have to identify a customer need, build software for it, and try to monetize, can help you develop the kind of product thinking and entrepreneurial mindset that employers and clients increasingly value.",GordanFr33man,2025-07-21 18:09:17,17,cscareerquestions,t3_1m5poo0,False,

It might guess wrong sometimes and do some wasted work, but overall things happen way faster than if the cpu was just waiting around.Another analogy is like competitive games/sports.

I had a recruiter start harassing me on LinkedIn because I was being considered for a contract-to-hire role at Chase that was a higher rate than she was used to seeing. She kept trying to insist I was lying. I just blocked her. No good advice on how to network. You need to find people willing to talk to someone, effectively a stranger, for very little in return. It’s a challenge. I recently accepted some LinkedIn invites from random new grads from my college, but I had too many personal things come up to follow up with them. It’s a very hard market right now. You know that. It just takes more time and effort than normally. One thing I’d encourage you to do more of is learning and expanding your skillset. You say it’s been 7 months. You can learn quite a bit in time like that. Maybe you should try learning some things to make yourself a stronger candidate. AWS had a free tier.

Because they were small they didn’t have specific recruiters, it was the head of development usually interviewing me. I did have a personal project I had been working on and was excited about it. It wasn’t a standard tutorial or project that everyone had done. I like to think it was that my excitement about my project shined through, because at several places I pulled out my laptop to show the project, and each time it usually ended up with me doing 15 minutes of pair programming with them.

I've used it for that. No ads, small companies showup, companies with 0 postings show up. LinkedIn doesn't make it super obvious that's even an option, but it's here: [https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/companies](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/companies)Once I find a company, I go straight to that company's careers page to see the full picture of what they're hiring for. Pretty regularly the all-knowing LinkedIn job search algorithm shows me roles that aren't good fits for me, and hides ones that are good fits. When I'm on the company's website, I see *everything* they're hiring for., and can decide for myself what is/isn't a good fit.If they aren't hiring, I make a note of that, and I revisit them in a week. A company hiring 0 SWE's today, could literally be hiring 20 tomorrow. A lot of the job search is timing and luck, and LinkedIn is not good at that.Google is a great company search tool as well. ""Top X companies for WLB"", ""Up and coming companies in \[city\]"", ""Best companies in \[industry\]"", etc, etc, etc. There's tons of different search terms that turn up endless articles out there on Google that list tons companies.

I'll have a lot to talk about if someone asks about them, but it has done nothing to catch any attention, even on entry level listings.For those that are curious so they can judge for themselves; the first project is a WebSocket based chat server written in Go. It has message caching with Redis(Valkey), long term message storage via PostgreSQL, and an admin panel via React where admins can create chat channels, ban users, and search message history. The server was containerized with Docker compose and used Caddy as a reverse proxy with TLS. I did a basic chat client in Qt/QML and C++.The second project was a basic audio DAW/tracker where you could cache audio samples, sequence patterns, and play them back. It was in C++ and Qt/QML with RtAudio to create the audio stream. I had to explore multi-threading and lock-free design for this project and genuinely learned a lot. I even separated the gui from the audio engine and made my engine a static library, in case I wanted to switch away from Qt in the future.I know it's not a replacement for job experience, but they did nothing for me.

I'm just going to dump my thoughts on the interview process and how far I have to go still.I refused to accept I'm not good enough for this industry despite failing so much. It took me 1k+ applications, 20+ different position interviews, to get 1 decent offer (that is still a pretty big downgrade to my last 2 jobs).I have anxiety and have a low stress tolerance, so I was fighting twice as hard because I couldn't make myself study more than 1-2 hours a day + I would get super nervous during interviews and it made it very hard to recall what I studied for.Maybe it was because I took it easy for most of my work life, maybe I just was supposed to be interview prepping during down time. For whatever reason, I could not adapt to what it took to pass interviews.The random trivia questions just get me. I don't have memorized small little stuff like making random SQL queries verbally or specific syntax or concepts for coding languages. I've gotten better at it studying and getting live interviews for months - even then I'm still missing questions sometimes. I HATED that feeling of completely blanking out on something that sounds easy, but the pressure and the fact I just Google this stuff when I need it at work made it so hard for me.Part of it was me stretching the truth in my resume, but early on they wanted me to be able to talk more deeply about CI/CD, and cloud/devops + QA experience. I just didn't know that stuff and lost a lot of early interviews bc of that. After I studied some major concepts and talking points - it was good enough for most interviews but some people would DIG in and expose me.I'd get a small coding live assignment that would be similar to a homework you'd get in first/second year college - but you have 10-15 minutes to do it. I immensely struggled with the pressure even if it was ""easy"".  I started timing myself doing LC easies and pretend to try to simulate that pressure.I'd get Leetcode, the worst I saw was Mediums in interviews. I wasn't that good at it, but at least that one is straight forward on how to improve even if it's many hours and hard.I got a take home once + did one personal project, and used AI to make it. I then went back and revised it after it was working to make it feel more like ""my code"", and then studied the code base with AI until I could defend the entire codebase. I did end up passing that specific interview. I will admit, making a personal project in my stack did help a little when I was discussing trivia questions and concepts bc it was more fresh.I got system design in 2 dif interviews, failed them both. Maybe the landscape is changing with AI but I felt like system design for 3 YOE was very unfair. I did not study this stuff, I'll work on it studying on the job in addition to this other shit above.I think I got a lot better at behaviorals, but I don't think I had the best stories about what I accomplished at work at first.

If your country has a bias towards math degrees that's something to consider, but CS is prolly just a lot easier to convert into concrete/hard skills than math especially with respect to getting a job out of any of this. I actually really love math and theoretical CS, if you angle your CS course load correctly you could essentially study the overlap of both fields (Type theory and functional programming in CS has strong relationships with Logic and Category Theory in Mathematics). If you at all consider moving to another country, CS will prolly be a lot more immediately transferable.Unless you're interested in some specific fields of mathematics that don't lead into the CS route/lead into other career routes (analysis, probability theory, etc), go the CS route.Also as someone wanting to one day go into CS grad school, getting into CS grad school from math may not be impossible but it feels like it's definitely not as direct as having a CS bachelors ;-;Honestly, to me, CS and programming feels like applied algebra. Especially if you go in the functional programming direction and have a nice, strongly typed language with things like algebraic data types, designing a program getting statically analyzed by a compiler feels like algebraic mathematical thinking. Even if you're more of an imperative programmer or like low-level stuff, math actually is even farther away from that.

My main interests also involves scale and I'm interested in getting to work with companies that deal with high throughput or distributed systems. I graduated from a 3-4th tier uni in 2023 and only work at a Fortune 500 company in enterprise right now. I'm in the process of job searching and hope to land a job at big tech or adjacent within 6 months (fingers crossed) so I can work on more interesting problems and to relocate.I also have already applied to OMSCS and am awaiting decision for Spring 2026, but due to the aforementioned goals, I'm planning to defer my start date for a year to get a chance to job hop as well as to sit on the thought for a bit. I imagine you're also wishing to do the computing systems specialization as well? My main concerns with a masters also align with yours too - between the gym, hobbies, my gf - and the idea that I can simply redirect the time commitment to get hands on experience with my interests at work anyways.I've emailed a Meta Staff engineer who also had a masters and he mostly concluded with the popular opinion that it wasn't much useful outside of having a good time. I think for my case I can see that it can be a backup option for me in terms of better job security given a pessimistic market: for you, I feel that landing in Meta out of college is all the opportunity that you need :) If I was in your spot I think I'd forgo the masters and focus on the other important things in life, we spend too much time inside anyways. At the end of the day do you think you'll gain fulfillment out of it? If you're already at Meta the ROI probably isn't that high",yukiel_,2025-07-20 22:10:37,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1m50r5o,False,

n3wcbgp,"Eh kinda similar. I went to CC and transferred. I was great at math, but coding was a struggle for me. also loved physics, loved calculus. Anyway finally got coding down. So it honestly just made the understanding of math's role in all this more interesting. I recommend sticking with CS if you like math because it dips into math theory, if you've already taken discrete math. Also look into a math minor, due to the math usually needed in CS concentrations you complete a lot of the requirements by default and all you need to do is take 1 or 2 more classes.Anyway just to stoke your curiosity, want to learn a little more math theory? what about solving questions like seeing how long your search method might take to search for a value in a linked list of idk 1023456889 items?

n4nn4xs,"That's too nuanced a question. It all depends on what backend you're working on and who you're working for and where you're working from. Some companies will pay higher for ios than the backend. Others will pay much higher for competent backend work over ios work they don't value. If you've done ios work for a while and are bored, learning backend stuff is still a very valuable skill.

n4nxjhd,"Backend often does have a higher pay ceiling, especially at senior levels. The demand for experienced backend engineers who can handle complex distributed systems, databases, and infrastructure at scale typically outweighs the supply, driving salaries up. iOS development, while still well-compensated, has become more specialized and competitive.Backend roles also offer more diverse career paths that can lead to higher compensation. You can evolve into systems architecture, DevOps, or engineering management more easily than from mobile-specific roles. The skills transfer better across different companies and industries, giving you more negotiating power.However, the transition isn't trivial. Backend development requires different thinking about scalability, data modeling, and system design that takes time to master. You can use a service like Applyre to passively search for entry level roles. Consider whether your boredom with iOS stems from the work itself or just your current company's mobile projects. Sometimes switching companies or teams can reignite interest without requiring a complete skill pivot. That said, if you're genuinely drawn to backend challenges and want to maximize earning potential, the transition could be worthwhile given your existing programming foundation.",Significant_Soup2558,2025-07-23 05:45:23,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1m6zlmf,False,
n4p7685,"With few exceptions software engineering pay is a function of leadership scope, company type, location, and negotiation. Technical focus usually has a minimal impact.As a staff FAANG engineer in the SF Bay Area with competing offers you’d earn a multiple of what you’d make as a senior engineer where only one small private non-tech company is hiring in the Midwest. Lowest to highest compensation there’s about a 20:1 ratio within the US and 300:1 internationally.If you want to earn more learn leadership to multiply other people's impact. Salary is linear with level, bonus goes up with its square, and equity is exponential.Work for a growing public tech company which pays equity and bonus on top of base salary. With increasing level base salary becomes a minority of your compensation.Work in a US tech hub, ideally the San Francisco Bay Area. Pay is higher for comparable jobs and the abundance means you're more likely to have one available at a higher level which matches your specialization. The cost of living will be greater but you'll accumulate more with $300K compensation and $3K rent than $100K and $1K respectively.In theory you could make more as an AI/ML engineer, although by the time you can gain experience compensation will level out as supply and demand come into balance.",drew_eckhardt2,2025-07-23 12:16:05,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1m6zlmf,False,

n4o4gs3,"I guess it depends on what you are looking to learn, and specialize in?You can do any course (on Udemy for eg) on full stack development, front-end development, backend development, data engineering etc but it all depends on what goals you have and where you see yourself heading.Also IMO, with AI, technical skills are becoming more and more replaceable as it gets better, so don't neglect developing soft-skills as well since that can actually help you stand out from most other engineers, and something I personally also heavily utilized (in conjunction to technical books for improving my technical knowledge) to make greater impact, and get promotions.
