nkc469e,"I did this at my last job, reluctantly. I was forced to do it as part of an initiative to surface metrics and data transformations back to end-users, and one of the engineers refused to use production data to test the dashboards; it HAD to be a fully separate env, hooked up exactly to the app's staging env. The rest of the company already had a full pipeline but tied to prod.I thought it was a waste of time and money when I was forced to do it because the environment was fully read-only. And after I finally completed the project I thought the same thing. The only good purpose of the separate envs was that it made it a little easier to test security, but it wasn't like that was particularly difficult. It would have been probably just as much work to set up a way to mock production data in localhost, and overall way more useful for the company.So, we got it working ultimately (separate Airflow deployments and separate Snowflake accounts), but it was a pain in the ass. I had a somewhat informal way of managing Snowflake account level changes as migrations / IaC, and setting it up perfectly still took a while. (This also corresponded with a company wide push to formalize migrations of all db's into a new software.) Then the Airflow instance, oh boy. You don't realize just how many assumptions you make about envs until you have to formalize the ability to make an arbitrary multiple number of them. I thought I knew, but I didn't. Oh, also, your staging and prod data will be different in painful ways. Like imagine a JSON field stored as a varchar, but the staging env has some bullshit that's not a JSON. Yep, that's one of many things that happens when you try to run your prod data pipelines on the app's staging environment.Overall, not worth it. The setup I had originally is very simple: there's local and there's prod on a single Snowflake account. When you run commands locally, you hit a separate database for writes and transforms that are handled by the env vars. All reads are exactly from the prod data. All developers have full permissions in the local or dev or whatever you want to call them environments. There were also simple utils to help clone prod into dev for easy development.Moving to the multi env setup was not only months of my life neither me nor the company is getting back, but due to how MWAA works, it significantly increased the costs of the data platform.Shortly after I left, the engineer who wanted this colossal waste of time and money also left. Or maybe he was forced out. Cool.Honestly, at the point you're doing this sort of thing to support multi tenancy across genuine staging/prod envs, my advice is to scrap Airflow and Snowflake entirely. Go to something like Clickhouse and use materialized views to manage your pipelines so it's orchestration free.I also want to note another thing. Not a single internal data end user cared about this. This came from a single frontend app developer and was supported by upper mgmt because it sounds good on paper if you're a conventional SWE. Even though it's completely divorced from how internal data consumers use and contribute to data pipelines. What data scientists do is they train models and do analysis on prod data. They don't care about the developers' staging data because it doesn't represent or cover real usage. As you note in your post, this seems to be what they want to do, right? Except now you're finessing with data shares instead of just some simple IAM and permissions.Lastly, the place I left to, I setup their entire data infrastructure. I'm still on exactly ""local"" and ""prod"" in one Snowflake account, and I have no desire to ever change this. Actually, we do have a ""staging"" env for testing full CRUD being run against our OLAP db in the app's actual staging env. What it is, is: a clone of the prod db, cloned weekly, so that state is preserved within testing sessions but it also up to date with prod. Also, we do have a way to mock user sessions in our app's staging env. That works well enough! I will literally write javascript dashboards myself, or migrate to an entirely separate DB and delete our Airflow pipelines and switch to materialized views, before I spin up multiple envs to assist someone who won't put up with a minor inconvenience for them at the expense of multiple months of my own time.",riv3rtrip,2025-10-19 17:08:46,8,dataengineering,t3_1oajs0h,False,

If you don't consider how you want to manage Infrastructure in this new world you get to great my advice would be look at a reference architecture for a lake house on AWS. Ask your company to send you to re:Invent in December take hands onlabs for building data lakes (avoid any sales sessions just do hands on labs) you will come out with a better idea of what to do. Also take a BASIC terraform course. It will make everything better. It will be confusing at first but ChatGPT/Claude will get you most of the way there. AWS + Python gives you A LOT of options. IMO DBT is kinda shitty. SQL ETL's are ass, because you cannot really unit test these things effectively. Focus more on python (it will get you 90% of what you need for most use cases) look at serverless event driven architectures, less work less thinking long term but you need to monitor that shit and make sure the SPICE FLOWS! Postgres is fine. Your use cases determine your data persistence. If you don't have a lot of data don't over complicate shit use and RDBMS + Python, geter done.2. look back at 1. I personally don't think much of DEs that focused on DBT or Databricks they usually don't know much....sorry to say that but it's the truth. I want coders. I want people who understand distributed systems. I don't care if people know Redshift of Snowflake as long as they understand what those systems are...MPPs. That's abstracted from most DEs. It means Sr folks have to learn ya some shit about an MPP like redshift and snowflake both great infra but they cost and abstract aspects of what's going on under the hood. They are not a golden hammer. Look at the use cases. Postgres on aurora can bang out A LOT of DE use cases. Don't buy a destroyer class ship to manage bass fishing :Db. pyspark is a good thing to pick up. Understand when you want a python script v a pyspark script to run a job. Understand shit like Airflow and how you split compute from your orchestration layer. Airflow is not an ETL it's orchestration. ELT work and computer is done on other infra like an AWS lambda. As you go further focus on microservices, apis, event driven architectures stuff like that. c. AWS tools are legit DE tools you just gotta look at the right shit. Get a cursory understanding these AWS servies (timebox yourself to a few hours total here) EventBridge, Kinesis, Manage Ariflow, managed kafka, lambdas, glue, redshift. aurora(postgresql). Athena. You can solve pretty much all problems with these with out really managing much infra.

nk2gmz0,"1. In the modern data world partitioning should be approached with the following mindset: read patterns (increasing read performance by partition pruning), data distribution i.e. your partitioning should make sense in terms of how you organize the data in files AND partitions (avoiding small files and data skew, but also creating enough optimal sized files so you can parallelize reading), and considering your deployment/compute sizing so you can actually take advantage of the things you can do in parallel and scale accordingly (again has to do with how you organize your data in files). Although partitioning is a tool you can also use to “group” and “label” your data, like you mentioned, - e.g. being able to reprocess a subset of your data based on a label (processing time) - I would discourage you from using it like this. You have other tools for this purpose that will not hurt performance in the long run. Use partitioning as intended: a tool to distribute your data to ensure performant reads and scalability.2. If you don’t need an immutable bronze data use a lakehouse format straight away like Iceberg and do updates/merge. Optimize for copy-on-write or merge-on-read based on the volume of your late or dupe data. Do proper table maintenance for healthy filesizes and valuable snapshots. (This equals to SCD type 1 btw)If you need the raw data, you can do CDC in an extra column or in a side table. Just like in a regular DWH. You trade downstream performance for history granularity. (This is SCD type 2+)Note: Iceberg/Delta/Hudi are gold because they bring SQL and data warehousing back to big data.3. Look at 1.For idempotency you can also implement watermarking or something with the snapshoting/tagging/branching features of your lakehouse format. This “metadata” can carry the same information that you want to implement with the “processing time” partitioning. These are all small things that can help you, but ultimately idempotency and deterministic behavior should be achieved on the data pipeline level with whatever tools you have.

njlnodr,"You need to build what's called a ""data pipeline"" for this. The basic idea is that:* Transactional databases, like Postgres, and the table design for software backend databases are not optimized for analytical workloads.* If you intend to use that data in your dashboards, like you mentioned, you would have to do a lot of joins to denormalize the data.* Analytical usecases benefit heavily from denormalized data.* The idea is that you do the denormalization before the data gets to your BI tool, such as your existing Postgres database or an analytical database like BigQuery, Snowflake or whatnot, and create ""data models"".* These data models would effectively prepare the data to be consumed easily for analytical purposes, such as replacing foreign keys with actual names, calculating metrics beforehand, etc.* You can build these data models as database views, each defining the data model without persisting the data. From your BI tool's perspective this'll be as if there are denormalized tables, but when the tool queries these tables the view will be executed. * This works if your data is small, but it gets harder to maintain, debug, and scale for larger datasets.* The more maintainable alternative here is to build a ""data pipeline"": * The pipeline would get the raw data from the production systems, as well as any other external systems you need data from. * Builds data models using SQL and Python and persists them into the database. * Your BI tools then connects to the modeled tables instead. * This allows the queries to be more efficient and faster, since the data is pre-calculated. * This also makes analyzing this data easier in BI usecases. * The added benefit of this is that if you want to use a different BI tool tomorrow, or if you need to use this data in some other way than a BI tool, such as jupyter notebooks and python scripts, then the data is also usable for that.There are a bazillion different tools that allow you to build data pipelines. In your case, it could be as simple as starting with a few views on your Postgres database, and see how it works.

njq7mit,"Athena and Redshift are quite different tools. Redshift (2012) is a full data warehouse living on a cluster, you have to provision a cluster to store the table's data. It has an SQL query engine (optionally serverless) based on a proprietary, massively parallel processing columnar database engine and an old fork of PostgreSQL 8. It has its own specific table storage optimizations such as distribution styles and sort keys. It is designed for data warehousing and BI.Athena is newer (2016), and solely a query engine (based on open-source Trino by default, or Spark), so you need to manage the data storage in another tool, such as S3. It's designed for interactive querying on data lakes, while Glue is designed for ETL. Although it doesn't mean you can't use Athena for transformations, I just would not bet that it will be cheaper than Glue (serverless Spark) for production ETLs. The design of interactive query tools is usually made to be faster in exchange for more resources consumption, which may not be the best trade-off for production ETLs.Running Spark on EMR may be a cheaper way to run distributed SQL transformations on AWS, but then you have to deal with EMR cluster management.",sib_n,2025-10-16 02:00:32,6,dataengineering,t3_1o7kzhx,False,

nkf5ltf,"My ideas on demos have changed over the years. Keep in mind that Agile and the demo they talk about was not designed for data engineering, so you need to adapt. Showing how a pipeline now runs 20% faster, or how you’ve improved data accuracy by 30% is dry as hell and demos terribly. What demos well is actual apps (or web apps) and clicking through them showing shiny features and pictures.In my latest project my team is creating a data pipeline and suite of reports for a new product. Our stakeholders are regulators, so we don’t get to talk to them. We have internal product people that interface with them. One thing we have done is create a crude diagram of each of the models we are building in the DAG. If it was created in the past sprint I color them one way so they stand out. I don’t go into depth on what they do, the point here is for upper management, product, and others to see “oh there’s more green boxes than 2 weeks ago”. Pictures demo better than words, and this shows progress. Obviously this works for greenfield work and wouldn’t work as well for other work.A challenge we have had is that we get different personas joining our demos. Sometimes they are upper management who think they are still technical and they want to get into details. Other times they are product people who are curious about how we interpreted a particular requirement. Other times it’s upstream teams asking things about a particular interaction. Honestly, any interaction is good interaction. However, I have been absolutely terrible at predicting which part of the demo will get the most traction. This is probably a function of how demos operate though. We roll with the punches and answer what we can.I usually have 1 or 2 people demo something we delivered. Usually it’s a particular table/model, but I push for something that is novel. People love novelty. If the report is “select everything from this table and aggregate” then it’s not a good candidate. We recently had a report that had the goal of showing the transaction record that crossed a certain cumulative sum threshold. That’s novel, and so that is what I pushed the team to demo. There ended up being a lot of conversation around that approach and the validity of the requirements. Good, we want conversation and interaction.I try to rotate different people demoing work they have done so everyone gets their time to shine. I make it clear that the goal is to a degree sales. Sell your work. Brag. Explain what you thought was interesting or challenging or whatever. People will engage with that.I also bring up specific challenges. This last sprint we spun out on a particularly ambiguous requirement. Attempting to nail down that requirement resulted in not delivering one of the items in the sprint goal. I made sure to relate those 2 things and called it out. It’s not just about painting a rose colored story, it’s also about showing we do more than just sling data left to right.Numbers also tend to register with people. An old manager of mine used to have a slide for git metrics. “this sprint we added 2311 lines of code and removed 5541”. It seemed a little corny to me at the time, but in reality it adds to the perception of “oh this team Got Stuff Done”On the topic of numbers, mentioning them can also make you sound like you know what you are doing. This can be more useful in non-greenfield areas. For example: “this table has 110 million records in it and grows at the rate of 5 million per month. Each daily run varies from 150k to 175k and runs for 20 minutes” if the goal of your project is to reduce cost then you tie it to that “…and with our new special sauce, we save $20k/yr”. If it is to run things faster you could say “and now we have partitioned it in a way that we have 10 parallel jobs that complete in 2 minutes”. Tie what you are doing to the goals of the sprint or project.Sorry if these ideas are a bit unorganized, hopefully these help you.",raginjason,2025-10-20 03:05:41,5,dataengineering,t3_1ob6d1n,False,

nkeugps,"Medallion architecture is an introduction to layering data, but you may find you have more 'layers' than the basic three it introduces.You can help keep data secure by making use of those layers to provide different kinds of access as you move from 'less well defined classification' to 'more well defined classification'.Your initial as-is landing area and bronze can be set up to be not-queryable by end users. Here you can have unclassified data, and potentially have it unmasked. The only access to these areas is either the automated system, or users with elevated privileges who are accessing it for the specific purpose of classifying data and setting up automation for ingestion and transform to later layers.You should track the classification for each column to determine what kind of data it has. Is it personal data? Is it PII? Is it generic contact style PII (name, email, phone) or sensitive identity-theft-enabling PII like external identifiers or private information (license number, tax number, birth details, passport, etc). Those classifications help you to understand the security policy you place on the column.With a lakehouse you have the option to also separate the data in the storage layer. You can have separate buckets for pii or sensitive data, so that you can specifically track and audit access to the buckets, and a leak of any kind on the general data bucket does not leak sensitive data.You will need some kind of query portal that enforces column-level security for you. Something like SageMaker, for example. You will need to set up rules for automatically hiding/masking tables/columns that people cannot access. You need to make sure people don't have an alternative for accessing the data.There are tools you could point at your bronze data to scan for sensitive data. They won't be perfect but they're a good start. I believe AWS comprehend can do it, but there's a variety of 3rd party tools you can run.---The main point is your early areas are kept inaccessible to users, so that you can hold the data in an unclassified manner that allows you to do ingestion and classification work on it. Users can only access data through a system that enforces security and access controls on queries, and you only add data that has gone through that classificatio process.",azirale,2025-10-20 01:52:34,2,dataengineering,t3_1oagoef,False,

It is one of the main reasons that file based looks so attractive (but is actually data on beer goggles).Let me share a way that has dealt with this issue. First, and most important, how are you using the data? This is the key question and will be the reason for your upstream choices. This should be used to guide all your choices. See which final format fits your SLA and performance needs best. See how I am moving to objective and not subjective reasons?The final form has to also consider flexibility, expandability and scalability. Have at least some good assumption on these so that you can use more information to make the case.BTW, ETL is just the homework you have to do in order to get the data into the final form. Until it is queried, data has no value. Zero. That seems obvious, but you would be amazed the number of people that don't understand this.Is your boss also the data architect?

nk80q6p,"I don't know how much moolah you all got because it can be expensive, but Google BigQuery is really slick. I have been using it for a project this year and I'm super impressed with its feature set, Python API, command line tools, and web console. It is so amazingly fast performing scans on big datasets, too, and you get detailed information on every query about how much compute it used and how much data it scanned. Big plus in my opinion is that it is a SaaS offering so it relieves you from database admin burden (which I personally kind of detest doing, haha).If you have < 1 TB of data it could be a good solution. A full scan of 1 TB is $6.25, but you can avoid doing that very often with decent table optimizations like partitions and clustering or even duplicate tables with different optimizations, since the storage is cheap.

The library is a port of a bunch of Matlab scripts written by the scientists. There is an off-by-one error somewhere that's causing one certain array result to be shifted by one element; presumably the Matlab code is correct, but that's not a given.My previous task: there's a 20k-line C module written by a certifiable genius decades ago, and a newer C++ wrapper application that works in concert with it. One part of that C++ code has a method that needs to be called in a thread-safe way at certain times in the runtime lifecycle. Figure out where in the legacy C program that call belongs (perhaps multiple places), and add a line or two of code in those places.I've worked in very different code bases and industries, but it's often similar: the task may take four hours or four days, but often results in changing a ""0"" to a ""1"" or adding or rearranging a few lines of code.The fun and easy stuff, where you take a spec and write hundreds of lines of new code, that's all done by junior people.

Unless it is part of a documentation then stop using tutorials. Learn to read documentation. You should learn how and where to find an information from. And how to verify that it is true. Do not aim for the speed but aim for an understanding and quality of your code/project. Trial and error is acceptable. But learn from your errors to avoid making similar mistakes later on. It all will contribute into your learning journey.Come up with project ideas that have no tutorial for. For example ""Create a system where you are using WIFI signal to detect when somebody is in your home."" How? Which devices? Which approach? I leave it for you to figure it out. Such difficult projects make you look for alternative ways for solving your problems. May it be breaking down the project into smaller parts and implementing these smaller parts one by one. May it be reading different documentation and scientific research papers. Or something else.Stop trying to memorize your code. Try to understand the business logic of your code. Where which part does what? Imagine having to explain your project to your grandmother. She won't know what is an encapsulation, what is a compilation error, what is a nullpointer exception, what is a dependency injection, etc. But she might be able to understand when you are telling that ""This part here turns this photo into a text"", ""This part here sends out an email."" and stuff like this. Photo, text, email - these are words that a normal non-IT person can also understand. Start watching podcasts and other tech talks. There different software developers and system architects and such are discussing topics. Can be that the topic is way over your head but you will still hear about new concepts that you can later on look up in the Internet.Learn to teach and guide others.

Mid-sized businesses can't get loans. Companies aren't willing to spend as much money on advertisements, so sites like google, instagram, Facebook, etc. see their revenue go down. Consumers buy less products on Amazon.So everyone stops hiring, and then they start doing layoffs, which means people have even less money to spend on stuff, and the cycle continues to plummet downward into a recession.And that is what we're going through now.Are there some jobs being made obsolete by AI?

nju6zus,">I’ve been wondering about the best way to actually learn when following programming tutorials.IMO the best way is to avoid online tutorials entirely. Most of the tutorials you find online are articles on blogs or YouTube videos, and they tend to cover some specific topic. In order to get the big picture that you need when you're learning a new language or large framework, you'd need to read/watch dozens of those types of tutorials, often from multiple authors, and try to synthesize general knowledge from that hodgepodge of specifics. I'd avoid any book with the word ""cookbook"" in the title for the same reason.What you want when you're learning a big topic is a big, comprehensive source that was built to teach that larger topic from soup to nuts, so you take a well-planned path through all the material you need and get a single, coherent perspective. To me, that mostly means getting a good book and working your way through it, but courses like the ones offered online by Stanford, Harvard, etc. would also work well.",iOSCaleb,2025-10-16 18:26:30,1,learnprogramming,t3_1o85o0f,False,

njv8t84,"You could look at the assembly and see what the compiler is doing. In practice, the compiler will enter `main` and move the stack pointer some offset; this space behind the stack pointer will go back to the end of the stack frame - the stack frame contains the information of where to go when `main` returns. This is the space allocated for the local variables. For you, that'd be about 4 bytes on a typical dev machine. So when `value_giver` returns, the memory for the return value is already allocated, and the compiler will generate machine instructions to write it into this stack space.If you're curious, you could pick up a book on writing compilers, and function call conventions, virtual registers, register allocation via graph coloring, caching and swapping, virtual address spaces, and all sorts of fun theory put into practice.Typically compilers will generate machine code that all the local variables are allocated all at once, so this code: void fn() { int x; // Stuff... int y; // Stuff...The stack memory will look like: [fn frame][x][y][stack pointer]So even though `y` comes into scope later in the function code, all locals were allocated at once; it's just less work to do it this way, and the memory for `y` is inaccessible until the machine code that uses it comes into scope. Compilers don't have to do it this way, and the C standard says effectively nothing about machine code generation. C is a high level language that targets an abstract machine. The compiler projects that abstraction to the actual machine.As far as C is concerned, `a = 25` because that's the code you wrote. How it's realized depends on the compiler and the target architecture that is going to execute those instructions.To blow your mind - Charles Babbage designed the Analytical Engine - a purely mechanical clockwork digital computer. He never did get the funding to build it; some private investor spent millions of dollars and commissioned his earlier Difference Engine to be built, and it was completed and put on display in a London Museum for 2 years, before being brought into his private collection. All the Difference Engine does is compute logarithms.But the Analytical Engine was digitized and simulated - and it fucking worked. Earlier analysis of the design has shown IT IS Turing Complete, and it was indeed designed to be a general purpose computer. So being Turing Complete means it is exactly equivalent to your computer you're using right now - just mechanical and slower.

njxik0i,"Generally, the value is returned by the function and since a function call has ended, all the values that were put on the stack by the function (i.e. the stack frame with local variables, parameters and other data) can be deleted except for the return value. The return value is then on the stack and can be copied. In reality this is optimised, but in a very simple stack based system you just return the execution to where the function was called and then the assignment copies the value on the stack. The return type defines the width (how many bits/bytes) are on the stack. After that the next function call will write to the stack, overwriting that value.The stack, CPU registers, and pointers that control program execution and function calls make it all work. There's a pointer that tells the CPU which instruction to execute next. That's the ""Instruction Pointer"" (IP). It can ""jump"" to where a function and and then ""jump"" back when the function returns. The pointers can just be on the stack because stacking those addresses makes it easy. Since it uses a stack\*, it must know where on the stack the function has to work with local variables. The ""Stack Pointer"" (SP) simply points to the top of the stack (new stack frames go on ""top"" (usually a higher address). \* You could compile C code for a computer that doesn't use a stack but then the compiler would just generate code that creates a stack at runtime using the memory.

Programming is really one of the easier concepts in a CS curriculum. And Python is especially easy. I was taught Java at first (which I'm glad about). But I think you also need to either be wired to think like a programmer or you need to learn it. You will learn to think more analytically and you will learn how to solve problems. Or you will find out that that kind of thinking is just not for you.My advice is: Just stick with it. If you can find any joy or interest in programming, then stick with it. It will click some day. If the whole experience is just a drag to you, even after trying for months, that might mean that it's not for you. Also: Don't do it for the money. If you don't enjoy it, you'll be miserable.BTW: I barely passed my introductory programming course. But once I finished the practical course in the second semester, I was an A-B student when I came to practical programming courses.

That way, you won't feel discouraged for doing extra research or taking longer than others to figure things out...or you could just ignore that and stress out 24/7 :smirking_face:With that said, a lot of programmers are obsessed with the idea that learning it must be really difficult; if you can't do x thing in y way, then ""you're not cut out for it.""I find *that* ridiculous, just like I find the method to teach you for loops a little odd. Don't be afraid to take a few steps back and look up introductory courses to x concept and asking for a lot of guidance if you're stuck on something. If you wind up going further down this path, remember this - building usable programs is really important, even if they're very basic to start.My curriculum failed to even suggest that. We've never even built a basic calculator like you are now. This led to my growth in programming being at a near plateau for 2 years. I learned theory, syntax, and basic concepts but never actually trained the most important aspect of a programmer - solving problems. A programmer is a problem-solver who uses tools (languages, functions, etc) to solve them. That's why many people emphasize solving the problem with writing out diagrams, pictures, words, etc, then turning that into psuedocode you can easily follow. Here's a simple way breaking the problem down would look like:- If I receive 2 numbers, let's say 6 and 2, what would the end result be? 12? - How would I get from my base numbers to get to 12 while only adding? Adding by 2, 6 times?- How do I make my program loop by 6 times?- How do I make sure I correctly add 2 each time in that loop? - How do I see if my end result is 12?- How do I replace my numbers 6 and 2 with variables? - Would I get the same result assigning 6 and 2 to those variables before the loop?- How do I get user input to achieve the same result?So on and so forth. Maybe add some psuedocode to give a basic idea of how it would flow in code. Building a bigger program would follow a similar process. Whenever you break down a problem but get stuck on breaking it down further for x, y, z reasons, that might be a good indicator of searching up a little more about x, y, and z.Hope that helps!

For example, knowing how to read and manipulate data, automate checks, or interact with embedded systems can have a huge impact in your day-to-day work without touching full-scale R&D projects.I’d suggest focusing on small, hands-on projects that directly improve what you’re already doing. Maybe write scripts to log system data, automate routine diagnostics, or build simple tools for troubleshooting.

For projects, start tiny like a calculator, a to-do list app, or a small scraper, so you can actually finish something and feel progress. It’s also useful to get comfortable with Git/GitHub early; version control is super important even for small projects. Once you’re comfortable, branch out.

Make the repo(s) public (watch for secrets and personal data etc.).If you have a website too I might visit it, but 95% chance I won't. 1% chance I look at any of the code in the repos. We just don't have time for that, generally. I'll just look at the repo README to see what it is, then move on. With this in mind, it's a good idea to spend a bit of time on the README, telling me the details I need to know ""above the fold"" (without having to scroll down) like what the project is/does, where it runs, key technologies used etc. In a few formatted sentences or bullet points. I will never ever ever pull+build+run your projects. Again, I've got tens more candidates to screen, so anything you can do to dial back the bullshit, not add to it, is great. (E.g. I once passed on a candidate that had an obnoxious loading message on his website whilst his unnecessarily large front end bundle loaded and hydrated taking seconds to do all these fancy JS things. The exact opposite of impressive.)You don't need to deploy things, but if there's a convenient link in the README I will probably click it just to see what you built. I won't run through the features or anything unless it's a button push.Saved on your computer is only useful if you're screen sharing for a demo or something, like in an interview. Maybe have a local copy checked out and built in case you get the opportunity to demo or something. I would look positively on a candidate offering to show me a project we are discussing actually running, even if I didn't take them up on it.Doesn't matter for recruiters. Most of them are even less likely than us to look at projects in detail, they just pass these things along to client firms. Occasionally you get a recruiter that will click around but their feedback probably isn't very valuable in all honesty. They'll focus more on your CV itself and experience etc.In general don't worry too much. If we want to see you code we'll set a test (live, take-home etc.) as repo code could have come from anywhere and doesn't tell us much. Honestly, I mostly use projects to gauge the level of interest a candidate has in writing software, not their actual ability, as we expect that to be low at entry level.

njy799i,"> I heard of something called Static Site Generation, the concept of which I haven't been able to fully understand yet. Could this be the solution to what I'm trying to do?It could be sufficient for your purposes, but more of an alternative to using React. Likely the technique you're looking for is what we call templating. It's also what SSGs use.I'm not personally familiar with react so I can't give an exact answer for your situation, but one common type of templating is [jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), where you can have a template like `hello {{name}}` (which you should be familiar with from basic string interpolation), and logic like `{% for name in names %}hello {{name}}{% endfor %}`.Static site generators essentially use templates to produce static HTML that you can serve to people through stuff like github pager, a simple Apache webserver, etc. Usually it involves some setup in terms of theming and what you want headers, footers, etc to be, and then you can do stuff like add blog posts written in Markdown with minimal effort.You can find static site generators in pretty much any language. Some commonly used ones include* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (Ruby)* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (Go)* [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) (Rust, but more special-purpose)Some of the ones I've used include* [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) (node.js)* [hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) (Haskell)You can find [a list of SSGs on jamstack](https://jamstack.org/generators/). There's 370 of them currently, some general-purpose, some special-purpose.

In my case it was building an encyclopedia - based on the entry title in the url, it would grab information about that entry from the backend database and populate the template's title, description, etc, with that information.Anyway, I don't know enough about React to say exactly how you would do it, but it might be worth looking into seeing if the router you're using has any kind of dynamic routing as an option and go from there.",0bn0x10s1337sp34k,2025-10-17 17:27:16,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o8upxz,False,

njvjnly,"Write an HTTP server.HTTP is a text based protocol, and you can get away with just implementing GET and POST - and you don't even need the whole thing - you can just ignore authentication, for example. You generate an HTTP response IN TEXT. It's all text. That's the point of this exercise.Seriously, don't overthink it - it's not hard. You're not writing a complete web server, you just need to read text from a stream, figure out what message type you got, and service it.You can write main in terms of `std::cin` and `std::cout`. What makes standard IO so special is that you can use the `netcat` command to open a listening socket on port 8080, and launch an instance of your program - `netcat` will establish the TCP stream for you, and redirect all IO to your program's standard IO. So here you're coding against `std::cin` and `std::cout`, and in reality, it's coming from a TCP socket over a pipe across the network.Now you can just hit the localhost loopback device with a web browser on port 8080, and your program just reads `std::cin` to process the GET request, and you write back a payload with the most barebones HTML that says ""Hello World!"" in it. Or maybe some JSON, or XML, since both those are transport protocols - you can just write it raw, you don't need a template engine that processes JSON or anything like that.But you could... If you get ambitious...You can also use `telnet` or `curl` to interact with your little server and see a more raw view, or the developer tools built into the browser - whatever those do...As for your code, OOP is message passing to objects, so you can implement a couple message types: class GET {}; class POST {}; using request = std::variant; std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, request &);The stream operator will start to parse out the HTTP request, determine the request type, and then create the corresponding variant type. This makes this stream operator here a factory method. Once you get as far as knowing the message type, you could defer to the message type instance to populate itself from the stream: class GET { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, GET &); }; class POST { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, POST &); };You'll probably want a response message: class response { friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &, const response &); };To make an object, you make it streamable: class http_server: public std::streambuf {};If you want to parse text, you overload a couple things: class http_server: public std::streambuf { int_type underflow() override, overflow(int_type) override; };And you can plug that into a stream: http_server svr; std::iostream ios{&svr};You can make a number of these, for being different kinds of processors and handlers and stages that all perform steps. Messages move content, objects do work. This is OOP in C++. This is why Bjarne invented C++, because he wanted more control over message passing, and he wanted greater type safety than either Smalltalk or C. Streams are the interface - and frankly you can bypass the stream implementations almost completely if you're messaging internally in your application - you don't have to serialize to text all the damn time. There's a lot you can do with OOP if you think in terms of objects and messages.I demonstrate these principles in past posts of mine, I spend most of my Reddit time answering C++ questions on Reddit, so look up a couple of my past examples.But if you can implement objects and message passing as OOP intended, I think you'll show your professor something he's almost certainly never seen in his life. MOST people can't even tell you what OOP IS, because they've never seen it themselves, before. Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism? These principles are NOT OOP, they just come OUT of OOP. These principles exist in other paradigms, too. You've got polymorphism in everything from imperative programming to functional programming, for example. Most C++ code is C with Classes because people don't know what they're doing - garbage in, garbage out. I've spoken to other developers who understand OOP, but in 30 years I've never actually met one in real life, never worked with one. I've worked with a Windows 95/DirectX/COM co-author, I've worked with the former maintainer of the Intel Fortran compiler (and that's a big fucking deal, since it's used on all the worlds supercomputers), and I've shown them this stuff, how Bjarne writes code, and they've never seen anything like it before.",mredding,2025-10-16 22:40:33,3,learnprogramming,t3_1o8hxas,False,

njkqvzh,"First, think about who will use the app and where. If it's just you on one computer, the easiest way is Python with Flask. Flask lets you make a simple website to view and edit data, and SQLite can store everything in a single file. You will need a backup plan for the database, but it's simple and doesn't require a server.If multiple people need access at the same time, you will need a server and a proper database. Node.js lets you run JavaScript on the server to handle multiple users. A NoSQL database like MongoDB is easier than SQL for beginners because you don't have to plan tables and relationships in advance. You can just add new fields as you go (Useful if they later need to add random stuff they forgot to mention). An online database just means the database lives on a server everyone can access, but it requires hosting, security, and backups. There are generous free tiers but it adds complexity.For now, start small with Flask and SQLite on your own computer as a demo. Focus on the key features, tracking animals, medications, and volunteer logs. Once it works, you can think about scaling it with Node.js and MongoDB if more people need access or using something like Pymongo to keep using your Flask app instead of redoing it in Node.js.What you are building is a basic CRUD app with a form to add new animals and a table to view them. It's simple enough that an AI could probably build it for you. If you want to learn, use AI as a tutor or guide so you don't get lost. Keep it simple.

nk6hzvt,"If you’re looking to get back into programming and want something practical that you can tinker with, leaning on languages like Java and C# (.NET) is a solid choice. Both are mature, widely supported, and have a lot of libraries that can make building things like a hotel PMS or a roster scheduler much more manageable. Java will give you platform independence, so you could run your programs on Windows, Linux, or Mac without much hassle, while C# and .NET are extremely well-integrated into Windows environments and offer rapid development with a lot of built-in UI frameworks. For your particular projects, SQL is going to be almost unavoidable if you want to store reservations, employee details, or scheduling data efficiently. Learning to combine either Java or C# with a relational database like MariaDB would cover most of what you need, and it’s exactly how most professional systems handle persistent data.For the hotel PMS, even if you already use Opera Cloud, building your own simplified version can be a great learning experience. You’ll get hands-on insight into the data structures and workflows behind reservations, room management, and billing, which will inform your understanding of what a full-scale system does behind the scenes. For the roster builder, the challenge lies more in logic and rules enforcement—handling days off, labor law restrictions, and employee availability can be complex, and practicing this in code will improve your problem-solving skills more than anything else. You could start simple, storing employee information and preferences in a database, then gradually implement more advanced scheduling algorithms as you learn.Here me out though: some of the most efficient POS systems ever made weren’t built on top of an operating system at all—they were written in assembly language. By coding directly to the hardware, developers could squeeze out incredible speed and reliability, especially in environments where every millisecond counts, like retail or hospitality checkout systems. Modern frameworks make development faster and easier, but looking at those old systems is a good reminder that understanding what’s happening at the low level can make you a much stronger programmer, even if you never touch assembly yourself. It’s all about learning how things work under the hood, and how your high-level code translates into actual performance. This also saves a ton of money on client end systems as the hardware doesn't need to support a full operating system since you've built it to be application specific. You wouldn't use a pc for what you can do with a 5 buck Arduino.If you're willing to learn a new language though, I'd recommend c++ as you can compile it for any operating system.",bringrainfire,2025-10-18 18:24:43,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oa2us3,False,

This is a static table of function pointers - each abstract class and derived class has it's own table. Your instance points to its table.So then, if you have a `B` instance, but through type erasure you only have an `A` pointer, then calling a method will undergo a lookup so the correct implementation is called.Maybe.The vtable only contains entries for `virtual` methods. In your example, the only entry in the vtable of both `A` and `B` will be for `print`. You didn't make `~A` virtual, so when you `delete a`, the compiler doesn't know `a` is pointing to a `B`. The compiler only knows the non-virtual interface presented to it through the `A` type.---If you google OOP in C, you can find tutorials for building objects in C, including modeling inheritance, and polymorphism. The object code generated by this exercise typically matches the C++ equivalent exactly. The first C++ compiler - CFront, was originally a transpiler to C.So why not just use C? Because the two languages have different type systems. C++ grants you much more type safety - and type safety is more than just catching errors; compilers are theorem provers, and they use type information in order to optimize more aggressively.

If you know that you will never extend the class or you know that it will never be destroyed via a base class pointer, then maybe not.

You have to decide for yourself when to follow them.In this particular case, splitting out repeated code into a common function created a lot of value for you. Not only did it make your code shorter, but if you ever need to modify that logic you only need to do it once.In terms of the name, I think you're focused on describing how it works rather than what it does. It sounds like you have a function that retrieves data and caches it. You could just call it fetchAndCache. Or you could describe in more detail what API it calls and what sort of data it fetches and we could help you come up with a better name.It's not immediately obvious to me that the one function violates SRP. Even though it does multiple steps, if those steps are all related and all necessary for your code, then that may very well be a single responsibility.Furthermore, splitting it up into three separate functions didn't actually help anything. It didn't reduce your total lines of code. It didn't help reusability.That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, just that there's less clear benefit. Don't do it because you think you're ""supposed to"".>So according to SRP I need to destroy old function and in the place when it was 1 line call I need to past three lines chain in each place instead.I don't think that's what SRP says.Doing three related things that often need to be done together can be a single responsibility.SRP just suggests that if a function is doing multiple \*unrelated\* things, try to split them apart.

If the process a particular responsibility is a series of small tasks that *must* be grouped together, there's no strong argument against it, especially if it makes the code easier to reason about and reuse elsewhereIf you find later that you need to move the marshaling/unmarshaling out of that function for some reason you can do it later,  very little actually prevents thisOne thing I have found to be helpful is that DRY can be interpreted to mean ""Don't Repeat Yourself"" but it can also simultaneously be understood as ""Don't Repeat *Information*"" or DRI. So what does this mean exactly; it could be a caution against extracting logic when the information it's working with is very different from other forms of information that might be outbound/inbound to this kind of call. So while having a one-stop function for things like payload validation and Redis caching might sound nice, consider that the language and packages/libraries you're using are already doing that for you, and you adding more function calls as wrappers around those library functions may just be walling off even more utility and making your own code more inflexible",StickOnReddit,2025-10-19 01:58:00,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oa8oec,False,

Because if any of the three changes, it shouldn't affect the other two. So **you are better of with having three separate functions**, requestData, validateData and storeData.And of course you need a fourth function that uses those three, but don't call it something generic like `requestTokensThenExtractThenStore` \- use a better abstraction that fits in with what your application uses the data for. Could be `cacheParseTokensLocally()` or `buildNavigationStructure()` or `retrieveCustomerData()`.Naming is the hardest part - but don't think too much of what the function does, think more about where the function is used: what name would make sense to the programmer using it?",peterlinddk,2025-10-19 10:05:10,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oa8oec,False,

njh9rqm,"Man, let’s be real, the job market right now is ridiculous. There’s a huge gap between the skills companies actually need and the number of people already trained and looking for work. So you end up with fewer openings and way too many applicants, and let’s not even talk about how low the salaries companies are offering these days. It’s not just tech either, people are getting degrees in fields like anthropology or psychology, and unless they go all the way to a PhD, they’re stuck in an endless loop of not having enough experience. The good thing is your degree is still super relevant to today’s needs.I think you should get your resume in front of as many people as possible. Find companies in your area where you’d actually like to work and reach out to people in the departments you’re interested in. Tell them your situation, ask if they know of any openings, and see if they’re willing to help or give some guidance. It’s not a guaranteed solution, but it really does increase your chances. If you’re open to remote work, check out [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemoteJobseekers/comments/1fdpeg2/how_i_landed_multiple_remote_job_offers_my_remote/); it shares a simple but effective way to send your resume to hundreds of companies.And don’t forget, all the jobs you’ve done to get by still matter.

I took 3 months off just like you, even spent a good chunk of my severance like an idiot.I spend the next 9 months looking for a job, I was out of work over a year. I ran out of cash, and I was 30-40k in debt on maxed out credit cards. I was borrowing money from friends to make the bills work and out of unemployment checks.My old company (the one that laid me off) called me up, they had an ugly project and were looking for current/ex-employees who had reputations for putting in the hours/work. Wanted to hire me as a contractor, I negotiated an hourly rate, and hopped a plane to chicago, worked remote there for over 9 months, nights/weekends... 80+ hour weeks. That hourly contract rate paid off all my debt, paid back my friends, got me a new car and a nest egg.That contract paid me more in 6-9 month of work then they'd have paid me if they'd just kept me employed during the year I was laid off plus the 6-9 months. It was silly. They hired me back full time to save money.About 8 months later I landed a job in my dream industry and happily walked away from them.Point of my story? It's rough. Being laid off sucks. We can all make mistakes. You may have to do things you don't like to recover. But you can and will recover given enough time. Hang in there. Do what you have to do to make ends meet.Edit: I should add since then I've ""lost my job"" to layoffs several more times in the proceeding years.

You're also basically on the weeds immediately of figuring out things like cross-functional communication and collaboration, prioritization of value generation vs maintainability based on expected impact and necessity, autonomy and ownership etc...Hence, why its the ""senior junior"" situation. You speed run learning some senior skills while potentially missing out on some of the more mid-level things like adhering to team styling, some knowledge gaps that come from needing to ship and not having the time or team for learning more about developing in a mature project, learning about choosing when to apply design patterns etc...Those things tend to come about from a bit slower of a pace where engineers can be deeper on engineering rather than making sure market fit has been established, runway is secured, and good enough is more important than scaling and maintaining due to the rapid nature of changing demands.But, as I said, that isn't for everyone which is okay. It also qualifies you much more towards startups/early/growth since the dynamics and environment, as well as associated skills and knowledge, aren't the same as more matured process and product.

Living at work, sleeping there, working through weekends, 60-70h weeks were seen as a sign of passion and loving your job rather than dysfunction. That was not the norm in most careers.Second, LOTS of passion in this industry. Or at least, there was. Any industry that attracts passionate people who love the idea of the work has problems with burnout.Third, it's a type of work that many people find they really put themselves deeply into. You have to defend your ideas, work as part of a team, take ownership. You are seen as an expert, a go to person. You have special knowledge no one else has. All of that further encourages people to go all in.Finally, for a long time the MONEY you could get at the top of the field was insane. But also random. Working harder and making yoru company succeed could be the difference between a nice middle class life and being a billionaire.

njzqzqb,"Capitalism as a system has two primary oppositional parties: the owners and the workers. Owners want to maximize their own profit, so it is in the owner's best interest to pay the worker as little as possible, and to work the worker as long as possible. This is made worse by the fact that profit under capitalism actually tends to fall over time, since capitalism is quite good at making things more efficient it tends to overproduce things in the long run, devaluing the products it produces, meaning often the only way to squeeze out more profit is by squeezing the workers.The workers in IT fields are well paid (still much less than the actual value they provide to the company), but work long hours, frequently more than full time, in order to meet arbitrary deadlines and push profits to an extreme. This work is highly mentally taxing contributing to burnout. Additionally globalization, outsourcing, and complacency due to high salaries makes demands for better working environments difficult.edit: To make things worse, since the 2010s tech companies have been relying on an extremely loan heavy monetary strategy due to low interest rates which actually requires profits to grow exponentially in order to pay their loans back, but this strategy is beginning to falter due to problems like ""running out of people on the planet to sell to"", and ""2% higher interest rates to combat hyper inflation caused by tech company speculative circle jerking"", and ""loans coming due"".

I'd say from the beginning. CompE grew out of EE as a specialization in the 90s. Every CompE job will hire EE especially if you dump electives in CompE, but not the reverse. None of the EE work I did would interview a CompE. EE degree broadness is its strength. Power plant work? Power always needs EE/ME/ChemE.*But really, the reason EE is better is because of insane CompE overcrowding*. Same problem with CS. [Sort here](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market#--:explore:outcomes-by-major) by unemployment. Factoring in difficulty, CompE probably is the worst degree of all. Where I went, expected time to graduate is 4.0 years for CS, 4.4 for EE and 4.6 for CompE.***I can give specifics. I went to Virginia Tech when CompE enrollment was 3x smaller than EE and the job market looked equally good for both. Not anymore. [Check out](https://web.archive.org/web/20240813115247/https://ece.vt.edu/undergrad/enrollment.html) our degree and enrollment stats.

CompE job market is competitive as hell and the squeeze is worse if you aren't attending Tier 1.***I'm not saying everyone abandon CompE. If you have to-have to work in hardware then get the specialized hardware degree. Or if you can't handle or hate the ludicrous EE math, very little of which you will likely use IRL.

Around the time front end frameworks started to become a thing, the company I was working at began asking people to choose between front end and backend, and I went front end. In my experience, there are a lot of roles out there where most of the work is on the front end, but knowing enough about the backend to add a simple endpoint is valuable. If you want to move from front end to backend, those roles can make a good gateway.I find that there are a lot of interesting technical challenges to be found on the front end, and that if you focus on solving those, there are lot of great opportunities for more senior front end roles. But, you have to be very intentional about focusing on problems of performance and architecture. If you get caught up in building forms or even focusing on interesting UX components, your job stays very small. But, it doesn't seem like that sort of work is ever fully going away.It's worth noting that the top architectural roles at companies tend to be held by people with strong backend experience. If you want to design full systems, you are unlikely to get there until you also get some solid backend experience under your belt.I went from a full stack role with a front end focus into management. I've managed a mix of full stack engineers with a front end focus and pure front end engineers. Being more front end focused does limit my options for management roles a bit because there are some companies that want highly technical managers with lots of experience across their stack.

I could've just quickly box-checked the task and closed the ticket but instead I dug about to understand the whole CICD pipeline and why the dependency even existed. I concluded it was way too complicated for what it did because it relied upon a convoluted ECS implementation to serve the frontend for no discernible reason (SPA , no server side rendering, never will need it given it's internal tooling with no need for major performance focus). I implemented a much simpler / cheaper way of hosting it as static content in S3 and ran it in parallel in dev as proof of concept.I spoke with our engineering manager who agreed it was a preferable approach and now we're integrating it to reduce architectural / build complexity.My point being, don't just take tickets to solve the immediate problem. See if you can solve the upstream problem too. My initial ticket was some version bump needed of a dependency for security reasons but the underlying problem was that we were managing unnecessarily complex infrastructure to serve up a basic SPA frontend.

nk6rsk7,"I wrote some Foxbase code on SCO Xenix for a dog track company in 1989 lol. I'd wonder if that was me but my naming conventions didn't include film stars. There was a compiled DBase III (Which Foxbase was based on) language called Clipper. My first job included some Clipper development in a MSDOS environment. In that same position I found that OS/2 and a third party multitasking DOS (which I think was built by the same guys who did Dr Dos) called DRM Dos were able to run the Clipper applications. The closest thing my company had to a ""Server"" application was a restaurant reservation application that I developed that ran on multiple terminals hanging off a 386 running Drm Dos.The oldest thing I've run across since then was a Motif application that a Satellite company was maintaining (*Edit:* This was in 2015). The oldest comments were from the mid 90's and some of the functions still used K&R function declaration syntax. I'd actually experimented with Motif while I was working at my first job, so I had bit of an advantage there.Their code actually generated three executables and shared a header file which declared 400+ global variables -- ALL the variables used in the application, pretty much. There were multiple places where global variables were mirrored -- another variable was created that duplicated the intent of an earlier variable. I was unable to determine if this was because they forgot the other variable existed or they weren't sure they could change the variable safely because some other function might need it set to a specific value at some later point. Probably a bit of both. This meant that you'd have to find the variable that was shared between the various functions of the code you were working on right now and insure that you were changing the right mirrored variable. You'd also have to hope that those changes wouldn't break some other functionality of the application. And yes, that was every bit as bad as it sounds.I went in with a philosophy of never adding another global variable to the code unless it resulted in the removal of at least two others. They were unwilling to do anything major with the code and everyone in that building got laid off a bit later, before I had a chance to really get it under control. Hopefully that entire code base was simply deleted after that. That abomination should not have been allowed to continue past that point.I'd say I'd seen worse code over the years, but only a couple of other cases I can think of where I'd actually define the code as ""an abomination."" All the code that I would describe as ""an abomination"" was developed by developers who clearly didn't know what they were doing in the least, because ""Global variables bad"" was something they were already teaching in college in the early and mid 80's.

A few things about a masters, it absolutely can help you get a job if you’re struggling to get one now. However, you need to have a complete mental shift if you decide to get a masters. A masters will be entirely worthless if you view it as just more school. You should treat it like a job which means you should take the hard classes intentionally, if you look for easy A’s you’re wasting your time and money. You should also get involved in graduate research (this is also how you might be able to get the school to pay for your degree + a monthly stipend). Doing research is free experience that can help you land an internship and/or a job. Talking about my graduate research during an interview is probably how I got my first job. This means you need to go to a graduate school that is a notable research institution. Also note that Trump has gutted NSF funding so some PhD programs are not even fully sponsored now and they will certainly get sponsorship priority over a grad student. I can answer more questions if you have any but if you wasted your undergrad you’re probably going to have a hard time getting into a worthwhile graduate program and even harder time getting it paid for.

First off, it’s completely valid to feel drained and frustrated; you’re juggling a lot, and taking care of your mental health is just as important as academics.From my experience, a degree DOES help open doors, especially early in tech, but it’s not the only path. Many people build careers through certifications, strong portfolios, internships, and practical experience. What matters most is demonstrating that you can solve problems, learn quickly, and contribute.If you enjoy programming, it’s worth thinking about ways to keep doing it without burning out. That could mean continuing your degree at a slower pace, taking a break, or focusing on building projects and internships that align with your goals. Leadership and managerial roles come later, and they often care more about results and experience than the exact degree.Honestly, there’s no perfect answer. Try weighing what will keep you motivated and learning while protecting your well-being.

I acknowledge myself privileged as my parents were willing to cover the expenses of grad school, but even if you need to take out a loan, I think grad school really does provide a second chance. What I did was enroll as a summer start, and for my first courses forced myself to take advanced DSA and architecture. I struggle with motivation on my own, but having a grade attached to my DSA skills forced me to grind the shit out of leetcode, and put me in a position to actually pass OAs. As for experience, I took 2 unpaid internships. Yes it sucks and is lowkey a scam, but it got something on my resume for this fall, and also forced me to learn relevant skills.

It lacks structure, has inconsistent code quality, minimal error handling, and an unresponsive, buggy UI. It feels like it was built without clear architecture or professional standards. The codebase is massive, so theres only so much I can do about this.And man, I totally get what you mean... we’re also using a modern stack, but the software engineering practices are also a mess...> At my company, getting a master's degree leads to a promotion quicker from L2 to L3, and I am thinking if I get a master's degree, especially in the AI/ML space, it will help me in the future when it comes to my career and opening up more jobs. However, doing this will keep me stuck at the company for several years and I won't be able to leave until 1 year after I have obtained the degree.I actually had the same thought you did and decided to go for an MSCS with an AI specialization. I’m over halfway done now, and honestly, I do feel kind of stuck. Not bc I have to stay for the tuition payback or anything (it’s cheap enough that I wouldn’t care if they wanted it back), but bc I’ve gotten used to this job now as working from home makes it super easy to balance work, life, and school. So even though I think about switching jobs almost every day, I haven’t actually applied anywhere. I just want to finish my MS first and then move on. And this job gives me the best balance for now since the school workload is kind of insane, and I don’t think I could handle it without having a WFH job.So...if you’re thinking about doing it, I’d say give it a shot, but just underatand it’s a huge time sink that sometimes I still wonder if I’d be better off just grinding LC and prepping for interviews instead of doing this MSCS...

Keep at it, I have seen friends of mine switch to better (for them) companies with a solid promotion, and while they said it was hard, it did happen with some persistence!",bluegrassclimber,2025-10-15 14:39:48,1,cscareerquestions,t1_njmfbv9,False,
njmyo96,"Same! Keep at the interviewing. Honestly, I didn’t expect to get this one, I was thinking it would be a good experience to interview and never considered they would actually make me an offer. They even pointed out all my wrong answers, which is confusing because I wouldn’t have hired me. I ran out of time to study, so just winged it.",miz_w,2025-10-15 15:36:10,1,cscareerquestions,t1_njmna31,True,

nkhnzt8,I remember the previous post. I'm pretty sure the general consensus was that it's a terrible idea. The need to focus so much all the time is literally what being a SWE is like daily.

nkhy57r,"And I'll reiterate what I said last time. There is more to life than money (see studies that show there is an income cap where money contributes directly to happiness if you are a person who needs some sort of evidence) and we only live once. That doesn't mean do anything and everything with reckless abandon, but if there is very low financial risk involved for you two, why wouldn't you want to experience more or try something new?Addendum: I'm saying this as someone who is a father of 2 young kids and we currently aren't in a very strong financial position. I think there may be some bias from people's own circumstances, whether that be financial or current state of the tech job market, etc... that bleeds into opinion because of the ""if I were you"" perspective while thinking more about the ""I"" part than what it's like to be ""you.""",Basting_Rootwalla,2025-10-20 20:51:21,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1obr8xn,False,
