If you are not influential on your team, discuss with someone who is and work a plan. Come with some ideas for solutions rather than just complaints and figure out how to present them. e.g. switch to a Kanban-style workflow; keep the backlog groomed and in prioritized order; for tickets with firm deadlines find a way to indicate the deadline so it gets prioritized correctly. Each person works on only one active story at a time until it is in a review stage where they are waiting on approval to merge. Only then do they pick up the next story on the backlog assigned to them.This gives a clarity to bottlenecks, and focus to what is in progress as it is limited at any given time. It forces clear prioritization of the work each person needs to do next: if a new urgent task comes in, it's set appropriately at or near the top of the backlog. Other items naturally shift down.It does require constant grooming & prioritization, and attention to velocity to ensure the lack of sprint deadline does not cause people to slack off. In addition to that, you can start the week off with everyone stating their goal(s) for the week based on what they know right then. ( in a shared document) \- As the week progresses, each person jots a quick note here or there on anything that prevent completion, whether changing priorities, lack of information needed from others, blocking issues, etc. Or you check off the stuff you have completed in some way. \- At end of week, status is left as it is; the next week a new section is created for that week, and you don't go back and clean up the previous week's notes or ticket status.Over time you can read back and see the patterns of *why* work is typically underestimated.",Fun_Independent_7529,2025-05-26 13:49:59,39,dataengineering,t3_1kvtz7d,False,

muj0rr3,"I'm brand new to DE. I wanted to type up a pretty detailed summary of what I've learned about all of these tools and formats recently, when looking at what stack to use for my app's pipeline but, unfortunately, my hands are fucked... arthritis is definitely coming for me.My super short summary, then, is that traditional databases use a proprietary file format to store data ""inside"" of the database (meaning it's not a file you can find in your file explorer and open); modern tools like DuckDB provide a query engine and enable SQL queries to be run on open-source file formats like parquet. Importantly, for my understanding, you can run DuckDB queries over many parquet files as if they were a single table.For me, this has shifted the way I view what a ""database"" really is. I used to think of it as the thing that stored data and let me query it. Now, I view the query engine and the stored data as two separate things, with ""database"" still referring to the engine. Then, tools like Iceberg exist to define how multiple parquet files are organised together into a table, as well as dealing with things like snapshots, partitions, schema evolution, and metadata files... at the moment I view Iceberg like a notepad I would keep on my desk that says ""to query sales, read files A, B, and C into DuckDB"" or ""Added Row X, Deleted Row Y"" so it can track how the table evolves over time without taking entire copies of the table (it actually creates a new file called a ""delete file"", to my knowledge, that works kind of like a subtraction X - Y). That means there are now three parts: data storage, the query engine, and metadata management.My understanding of the blogpost is that DuckLake replicates the kind of functionality that Iceberg provides but does so in a format that is compatible with any SQL database. This gives the management of datalakes database-like transactional guarantees, allows easier cross-table transactions, better concurrency, better snapshotting by referencing parts of files, and allows for things like views (which I guess Iceberg and other tools didn't?)Moreover, metadata is currently managed through file writing, and when performing many small updates or changes, this can be slow, and prone to conflict errors. Tools like BigQuery can be even worse, as they re-write entire blocks that have been affected by operations. DuckLake claims to solve for this by storing the metadata in a database, because they're typically good at handling high concurrency and sorting out conflicts. Correct me if I'm wrong there - that's definitely the limit of my technical knowledge.... if I ever get to work with these tools, I'm sure it'll be good knowledge to have!",ColdStorage256,2025-05-27 15:13:22,28,dataengineering,t3_1kwnx2o,False,

If we're going to have a database in the picture, why don't we just put all the metadata there?The problem I see is, I don't see how this gets adopted. Adoption of Iceberg was a multi-year process.

For example just automatically converting tables to pandas dataframes and processing that way could cause some big inefficiencies, especially if you could just perform the operation in SQL to start.A good place to start might be to look at your existing pipelines and process and figure out where the rubbing points are and seeing if that's a place Python could help with.",full_arc,2025-05-30 15:27:46,15,dataengineering,t3_1kz6t8f,False,

The requirement to authenticate in the VS Code extension, along with its acceptable use policy, seems aimed at identifying medium- and large-sized organizations using the free tools and pushing them toward buying a cloud license.This isn’t just about drawing a line between core and cloud — it looks like an intentional effort to murder core without causing too much backlash.

The only restrictions are around building competitive managed services or circumventing the license keys. If you use dbt core at your org for your data pipelines today, you can use the dbt Fusion engine for that same work in the future.

My team uses Airflow and k8s, and we've had to refine guidelines on building DAGs a lot. Originally, we just used DbtTaskGroup() from [astronomer-cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos), but this approach introduces a lot of overhead for large pipelines with many small models. Essentially, it executes 1 dbt invocation per model. When you have dozens or hundreds of models, and you're waiting both for Airflow to schedule tasks and then for the tasks themselves to spin up k8s jobs, this can propagate delays through your pipeline.

Before it was spaghetti SQL files with no clear dependencies. Most useful features: ref(), tests, and documentation are actually worth it. Sources and macros are heavily used. Exposures were nice in theory but nobody maintained them. Snapshots were a mess - ended up just building those in our warehouse directly.Orchestration: Airflow + dbt is still clunky. We have our dbt DAG inside Airflow but then need to manually sync when dependencies change. If I started today, I'd use Dagster since it has first-class dbt integration.For non-technical folks: The lineage graphs in dbt Cloud are nice but rarely used by stakeholders in my experience. They still just message the data team.Challenges: The learning curve for non-SQL people is steep, especially with macros and Jinja. Performance became a bottleneck with 500+ models. dbt Cloud's git workflow is rigid compared to local dev.Would I adopt again? Yes, but with caveats. I'd set much stricter conventions up front and would consider something like preswald for the Python+SQL parts since our ML engineers hate the dbt workflow.

The most impactful changes I've seen are around collaboration and code quality - `ref()` functions eliminated our hard coded table names, builtin testing catches data quality issues early, and version control became natural. The documentation generation and lineage tracking have improved our communication, though the semantic layer features are still maturing and often feel overhyped.The real challenges I've encountered emerge around orchestration and performance at scale. While dbt handles transformation DAGs elegantly, integrating with Airflow required planning to avoid duplicate logic and scheduling conflicts. For managing data from multiple sources, I've found that solutions like Windsor.ai simplify the upstream, consolidating data from various APIs and platforms.Given your junior team's situation, I'd recommend starting with dbt Cloud despite the cost, the GUI, builtin scheduler, and easier onboarding reduce the learning curve compared to Core's CLI-heavy workflow.

For example, not many people using versioned models, unit testing, etc.What people do use; docs, lineage, data testing, and the bread and butter of dbt; snapshots, incremental models, etc.All this being said, dbt alone isn't gonna fix anything. The teams that realize the best outcomes change more than the tech. They add things like CI/CD, implementing tools like SQLFluff, dbt-checkpoint, etc. They rethink the whole process not just adding dbt. You also need to worry about improving how data is modeled, because that will have a big impact as well.Many people do use Airflow with dbt including people on dbt Cloud. Why? because the dbt Cloud scheduler is pretty limited. Airflow is the market leader hands down.I have seen large teams work with dbt well and I have seen small teams work with it poorly. Sometimes this is due to their philosophical differences. e.g. not letting dbt manage the dependencies but trying to manually recreate them in Airflow. As for dbt Cloud pricing, it can be an issue as teams grow. Their teams level is limited to one project and up to 8 users, so that becomes an issue when teams pass those limits because prices jump quite high.Google ""dbt alternatives"" or ""dbt cloud vs dbt Core"", lots of resources out there. This week there has been a lot of chatter about dbt Fusion, but if is not feature complete yet IMO and very Snowflake centric. The licensing restrictions will mean many people won't adopt it any time soon. Would I use it today, probably, there is a wealth of information out there on dbt, a big community, a large ecosystem, but I would also consider other options like SQLMesh which has a more open licensing model and even their VS Code extension is better than dbt's because that one requires registering with dbt cloud and it is limited to 15 users.",Hot_Map_7868,2025-05-30 12:43:54,2,dataengineering,t3_1kxzk3f,False,

I’m not saying this is all companies, but it was my experience early on and have since enjoyed working in cloud settings.What you are describing sounds more like poorly architected cloud platforms versus an issue with cloud computing. The same could be said for an on-prem company where there isn’t a reliable IT team for managing the servers. I never experienced it but you hear about the meme posts of “unpatched servers” so I doubt those are “reliable and performant”Both on-prem and cloud are susceptible to poor architecture, lack of resources with unrealistic demand for budget, lack of in house knowledge, etc. At the end of the day, the tools themselves matter far less and instead require in-depth understanding of trade offs to know what is the right architecture for different use cases.Lastly, on-prem and cloud both have a place in building Data Platforms.

Not only do they not have the budget allocated to hire full time permanent IT staff, they usually don't have managers skilled in building or maintaining technology infrastructure teams. They also usually don't have the culture required to do site reliability properly. Imagine at Bank XYZ you ask for a new server. You have to call the IT team, they have to call their manager, get approval, the guy who buys server racks is on parental leave, sorry you'll have to wait for 3 more months. Not to mention, the manager of that team decides to de-prioritize your request because guess what, when Bob Servers came back from leave he got a better offer from Google and left.

It's about the ORGANIZATION. They don't WANT to be TECH companies. They can't recruit developers, they can't retain developers, they can't manage developers, they don't have code quality standards, the limited devs they have are swamped with managing legacy infrastructure that sucks because it was built on top of technical debt and needs to be refreshed.Now, if AWS or Google or Azure come along and say, ""hey you can store 300Gb in object storage for $30/month and we handle patching/security etc."" do you think anyone in these companies would say no? If you're the only data engineer in company ABC that makes widgets for robots, do you think you'd say ""actually let me configure an on premise data center all by myself, configure all the users, and install Ni-Fi and also let me patch it and renew certs and everything else all by myself, and when my boss yells at me to take shortcuts to please people that don't understand software I'll tell them no"" Do you really think that will fly?

Bank operations are about securing lending and loans, personal data, etc., managing risk; IT just facilitates that.

Are you talking about like adding columns or adding new fact and dimension tables? Any data warehouse will require maintenance, add new features, etc. but if you are doing a regular major rework, that is either a business issue or you may need to consider evaluating a skill gap on your team around data modeling.Lastly, this would be a poor KPI. Like some other folks of said, it would be similar to counting lines of code. If you are looking for some good KPIs, general ones that I’m a fan of are:1. Data Quality time to resolution. How long does it take from when a data quality bug is reported to it being fixed.2. How many Data Quality issues get through to end users. If you do not have a good data quality test suite in place, you will end up with a lot of bad data getting presented to end users which loses trust and can potentially be costly to the business.3.

This means you're in a strong position to understand modern data workflows from the inside.If you're concerned about limited learning opportunities, try exploring what surrounds your current tasks.

This will encourage them to give you larger and more complex tasks which will increase your rate of learning more than requesting exposure to X or Y tool.

Right now I'm taking an entrepreneurial class that's helping me refine my pitch in my financial forecasting models and stuff like that. My idea much like your own is that analyst team still spend a lot of time doing data prep writing connectors. I've been doing it for so long that I can pretty much do it with my eyes closed so I would love to build a system you know that's managed version controlled it's got row level security, everything is a description attached to it easy to use for anybody including non-technical people. So far I've got one client, but they are a bit more involved it's helping me keep afloat in the meantime. They pay 5,000 usd monthly and do a lot of things manually have a lot of data sources that are pretty complicated Don't have API connector stuff like that. I've got lots of insights but no diamonds yet. At first I tried really small businesses like Mom and Pop shops around town, it was really hard to educate them and also they have no money. Some other key things I learned is that in person referrals are worth their weight in gold if someone else can sing your praises then the person that they're singing to doesn't really need to do any further validation that you will be able to solve their problems. This is hand in hand with finding complimentary businesses that might need to outsource their work. So if you can meet with as many people who do similar work they may eventually have work for you. The other thing is social media if you can manage to figure out what your customers paying points are specifically and then regularly make content around it that may produce leads for years to come. I suppose alternatively completely cold outreach has not worked for me yet. I tried messaging on LinkedIn I've tried to emailing people, mind you not in the hundreds but rather and let's say the tens. But still 0% response rate on any of that and most of the time you just get ignored. After a lot of talking and thinking I realized that I'm really trying to solve my own problem as an analyst for so many years. So I'm doing a micro pivot and trying to focus on helping maybe slightly technical marketing teams or analyst and scientist teams that struggle with disconnected data sources and they would like a modeled data warehouse as a service. Including all of the business metrics reports dashboards The whole works. My pricing is pretty similar to yours, depending on the number of data sources I was thinking somewhere in the ballpark of 4,000 to $10,000 for a setup, and then a retainer feed to manage everything going forwards anywhere from you know 500 to $5,000.

muhznyi,"ClickHouse will optimise the query as long as you set a useful ordering key in the table. If you tell me your schema I can give you an example of how to set up the table.In ClickHouse when you make a table it must have an ORDER BY clause (this is a different concept than the order by your queries).In general what you want to do is set the ORDER BY on the table to all the fields you will end up using in your queries, but list them in order of lowest cardinality first. This will let ClickHouse run your queries in literally milliseconds.e.g. suppose you have logs that have the columns: id (unique), timestamp, app, machine, country, message. Where each app runs on many machines and each machine is in a country.Here you want to set the ORDER BY such that the lowest cardinality items come first. Since you have few distinct countries, more distinct machines, many distinct apps and very many distinct timestamps it should be:ORDER BY (country, machine, app, timestamp)This will store the data sorted on disk in a way that will make GROUP BYs very efficient. You can expect queries of under 1 second on an 8 core machine.However also note that ClickHouse is very fast. Even if you don’t set the group by optimally it will likely still execute your queries in under 1min.Whilst it’s hard to give exact numbers I’ve given ballparks for what you can expect for illustration to help you decide whether you want to do it or not.Edit: another thing to note is that ClickHouse will compress your data to speed it up and use less disk.

We only did PoCs with ClickHouse and Starrocks - I'd say those are kind of ""second generation real-time OLAP"" where Druid and Pinot are first generation. The difference between the ""generations"" seems to be mostly operational, and also ClickHouse and Starrocks can also do data transformation, while Pinot and Druid seem to expect the data goes out mostly in the same form as it goes in.The data transformation is also the key challenge, as for the data to be transformed you have to translate the logic into materialized views, which have some limitations.

mutzeq1,"Gotcha! Thank you for the clarity. This is actually a project I've completed recently - moving processes from legacy to Fabric PaaS. Yes! A lakehouse definitely can be the origin for a dataset and be the only 'source' for this data. The important aspects to consider before choosing to use the lakehouse as the origin location for the data will involve your governance and auditing practices, how robust your lakehouse setup is, how reliable your processes are to ensure proper testing / auditing. Etc. Its the same concern you'd have keeping a data set in any location. In reality, depending on your use case and how your data sources store the data once its extracted, once your lakehouse ingests the data from the external sources, the external source may not always maintain a copy of that data, leaving it only in the lake of the lakehouse. Same sort of idea as using the lake & lakehouse as the data origin for a 'new' dataset that isn't derived from a raw external data set. If you're performing transformations on the raw 'bronze' or even 'silver' data, you are creating new datasets likely being held ONLY in the lake or lakehouse, unless you then moved those datasets into a different warehouse or system.These new transformed datasets may be derived from the raw external data, but they are new datasets in tables in the lakehouse. I think you'll find lakehouses to be powerful and friendly for rule-based processing. If the lakehouse is ONLY being used as a glorified ETL platform, it's kind of a silly misuse of the power. (If you have a strong data governance program requiring you to maintain storage / system of record elsewhere, then obviously the lakehouse is not the long term storage place. But this has not been the case in my experience, outside of heavily regulated industries... which generally have so many redundancies in place the data ends up living in multiple places )For clarity in how this is possible: constraints being business setting the rules and editing the data set.im not sure exactly what platform you're working with or what type of lakehouse you have, but an example way to do this for microsoft fabric: 1. Create a rules table that lives in the Fabric Lakehouse (Delta format).2. Let business users edit those rules (via Power BI, powerapps, excel ).3. Build a processing logic (in Notebook or Dataflow) that applies the rules to a dataset. 4. Trigger the Fabric pipeline when rules change or on a schedule.5. Store the final result back in the Fabric Lakehouse. Because the users can change the rules themselves, be mindful to keep a table with every recorded change if you're concerned about data loss or potentially having a need to review the intermediary changes that occurred on the datasets.[Big ND energy over here - hope the details help]",nomdeplume2,2025-05-29 05:07:34,2,dataengineering,t3_1kxzcuu,False,

So that you can do the solution in a naive way and still get a passing, because is what I actually care about as a dev. You are able to understand and solve the issue, not that you can do in the most efficient way, that you only need to do it as a refractoring after it has been assessed that we need performance for that specific task.Classic example is to be able to do what they ask for string 10\^12 carachter long in less than 200ms.And that's bad for two reasons:1. A requirement like that in a professional setting would have probably been stopped at the source: why do you have a string this long, and do we really need a string this long ?2. A lot of times, the DP solution is worse than the native solution for smaller sets. Something simply because it's harder to understand and as a general rule of thumb you want to make your code easy to understand, and also because sometimes is just less efficient for small sets because it requires some overhead work that the naive solutiomn won't need and while the naive solution is 0(n\^2) instead of O(log(n)) for strings less than 200 carachter the naive solution can be faster.",LordAmras,2025-05-27 06:00:30,3,learnprogramming,t3_1kwbj94,False,

Compared to PHP or Node, where you pull in tons of packages just to start writing any code, it's a really nice experience. Creating a new project is literally just creating a `.go` file and writing code.On top of that, the language surface is small and can be learned very fast, there is depth to it and gotchas you'll eventually, sooner or later, come across, but at that point you're already writing useful code.It also builds into a single binary which is easy to distribute, it has a far smaller memory footprint than Node and significantly faster start times. The builds are also very fast, making the development cycle very fast, almost like PHP or Node (in watch mode).Also, Go is often praised for its concurrency model.The syntax and paradigm of Go doesn't fit everyone, the language is definitely less expressive than TypeScript, and its type system is more rigid, at times it leads to lengthy code, but it tends to be easy to follow and understand, even if wordier than others.Go is just pretty good.

It's got just enough features to be powerful, but few that lead to bad design patterns. This also means that whole teams can learn it quickly. I have presided over a team learning Go and getting them ramped up, it was fun and straightforward.2. It has a static, strong typing system, which both eliminates a whole category of errors found with languages with dynamic type systems, and frees up computational resources that dynamic languages use to reason about data types. If you like data correctness and unambiguity, you'll like Go.3. While garbage collected, automatic garbage collection is great in 99% of cases and you're likely never going to run up against it in your day-to-day. Also, and sorry for burying the headline, but **Golang is almost as fast as any other compiled language like C** but monumentally safer and free of a vast majority of memory pointer errors (the biggest source of critical errors in compiled software).4. It produces all-in-one binaries that run. *And a cross-compiler is included.* Want to compile for Linux on ARM64? Windows on x86-64? NetBSD running on a PowerPC for some reason? Go's got you covered.5. Along with 4, the included tooling is fantastic - one download and unzip, a slight modification to your shell's rc script, and you're cruising. You have a compiler, a robust stdlib, a linter, etc.There are a couple of pitfalls though:1. It can hard to be understand at first how files, directories and packages are related to each other. 2. When you tread the usual, safe paths Go is absolutely phenomenal.

Nulls which you can't easily check for: see above.At this point I should note here that for a string value, null == """", for a number, null == 0, etc. Fun!So, what's this simple idiomatic and ugly way to check for error from the last call i hear you ask??You... you compare its second return value with a null........ go figure.Go is basically what you get when you take C, add garbage collection, and prohibit pointer arithmetics. That's the good side of go. The bad side, you're essentially in a stripped down C.They try to be ""clean"", yet keeping all the C weirdness. Like \* in arguments meaning the thing is a pointer, but \* everywhere else meaning the thing is no longer a pointer. But some things are pointers even without the \*, and you need to remember which ones those are, because that dictates how can you check those for null values.For some strange reason you can't do nested struct literals. Also, you need to call some built-in initialization things to properly initialize a hashmap. Good thing is, we now have generics. Bad thing is, they're weird, don't work on methods, and they overload the interface syntax for type definitions.I actually like their OO in theory, because having methods separate from the structs allows for multimethods. Except go doesn't have multimethods.Instead, they use ""interfaces"" who's main feature is that they convert null pointers into semi-null pointers, which don't equal to null when you compare them with null, but then fail on null pointer reference anyway.Despite this, it's not actually that bad, if you embrace all the discouraged practices, which the standard library devs use everywhere anyway.It's pretty neat for small and performant production level projects. Just don't use it for anything big. It doesn't have the abstractions necessary.And if you can't make big projects, this makes their insistence on having a fast compiler pretty strange. I guess they need it to be fast to churn through all the copy pasted code.It's worth learning I'd say, it has its use and does have some redeeming qualities.But the community of apologetics is so high, you'd think that this whole thing is just a front for a large copium smuggling cartel.",paperic,2025-05-30 10:52:38,26,learnprogramming,t3_1kyxbmi,False,

Learning what you need to make the project will be your project!Break it down into smaller and smaller tasks until each task is small enough to be accomplished in less than a day or two. Create an ordered list of those tasks and tackle them one at a time. Stack up those small victories. Create momentum and ride it. Stuck on something and feel your momentum slowing? Switch tasks or call for help. Momentum is king and it's fed directly by those small victories. Small victories eventually add up to bigger ones. Those bigger ones eventually add up to a completed project. This is a marathon, not a sprint. You have to pace yourself.Once the project is done, do an analysis of what went right and what went wrong. Learn from your mistakes and keep doing what works.Bask in your victory for a short time. Treat yourself, you earned it.Pick your next project and buckle up. It's time to ride that train again.The longer you go, the easier it usually gets. If you find things are getting harder instead of easier, take a moment to step back and see why things are getting harder and how to lower the difficulty. If you find the difficulty of the project has gone past your limits, it might be time to realize your limits and find a more manageable project. Maybe, you got too ambitious and need to pick something easier, for now. Maybe, what you picked just isn't realistic to begin with. Sometimes, you have to figure these things out the hard way. It's a learning process and, if you do it right, it never ends and you don't want it to end.As for tools, you're pretty much the only person who knows what kind of tools you need.When it comes to programming, the tools you're likely to need are mostly in two categories. There are the tools that directly impact programming and the ones for organization and tracking progress.For programming, it's mostly about the environment; the editor, plugins and related tools. These are usually fairly straight forward to understand. Though, finding your preferences is a bit of a trail and error experience. Most people are fairly happy with Visual Studio Code for the editor. Try that and see what you like or don't like about it. If you're happy, move on to figuring out what additional plugins and tools make it work best for you. If not, figure out what you like and don't like about it and see if there's something that better fits your preferences or if there are plugins that fix what you don't like.For organization and tracking progress, it becomes even more personal. Maybe, you do it all in a series of post-it notes. Maybe, you type it out in a bunch of plain text documents. Maybe, you use something more sophisticated. You're the only one who knows what work flow works for you. There's more organizational and tracking tools out there than I could list in the 10000 character count limit. Do some digging and find your favorites.

When you're ready to apply the js skills from FCC, start odin project for web development -- it'll show you how to use all of the syntax you've learned to build real things. Odin is particularly good because it's project-based and doesn't hold your hand, but for these reasons, it's good to have some syntax knowledge before getting too deep into it, IMO. It also teaches you common non-code skills that are necessary for building software in web context: version control (git/github), IDE/code editor setup, linux env setup (esp important if you're not on mac), basic terminal usage etc.That's the path I took, and I don't think I'd be where I am today if I hadn't had FCC and Odin. I stayed 100% focused on js, and if you're going for web, I'd suggest you do the same -- it will speed things up if you focus on one language. And with node, you can write backend in js as well. The earlier you get used to typescript, as well, the better.By the time I got semi-competent w/ React through Odin, I actually did a bootcamp.

To be more specific, you have to completely iterate through the array in the time it takes the hashing to complete. That said, I've played around with a problem that fit this scenario, and the performance difference was negligible on an array with a max size of 20 elements in Rust.

mv6zuqn,"The devs who create APIs are backend devs, and they typically work in languages like Java, Python, C#, and even JavaScript. They often use special frameworks for these languages that have built-in features that make building APIs easier or more performative. Typically they also work with databases in some capacity, as a core function of most APIs is retrieving or saving data to a database.Typically the devs consuming APIs are frontend devs who need data to display on a GUI. However, APIs can also call other APIs, so consuming APIs is something done by devs front or backend. It's becoming more common to become a full stack developer where you both create APIs and then consume them on the frontend. Often times though even full stack devs will specialize in one over the other. You'll find when you do this kind of work, you don't need to be a master of a language or framework to create passable features. Obviously it depends, but if your API consists of a lot of CRUD (create, read, update, delete) work, most devs can produce these endpoints with not a ton of experience needed.A great tool to start messing around with APIs is postman. You can call API endpoints from this tool and see exactly what type of data they return. Then you can start imagining how you could use this data, or how to build your own API that produces data you need. A real life example I'm currently working with is that I'm creating an app that uses flood data. Weather.gov has a great API that allows me to get flash flood alerts. Instead of just calling this flash flood API from my frontend, I'm actually calling the weather API from my backend. I'm doing this because I need to alter the data to fit my needs before using it. So I'm using my API to grab data with weather.gov's API, manipulating that data into a usable form for myself, storing that data in my own database, and then calling my own API from my own frontend to get that data out of my database so I can display flood alerts to users in the way that I need.

mv77ve5,"One good way to think about APIs is a way to connect 30+ different services, instead of having a single service that tries to do it all. You need a way for service 1 to talk to service 3. This is done through APIs. Here is a long winded example:Imagine you have one central platform that users interface with (the UI/website).But then you also have three services {A1-3} that take in data at the start, from three different sources. Say the data coming into A1-3 is different user activity, say everytime a user logs into some systems {S1-3}. Those systems send data in different ways to A1-3. A1-3 may transform the data in some way and send it down the pipeline. Possibly convert it into some central schema, since the three sources {S1-3} provide different sources data formats.Maybe one of these data-consumers {A2} needs to query some other service {B1} that provides additional user data. Perhaps A1 and A3 already get this additional data directly from their sources, S1 and S3. B1 is a service your company created that just stores a bunch of specific data in a database. When the service A2 queries it (or any other service), it returns some useful information. Maybe the database holds user host information (like their computer name). So B1 is an API that takes in a User ID, and returns their hostname/Mac address/location, ect. It just queries the database by user ID, and returns the information. So you might say, why not just have A2 query the database directly? Well, what if later on you have another service that wants the same data. So you made the API B1, which is the only connection point to this particular database. Once A1-3 enrich and convert their data into a central schema, they send that data using some messaging service (e.g. Kafka) to one consumer, C1. C1's job is to just store this data in some database. All it does is read data from A1-3 and store it (in a DB), and then it provides an API to retrieve this data on-demand. All of these could be called 'microservices'. Instead of having a single service that does it all, we have 6 that just handle their own little section. The user interface (the front end), needs to be able to provide information to customers. If the customer needs to know when User#45 last logged in, it queries C1. This event has the original data A2 consumed + some enrichment from B1. Now is the best part. Remember how we made B1 its own independent service? When the UI wants to give the latest login info about a user it query C1.But what about when it needs to provide just hostname information (which is not directly tied to a particular login instance). These hostnames are unrelated to the login information from C1 (even though C1 has some hostname info, but only when related to logins).So now the UI can query B1 to provide a bunch of hostname information. In this long example, we only have two APIs, B1 and C1. But whilst populates B1? Imagine we also need to manage payment information, basic account info, ect. If it's closely related, it could be with one API and in one database. But often there will be disparate data from different sources. Better to make everything modular.

mub99m4,"I have a little over 3.5 years of experience, and I’m at a mid-level position. I work in web dev.If I was starting out again, I’d do the bare minimum to understand how to debug on my own and learning how to Google and find things on Stack overflow.After becoming barely proficient enough to generally get through difficult tasks that approach, when needed, then I’d stop utilizing that approach for learning. I’d then open up several AI models with free chat samples of their higher-end models (usually in the form of free credits that reset daily), and then I’d start building tons of projects.The AI assistance I’d use to help me understand things and identify unknown unknowns. You can’t just use it to build everything for you. Then you’re not a programmer, just a prompter. The goal is to use it faster than you’d have used Stack Overflow or Google to learn the same things.After building tons of projects, I’d get the experience taking a few live, such as web hosting, figuring out DNS, live database, live authentication, etc.After doing this, I’d research best security practices and go back through projects implementing them, and also trying to break them, to get a real-world understanding of how many insecure things you just built with AI’s help. AI isn’t thinking of security. You need to be. I’d download Burp suite, and learn the basics of using it. This is great for learning how to compromise your system and find vulnerabilities. You will find vulnerabilities. If you don’t, it’s not because you don’t have any. It’s because you can’t find them.I myself am still getting better at the security aspect of things, so I can’t give you much more advice there, but that’s a starting point!The thing is, I’m providing the value that many coworkers pre-AI were providing with much more years of experience than me. You need to use it to your advantage and speed up your learning to catch up and overtake many of them.You also need to acknowledge that you are in a competitive field, and you are competing with many smart people. You need to acknowledge that if you want to grow faster than others, you need to do what 99% won’t. For me, that was working longer hours for experience. It was jumping into hard tasks for experience. It was pushing for more work and opportunity and legacy code work and bigger features and more bugs. I was willing to do the dirty work when it came up, and I was also always willing to listen to my coworkers whenever they had constructive feedback.Some of my coworkers have described me as “starving” and “hungry” to learn. I think there are a few who it scares, because of how fast I caught up to them.The thing is, they’re working 9-5. I was willing to work 9-5, or 9-9, or 9-5 then midnight to 4, or over the weekend. It isn’t about the money. It’s about the experience. I don’t get paid more as a salaried individual. You need to acknowledge that it’s about the short-term suffering for the long-term investment.Finally, place yourself in positions where you’re not the smartest in the room, or the highest on the totem pole. If you’re the top of the food chain in an area, leave. It’s a waste of your time unless you’re building up experience by sharing to those with less experience. You need a bit of both. Sharing to others, and learning from others. Look for engineering meet-ups in your area. I was lucky to go to one with all staff and principal engineers, as the sole junior. Just being around them causes you to learn immensely. If you go to a meet up, and it’s primarily people in your own skill level, then leave.In code, don’t get caught up in the little picture. Remember the big picture. Sometimes, things should really be left a little less perfect, or maybe not as clean, if they’re very leaf-node-like. Focus deeper on the root areas of the code base, that affect many things.In the end, it also depends on your goals. My goal was (and is) to move up as quickly as possible, to make as much money as I can, as quickly as possible.

The reason you might want this is to improve security further, it means if an attacker chooses the password ""password123"" and they somehow get access to the encrypted passwords, they won't be able to know everyone else that used the same password (since they will have different encrypted passwords even though they had the same original password).Whenever you generate a password with a salt, you are supposed to store that salt and use it again when validating the password.

muun8zz,"If it is ""just"" about website building you could explore more versatile options too:The quick answer:1. Websites like Squarespace offering building kits in which you can make the global layout without coding and then refine things via. added scripts and libraries. 2. WordPress 3. HTML + CSS, the default option for simple sites 4. JavaScript for interactivity 5. Python/PHP (or other languages) for server implementationsThe ""correct"" choice really depends on what you plan to make and what you plan to use it for.The long answer: HTML is technically not a full-fledged programming language, but more a tool to build the skeleton of the website. Basics you can mostly learn in a day/week. CSS is for everything style (fonts, colors, layouts, ...) and works as addition to HTML. For real-time interactivity, you need JavaScript. There are variations, but JS is the only language supported by basically all browser, which is why it is the go-to programming language for this.If you want your page to have the ability to save/access data, through a database or multi-user interactivity or such.. Then you generally need to have a programming language on the web server. PHP was most common for a long time, but nowadays you see a lot of people use Python instead. You can generally use any programming language you want on the server, it will effectively read data coming in from web pages, and produce web pages as output. It also deals with a file systems or databases.Unlike HTML and CSS, any programming language will take a lot of effort to master. So if you really want to build a web page that sits there and shows information, you'll be fine with HTML and CSS.Easy-Mode: HTML + CSS Medium-Mode: add JavaScript Hard-Mode: add PHP or Python (or other...) for server based interactions and databasesKind regards, Mr. Prototype and the Broken Pony Studios team (I am just an indie game developer who made his companies website :D)",TS_Prototypo,2025-05-29 08:50:21,1,learnprogramming,t3_1kxparp,False,

I think learning ""the hard way"" like this is quite good but autocomplete/suggestions make getting the syntax right a lot easier.A few tips/useful sites:* [MDM ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)\- this should be the first place you look things up, its THE reference and is well written, easy to understand and has good examples * [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/guides/) \- I've linked to the guides section, whilst there's some advanced stuff here their guides/cheat sheets for flexbox and, lengths and media queries are always useful* [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/elements) \- Firefox has similar, use the one you like.

On free code camp when doing the test projects you can click the button at the top right to open the preview in a new window, this will mean the dev tools for that window don't show the code editors which can be confusing.* [BEM](https://getbem.com/naming/) \- At some point you'll start building more complex things and have a convention for how to give things names consistently helps keep your CSS readable and reusable. There are other conventions but I like this one.* [CSS Variables/Why frameworks are good](https://coreframework.com/) \- Free code camp introduces variables super late which can build bad habits. As a general rule you never want hard coded values in any code, anywhere. It makes code hard to read and hard to modify in the future. Defining things like font sizes, colour palettes, spacing and border radiuses upfront makes everything a lot easier down the line.

mu5ufnh,"Well, no, but also yes.CSS isn't confusing at all, it is, especially with changes made the last three-five years, a very well structured language to express how you'd like the design and layout of your HTML-document to look.However, most programmers suck at visual design, at understanding what looks good, what the rules are, what things are called, and how to plan or even talk about the design of a document. They often prefer some pre-baked incantations that they can just throw at the page, so it will look like every other page out there. Which is probably why Bootstrap became so popular in the first place, and why Tailwind is so popular now.CSS is very, very, very different from HTML and JavaScript - HTML is a structure, it is easy to see if one element is before, after, inside or outside another. And JavaScript mostly is a list of lines, all being executed one after another, so that's also pretty easy to understand. But in CSS there isn't really any structure, just a bunch of rules that more or less all apply at the same time.Some parts of CSS has to do the the individual elements, how they look, how much space they take up, or where they are in relation to other elements. Other parts of CSS has to do with the layout, how an element layouts other elements inside of it. Yet other parts of CSS has to do with how an element is layouted by the parent. And you don't really write the rules, you just set some values on some properties that is used by some algorithms.

When researching ""how do I route with an optional parameter"" you also learn a bit about how the library processes routes in order; a month later a ""weird routing bug"" has an obvious and simple solution to you (""this route just needs to be higher precedence"").To write new code you need to read existing code, sometimes code right where you're working, sometimes code many hops away in a callstack. The more you read, the more you slowly build up valuable context about the code in totality, the better your future code comes.The acceptance criteria for AI tools in their current form is the same as an incredibly eager intern or early career professional: ""Well, *it works"".* A large application that is an accumulation of tasks completed to a ""well, it works"" level becomes increasingly difficult to understand and change.

Other things are a matter of comfort, and you can always re-learn and remember once you start working back in a language, framework etc.To specifically answer you:1. It is definitely okay to go with web dev and frontend path now. 2. Use LLM as a resource to learn. Write code to do simple things and make projects. And show that code to LLMs to ask for improvements and suggest conceptual lackings that are present in that code. 3. Titles are unimportant imo.

The issue arises when I have to build join statements in Python using SQL Alchemy since a single table doesn't have all the data it needs to be pulled from multiple tables. But due to three naming conventions I have to go through each and every one of them just to figure out what is the name here. To further add headache the relationship are many to many. I am not even sure if this helps but there are many columns that come from API but even there the naming conventions are different. Here's an example country_id is the column name in table1 and I need table2 to join at country_id because that's where the weather report comes from but the column is called weather_ids_country I thought this was a mistake so I asked the team they are like no this is correct. It means the same thing. I am like fine. Now everything is in integer so I need the values which comes from API on that it is called currency_code_id it means the same thing.

mv666zm,"When it comes to debugging, while simple methods like console.log, print statements, or dump and die are useful for inspecting values and responses, effective debugging requires a more structured approach.My general advice is to start by isolating the issue and confirming each part of the workflow independently. For example, in web development, if I'm passing a value from the backend to the frontend, I would first hardcode an expected value directly into the frontend to verify that the interface and frontend logic behave as expected. This helps determine whether the issue lies in the frontend or further back in the stack.Once the frontend behaves correctly with the hardcoded value, I would then pass the same value from the controller to confirm that the data flow through the backend to the frontend is working as intended. If this succeeds, I proceed to review the logic within the controller itself. Essentially, the idea is to work backwards from a known, working state toward the suspected issue.For game development, I take a similar approach. If, for example, I encounter a bug in a movement script, I would isolate that script by moving it to a new, minimal scene with a single object. Once it works correctly in isolation, I would then reintroduce the object to the original scene and observe whether the issue persists. This process of isolating and testing components individually allows you to narrow down the source of a bug systematically.In both cases, the principle remains the same: isolate, confirm working states, and incrementally trace the problem back to its origin.One last trick is the rubber duck, honestly works :flexed_biceps: explain what your trying to achieve to a rubber duck or colleague in the explanation, you will realize where you went wrong.Good luck, troubleshooting and debugging can be super fun when you get some wins :flexed_biceps::thumbs_up:",the10xfreelancer,2025-05-31 01:09:23,1,learnprogramming,t3_1kzfy86,False,

mumt1ya,"So for each user, you want to store a list of ""interactions"", and then given two arbitrary users, you want to show the interactions they have in common, right? In other words, if you represent their interactions as sets (of IDs), you want the intersection of those sets.I don't know of any fancy general-purpose algorithm that can do this better than the simple, brute-force approach of just computing the intersection on the fly. Precomputing the intersections is not a good idea because if you have N users, there are O(N^(2)) possible pairs, and most of those pairs will never be queried.Beyond that, you just have to estimate/benchmark the performance and optimize for your particular situation. Here's a very hand-wavy and totally hypothetical estimate:* Let's say that for future-proofing, each ""interaction"" (the ID of a post or whatever) can be represented as a 64-bit integer, occupying 8 bytes of space.* Assume that a typical user does 1000 interactions per day, and has a 10-year activity history on the site (if your site is very successful). So you can store a user's entire history in 1000 x 365 x 10 x 8 bytes, or about 30MB. Maybe this compresses down to 10MB or so.* With an SSD that has a sequential read throughput of maybe 500MB/sec, you can read 10MB in 20 milliseconds. Double that for two users.* Actually finding the intersection between two sorted lists of integers can be done easily in linear time. So the CPU is unlikely to be a bottleneck.* If one request fully utilizes the SSD for 40ms, then you can handle 25 ""common interaction"" queries per second. If you need to do more than that, you can add more read-only replicas of the same data.* Don't forget to account for the disk utilization associated with updating the user histories when new interactions happen. This depends on your requirements, e.g. do the query results need to be perfectly up to date with the latest interactions, or is it OK to perform batch updates once an hour, or once a day?* Maybe you want to find the top 10 most *recent* interactions in common. In that case, choose your 64-bit IDs so that they are (exactly or approximately) increasing in timestamp order. Then if the intersection has a million IDs in common, you don't have to fetch a million rows from the DB. You just sort the integer IDs themselves (very cheap since they're already in memory) and then only fetch the largest 10.",teraflop,2025-05-28 02:46:03,3,learnprogramming,t3_1kx5jkn,False,

muqkz8j,"I think it's important to have a diversified interview prep.Leetcode is a *part* of it, but you also need to be prepared for more general questions. Honestly leetcode is only maybe 20% of the prep I do when I decide to job hop. Most of my time goes towards behavioral prep and STAR scenarios, but a decent chunk of time goes towards very general technical prep. Language-specific terms/concepts, differences between versions if it's relevant (Java 6 vs Java 8 for example), re-reviewing data structures, SOLID, the 4 fundamental OOP concepts, design patterns, etc.Basically a review of all the fundamentals that are things we don't consciously think of during our day to day, but we're doing subconsciously. The exact kinda stuff pop-quiz style interviews tend to poke at.For example, if I asked you what the L stands for in SOLID, and explain it, could you do that right now? I know I couldn't. But when I'm looking for a job, you bet your ass I could rattle off any of those letters from memory and explain them. I *have* absolutely been asked about SOLID/OOP before. I remember one interviewer off-handedly asked me ""What's your favorite design pattern?"". I'm not a theory guy really, so I'm not really thinking about the textbook names and definitions of design patterns day to day.... but I had prepped on design patterns, so I was able to give a great answer that cultivated a good discussion. My answer wasn't ""Builder... because it's the only one I remember"". I got that job.There's a lot of stuff in between a pure leetcode interview and a 2 hour pop-quiz session, most interviews may settle at a natural blend of the 2 types of questions. But you should absolutely still expect to be asked questions about the basics and fundamentals. Even an hour of prep should make those kinds of questions trivial for you to answer.",SouredRamen,2025-05-28 17:52:36,53,cscareerquestions,t3_1kxkbsi,False,

You have been doing PHP for 13 years and they ask such random PHP question that you couldn’t answer. That basically means that either you have just been fucking around with PHP for the past 13 years as a fraud, which I don’t believe, or the questions are just so arcane that you most likely wouldn’t have been able to answer even with preparation anyways.Also the recruiter has been completely misleading too, let’s not forget that part.

Instant resume killersYour resume doesn't tell me what you've been doing the last few years! I know it sounds silly but I've seen some resumes that talk really in detail about tools and languages, and don't talk about... what projects you worked on and how they mattered in the big picture, who used your work, who you collaborated with to make things happen, what defects you saw and what you improved and how you did that.If all you talk about is having taken tickets and turn them to code with lots of languages and tools, I can only assume you're best suited for a role that needs someone to specialise in taking tickets and turning them into code.What I'm looking for is, someone who's interested in joining a team, who wants to learn and help others learn, who wants to improve things, and to build stuff that works which they're proud of. So.... Write your resumes to show me these: make each bullet show some mix of how you've worked with lots of types of people, learned from and mentored them, made small improvements, worked on projects, all while you did the bigger items you want to highlight.Illustrating these will impress me more than a contextless ""Shipped project megazorb in java 21, made a billion""3.

The aim of the interview is: get to know what we'll both be like to work with. If you feel like a question or task is about to sink you, this is now a chance to show me how you deal with what seems like a really big problem. We'll have plenty in the role, I'm certain you've seen plenty before, so show me what you can do.\- Never criticise past employers/colleagues. Just don't go there. Even if you've heard that rule and still think ""well this is close to criticism but I'm phrasing it objectively so its ok"", still don't. I don't know why, but people do it a lot. I don't know you or those people and I have know way of knowing if what you're saying is fair or not. Just flip everything to ""I'm looking for $goodthing"" and don't say ""past employer had $badthing"". We can lament bad jobs when you're hired\- Don't lie. I'm not always going to catch it, but when I do, it's just a straight decline. If you don't have a great example of ""tell me a time X happened"", don't make one up, just say: ""I've never had to deal with that exactly, as stated, but I have had to do Y or Z"". These questions are almost always about, how did you learn from bad thing, how did you get around obstacle. If you just make something up there's nothing real and human there and it does show through.

muj8j9p,">I'll do junior stuff and take low end salariesAnd companies won't believe you.One of the most important parts of recruiting is retention. If a company doesn't think they can retain you, they're not going to hire you.Lots of things can make a company think they can't retain you. For example, if you blurt out your salary expectation are $200k, but the company is only able to offer $80k, they're not going to even bother extending the offer. Even if you say ""Oh, actually, I'm totally willing to accept $80k!"", they're not going to bother. You already showed your hand. They know you want $200k, and they know even though you'll accept their offer of $80k, because $200k was your expectation you're going to continue job searching and leave them the moment you get an offer that's more aligned with your expectations.Another example, if you've gotten a PhD and are highly specialized in a niche area of the industry, and the company you're talking to is just hiring for a basic CRUD role... they know you'll be impossible to retain. You got a PhD, you're highly specialized. Even if you say to the company ""I'll be totally happy in your role"", they know it's BS. They know you'll be out the door the second you get an offer that's relevant to your PhD.That same idea applies to you. You have 10 YOE. You can claim you'll be happy with junior roles, and low end salaries, but companies know that's total BS and you'll quit the moment you get a Senior role with a Senior salary lined up. Even if it's the truth, from the company's perspective, they're not going to believe it for a second, and you'll fall into the ""impossible to retain"" category. No company will hire someone they don't think they can retain.All of that said, you can absolutely be a 10+ YOE dev and be part of the team, and code regularly. Most of us do. A Senior SWE is still an IC. A Staff SWE, and a Principal SWE, are still IC's. They still code every day, they're still an active contributing member of the engineering team, their responsibilities just get zoomed out a bit. Instead of looking at things at the single-Jira-ticket level, they might be thinking at the epic-level, or the quarterly-deliverables-level, or the company-wide-architecture-level. You're still extremely technical, you're not a manager. Plenty of people stay an IC their entire career, and you can too.But your problem is you're trying to stay on the IC-route, but aren't actually evolving beyond a junior/mid-level in terms of skills/contribution. So that makes you a very, very, very expensive developer that doesn't deliver on their price tag. And because of the aforementioned issue, companies aren't just going to continue paying you junior level salaries when you're carrying with you 10+ YOE.You need to dive into the deep end, and apply for Senior+ level roles. If you can convince a company you're ready for that role, even if you don't feel like you are, that's how you'll set yourself up for the next 20 years of your career. If you don't do that, you'll find yourself struggling a lot, and you'll claim ""age-ism"", but it's very much about your career path, not about your age.",SouredRamen,2025-05-27 15:49:26,71,cscareerquestions,t3_1kwq4ml,False,

The stuff about CRDTs and timestamp ordering isn't really relevant here. He ends up with a only approximately correct result at the end anyway. It's possible to solve this acceptably without ever even storing individual events.- contrary to OP, I didn't like the answer about event storage choice. Mentioning specific databases and showing that you understand tradeoffs between classes of storage is a good thing, actually. I liked that he mentioned WAL and Kafka, but I'd expect discussion of wide-column data stores and mentions of e.g. cassandra, DDB etc. How the data would actually be stored was never actually answered (I think?

How is it different from a ""foolish mid-level didn't know any tools"" versus a ""wise staff refused to get tied down""?It can always be ""foolish staff only worked with proprietary tools!"" More seriously, there's two layers to this. One is that mapping tools to conceptual components is generally more flexible than the other way around (and at a number of places will look better, but know your audience); knowing the reasonable scope of what tools can do is often more useful than detailed specifics, role requirements not withstanding. The other is that at some of these levels, you do have to build bespoke tooling.Of course, it's also the case that when you usually only have ""a bunch of Linux machines, an SSH session, and some certs"" (as the joke in the interview went, I think), you spend less time on keeping up with general tooling that you can't use anyway.>I'm curious why he's calling this out when pointing out a need for availability, given that CRDB's [FAQ](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/frequently-asked-questions#how-is-cockroachdb-both-highly-available-and-strongly-consistent) points out that they're explicitly strongly consistent. I don't think the post is quite summarizing right here. I don't recall if CRDB actually came up?

It was written by a lot of people who have vested interest in AI hype staying as high as possible. This paper just happens to come out when we are seeing chatgpt fail to release 5.0 and revising what it's supposed to accomplish down harder than the old 5g definitions. It is becoming more apparent that AI is being used as a marketing tactic to do layoffs and still raise stock prices. AI hype is almost single handedly floating the stock market.

The public gets compute time on a supercomputer for a Google search summary now. That is not a reasonable business plan, they make no money doing that for you. Why do it? Stock. Google can't be the only giant left behind. Once investment money isn't forcing the business plan to work it'd probably enshitify.

It argued you want your finances in check and after that, be in a stable work situation. Part of your problem is that your current work situation sucks, so you feel pressure to find something better. You might not properly vet your next position, then you get caught in a vicious cycle. I'm in a somewhat similar situation. I was trying to get out of a job before I expected layoffs were coming, so I've accepted some less-than-ideal positions, and I've found myself with constant anxiety about needing to find something better.

Yes, you'd like a new job, but maybe it's OK to just say you're not going to study for a month or two, and use that free time for something else. Do something relaxing, get some exercise, just something to hopefully help with healing. Then, when you start looking for another job, be mindful of vetting them. While you want a new job, you want to make sure you find something that aligns with what you want (work-life balance being a priority). Another option is to reach out to people you trust and see if their current companies are hiring. This depends on your network, though.

muf3c4u,"tl:dr: I'm a full stack dev who is about to get laid off. I've worked at one company for 7 years, and that's the extent of my industry experience. Assuming work is going to be scarce, what other options are out there that i could look into with minimal or no need for additional training? Does that even exist? Trying to be realistic and proactive. Summary: I work on a team of developers for an enterprise company with a suite of proprietary web apps. All .NET/angular & nosql cloud architecture. I was promoted out of QA into development, but have not been given opportunity to progress, or mentorship, so I've had to learn everything on my own through hard won experience and the help of online coding communities. I only recently started using AI tools since I felt early on that it would limit my learning rather than improve it (honestly they only became strong enough to really help significantly in the last two years, anyway. I don't tend to work on stuff that an AI agent from 2022 could reproduce without errors or structural issues). I believe I may be about to be laid off, so I'm looking for advice on how to continue pursuing a career as a developer (aide from just trying to apply everywhere i can, obviously) - or, what adjacent options i could pivot into given I only have an Associates degree.The whole bloody story: I've been a junior web developer for 3 years. Before that I did two years as a QA Analyst and one year of help desk before that. All at this same company. The first year I spent as a developer, I spent a lot of time online doing courses like Pluralsite, MS Learn, OSSU, etc, so I was learning, but in my day-to-day I wasn't being allowed to work on modern infrastructure the rest of the team was working on. Instead, I was made responsible for maintaining a 20 year old piece of software primarily operating on old mvc and web forms. This was mainly to free up the other developers (who are all seniors) to work on the ""important"" projects. So I was spending 8 hours a day on bad examples and barely-functional software, while on my own time trying to learn javascript, .net, c#, angular, react, my sql, rxjs, etc. I have pretty severe ADHD that I'm on medication for... that didn't go well. They knew. I made a lot of mistakes, because it was difficult to apply what I was learning to what I was working on at work. When asked to create a proof of concept in modern architecture or refactor some complex logic, I would constantly be getting confused by outdated coding patterns and structural flaws vs newer stuff like onion and so on. I brought up multiple times that this was a problem and that it was impossible for me to learn anything this way with my disability, and was ignored. It was truly a ""sink or swim"" mentality. Eventually, I was taken off of development because they weren't seeing the improvement they wanted, and given qa tasks. For an entire year, I was not allowed to work on code and was entirely support. My title did not change. They moved me back into dev in 2024 as a ""last chance."" At first this went really well. People were shocked to see how much progress I'd made, because I WAS NOT IDLE during the intervening time. I'd still been studying and coding in my spare time while I was working on QA. I work for a company that has a suite of proprietary web apps used to track their assets, and most development is done in-house. I just helped them release a modern replacement for that 20 y/o flagship product, and being that it was just released, it has a lot of user stories coming in. As you might expect. Several other devs recently left, and all of their defects and user stories were reassigned to me. Because I'm taking the heat for all of these story points, and my performance is being called into question, I've been told-without-words that if I don't improve I'm going to be terminated. The company is young and scrappy, and they ""aren't interested in being a school"". I'm completely overloaded, sometimes literally working 80hrs a week just to keep up with the pace of seniors who have 20+ years of experience, and to be honest it's really starting to affect my health. Based on the way my coworkers are talking about and around me, I feel like it's going to happen soon (possibly this week).This company is hugely toxic (its one of those ""corporate family"" environments), and during this entire process I have never received a significant raise, so my compensation is still on par with a tester. I need to leave. I've needed to leave. But the job market is in the toilet due to the seemingly endless layoffs in our sector over the last years. With recent news from Microsoft, that doesn't seem likely to change. For what is worth: i do really enjoy the work. And my coworkers. But I'm absolutely killing myself over it. I routinely have anxiety attacks. The area i live in is expensive, and I'm not making it to payday as it is. In this economy, I'm looking for any advice on either how to continue pursuing a career in development... or how to pivot into something adjacent. I'm happy to move literally anywhere as we don't particularly like the northeast anyway. To be clear: I'm quite proud of where I'm at now, as far as my capability compared to where I started. I routinely work on tasks that would be out of question for a green junior and these days my code is much more structured and predictable. I have done a huge amount of skill acquisition in the last 3 years and I'm very confident in my abilities (with or without AI). My biggest detractor is my education status which stopped at Associates degree due to health and family issues. Thanks for reading. Any advice is appreciated. Good luck out there.",BookerPrime,2025-05-26 22:28:57,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1kvrs94,False,

A risky startup is a risky startup in any market. A stable startup is a stable startup in any market. Your risk is if the startup disappears tomorrow, it might take you some time to get a new job. But the same risk exists for ""stable"" startups, and large companies too.

mv5m555,"Joining the right early stage startup with leadership that knows what they are doing and putting in the work to excel in it is a cheat code for your career. You will quickly get used to getting things done quickly and effectively and learning how to manage priorities and getting confidence to innovate. You would also likely build a much stronger network and bond with the startup team than the run of the mill mature larger company with a lot more established processes. Most likely you will also quickly outpace the average FAANG engineer in terms of upskilling and improving by far. But this is all assuming you can pull your weight in the startup and not get let go for underperforming in the first month and also assuming the startup itself is a good environment (good leadership/mentors/culture, etc). The answer to this is how risk averse you are and how willing you are to put in work and what your priorities are. The smaller the startup, the more brutal it will be in terms of workload and expectations and “hire fast, fire faster” is the norm but there are benefits to it that I mentioned above. The larger the company is, you will have more stability but the work in general tends to be more boring with less agency, you don’t learn as much as quickly as at a startup, and the amount of process and red tape required to do things get more and more overwhelming. This leads to a lot of incompetent people that are just coasting and coworkers that are dead weight in larger companies whereas in a startup they would be canned in a week.To me, your situation is not about the difference in pay at all. It is not relevant.

Not many people get to be picky enough that they can choose where they live in the country straight out of college.Most people move to wherever they can get a job. There's your reality check.So if you can find a job in a big city, then you're free to move.

I also prefer living in big cities. Out of college I was considering 2 full time offers, one in a big city that was for a PM role, and the other was in the Midwest for a SWE role.

mv96lzd,"Warning: This ain't your usual ""Yeah buddy go for it, you can't do no wrong"" comment that we're seeing on this thread. My advice is this....suck it the eff up. At least for 2 years for your resume so you actually have a better chance at securing a job. Be the model employee. Go above and beyond. Build a reputation as a Subject Matter Expert or the Go-To guy on your team. That way you can spend the rest of your 20's doing what you want and not just barely scraping by washing dishes in a big city because you couldn't do the work to build your career a little bit before jumping ship and making yourself look to be the most flaky worker ever. No one is going to want to hire someone who quit their job in the first few months. You're not even worth considering to train because you've ALREADY proven you can't be trusted from the perspective of the employer. They could put all their time and energy into training you, which is VERY EXPENSIVE, by the way. (It's part of why so many are basically just looking for flawlessly perfect matches on jobs, they don't want to train you). Only for their very expensive investment to come back and whine they ain't happy. Move me to a bigger city or I QUIT to go work at some crappy minimum wage job in a big city because that's obviously better than making a good salary at a mid-size company in a ""small town"" (I kind of doubt your town is that small with the vibe you give). Would you want to hire you in that case? I know I wouldn't. I wouldn't even give your resume a second thought because 1.) there's nothing on there and 2.) you quit so fast you're not even worth investing in. What's to stop you from doing the same to me? How do I know you ain't going to quit on me in 4 months or demand a move somewhere? I don't and as an Employer, I operate automatically on the principle of least trust. You only give the minimum amount of trust to anyone working under you. Never take your employees for granted. They can leave and quit any time they want and leave you with a labor shortage that you have to fill. You would not be a very good candidate for filling in that labor shortage because you're currently just as likely to cause them. Right now you sound very entitled and flaky. You've worked a SWE all of a couple months and it's already unbearable for you? You blame the city but it really sounds like you got fixated on what you thought your life would look like and are now feeling intense things that it's not going like that. That's normal. When I was your age, I thought I would be able to advance my salary quickly enough that I'd be able to buy a house in 2-3 years. That wound up not happening. I thought I'd get on the PM track and not have to do a bunch of coding when I initially just wanted to get into management. Instead I've basically been stuck in the SWE path. It is what it is, I'll eventually get back to where I want to be but for now, I'm making the best of what I've got. That's how life goes.

muebgrm,"Same advice for anyone else who hasn't been able to find a job post-graduation. Apply to jobs, be open to the kinds of companies you are applying to. Don't think you should only work for pure tech companies. All sorts of companies hire developers. You have a gap since your graduation. It may make sense to take your graduation date off your resume. It's your call. Besides applying, studying a mix of LeetCode and practical skills. What do I mean by practical skills? Things you'd be doing on the job.* Do you understand how databases work? How familiar are you with SQL?* NoSQL?* Any cloud experience?* How good are your front-end vs back-end skills? Do you only know a language like PHP, or do you know languages that are more widely in use in corporate settings like Java, Python, JavaScript, React? * Can you build a basic CRUD app that uses REST API endpoints?* Are you familiar with Git? CI/CD pipelines?Those are a few things to get you started. I worked as a contractor at a large financial institution for a while. They were trying to fill some roles with people who graduated from a boot camp. 5/6 candidates could not answer extremely basic questions. I know everyone needs to live, but one guy said he had been driving Uber for a few months, and he seemed to have forgotten everything. The one person who was stronger ended up getting another offer elsewhere. While LeetCode has gotten more popular, there are still companies that don't use it. A challenge is finding a balance of what to study, etc. Some recruiters will tell you what their interview process is like, and others will not. A lot of people on this sub think that applying with what is effectively the same resume over and over will yield different results. Some people get lucky, but you should be trying to improve while you're looking. Otherwise, you're just someone who graduated and couldn't find a job. There are people with plenty of work experience who still don't know anything about cloud or NoSQL for example. There are tools and resources out there to become a stronger developer. It's been years since I graduated, but there's a lot of stuff that school doesn't teach you. One other thing, take any comments from the internet with a grain of salt. Looking through these comments, there's almost nothing of value in there. Remember the joke about most of this sub being unemployed students.

mug35yf,"English is my first language, but I learned Spanish well enough to present at tech conferences in Spanish, so I do have language learning experience.Regarding A1-A2 active vocabulary: you’ve gotta move a lot of stuff from passive to active vocabulary. Writing may be a good stepping stone to practice output without the time pressure of speaking. r/WriteStreakEN will give you daily corrections. You could even note in your posts that you want corrections that elevate your vocabulary.Also, if you have flash cards, work them in the “I need to produce English” direction. If you don’t have flash cards, maybe get started with some. I had 5000 words in my Spanish study list back when I was studying.Also: read. A LOT. Reading is huge for increasing a person’s vocabulary. Since English pronunciation and orthography are only loosely related, and we’re talking about learning new words, reading along to an audiobook may be wise to ensure you pick up the correct pronunciations.For specifically-tech stuff, watching conference talks might not be a bad idea; you can learn a lot of domain-specific vocabulary that way, and there are a ton on YouTube.Regarding filler words: spend at least one hour a week with a tutor doing conversation practice. If you can do an hour twice a week, even better. This is to get you practicing with the time pressure. As your vocabulary and production under time pressure improve, you’ll spend less time searching for words and trying to hide it with filler words. But also: are you using English filler words/sounds/phrases or ones from your first language? If first language, switch to English fillers. “That’s a really interesting question because well, you know, the thing is, when you consider all aspects of that topic…” is a nice long string of words that give you time to actually think of your answer without it just being “uhhhhh” or worse, a non-English filler like “eeehmmmmmm.”Regarding pronunciation: record yourself repeating after something you’ve just heard. Maybe you watch a technical video and pause and repeat back a sentence. Then play back the original and yourself and compare. You can do a fair bit of accent training this way. You can also hire tutors who specifically do accent coaching.

Watch YouTube videos from channels like Gaurav Sen or System Design Interview, but spend most of your time actually practicing mock interviews out loud.

Focus on one language really well rather than jumping around, and make sure you can explain every line of code in your projects because interviewers will dig deep. When you do start interviewing, [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) can help you navigate those tricky technical questions and coding challenges that often trip up newer developers - I'm on the team that built it specifically to help people handle the pressure of real-time problem solving during interviews.",akornato,2025-05-29 08:45:26,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1kx5oo7,False,

mutxuq5,"oh im not in school rn, pursuing CSE. and by the finance side, i mostly meant to refer to quants, algo investments or maybe the DeFi part. and for the interest part, idrk anymore i kept jumping from hype to hype and im stuck in a weird situation now. i want to finish up web Dev, ML and finance and create the projects i have planned for this summer But i cant help but feel like i might not be able to get an internship this year. anyways another reason i am looking for new tech is to maybe find something that can get me going",Arjeet_singh,2025-05-29 04:54:48,1,cscareerquestions,t1_mutwnb2,True,
mutypns,"There are trillions of dollars in quants/algo trading, so if you want to get into that you're going to need to go deep and take it insanely seriously. There are plenty of day traders with their own algos going, let alone the big boys tracking the speed of light in their fiber cables in the data centers in NJ. You need to be the person answering these questions tbh. What do you want to do? You're not going to be able to chase every fad. There's plenty of demand in all the spaces you mentioned. Finish your projects and move on to other ideas that might give you a better idea of what you'd like to do.",phoenix823,2025-05-29 05:01:49,2,cscareerquestions,t1_mutxuq5,False,

mujlvl2,"Tough market, gotta have the degree. I’m doing it (MA in English, BA in English Education). Took 11 courses at a local college, enrolled in OMSCS, starting in the Fall. If it doesn’t work out, I’ll keep teaching. If I never enroll, I’ll keep teaching. Might as well do the degree naw’m’sayin?

mujubx3,"By UofT, I’m assuming UT Austin. I’m currently attending their MS program part time.That program does not sound like it’d be a good one for you as heavily focuses on theory. You’d be missing out on so many fundamental concepts that I don’t think you’d do well nor would it make you employable.It’s not going to teach you OOP, data structures, database systems, algorithms, etc.I would look into UPenn’s MCIT program as it’s tailored for people without a CS background.

mujoond,"I teach English at a local college. Regarding whether it’s worth it: I feel it provides me with the best odds of transitioning. It’s a reputable, affordable program with a great curriculum. Of course, my career transition is really up to me in the end (networking, projects, fine-tuning resume, tons of applications). The degree won’t open the door and pull me through, but it will create doors that wouldn’t otherwise exist.",tabasco_pizza,2025-05-27 17:05:50,3,cscareerquestions,t1_mujoaea,False,
