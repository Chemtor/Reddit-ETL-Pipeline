nnfkk05,"I don't think data quality is purely owned by product managers any more than security, availability, and scalability are.The biggest issues in my opinion are: * Data & software engineers and product managers have little understanding of the impacts and contributing factors to data quality issues. * Data engineers build systems in which they copy the encapsulated schemas from source systems into their warehouse to then transform them. Well, yeah, that's a solution that is pretty much guaranteed to cause a ton of DQ problems. As opposed to having the source system publish domain objects that are locked down with data contracts. * Data engineers build almost no quality-control tests, no unit testing, no reconciliation checks, no anomaly-detection, and no field transform audits to track changes over time. dbt and great expectations are generally poor tooling that only address a fraction of this. * Product managers, given zero push from engineering, leave out all considerations of data quality - no SLOs, no dashboards, no investment. Which means it falls 100% on the engineer's heads.It doesn't have to be that way.

The way they do so is perfect for them.Marketing want a single customer view. Neither line of business collect the data in a form that allows comparison. You now have a data quality problem.The only way I have found to improve the data quality is to fix it at source. You do this by making the down stream data vital to the earnings of both lines of business. Customers get pissed off because, as far as they are concerned they are buying from company X. They couldn't give 2 hoots for the fact they bought product line A which is different from product line B.

And no I cannot put new work on hold because I (the boss) cannot say no.\- Everything is fine, your other team mates (who are work-a-holics) are meeting deadlines, why are you complaining.\- A general lack of boundaries by your boss, management, or team mates to say it can wait til tomorrow for stuff that legitimately is not criticalI have some or all of the above at all of my jobs. When you have a boss who won't advocate for the team it really makes everything bad.

Mind you, the SMS notification job ran at 3 PM. He could have just asked me the next morning in the office. The problem is once you give into this type of nonsense it is hard to get people to back off and respect your boundaries.I now have a job with a great boss that sets clear boundaries. Maybe once in 4 years have I had an emergency call while on PTO or during off hours. And in this case it was a legitimate emergency and I was given extra time off to compensate. Sometimes we still fall into the ""get it out the door we'll fix problems later"" cycle, but at least my current boss sets some sprints aside to eventually address these issues.tldr: sounds like your company has management problems and doesn't respect boundaries.

Given that the field is more nascent, there’s lots of new, interesting problems to be solved, and you get to dig deep within the infra stack. If that’s of interest would recommend looking at companies with big infra departments in your country.

If you ho with databricks, pick Delta Live Tables, Databricks asset bundles, streaming tables etc and almost certainly CI CD. DbT would be another thing to think off.

nmscbyr,"I work for government: city-level economic growth data.The first thing in the morning I do is to ssh into our Linux virtual machine, manually run a pipeline I should have automated ages ago but haven't done so lol. This specific pipeline lives in our Virtual Machine of our Azure subscription, in which we integrate our Python scripts/modules and our Postgres server. So I am basically just typing some commands in the terminal until the pipeline completes which is a very simple report that ends up in a Google Drive folder for end users of our organization to see.I then go to Microsoft Fabric (the tool chosen by our organization for all data things), go to the monitor tab, see that the scheduled pipelines and any other job is running accordingly, maybe check the Excel reports we are generating to see everything is in order even if we are confident that things are fine.Attend a virtual call only me and project manager, in which like 5% of the whole call is talking about data, issues, tasks we have to do, and the rest of the call we talk about our lives lol.That's always the same, independent of the project.Now, depending on what we are working on, the rest of the day would be doing exactly that.For example, right now we are trying to organize more our workflow, so we are trying to implement the medallion architecture. So this last week I have been creating lakehouses in Microsoft Fabric (an object that lets you store structured and unstructured data within this ecosystem) where our bronze data will reside, ideally, I am separating a lakehouse for each data source (so we got sources like ArcGIS objects such as tables and PDF attachments, Postgres tables, nighttime lights satellite rasters of the Earth Observation Group, the typical Excel/CSV/txt files in a shared Google Drive folder, etc). We want to work less with Fabric notebooks because it lends itself to poorly organized code and workflows, and replace those with suitable items like Dataflow and such.But for 4 months I worked in implementing a system to gather real-time info from one of our ArcGIS social programs surveys. This again resides in our virtual machine, not in Fabric. I did this by deploying a web server and activating webhooks in ArcGIS and a receiver in Python, so ArcGIS basically sends a post request to our server every time there's a new registry or a change in the survey, we then transform this json payload (do some calculations, merge it with other existing data —data which can be obtained via API calls—) and finally upload the structured new registry in our Postgres tables which follow a relational schema. We haven't yet implemented this infrastructure to the Fabric workflow, so that's a task I am also working on.The Fabric notebooks we have are basically for data cleaning and transformation in either Python or PySpark.There's little routine in my job, since once we have something under ""control"" we are always thinking what else we can do to implement cool tools or new data or make cool analysis. For example, by December we want to be able to implement in our workflow a ML model one economist in our team is running about city's quarterly GDP prediction by grid, but first we must automate the ingestion of the inputs of the model such as .shp, geojson, etc files and create the full pipeline so that we then run that model.Disclaimer: I didn't study anything remotely related to software or data engineering. I studied economics but my career path took me to a much more data engineering roles for reasons I don't even know lol, life just surprises you sometimes as I never had this remotely in my mind. So far I have enjoyed it a lot! I work from home, I am free to make my own decisions, people hear my suggestions and ideas, and we can implement things freely. No micro-managing whatsoever. Also, there are routine things, but most of the time we are thinking in new ideas, so we are free to be creative.If you have any questions I am glad to answer them!",RoundAd8334,2025-11-02 22:57:30,5,dataengineering,t3_1omf6qa,False,

The concepts you learn building in Azure Data Factory (for example) will allow you much more easily learn something like Airflow versus if you were just learning it from scratch.Also, the vast majority of companies you apply to already use at least one of these and your audience becomes a lot bigger if you are an ""Azure expert"" vs. a ""Snowflake expert"" or a ""PySpark expert"".

There will be reports, there will be dashboards, there will be analytics there will be god knows what.Whatever will be the next hype cycle in the world data, companies still need their infrastructure running. As the old joke goes, whenever a data scientist joins a company, the first question they ask is 'well do you have a data infrastructure running?' and the answer is mostly no.AI/ML is really interesting and there is space for innovation. DE work is less innovation, but more hands on problem solving. I liked working in both. You can still transit from DE to AI/ML easily, you'd have a very solid foundation.I'd vouch for DE with an AI/ML flavour. If the market shifts, then you can become DE with a something else flavour (e.g. bit of analytics on side. Dashboarding maybe?). You already have an ongoing experience with AI/ML, combine that with a solid expertise in DE and you have good chances ahead I think. I'm sure i'd be happy to have someone like that on my team.Some skillset i'd recommend overal: strong grip on SQL and Python is already given for you which is great. Add understanding PySpark on top (with Spark generally), add a good understanding of a cloud provider (Azure or AWS, some relevant resources) add a data platform skill on top (Databricks or Snowflake). Get a basic understanding of OOP, maybe implement a simple pipeline platform in OOP for an example project.The market will always change and shift and we always had to adapt. Learning never stops in either field, but i agree that AI/ML is currently steeper than DE. If you cant land a DE role, go for a Data Analyst with (and i cant emphasise this enough) heavy tech skills orientation. Many business views DA jobs business only and not IT.

I cannot answer precisely on business wins as I had less exposure to end business users.From my experience, I can tell that it works well when there is a consuming/business team driving MDM with proper requirements and goals. Slowly it can evolve and become an enterprise level golden data layer by onboarding other business groups. This becomes a single source for multiple departments and business teams within an organization, this in itself solved a lot of things and improves productivity and business insights.Examples I have seen,- better(faster) customer onboarding and handling with the Customer master.- Improved vendor insights using supplier mastering.- I have not done product master implementation but I have seen a lot of top companies doing that as well.Cons:- MDM projects might fail if an organization fails to involve a business rep (MDM requires a lot of business involvement to deliver)- MDM projects unnecessarily extend and fail to deliver if an organization has short term vision- Vendor lock might be a problem as MDM is offered as a Software product- Sometimes it can be too complex- Before bringing mdm it is important to educate clients on what value MDM can provide and what are the limitations of MDM. It might sound absurd but I have seen a couple of projects cancelled midway due to this.Please let me know if my answer is naive.

(Ironically now we want to jam everything ino columnar store table file formats, that can partially trace to Vertica - Stonebreakers columnar OLAP db (fit for purpose)). The core issue is that our infrastructure layer never evolved to make fit-for-purpose systems practical at scale. We know different workloads need different data structures, different storage engines, different consistency models. But the operational reality of managing multiple specialized systems, keeping them in sync, and reasoning about data flow across them remains prohibitively complex for most teams. State management is a big reason for this.So we get stuck with pragmatic compromise. Teams choose Databricks or Snowflake or whatever and then bend their problems to fit the tool, because the alternative is managing a constellation of systems that might be technically superior, might better fit the different business needs, but is operationally untenable.There is a ton of conceptual inertia in industry too. We think in terms of linear data flow: source to warehouse to consumption (ETL or ELT). But that framework doesn't naturally accommodate materialization into multiple fit-for-purpose targets. The tooling, the abstractions, the operational patterns are all built around central systems of record (BI, Analytics, Dashboards), not around dynamic materialization.This is a key problem I'm working on. Until we have infrastructure that makes it trivial to materialize data into whatever shape and system the workload actually requires, without creating operational chaos, we'll keep defaulting to whatever single system we've already adopted, even when we know it's not right for half (or more) of what we're asking it to do.The inertia isn't just conceptual.

nngmmh4,"The cleanest most ""correct"" solution I've seen on GCP is to switch to the KubernetesPodOperator. The gist is that every single task in your DAG runs in its own isolated Pod in GKE. This is where the magic happens: you can apply labels to these pods: dag\_id, task\_id, and most importantly, customer\_id. Then you just go into GCP's native billing, which can group costs by those labels, and you can see exactly how much a specific DAG for a specific customer is costing you, down to the penny But if a full migration to Kubernetes is too much, there's a ""good enough"" method. Instead of tracking dollars, track resource-hours. Airflow logs the duration of every task. If your workers are a standard instance size (e.g., n2-standard-4), you can build a simple cost model: cost = duration\_in\_hours \* cost\_per\_hour\_of\_worker.

If your Airflow workers are not dynamic or they use the same pools of compute for all tasks, having a tagging system that trickles up into GCP/AWS billing is likely not possible. However you can often tag individual 'task runs' of ECS/Cloud Run instances and have those trickle into billing natively. In my experience you do lose out on additional aspects like networking out, which can be substantial, and if you can't find a way to associate that you'd need a top level overhead you append onto each task or maybe by runtime. Regarding non-efficient tasks, what does that mean? Airflows native monitoring shows the Task Duration and Landing times. Perhaps also look at sensor runtimes to subtract from overall runs as they're 'efficient'.My opinion would be that Airflow is a task orchestrator and attempting to patch in some sort of cost observability natively would not work well. Use the systems that are native to billing are the way to go.

nn6epnv,"I've done this to subset data for micro-batches. It does work and you can create quite clean and comprehensive collected datasets with it, but there are caveats.First, if you have links between two entities of the same type (customer-customer) then you will need to recursively traverse this graph to make sure you get everything, otherwise some referential integrity or derivation can break. These links can themselves be derived links rather than explicit ones, so it isn't necessarily something you'll be able to pick out algorithmically right away. An example I had was that two customers could be linked via a shared account, but the relationship was in a generic customer-account table, and the account could appear multiple times. Pulling in a customer that wasn't initially selected could pull in *another* customer, because the third customer may be related to the second but not the first.Second, you may end up with 'orphaned' data if you have you have some entity that is disjoint from your entry. Ideally this is not the case, but if you have multiple domains that don't directly interact you may end up just dropping an entire domain. Similar to the prior point, this is mostly something you'll find along the way, and you just need to give yourself an additional entry point.Third, you may have reference data that you don't want to filter in this way because certain outputs or reports may expect all reference data to be available regardless of whether anything relates to it. For example some classification reference set where someone does an aggregation group by that classification -- they may suddenly see classifications disappear entirely if no data was joined to it. They may prefer to still see the classification, but get `0` values in the aggregate data. Again, not something you can easily algorithmically determine, it is more of a UAT process on your data selection.That said, this is afaik the only real feasible way to get a comprehensive random sample of the data at a given point in time. As long as you come up with an extensible and performant way to relate tables for key selection, to add extra entry points, to specify 'full copy' reference tables, and to specify 'loopbacks' on key selection, it is just a matter of configuring things.I am not aware of a 'standard practice' for this.

nn1o6n6,"I think you are right that data governance often grows out of other data domains like engineering or analytics. Companies usually learn the hard way why their engineering or analytics initiatives fail, and only then start thinking about governance. At first they try to handle it with existing people, and when it grows large enough they start hiring roles dedicated to it. In my experience this mostly happens in big regulated industries like banks, insurance companies or government. Small companies usually do not care much, and it is fine, because their scale rarely makes the problems severe, and a small team can still handle them. So yes, I would recommend looking at highly regulated areas like banking, insurance or the public sector. You will find more demand there.As for entering data governance, it is a bit odd. From what I have seen, these roles are not the most sought after in data teams because they usually require less deep technical work. But this may only be true in organizations where the governance practice is already quite mature. Data skills still help a lot, and most places expect them in governance roles. Many organizations are still in the transition phase, where governance is mixed with regular data roles. It is still common to see a data engineer who is also a data steward at the same time while his job description might not actually indicate that.",Kardinals,2025-11-04 12:49:22,2,dataengineering,t3_1oo5u6o,False,

For instance, in countries like Germany where the automobile industry is huge, companies are starting to take data governance seriously. But instead of hiring an entirely new team, they usually trust experienced internal people from engineering or analytics and hand those responsibilities over to them. Of course, they often have one dedicated person overseeing governance to guide the engineers, but that’s usually about it.What’s confusing, though, is that some industries seem to treat it differently. For example, Lufthansa recently started hiring specifically for data governance roles, which shows that aviation and other heavily regulated sectors are beginning to take it more seriously.

It is often easier to pivot internally from analytics or engineering into governance or data management than to try to find a pure governance job from the outside.It can also be risky.

It finally made sense when I came in on Monday after a weekend release and noticed an algorithm I had written (tree traversal, but that doesn't matter) had been rewritten to be less efficient by the chief architect. I was young and inexperienced and stormed in and demanded an explanation why they had ""regressed our performance"". He calmly explained the situation. To get the release out on Saturday night he had to modify the structure of the data slightly...in a way that was incompatible with my traversal. He had spent about half an hour trying to figure it out, writing unit tests to test the old and new structure...old passed, new didn't, the issue he was troubleshooting came down to the algorithm. It had no tests other than the ones he wrote. No comments explaining the reasoning behind it. It was not obvious to him why a convoluted and non standard algorithm was used. He had to fix it, and had to support it, so he did the reasonable thing and replaced it with a well known algorithm that worked with his new unit tests. Problem solved, release shipped.Starting to sympathize with the predicament he was in I explained my concern...the performance wasn't ""optimal"". ""'Optimal'? how do you know yours was 'optimal'?"" I stammered a bit and conceded I didn't actually know...but it \*was\* more efficient. ""Benchmarks?"" ....""no...I never benchmarked it"". ""What cases does it work with""....""oh..this and that and the other...."". His response was ""how do you know?"". ""I tested it!"" .....""No...no you didn't. There were no tests. There are now. We know this works, when it works, and how it works."" I responded indignantly ""but it's slower"". ""By a couple milliseconds, a few dozen times a day it runs. Do you care about that? Why? Isn't it better to know it works because it is tested with cases we expect it to handle?""""Yeah. If I write unit tests to fix the trivial issue with the original algorithm can I replace it?"" .... ""I guess you can....but is a few milliseconds of execution time a dozen times a day worth the effort? Don't you have actual bugs to fix?"" ....""Yeah....""....""Then do it the next time you change that code"". It never had to change. I never put it back.If I'd written unit tests showing the conditions the traversal handled, what it's preconditions were, etc he would have fixed the trivial issue with it and gone about his way, me none the wiser. Because I did a shoddy job it became his problem, and he fixed it the most expedient way possible...reasonable while the entire release team is twiddling their thumbs waiting for a critical fix.If you don't unit test your code it doesn't really work.

This promise to myself would become very important later as I had several moments where I wanted to give up in the beginning because I couldn't solve some Javascript puzzle.At the same time I had the idea for an App that we could really use in the company I work at. For many years we used a whiteboard to do shift planing and it was really cumbersome so my goal is to develop an App for this but I had no idea how.7 months passed by and I was around half done with the Odin Project and decided I had enough know how to start developing the digital shift planer. If anyone is interested in the detailed development process of the App I wrote a long post in the Odin Project subreddit, you can check it out in my profile.Anyway after 3 months I had a working app that we now use for almost a year and as mentioned above I also won a company price for it.

I am a mathematics graduate who minored in data science and computer science, enough to focus on software engineering as my full-time job.My reasons are not degree based, but content based. I find it very hard to get motivation without structured, grade-based, financially-committed learned. That is, online free MOOCs are difficult for me to complete and actually learn. The masters program definitely breaks this barrier by putting my academic reputation on the line, and hitting my wallet!In my undergrad, there were a few gaps I had being a mathematics major. I never had a formal operating systems, database, or computer networks course. Thus, my first glass is in operating systems and I'm learning a ton through the projects, including client-server programming in C, IPC (shared memory and message queues), operating system design, and so much more. Note that I am doing this while I work a full-time job as a software engineer in the aerospace industry. So I'm learning from multiple angles. My focus in my program is to learn several computer science fundamentals that I missed and some new ones, and then transitioning to some more AI/ML related topics and applications in robotics, computer vision, etc.Do I think that an official masters degree in name is worth it alone? No. Don't get the masters if it's just about getting the degree. Do I think that an official masters degree is worth it for the structured learning and content? Definitely yes. I've only been in the program for 3 months and I've already learned so much. I'll take some classes on things I'm not familiar with and some new cutting edge features in computer science. Now there are some careers I'm interested in that start with having an advanced degree, but it's more of a convenience that I'll get that requirement than it is a motivating factor.Will it help your job outlook? Maybe, but it depends on what you take from it. If you have a masters or undergrad in computer science, but can't program anything or speak on certain subjects, you likely won't get the job. Believe it or not, this is a common thing that happens. This is the reason why cheating and similar is discouraged. Not just because it is dishonest, but because you won't learn anything by researching documentation and spending hours trying different things out. That's where the learning happens.The masters program I am in is Georgia Tech's Online Masters of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS). From what I understand, this program is very welcoming to non-CS undergrads, but you need to be able to speak on your abilities to accept the intense CS workload. If you don't know a single thing about computer science or programming, you won't succeed.

Here the Odin Project also does a great job. You learn the theory and then you build a project they provide where for each project you need all the theory you were supposed to learn prior. The course is hard and takes a long time to finish but imo is far better than a 5 hour youtube tutorial. Just watching someone code or just copying a project is not the same as creating your own version of a project which you will be required to do in the Odin Project.

nmunn5u,"First of all, you have your boiler plate stuff. Creating the solution and the main project, setting up configuration. I have separate projects for different parts.* Main program - UI / API (+web) * Business layer - called by the UI, contains operational logic* Data layer - called by the Business layer, houses Entity Framework code or anything that accesses the database.* Models - usually a sub-folder in the business layer, this is where the DTOs go* Services - also usually in the business layer, this is where classes that do stuff not directly related to the business logic (fetching/processing external data like HTTP or file calls, CSV, etc)* Database scripts - I'm a database-first guy, I like to write SQL, and use EFgen to (re)generate the context and models whenever the DB changes. I use DBUp to sync changes across environments. This is obviously optional. Then I think about the data it's going to be working with. I usually start with the database first, creating tables and indices, thinking about what kind of data I need to store. I might miss a couple of things that can go in later.I then think about how I want to access the data from the outside. I create a business layer class for each ""domain"". A domain is usually one table, but it may access other tables as needed. I don't do repositories as they are mostly just extra work, also EF is a repository, but you do you.The business layers job is to restrict how data can be accessed. What goes in when you create a new object? Usually the pattern is* Search - a way to list and possibly page through a set of objects, returning a summarized, smaller object that contains only the stuff that needs to be displayed. If paging is required, I have a generic class that returns the paged set and the total count. I also have a common extendable filter class.* Get - returns more detail about the object. May return child objects as needed.* Create / Update / Delete There may be more, specific ways to interact with the domain, those get added as needed. Sometimes you want to update only one field, like status, progress, without updating the entire object. Separating thouse out give a nice, clean, clear API and shows intent.If this is a web project, the controllers are mostly interfaces to the business layer. I can sometimes call multiple business layers in one place, but I never try to reuse code from one business layer as-is unless it makes complete sense. Don't be afraid to repeat some code. Or if you do, push it to a service that gets shared. The main goal is that each method should be doing something unique, and that if it changes, then everything affected should be minimally affected, i.e. the change shouldn't affect their core behavior.I separate (as much as possible) security from the business layer. So business logic should only care about what to do, not who is accessing it. Sure you will pass in some user information for filtering, and you will have logic that changes based on who is accessing the data, but you should have up-front checks before the business layer is called. This way you can test or use your business logic, either via unit tests or in a prototyping project without having to deal with setting up security contexts.",rupertavery64,2025-11-03 09:06:10,2,learnprogramming,t3_1on6g8o,False,

They don’t care about backlinks or meta tags; they care about context clarity.Think of it like this: instead of keyword density, LLMs look for meaning density. The cleaner the structure, like H1 → H2 → lists → short paragraph, the easier it is to turn into embeddings that make sense during retrieval.It’s a mix of HTML parsing + embedding similarity. The model doesn’t want to guess what the content means; it wants to know with high confidence before it recommends it.I’ve noticed smaller sites win here because they’re often simpler: fewer pop-ups, less CSS noise, and more direct semantic HTML.

Once a site has too many layers, widgets, modals, marketing blocks, or “creative” layout choices, the core meaning gets buried. The model can’t reliably extract one clean representation of what the business does, so it defaults to safer, simpler sources.And you’re right about agents.

It’s going to load machine code into an isolated virtual memory space and control physical memory storage, swap space, and cpu time vs other managed processes. It will also provide mediated access to hardware via OS calls. You still have to compile for the right cpu architecture and OS. Virtual machines like the Java JRE let you start with a semi-cpu agnostic median build that is JITted into machine code at runtime. The OS still doesn’t do it. With some runtimes, like .net, you do have to specify a target cpu architecture as well. That’s a VM design choice on whether they want to abstract certain cpu features like the size of registers (32 vs 64 bit), endian storage, etc. and OS features. These choices still have to be made eventually of course and abstraction adds overhead if the actual cpu uses a different standard.

nmkrlra,"I am not a REST evangelist, but the STANDARD approach to REST is that an endpoint set should refer to a RESOURCE, and a good litmus test for that is ""can I assign an ID to it without it getting weird"". And then you spread CRUD operations (create read update delete) across the verbs (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) for that resource. If you're more familiar with SQL, thinking about how you'd normalize the tables and what gets a primary key can kind of give you an idea what a ""resource"" or ""entity"", etc. would be.In your case, I'd probably have something more like1. POST /api/cart - CREATE a new CART2. POST or PUT /api/cart/{cartId} - Update metadata about the CART {cartId} (not necessarily its sub objects)3. POST /api/cart/{cartId}/item - CREATE a new item in cart {cartId}4. POST or PUT /api/cart/{cartId}/item/{itemId} - UPDATE an existing item in cart {cartId} with the id {itemId}. Your quantity update would go here.For the item model I'd probably have something like (BASIC) itemId // the id of the CART item productId // the id of the product in your catalog quantityNote I dont put things like PRICE, etc. in there: the PRODUCT linkage should let you get the price of the product in your catalog and do the math to present price information. You don't want to put things like that in your cart model, because it gives attackers a target to EDIT something they shouldn't, and suddenly they can update something in the cart to give it a price of $0. There are like a half dozen different suggestions about proper security design that go along with that, and I know you didn't ask about that, so I'm not going deeper.Also note that endpoint split is a little obvious for REST stuff, but there's others that aren't as obvious: like do you have an endpoint for SHIPPING information, OR is shipping information just part of a CART update call? ie:1. POST api/cart/{cartId}/shipping - ""create"" a shipping record for cart {cartId}?2. PUT api/cart/{cartId} - or just update the shipping information on the cart record itself?These judgement calls can be driven by LOTS of things. I might want to split shipping info updates to its own endpoint because the UI segregation of that operation vs other cart update operations kinda suggests it. Or because my DB design says that ""ShippingInfo"" is a 1:1 record with a Cart, and I want to adhere a bit to my data structure case, or dozens of other reasons.Another fun one, what type of endpoint would you use for a SEARCH endpoint? By REST standards its conceptually a GET, but robust search often becomes a POST out of necessity of supporting larger POST bodies. Plenty of GETs in a larger ecosystem migrate to POSTs to support request bodies too, because REST doesn't really deal with that, and you absolutely will hit a point where you have to send a body on a GET at some point because URLs can't support the size. Be pragmatic when its called for.Hell you don't HAVE to use PUT for updates. I've seen plenty of people only use POST as just ""POST is an upsert"" instead of dealing with PUTs at all, or reserving PUTs for PATCH operations and using POSTs for full object updates. REST purists will get all up in arms about that but... you should really ignore them. Almost no one does the pure thing in reality.",i8beef,2025-11-01 18:49:22,7,learnprogramming,t3_1olpqwa,False,

REST rules are about finding a kind of consistency, but real world API's often have edge cases.

Setting out to build a huge system, which is what you have envisioned, is likely to result in feeling like its too big and burnout. I would encourage you to pick one small component of what you want to build and do that. Skip the fancy UI, make it a command line utility so you don't get bogged down with building a fancy interface. Stay very focussed on it and only it. Don't worry if it feels like you can't visualize it, you can add that later once the core is working. For example, ""signal processing"" is very general. What inputs do you want to process to produce what outputs? Pick one, say the ability to accept stereo audio and determine which side of the space it is on. Not where it is, just which side, ie left or right. Test it, first with unit tests, then using live data. Get it working, very well. Feeding unreliable data to the next step in the processing pipeline will create pain as you have to determine which component is unreliable. Then add multiple sources of input, ie two people having a conversation back and forth. Extend it to identify that there isn't a single source. Get that working. Then extend again to identify which side the sources are on. Get it working. Unit test everything so you don't accidentally break stuff that you had working. I could go on and on and on...but that is how you build a complex system from the ground up.Expect your project to take years working on it full time. What you have laid out is a \*massive\* undertaking. Spend ample time evaluating existing libraries and tools that do the things you want...it's almost always easier and faster to use existing components than to build your own. Beware of the licenses...don't use anything that you don't want to be restricted by in the future. You can always replace components with others or your own if you determine they don't work. That might be reasonable to get you past a hurdle, but can also be a waste of time if you try to use something and it just isn't suited. Rack it up as a learning experience and move on.Break everything down into manageable chunks. Days or maybe a week...longer than that does not provide enough structure or confidence in feasibility.

nnadgly,"> How to figure things out on my own?Kind of ironic that you're even asking this, rather than figuring it out on your own, no?The process is pretty straight forward - you think about it. You read about it. YOU BEGIN BY STUMBLING AROUND, LOST AND ALONE IN THE DARK until you trip over something that might possibly happen to lead you somewhere. You have no idea what you're doing or where you're going until you get there, only to discover it was a dead end, and then you have to backpedal and try to figure out where else you might be able to go - perhaps from a past breadcrumb, perhaps a different trailhead you found along the way that you can come back to.Figuring shit out on your own means being lost most of the time. If you are willing to accept that whatever you're trying to do - you're likely not the first, and your problem was probably already solved first 60-80 years ago, then there's a lot of academic research to do. It's reading, reading, reading...If what you're doing IS unique, well then you have to spend a lot of time just thinking, just trying stuff. Every failure informs you of what not to do and how not to do it. You have to know what you want to accomplish in the first place so you can measure how far off you are.> I want to know how I can truly figure things out on my own and study effectively without missing important or essential informationYou need to embrace that you're totally missing shit, all the time. There is a depth of knowledge in front of you that you have no idea is even there, but the more you learn of it, the more profound all future insights would be, the faster and better you will find future solutions.But don't miss the forest for the trees. I've been programming for over 30 years - I'm tickled that Unicode is backward compatible with 1830s telegraph equipment, and that means something to me, but it doesn't mean anything to you. You're not there and it doesn't have to matter.> while also avoiding wasting too much timeThis bad attitude is not going to serve you. NOTHING is a waste of your time. Thomas Edison didn't invent the lightbulb, but he did improve upon it. He said it himself - he didn't fail 10,000 times, he just found 10,000 ways how not to do it. That information was GOLD back then. You don't learn from successes but failures. Being lost and stumbling, ""wasting time"" as you put it is a very necessary part of the process, it builds your intuition, which is what you actually need - knowledge you don't know you have and don't have to think about, but it informs you.

nnmqdpc,"Jira is absolutely a solid choice (when it isn't atrociously slow, but that's not something you need to worry about). I won't try to convince you of something else. Below is more of a personal observation to put my recommendation in context.I have worked with a lot of bugtracking/planning software. bugzilla, trac, redmine, jira, codebeamer, github issues, IBM doors... big and small, well-known to self-made. At the end they all do more or less the same with varying degrees of usability and features.And some things never change:- Planning is mostly garbage. This isn't a slight against you, this is universal. The entire agile movement at its heart is about the realisation that planning longer than two weeks ahead is reading tea leaves. If you need to plan, plan only enough to keep people busy for a week. Ideally the subjects of what needs to be done should fit on a single screen. Jira can do that, a text file can do that too.- Any planning tool is only as good as the people maintaining it. It's a non-trivial commitment and it is thankless work, and people who like coding will quickly forget about it. Only commit to processes you can also keep up. Jira can model entire epics and release plans and whatnot - and will gladly rot away with outdated information unless you slavishly document everything there.- Text is king. Whatever you do, a few month from now you'll need to find it again within the hundreds of tasks you did in the meantime. You can search for text, but you can not search for audio or images. Try to keep everything as text as long as possible. The tracker may have fancy images or support draw.io embeddings, but as soon as you try to export to pdf or copy paste into a code editor or try to localise it breaks in creative ways.- Locality is also king. Every external tool is a chance for things to go out of sync or to get lost. There's an old open source project where I have been contributing for over two decades now. We've gone through 5 different bugtrackers in that time. Every time the decision to move was correct in the circumstances, but every time it meant we lost the entire bug history.",aanzeijar,2025-11-07 17:44:12,2,learnprogramming,t1_nnl51dn,False,

We will only do this for a short period of time, like 3 sprints (6 weeks), then we go back to the process.The process is good and it works, but it is a slower more methodical and sustainable thing.",Ok_Substance1895,2025-11-07 17:31:57,2,learnprogramming,t1_nnmkg76,False,

If they have an operating system (e.g. linux) then you can use VM langs. These tend to be your bigger devices with more power. If battery operated customers really care about battery life. If you have 30,000 sensors around the country with button cells in, you want it to be 5-10 years before you have to replace those... so we use microcontrollers and C (sometimes C++). Custom protocols are sometimes seen, but LoRa(WAN) etc. are common too. You need to be comfortable at the bits-and-bytes level ideally. Good fundamentals in general software dev (data structures etc.), network programming, are necessary. The ability to understand a bit about hardware is a nice to have.You can also get into the networking and infrastructure side, or the distributed system design side of things, and of course you have standard app development to actually use the data from things like sensors and devices on the network etc.Cool field if you like to stick your fingers in many pies.Edit: Forgot databases.

nnbsejv,"Here is a recent comment I made on Assembly, with some book suggestions. Tldr: ""Programming From The Ground Up"" is a good starter assembly book imo.Assembly is very useful if you have a need to craft custom executables without trying to wrangle a compiler. Having control to the byte level of an executable can be handy.For example, I have written x86 assembly in recent years to solve 2 problems.1: I wanted to make a hobby OS that can run on BIOS based computers, and to get that going, I needed a MBR (master boot record). So I wrote a 512 byte MBR in x86 assembly, since an MBR needs to be exactly 512 bytes, with a signature at byte 512. No idea how I could have done that in C or any other language.2: I wanted my Python program to export executables for vintage computing platforms. Think MS-DOS, C64, etc. I did not want my program to rely on cross-compiler packages or any of that crap. So, I used assembly to craft some executable code that would look for video data at the end of the file. I assembled that into a machine code blob, and have my program encode video data and append it to the blob when I want to export an executable. Now my program can spit out custom DOS and C64 programs, with 0 dependencies for the user.I found the book ""Programming From The Ground Up"" quite useful for getting my feet wet with assembly. After that, the books ""Advanced MS-DOS,"" ""EGA/VGA: A Programmer's Reference"" and ""Zen of Assembly Language"" became useful.Other obvious modern uses for assembly language are writing compilers, language virtual machines, reverse engineering, writing exploits.If you are writing for a microcontroller and need to use as few bytes as possible, assembly is the best way to optimize for space.As far as I know, hardware IO ports (x86 only?) are only accessible through assembly. C functions that do this wrap assembly code. This is necessary for writing some hardware drivers where memory-mapped I/O is not an option.If you want to try 6502 Commodore 64 assembly, this site has some great resources: https://codebase64.c64.org/",Tall-Introduction414,2025-11-05 23:20:51,1,learnprogramming,t3_1opiagu,False,

And these are all scenarios where a solution like site builders, CMS etc are not only easier, but often the most appropriate solution. Any experienced dev will tell you there's no point reinventing the wheel unnecessarily, and you really want to avoid building yourself from scratch anything that handles money or PII.Companies that do need custom web app development/maintenance, are hiring teams of them on long-term contracts or FTEs, via job postings/recruiters/consultancies, not from bloody Fiverr or the local community notice board. And that's almost exclusively larger businesses. Or smaller businesses run by inexperienced entrepreneurs whose eyes are bigger than their budgets, whom you should avoid.So yes they're hiring true full stack devs, they're as in-demand as ever, but not in the places you're looking. And between the economy & mass industry layoffs, cheap foreign labor, and the several-years-long influx of newbies who've been convinced a 6 week ""bootcamp"" is enough to get rich quick and that freelancing is the cheat code to success when real companies won't hire you; competition is pretty fierce so your work is cut out for you.If you truly want to attempt this you would avoid those freelancing platforms, that ecosystem is tailored towards small COTS solutions with short turnaround.

You can also learn about manual memory management that way. It can also teach you lot about parallelism if you start doing multiple processes and multiple threads. Again those are things which you won’t have any experience with from TS and it can help a ton to learn them.Beyond that learning a bit of assembly is always worth just because it can demystify bunch of stuff. Scheme and C++ are both very interesting if you want to learn what cool stuff you can do with compile time meta programming, since they these languages are kinda kings of that. Erlang and co can be interesting because of the OTP and in general CSP/Actor style concurrency. Learning prolog can be pretty interesting educational experiment since the whole highly declarative style of programming is very unlike anything you might see elsewhere. Elm is also really interesting take on declarative UI programming. Idris is amazing take on dependent type systems. Rust is obviously pretty cool and popular take on affine types etc. There is abundance of cool languages which can teach you a lot.The holy trinity of corporate languages (Java, C#, Go) are not particularly interesting, nor can you gain a bunch of great insights from learning them… Sure maybe some things about parallelism can be learned, and Java and Go are both decent enough takes on the whole CSP concurrency model, but mostly they are kinda boring, which is kinda the whole point of languages like that.

And a two year gap is an issue, but it’s something you can overcome (you can also finesse it on delivery).1. Go all out on applying right now to see if you can get an offer within the calendar year. It’s unlikely, given how close we are to the end, but those kinds of arbitrary markers matter on a resume.2. Target what’s sinking you. It sounds like you have to some extent, but in a more nebulous way. Do practice interviews with other people online.

When I got out, I had no idea what to do, went through a really bizarre divorce (not related to that transition) and basically sat on my hands for a year and a half. Had to move back in with my parents, it all made me miserable. Finally decided if I wanted to do something worthwhile, I would need a degree. Turns out if you haven't been in school for awhile, its hard to get accepted to a technical program, so did community college for a year, got into a program, didn't really know what I wanted to do, did math, decided CS might be reasonable. Transferred to a different (better engineering school), COVID hit, decided the work I was doing in CS was remarkably boring, did really poorly, felt wayward again. Got transfered to a different program (Civil Engineering), got through the whole program pretty quickly and cleanly, basically could care less about it. Now I am in a Computing applied AI and systems masters program trying to focus on the components I actually enjoy (to varying degrees of success so far). The joy I find in all of this comes in at the edges, and honestly my girlfriend and cooking, the little things I do everyday keep me sane.I say all of this to say its okay to be struggling, its fine to vent and shout into the void, its fine to be tired and disappointed and honestly, in my experience is its also normal to feel like you are doing everything right and still come up feeling like you didn't get anywhere. Life is a grind, survival is a grind and if you can set goals and work towards them, that is awesome (and aspirational), but when something doesn't work out, for whatever reason, it doesn't mean you are washed, you aren't done, just time to figure out the next thing.",Mountain_Classic_384,2025-11-06 06:21:59,16,cscareerquestions,t3_1opqxkh,False,

For Atlassian, do you at least still get hired into a craft (BE/FE/FS) or did they get rid of that?

Its ability to search through the codebase for context and examples is very helpful.3. Give it context. Point it in the direction of a similar test suite with patterns you want it to emulate. If you just tell it to write tests for Service X, it will do whatever it wants - which is usually not what you want. Point out patterns you want it to emulate (e.g., “Use fluent assertions and create separate expectation objects to compare results against”)4. Don’t trust the tests it creates. Testing is meant to find the cracks and AI is an agreeable little sycophant. It’s just trying to get tests to pass.

My prompts for larger changes are usually about 2 or 3 good paragraphs.There's 2 approaches to this:* learn how to provide all the necessary requirements and context so that an agent can do everything all at once* break up your work into small bite sized pieces and have the agent work on those one by one.

Our on-call can be brutal and all of the things we own are critical so it can be stressful. It’s not friendly to early career, especially if it’s not the type of work you are interested in, and it has been a struggle. I was told that this experience with systems would be great for my future career opportunity so I went along with it. What I’ve found is that I’m missing out on a lot of traditional early career exposure. I don’t have much OOP experience and I don’t know much about writing or owning the destination services themselves. This has made it tough to change teams (I’ve gotten direct feedback that they want more code experience) and it means that to land another job I will have to be “creative” on my resume and when interviewing. In the current market, people want specific tech stack experience, not generalists. So yes I very much feel pigeon holed as a result of the bait and switch and it has impacted my career trajectory and my overall happiness in the industry. I don’t write code or build things: I put out fires, stare at dashboards, and debug kubernetes logs. I’ll spend an hour figuring out an esoteric 1 line yaml configuration change which could literally take down the entire business if it’s done wrong, and then a teammate will ask why it took me so long. I am expected to understand the entirety of our system as opposed to just my one vertical. It is not at all what I expected when I chose this career. I do not recommend taking an SRE job out of school. As others have said, it’s something people usually choose to get into later in their career, it assumes a lot of underlying knowledge, it’s high stakes, and it’s not the type of work everybody enjoys or excels at.

nmxiy6g,"One of the big issues right now is the industry is in a downturn. There’s debate if and when things will turn around. There’s a chance by the time you graduate, the market will be better, but there are no guarantees in life. There is a general shift away from remote work. Hybrid is more popular these days, although there are some places going 5 days on-site. It won’t be impossible for you, just hard. There’s value being in-person, especially earlier in your career or time at a new company/team. You don’t need to necessarily love programming, but you need some combination of competence and caring. When I say “caring,” I mean wanting to do a good job rather than half-ass it. You don’t need to work a million hours. There are a lot of really lazy devs out there. And a lot of people want to gatekeep the industry to those “who truly care.” I’m not trying to contradict myself. In latter scenario, caring means people who eat, live, and breathe tech. You can still be quite successful without that. There are some online universities, if you really cannot stand your current state. There are about 3-4 that are regularly recommended, but their names escape me at the moment. Definitely a step above University of Phoenix. You will be getting a real degree. One other thing to consider is some women don’t like tech working environments. Men in tech can be weird for several different reasons. You have the original nerd types, and now there are tech bros. There have been initiatives to increase the number of women in STEM, but YMMV how each company has done. I saw this post in another sub and thought it was interesting. It’s open to some interpretation. https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1n5xc3s/im_told_that_our_engineeringfocused_culture_is/There are also tech roles that are don’t require coding.

Not enjoying that basic part early on says your tolerance for it might be too low for an industry that prides itself on burnout.However! There are a lot of cushy, well paying jobs in literally every field. And, in most of these jobs, you will find that having a working knowledge of scripting, data manipulation, and basic structures can give you a MASSIVE advantage.My advice: find something you want to do.

I've literally had to tell people ""don't tell me the number you think I want to hear"", for example, when I smelled a ""going through the motions"" estimate.On the code quality front, ""letting them failing"" is another way of saying to give people autonomy to potentially shoot their own foot (and then own up to it).

EM does a lot more in the realm of fielding requests for work coming from other teams. Understands our capabilities, commits us to work that is in our ballparkand so our tasks to start are usually very broad in definition, something like ""Add Drawer Login Component"" with really just the design files attached and some bigger acceptance criteriait's on us to break that down to the smaller manageable tasks, and point them as a group. Then they're just added to the queue for the sprint, that's what we've committed to. All unassigned.and so now, anyone can pick up any of those tasks, let's say given an assumption we all have similar skillsets. Maybe a junior picks up a task that is a little more difficult; they can either take on the challenge, or maybe a more mid or senior stops them and says - ""oh hey this might be a little more involved, but you can help me build this part of it"" and create another ticket.So now we're all trusted to get the job done by doing all the discovery and now we have to work a little bit more together, and everyone has an idea of who's taking what. Junior A is prob waiting on bigger design things from Senior B before they can start. The senior would be inclined to prep the junior on what they have to do. or get them to focus on something else while Senior B finishes.You, just kinda make sure that you're aware of the progress, and the more senior engineers are there to identify risks.

Specifically, review their recent stock price history (if they are a publicly traded company), see if they are operating at a net loss, and read reviews from employees to see if there are any negative trends to watch out for if you were to join. (For example, if one employee review says that everyone backstabs each other, but the other 300 show nothing but praise, the backstabbing claim was most likely made from a bitter person who got fired, or at least it is very uncommon at that company.

nn8yf0v,"This is kind of a brain dump, but hopefully it helps:There are four types of layoffs (at least):1. The company is doing bad and they need to cut costs to stay afloat2. Corporate greed - the company is doing perfectly fine but the shareholders aren't seeing enough profit so we're gonna lay a bunch of people off to get more ""efficient"", which actually means ""overwork the shit out of people""3. Bloat - the company is doing fine, but there's a bunch of people that aren't actually working on projects that are valuable and the company can realistically not justify keeping them around4. A team is no longer necessary because the product/service/whatever they support is getting axed because it sucks - the rest of the company is fineAnd that is the order of how unappetizing it should be to join that company. A company that is struggling so much that it needs to lay people off is not necessarily a company that will turn it around because of the layoffs - things might get even worse after the layoffs.A company that is laying people off because of greed is going to have a horrendous work culture where people are going to have to work long hours, where a lot of knowledge will have recently left the company, etc. So you're not necessarily at risk of getting laid off, but you're going to be dealing with a pretty shitty work environment for a while.A company that allows bloat to happen now might allow bloat to happen again - if they aren't disciplined in their hiring, it means there's a risk that you might be the next bloat they get rid of. So this is going to be a role in which you're going to want to quickly make sure you're attaching yourself to valuable projects.And lastly - sometimes shit doesn't work out. We're seeing this with Amazon for example - you signed up to work on Alexa and now Alexa looks like it's going nowhere. It sucks, but sometimes you do need to get rid of like an entire department because it's just not what the company can justify. And as long as you're not joining a highly experimental arm of the company, this shouldn't really impact you much.I think by now there are very few companies that haven't done layoffs, and a company that is conservative enough to never overhire will have their own issues - namely, probably some stagnation and some lagging the market.

nn4lesf,"Did this about a year ago. SA / sales-adjacent roles were not on my radar at all, I had 8YOE as a SWE. I just thought the role sounded interesting and applied. In terms of transitioning understanding the domain you’d be working in is as important if not more so than your technical experience, so if you can find an SA role that is focused on the industry you work in now that’s probably the best way to get your foot in the door. Interview process was relatively easy, not highly technical. I was asked to describe in detail my technical work on my resume to basically check that I have a basic level of technical skill and can approach a new project, do research, build any required new skills, and execute, but no leetcode or anything. Obviously being personable and charismatic is relatively important as well. I’m at a Mag7 company. I believe SAs here are paid roughly 10% less than equivalent level SWEs but the pay is more than double what I was making in my last job at a Fortune 25 non-tech company as a SWE. WLB here is good with the caveat being that any SA role is likely going to require some travel. I’ve traveled approximately 6 times in the last year which isn’t terrible but I have colleagues who are traveling once a month or more.I’d say career trajectory is good, in my company SA has a high level of visibility, and because it’s a very versatile role that spans sales, product, and engineering I think it would be fairly easy to transfer into TPM or engineering from here. I don’t personally find the work as fulfilling as SWE but I also think that’s partially because I haven’t quite hit my stride yet. I have zero regrets about the transition in because of what I gained financially.

How do you manage migrations? How do you do migrations and app deployments without backwards compatibility issues? When should you use jsonb and when shouldn't you? What should the data type be of your primary key? When should you use a composite primary key? How should dates be stored?

nmjx8bn,"> The recruiter said it’d be best to brush up on [Azure and Postgres] and that “_They will likely ask about your skill sets in those areas and how you would deal with common problems that are encountered in Azure and Postgres_”.This isn't super useful advice ... best you can do is speculate.I would say ""relating the services"" is probably not what they're expecting. They're likely going to want end the interview feeling that you can competently architect and implement solutions on Azure. And if you've done this on AWS, chances are you won't struggle with Azure. But you'll need to sell the interviewers on this.Differences in the major services across AWS/Azure seems reasonable. S3 vs Blob / EC2 vs Azure VMs (and all of the sysops stuff orbiting both) / Glue vs Fabric -- you get the picture. So you can confidently address things like ""well, we did it this way with Glue at current employer for these reasons, but my understanding is Fabric handles X Y Z differently, so we would adjust the approach in A B C ways for D E F reasons if we were to reimplement"".> Postgres * MVCC * Complex and composite data types * JSONB * Object relationsIn my experience this is all pretty surface-level stuff that practically any RDBMS would force you to learn if you're building anything moderately complex with it.

nmuot76,"7 YOE here.I am a BE generalist who due to the fluidity of the market also do full stack (BE focused).Personally, life just... more or less led me to be a BE/full stack-ish generalist. It just sort of happened because those teams took me in early career and it just... sort of kept going on like that since then.I am purposely rerouting to full stack side from purely BE as I am noticing more and more job postings want full stack (so doing best to adapt to the job market for future job searches).>what factors helped you choose your pathtbh, I don't know. I think for most of my career, I didn't know much so I just adapted given the work I was given. And I never really gave much of a thought. It's really difficult to know anything early career and all I knew during college was I absolutely wanted to avoid networking, C++, OCaml, machine learning. Looking back now, I feel thinking in absolutes is not good and I should have given those fields a try.I did do data engineering side (more niche) early on but quickly pivoted away because I noticed data side was going to get paid less than general engineering (the trend was dying and the number of job postings were too slim so I escaped while I could early career).>How has this decision impacted your job security, compensation growth, and day-to-day satisfaction?Job Security - Feels nonexistent. I think this is the worry with generalists. I am way too easily replaceable by offshoring as offshore infra matures more and more. I wish I would have specialized and am doing my own sort of specialization in some ways (explained later on).Compensation Growth - Leaves to be desired. If I could redo I would have run immediately to Machine Learning. The pay premium is so much greater. It's noticeably more. Basically about $80\~200k more a year when you are senior/staff. And career growth (promos) seem much faster for more niche fields. For instance for those in security or ML, they can get external Google Senior offer at 5 YOE. A generalist might need 10 YOE in comparison and get paid worse.Day to day satisfaction - I find working with motivated coworkers with a decent manager is what sets the day to day satisfaction. Not the type of work I do.>specializing in a niche vs being a generalist?While my skills are generalist, I am 'specializing' in business domain. That's how I plan on 'buffing' (?) my resume. So while my coding skills are generalist, the domain I am working on is becoming more specialized.I definitely noticed how helpful that was when doing a job search recently.[https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1o1m1hw/2025\_job\_search\_2\_month\_long\_results/](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1o1m1hw/2025_job_search_2_month_long_results/)Applied 18 companies and 15 gave interviews. All 3 that didn't respond were for generalist roles that were far off from my business domain. And the 1 recruiter who ghosted me after recruiter call was also for a role far outside the business domain I worked on.If anything, I noticed throughout the interview process the jobs that were closely in lined to business domains basically just gave me offers (freebies). It's a huge advantage to have experience in closely related niche fields.I say specialize early on in potential in-demand fields if you can because the ones with high barriers of entry like GPUs, AI inference, etc are extremely difficult to offshore. And basically have no competition once you have sufficient experience (best for job security). And can command huge premiums in the market as you become senior+ (+ promos are easier and quicker).If you cannot specialize like that and you are a generalist, at least specialize on the business domain. Why wouldn't a hiring manager pick someone who is exposed to similar business domains over some random candidate who worked on something completely different? That said do keep in mind generalists are the most replaceable so offshore worries will be a bigger threat over time. :/**I honestly feel generalist just sucks. Most easily replaceable/offshore-able.** **Specialize in what companies need but cannot find. It's all supply demand and promos/compenstions do reflect such as well.** **Have knowledge in many stuff but be deep in 1 topic.**In a bad economy, also keep in mind while generalists can apply everywhere, specialists (in domain or busines knowledge) will be first in line for those jobs. So you do get screwed in job searches as a pure generalist.Keep in mind specialist in some outdated garbage is the worst of all worlds.",Fwellimort,2025-11-03 09:18:55,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1on6sqo,False,

nmvr66b,"Love the question. makes me think more carefully about my path.First off, I have intentionally never hired full stack engineers, so I vote for specializing in front or backend. That's an interesting topic to get into, too.Myself, I've serially specialized in both my roles and what industries/segments I've been focused on. In both cases I've tried to get as deep in the speciality as practical. Roles: backend dev, product manager, project manager, software & systems architect, no-hands-on people manager. Bouncing from one to another hasn't held me back. I honestly couldn't say which I enjoyed more and the world needs all of them. With industries, I specialized in systems (primarily app servers and orch platforms), dev tools, data agg/monetization, and vertical search engines. That might not seem like a huge range, but each of them are pretty specialized and their first choice is to hire people from their own space, so the segments are a factor.I don't think specialization necessarily holds you back from making changes. As a hiring manager, for a mid-/senior dev I want to see people have been in 3-6 companies in at least 2 industries over 4 to 12 years digging as deep into whatever they were doing at the time to be great at it.

I have never been at a company where anyone really got up to speed in less than six months. If it's a large company, a fast-moving company, or both, it can take closer to a year.Two: We are all our own worst critics. We see all of our deficits and fuckups. Meanwhile, when we see other people's work, it's because they landed something, solved some problem, gave some slick presentation, etc. Don't compare yourselves to others. You will invariably be comparing your messy practice sessions to their greatest hits.Three: When the great jazz guitarist Pat Metheny was asked by an interviewer how he got so good, he responded ""easy, I made sure I was the worst guy in every band I was in."" Talk to the people whose work you admire. Ask them how they think about problems. If you see a slick piece of code or a clever solution, give it the old \`git blame\`, figure out who wrote it, and message them saying it's cool and asking how they came up with it. Pay attention in code reviews. Get a mentor who is more senior in the same org and role as you. Even if you are the worst guy in the band right now, *that's the position where you do the most improving*.I've been where you are now, and it sucks, but it doesn't suck forever.

Especially applying for full time positions, a single internship with relevant experience to what you’ll be doing in the position you’re applying for is worth WAY more than a degree from like CMU, MIT, Stanford, GT, etc. That said, these places might get you better connections, but at the end of the day you can make up having a less prestigious school in your resume by having strong projects and or internship and co-op experience. Also once you get your first real position, no employer really cares about what school you went to or what your GPA is. If you’re interested in graphics programming, I would start with picking up a book on OpenGL and actually building stuff. Possibly using something like Open3D. As for if you should get your Masters, I would look now at the types of jobs you would like to apply for after you finish school. If most of them require a master’s degree, then yeah get it now. Speaking from experience it’s way easier to get it straight away than trying to go back. I tried after i started working full time and my wife and I had just started a family and finishing my masters program was more than I can handle. So if you think you might want to and you have the means to do it, I would say do it now while your brain is still in “school mode” and you don’t have a bunch of other extra responsibilities to balance.

nnbzeyu,"The issue isn't your technical skills - those projects show you can code. The issue is positioning. Right now your resume reads ""teacher who learned to code"" when it should read something like ""technical problem solver with rare communication skills."" Your teaching background is actually valuable, communication skills are valuable. Right now your experience section leads with teaching, which makes recruiters think ""teacher"" not ""engineer."" For a career transition, you'd need to reframe. I would lead with project experience. Recruiters spend 6 seconds scanning - they need to see impact fast. Instead of ""Integrated Leaflet maps with \[city\] open data API"" try something like ""Built a web app that helps users avoid 3.4M parking tickets by visualizing real-time data"" I'm building a tool to help career transitioners position themselves better.

nnj8g3b,Had a technical interview for an intern position. I was expecting leetcode but it wasn’t really leetcode so I was thrown off guard. I think I managed to get the solution but I was asking a lot of questions and the interviewer was also asking questions about the code. Am I cooked ?,Antique_Lion_2516,2025-11-07 02:56:52,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1opt3pw,False,
nnk1iuo,"u/Antique_Lion_2516 It's hard to give you a definitive answer without knowing the exact problem that was discussed and questions that were asked.From a recruiting/interviewing standpoint, here's what I'll say: not all technical interviews are going to be leetcode-type problems. Some interviewers prefer to pick your mind on specific aspects of the code and focus on your approach to problem solving rather than on a specific solution. These interviews can feel more like a discussion rather than a ""test"", and you're definitely allowed to ask questions.So the final answer really depends on the specifics of the conversation you had (were your questions targeted and useful to solve the problem or were they due to a critical lack of comprehension? Did they ask basic questions because they didn't get enough from you or were these calibrated follow-up questions to dive deeper?). Regardless of the outcome of that specific interview, it's good for you to experience the different interviewing styles. If you don't get this one, you'll get another one ;-)Best to you!",emmanuelgendre,2025-11-07 06:36:01,1,cscareerquestions,t1_nnj8g3b,False,
nnldabz,Thank you for the reply!! I’ll say the questions they asked were more like edge cases for how the answer should be formatted. I’m hoping I solved the main issue and the questions were just extra. Also pseudocode was allowed so I’m hoping it was more of a discussion type question and not necessarily having to solving it,Antique_Lion_2516,2025-11-07 13:33:50,1,cscareerquestions,t1_nnk1iuo,False,
nnmjouz,"u/Antique_Lion_2516 That sounds like follow-up questions and the fact that they were ok with pseudo-code matches the discussion style indeed.
