It goes without saying this was well before the advent of AI and also chemistry is a field where all of the answers aren't on Google.One of the reasons I wasn't improving was because I didn't like the field I was in. I didn't have passion to improve and felt like I was entitled to more than I actually deserved just because I had X years of experience on paper. In the meanwhile, people who were much younger and less experienced came in and were smashing it purely because they had drive, passion, and a desire to improve.Lost my job during the 'rona pando, attended enough interviews for a chemistry job and didn't get any offers even though I felt the interviews went well.I thought I was a great chemist who was underappreciated. In reality, I was discovering in real time that I was a subpar, disgruntled chemist at best. Thought I was faking my way through the interviews, getting all of the technical questions right, but in hindsight, none of it mattered because even though I knew all of the answers, there's no point hiring somebody who doesn't want to be there which is the energy I gave off subconsciously.Offering this as an alternative perspective because sometimes the answer isn't necessarily trying harder.Paraphrasing although a famous MMA coach once said that there are a lot parallels between life and your style of fighting. Loads of people in the martial arts community start trying to emulate their favourite fighters without considering that style might be unsuitable for their physiology, essentially training on ""hard mode"" by doing something they aren't designed to do instead of putting energy into discovering their own style.

Hubspot may have some slower streams which could significantly slow down the rest of the sync if they are the first to run. A general suggestion for API sources (especially when slow) is to deselect any streams that you don't need.In regards to the destination performance (BigQuery), we are starting to roll out our ""Direct Load"" (https://docs.airbyte.com/platform/using-airbyte/core-concepts/direct-load-tables) which may speed up BigQuery load performance up to 2-3x. That said, if the source connector is the real bottleneck, the BigQuery performance boost may not help as much in your scenario. With API-type sources, much of the performance constraint is often in the API itself, but without diving deeper, I can't say specifically if that is true in your case.I hope this info is helpful - and sorry you are seeing poor performance here.

That way, once everything is planned out and you're ready to start, you can just tell the AI basically: ""follow this planning doc, and after you complete each step, update the doc and begin the next step"", and then you can just keep hitting the OK button until it's finished building everything.",WeedFinderGeneral,2025-07-21 23:09:40,1,dataengineering,t3_1m5miwq,False,

I'm phrasing this strongly not because I want to scare you away, but because I would like you to be aware of what you are walking into when you say yes. I chose to switch into the managerial track a while back and I must say I really enjoy it. If you have a tech background and can convince people of ideas you can really move the needle.That said, the ""cost"" is that you no longer get to play with any the cool toys yourself.

I wouldn't do that. You can get a VP-level paycheck as an architect or principal-level engineer if you are good.

n44cwdj,"Howdy! I’m an Aggie (grad school in stats, not DE) and a Sr. DE working in Dallas. I was actually part of the industry DE group that A&M was talked to when they designed a bunch of the DAEN classes. I was one of five who chipped in on DAEN 323. They wanted folks who had industry DE experience as well as advanced stat training, which is actually a pretty small pool.The DAEN major is… fine. The small group of junior/mid-level CS faculty who pushed it to completion haven’t worked in industry, and they *really* wanted it to be more data science-y, which is why there’s a weird amount of semi-niche statistical topics (I love bayesian methods, but they’re generally a grad-level topic for stats, and they’re not really useful at all for a DE to be familiar with), and mandating that the DE students take the two required ISEN classes is silly. There’s too much statistical/ML methodology (which is awesome if you want to go into ML enablement, I’ve done it and can tell you that it’s a ton of fun) for the average DE, and especially the entry-level DE, and the tradeoff is that there’s not as much cloud education in there as I and most of the others thought there should be. They get you into databases early, which is key, but I’d like there to be more database coursework. Fortunately, you can do those extra DAEN technical electives.That said, you’ve got a few classes in there that rock for developing your practical skills. The DAEN project classes are a high point that have some good projects that would shine on any junior DE’s resume that I’ve reviewed in the last three or four years. I would strongly recommend augmenting those classes with more database coursework than the one required CSE 310 class. Overall, I’d say the program is about as good for getting you into DE as just doing a CS degree, and I’d strongly note the dual caveats that:1. your first job almost certainly will not be in data engineering. This is not an entry-level field, your first job will probably be in data analytics, and you’ll progress into DE like most of us did.2. This is a new program, and they’re still working out the kinks.

Now I personally was leaning into a DE major because I thought it would help combine data science/statistics with more computer science topics like databases/cloud computing. However, as you mentioned with DE not providing a solid cloud computing foundation, do you think it would be sufficient to add CS cloud computing electives. I have majority of the core curriculum taken away with AP classes which leaves decent spots for me to fill up? Also, you mentioned data engineering not being an entry level role. My original thought was by committing to a data engineering major I would be better suited to building infrastructure/data pipelines, but if that’s not an entry level role where does that leave me in the job market? I thought by having a DE major I wouldn’t necessarily have to compete with CS majors for similar jobs, giving me an edge.

You are placing your operational decisions in the context of business decisions.Fwiw, it’s not reasonable to expect an out of the box solution to outperform something bespoke.

It’s not really meaningful to bring open or closed source into it- some of the slowest, crustiest, dogshit code on earth is very expensive and has a proprietary license attached. And if your thinking is ‘in-house = free’ like open source, you are very much mistaken. Honestly, not even open source is actually free, you just don’t need to pay for a license. We can’t really comment on your particular situation without knowing more about it. What code did you implement your custom solution in, for example? What is it actually doing? Is one solution parallelised whilst the other not? Where are your bottlenecks? In 2025, I’m very suspicious of any process that takes 5 actual minutes for less than a million or so rows, frankly. It suggests a configuration issue. But as a more general thing, software is like a pet- it needs to be fed, watered, and periodically taken to the vet. Eventually, you will need to deal with it humanely. If your org can support a development team to maintain your in house solution, good for you! It may be worth considering how well that dev team scales, what else they do, and what their long term prospects look like. Consider the time and salaries of those developers versus an off the shelf approach, for example. You seem to be operating under the illusion that your in house solution is free, when in actual fact their on-cost will be about 2-3x their salary. Your organisation will need to pay that, forever- or at least ass long as that software exists. And if someone gets laid off, do you have the redundancy, resilience, and skill overlap to maintain it?And yes, training new staff becomes an issue when you have custom software- ask any game dev studio why game engines are essential even though custom code is faster, for example.

I don't have the exact logs, it was a few weeks ago, but the dlt time distribution was:~10s extract~3,5m normalisation~1.5m insertWhich was weird, since we're reading relational data, and as far as I know normalisation is mostly relevant for nested data.

Set the start_date to the day you ran the first scraping job (let's call it D), and set the end_date to something far in the future (like the year 9999) to indicate it's still ""active.""Now, when you run your second scraping job (on day D+1), compare it to the data already in the table:* If a listing is new (wasn't in the first file): insert it as a new row, with start_date = D+1 and end_date = 9999.* If a listing no longer appears: update the existing row in the table to set its end_date = D. This marks it as no longer active.* If a listing is still there but has changed (e.g., price or details): treat it like a delete and reinsert. That means: Update the existing row's end_date = D, AND Insert a new row with the updated values, start_date = D+1, and end_date = 9999.If you already have a historical mass of scraped data, you keep going day by day until your current date. You then schedule your job to run right after the scraper to update the table with your new data.If this sounds confusing, look up Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (SCD Type 2) It’s a standard data warehousing method for tracking changes over time.

Then you need to carefully think through your BI architecture because you are paying to move data off AWS to Azure, so you want to minimize that as much as possible.

You are hitting most of the key pieces for a clean modern data stack.**On the architecture:** Snowpipes + dynamic tables is a good combo for simplicity. Just watch out for costs with dynamic tables if you have high refresh frequencies. The integer surrogate keys vs hash keys decision is smart, easier to manage and debug.**dbt thoughts:** Even with Snowflakes native lineage, dbt still brings value for testing, documentation, and standardized transformations. The macro system alone can save you tons of time. Plus if you ever need to migrate platforms, having your logic in dbt makes it way more portable.**Orchestration concerns:** You are right to be worried. Tasks + dynamic tables work for simple stuff but get messy fast with complex dependencies. At DataToBiz we have seen clients start there and end up needing Airflow or similar within 6 months. Consider budgeting for a proper orchestrator from the start, saves headaches later.**Random tip:** Since you are on three separate accounts, make sure your CI/CD handles cross account permissions properly. That's usually where people get tripped up.The biggest lesson from similar migrations is don't underestimate the orchestration piece.

Probably the biggest issue is that it relies on a team having sufficient knowledge of the stack components to maintain the underlying components in production, but this goes back to the packaging and deployment piece. How much of the stack has to be “always on” and how much of it can be spun up and down as needed? The more ephemeral it is, the better it stands as an open alternative. It has to be sufficiently cheaper than something like Databricks while not missing too much core functionality.

Run 10, 20, 30%... of your typical number of parallel tasks but just to a BashOperator echo. Scale percentage.

n48r3gw,"So we have a data feed that’s not exactly real-time due to the complexity, but it is continuous. Our official SLA is 3 hrs but in reality we process the data in around an hour tops end-to-end. The input is approx 500 JSON files a minute, essentially a new version of each business object in each file, and the output is 280+ delta tables. We use only custom-built pyspark notebooks to accomplish this, no DLTs, with a combination of continuous batch job workflows and ADF-triggered readstream workflows that run for 24 hrs then time out using a query listener to recycle and restart during off-hours.The first crux of the data feed is to transform the incoming JSON into a collection of 280+ tabular and relational “bronze” tables. This first crux is the essential schema transformation from an object-oriented data view to an analytical and relational-database view of the data. No data contents are modified, only the schema representation.The second crux is the creation of a merge statement from the collection of “bronze” tabular tables to the final collection of “silver” tables. We have 6 workflows that run this second part with about 75 tasks for the big ones, 20 for the smaller ones, that all use a status table as a readstream to know when parsed, tabular data is ready to merge into the final silver tables. Each task is responsible for keeping one final silver table updated.

To me it sounds like maybe you should extract specific standardized information from each pdf to a database and then you can use it to filter information, for example, using an llm to detect and classify project locations, sizes, cost at the time, and other related information, include source document and page, and for all location questions this should be used as a kind of index, I guess an llm reading each document and creating a json, you would need a validation for the structure of the output so it is consistent for all.The same for other subjects like names of people, locations (you can use a NER model like Stanza), tables, photos, designs, and so on, with this in place, maybe it is easier to identify which parts of each document has the information needed to answer a question and can be pdf raw fed to, for example, a Gemini query to answer the question or to simply used the gathered information in the database to answer. I am not sure that using pdfs and a chatbot is the best aproach for this though, seems to me that there should be a primary source of all that information and it should be collected and written in a database, and maybe some of these questions are some dashboards that should be built, but I don't have enough information of your context.",divedave,2025-07-19 12:24:03,1,dataengineering,t3_1m3seuq,False,

n3ob076,"Phased rollout and early operator buy-in beat any shiny tech stack every time. When we modernized a steel plant, we started with a shadow pipeline that wrote to a separate lake while the legacy jobs kept running; operators got weekly side-by-side reports, so by the time we flipped the switch they already trusted the numbers. For live dashboards, push events from the line into an Event Hub, land them in Delta, then cache the viz layer (we use Power BI agg tables) so queries never hit production gear. Skip true sub-second unless quality or safety needs it; 5-min windows keep costs sane and still feel instant on the floor. We also set up a burn-down board of manual tasks and let each shift knock one off; that small win loop mattered more than any lunch-and-learn. I’ve run setups with Ignition SCADA for tag collection and Snowflake for fast JOINs, but DualEntry was the piece that finally let finance and ops share one source without nightly CSV fights.

That's way smarter than the ""big bang and pray"" approach we see too often.Love the burn-down board idea for manual tasks. We tried something similar where we let each department pick their first automation win, and yeah the momentum from those small victories was huge. Getting people invested in the process beats any technical solution.The Event Hub → Delta → cached viz layer setup makes total sense for manufacturing. We've been debating whether to go sub-second on some dashboards but you're right, 5-minute windows are usually plenty and way cheaper. Production systems already have enough to worry about without us hammering them with queries.Quick question - how did you handle the transition period when both systems were running? We're worried about data drift between legacy and new pipeline, especially with inventory reconciliation. Did you automate the comparison reports or was it more manual spot checking?Also curious about DualEntry, haven't heard of that one before.

n4dy17a,"What is it that people generally struggle with? It took me about a month (full time) to go from understanding practically nothing about programming, to being a passably competent junior developer, back around 10 years ago.I did spend a lot of my teen years building and tinkering with computers, and I was able to make static websites, but that was all I knew going into it. Perhaps having that basic understanding of how the hardware worked helped.I knew I had to learn C#, and that I would be doing web app development for work, so I just set myself the goal of building a social network site, not one that would be live anywhere or with scalability, just one that technically worked.I wrote out the list of features I wanted, profiles with personal info, picture uploads with compression, posts with comments and likes/dislikes, a friend list with the ability to add or remove people, and a search to find people on there.I looked up how entity framework worked, and followed about 30 mins of a tutorial for setting up a code-first database, but made models for my own project instead of copying the tutorial ones. I do remember having a little confusion on how to store and model references for comment chains, but google and a stack overflow post helped with that.Then I did something similar for authentication, integrating it with the models I had already made. After that there was some googling on how MVC worked, and how to pass models around. I’m pretty sure I went overkill on that, as I didn’t know just how much ‘just worked’ and how much I had to manually implement.After that it just sort of snowballed. I’d move from feature to feature, working on each, and googling very specific things when stuck to find stack overflow or random blog posts, which I could just read through and then implement myself. The second half of that month was a lot of fun seeing everything come together and work. I’m sure if I could find the codebase today, I’d shake my head at the quality, but at the time, I was very proud of it.Honestly, I never found any struggle at all when it came to learning the basics and putting something together. I didn’t hit a brick wall until I was getting into things like trying to implement algorithms directly from academic papers, and that’s mostly because I don’t always follow the terminology or notation correctly. There’s also usually a couple of times a year I come across some incredibly elusive bug that takes me a week to figure out. I find the hardest part of the job is looking at large projects written by other people with a differeng style, and having to unpick everything and figure out how it works. I know when I was a teenager, I always wanted to learn, but never did because I wanted to do everything perfectly first time and not waste even a second of time by picking the wrong thing, but as soon as I needed it for work and just had to figure it out look for a new job, it turned out to be so simple I wish I could have gone back and slapped my younger self for all the delaying.I’m curious, which part in the process is the challenge that makes it harder? This post is interesting, but it definitely feels like there’s a degree of overkill to the process!If someone can really verbalise what makes the whole thing a challenge to them, perhaps I can help? I know it sounds weird, but I’ve been doing it for so many hours now that it’s hard for me to imagine not being able to, but I would very much like to help if I can somehow!As for your conclusion about shifting mentality, that is one thing I do try to reiterate to people, nobody in tech support or software development really ‘knows’ it all, we just know that if you sit down and do some searching, as well as thinking through each problem step by step, you’ll get there in the end, there’s not much to it. Yes, some stuff gets passively memorised over time, but other than a handful of keywords and simple logic, you don’t need anything else to start working on a project. You’ll be slow, sometimes it takes a while to find the correct answer online, but overall, you can fundamentally do it.I do think some people believe we’re joking when we say that 50% of the job is figuring out what to google, but it is mostly true. Programming languages are not actual languages, you don’t need to converse in real time, and therefore you don’t need much stored information to do it. It’s far more like a trade skill, like plumbing or carpentry, anyone can do it, the difference between a new learner and an experienced developer is simply how quick and how well polished the result is. If I give you some wooden planks, a saw, a hammer, and some nails, you can build a table. It might be a shit table, it might collapse as soon as you put weight on it, but you can do it. After you do it once and find the flaws, you’ll do it again better the next time. The same is true here, if you have an IDE installed, and have a web browser and a list of keywords, you can build an app, it might crash, or be slow, but you can build it, then you go again and you’ll do it better and faster next time.",Kezyma,2025-07-21 18:34:49,3,learnprogramming,t3_1m5lmth,False,

n4150yu,"> So I understand that computers run on bits that are either 0s or 1s. And programming is the manipulation of these 1s and 0s via a programming language. It's a bit more nuanced, but lets say this is kind of true.In any case, at the lowest level that is worth talking about, it's possible to connect some wires to the CPU/microcontroller and directly influence the electricty. But usually people don't do that, because both the computer/environment and the programming part have multiple levels of abstraction.First: The computer has ""firmware"" built in, which is basically small existing software that is part of the hardware components. One of its features is also that, when you turn the computer on, it loads other software from some predefined place (ie. the 0/1, or rather 0-255, that are stored there), and continues with executing this - so that you don't need additional physical wires to control your computer. This other software, that is loaded, can be called operating system (OS). And the OS then also doesn't do ""everything"" with 0/1 directly, but can give some known commands to the firmware (that the firmware understands).This data that is the operating system, you could create the 0/1 manually. But again people don't really do this. There is ""assembly"", which is a very basic, hardware-dependent programming language. There are commands like eg. MOV and PHMINPOSUW, no convenient loops, classes or anything like that. A helper program called assembler translates such a program to the binary data that can be executed.And, for both manual-binary or assembled programs, there's also the question of the environment that it runs in. Should it be an operating system that works directly with the hardware/firmware? Or should it run ""within"" an existing operating system, where it doesn't get to access the hardware anymore, but can access things provided by the OS?As next level, languages like C/C++/COBOL/Rust/.... Here you get compilers that translate this programming language into assembly. These languages are less hardware-dependent, instead you get different compilers for different hardware platforms (producing assembly for their specific platform). Once again, it's important to decide if you want to make an OS, or a program to run on an existing OS like Windows or Linux. The code will be quite different. As you know C, you surely know things like printf - that's not something the hardware and assembly can do, it's part of an existing OS (and it's libraries). When writing C to make an OS, you have to make your own printf too, by using firmware things that allow you to contorl the screens output.ObjC etc. are not C, please don't confuse them.Next level are languages like Kotlin, as you expected. With Kotlin, Java, C# and so on, there is no compiler that directly produces assembly anymore. It's technically possible to create such a thing, but no one is doing it. Compiling to C code is possible too, but again unusual. Instead they have their own compiled program format, that is unrelated to what the hardware can understand. And in addition to the compiler, they need a second helper program (written in C etc.), that during each execution takes this custom binary format and each time ""translates"" it to real native things on the fly. It might sound weird, but there are advantages too (and disadvantages too).",dkopgerpgdolfg,2025-07-19 17:51:54,22,learnprogramming,t3_1m41o5i,False,

Sometimes you need to use an existing language like C/C++ to write the first compiler for a new language and then you can use that first compiler to compile a compiler written in the new language. This is known as bootstrapping.Keep in mind that some languages are ahead-of-time compiled directly to machine language.

When you have a problem, search for your answer on docs or stackoverflow/forums and find the answer yourself. You will learn so much more this way, and have a deeper understanding. Sometimes, if you don't know what to search, AI can be useful to help you put a name to your problem, and then you can search based on that. Knowledge is valuable. Don't offload your learning! \- To form a deep understanding, there's no substitute for hours working on projects. Just keep doing it. If you find somebody you can team up with, even better! Maybe there's an open source project you can contribute to, or something you can start. Collaborating with others is a great way to keep things fun, and gain valuable feedback on your code.\- Don't give up! Technology is a competitive field.

I don't say this just to be contrarian, but because this comparison leads to what I think is actually quite bad advice right here in this post. With spoken languages, yes, focusing on precision is a bad idea because they're usually vast, highly contextual, meaning is frequently ambiguous and it can be achieved through other means. For example, in a great many languages a question can be achieved either through the structure of a sentence. ""Am I going"" vs ""I am going"" but it can also be achieved through tone. ""I am going."" vs ""I am going?"". We talk in language learning about something called tolerance for ambiguity, learning to accept speaking and listening without fully understanding everything, because the scale of what you need learn is vast and you're trying to actively fire up a part of your brain that will start working on what currently sounds like gibberish and start building meaning out of it.

n3gsm6y,"Just a bit of a historic tangent note: Back in the late 1970's and early 1980's I only encountered the usage of ""unusual"" characters in passwords that were accessible by keyboard on one computer: The Apple ][e computer! Its OS and built in version of Basic allowed you to press CTRL characters as part of your password. --------------------------------So for example, you could type a password like: monkey123or you could type: m[CTRL-O]nkey12[CTRL-3]Both were completely different passwords. The cool thing about the Apple at that time, was that when you pressed the ctrl character as part of your password, it would do 2 things: first it would register that as an actual character of your password, and then it would next, do the function of the special control character. So if your password had the letter ""g"" and you replaced it with [CTRL-G], well first it would record CTRL-G as a keystroke as part of the password and insert that into the input. But then it would do the function of the CTRL character like ring the speaker bell, or whatever. It was quite a fun and unsual way of handling keyboard input that I don't think I ever seen since. I liked it! --------------------------------ALSO: On the IBM PC at that time, in theory there was nothing really stopping you from doing the same thing... So for example with an extended ASCII character set of 256 characters, including ctrl characters and graphics characters... You could use almost any of it for your password. But... the trouble was the way the keyboard talked to the OS MS-DOS and the BIOS, which was not the same as the way the Apple ][e would handle it. So if you pressed a CTRL character, for example, then the computer would just do the function of that ctrl character, such as ring the bell when you pressed CTRL-G, but not pass that on as an actual input character to the running program. And then as far as special graphics characters go, well the IBM keyboard had no way for you to directly type them, unlike the Commodore 64 for example, in which many of the graphics characters were displayed on the side of the keys, and could be typed with a special function key. --------------------------------Also interestingly: On the IBM PC running MS DOS back then, you could even use graphic characters in filenames which suprisingly as a kid experimenting, I found that out on my own! (None of my other computer geek friends had ever tried that, which surprised them when I showed them.) This would actually add some limited security via obscurity, helping make it a bit harder for people to poke around with your files on a floppy disk, because they could not just simply or directly open or run them by keyboard. --------------------------------ESSENTIALLY: In order to access a file back then with special graphics characters on the IBM, you'd have to write a batch file or Basic program to specifically address those unusual characters. Otherwise again there was no way to type those characters on the keyboard to do what you wanted with it. You could however still copy the files all you want using the command: copy a:*.* b: That would copy them from floppy drive a to b. So it wouldn't give you any copy protection, but still even on the next disk, you had the problem of getting to the files with a keyboard alone. --------------------------------Funny enough: All this to say is that I did use it to build in a somewhat half copy protection security and self-destruct feature! So ya: I was working on my ""big program"" at the time. It was a clone of Macpaint but on the IBM PC. I was using Basic and Assembly language. (It did some of the basic stuff of Macpaint, and visually it looked good! And you could move a pointer around with a mouse or arrow keys.) And so I didn't want my friends to ""steal"" the code (lol! As if they would!) when I gave them a copy to try on their computer. --------------------------------THUS: What I did was make all the files with special graphics characters only, except for the file which you could type to run the program. Next, one of the weird graphics character files was actually a pure text data file that just simply had a single integer. A run counter. So each time you ran the program it would just update the counter, from say, 0 to 1. And then the second time you ran it, it would update to 2, etc... When the program ran, it would check and see how many times you ran it. And if you exceeded the limit I put, it would then perform an ""Erase *.*"" on the floppy disk, and then next start a full reformat of the disk, LOL!

I'll give an example:My first project was building a game. This wasn't web (I used Python), but the same idea should apply. A bit of Googling led to me learning there was this nice Python library called Pygame. I poked around at tutorials just enough to figure out how to display stuff on the screen, and then I started designing my game - thinking about how I needed a hero, platforms, monsters, etc., how to represent those in classes, and how to draw things on the screen. A bit more Googling revealed that a game typically has a ""main"" loop with a delay at the end where the goal is to get user input, update various things (hitpoints, etc.), and draw the next frame. So I mostly figured out how to do that but had to turn to tutorials for a few things like animation and how to make jumps actually look like jumps.So you're still using tutorials, but you're using them **as needed** rather than following a long tutorial beginning to end. I do find when looking at a tutorial to help with a project, it's useful to first try out a few simple examples in a small program before incorporating into your project. So in the example I gave, maybe I'd make a small program to display images or even little filled-in circles on a screen and then try to make them move in some pattern.If you want to try full stack, Flask and sqlite are pretty beginner-friendly for the backend if you don't mind picking up Python.

Most companies have existing Java codebases and need people to maintain them.But honestly? Pick whichever one doesn’t make you want to cry while coding. I’ve seen people succeed with both.

n4gr972,">my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going onThis sounds like what people call a ""mental block"", and I think learning to defuse that involves a lot more learning *how to learn* than it does learning how to do computer science. Heads up, this is probably going to sound more like I'm trying to give you therapy than anything else.**Step 1:** Validate yourself. *It is totally normal to struggle learning this*. It's a hard fucking topic, half the resources online are dogshit, and significantly more than half the people you meet online trying to talk about it are probably going to call you dumb and/or lazy. You're not. You're allowed to struggle, and in time you'll come to learn that failure is positive; but I full appreciate that it doesn't look that way right now.I'm a senior dev and data scientist. I've dropped out of multiple degrees. There are some leaderboards on leetcode-esque sites where I'm in the top 100 in the entire world. Sometimes I make mistakes that a child would laugh at.The struggle is just part of the journey, and comprehension will come with practice and time.**Step 2:** When your mind is settled and ready to be curious/compassionate, think back to that feeling of ""my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going on"" - what's *actually* going on there?What's going on is your brain throwing up barriers; an anxiety response, not necessarily a cognitive one. ""It's better to stop trying than to risk failure"", or something along those lines. I bet you do know a bit about programming. I bet you could tell me what a variable is, how to make one, probably what a function is, and so on. Remind yourself of the things you *do* understand and try to connect them to what you're currently struggling with.We beat anxiety by breaking things down into tiny little pieces until they seem surmountable. We win by starting very very simple, and going very very slow, if we have to. Every time you don't understand something, every time that ""I don't get it"" response pops up, *stop struggling*. Tend to it. Take a breath. Talk it through with yourself - break it down into the smallest, silliest subproblem you can. Address just that one tiny subproblem. Didn't work? Break it down even further. Take a break the moment you feel like you're making negative progress, because that is a real threat in these kinds of situations.**Step 3:** The real outcome we're looking for here is a mindset change, because (as much as it sucks) coming up against frustrating or overwhelming problems is just a part of doing programming. It's tempting to think ""how do I avoid this?"" but it's more productive to instead think ""how do I process this and learn from it?"" - because it is gonna keep happening.When your brain wants to say ""I don't get it"", try to reframe: you don't understand *yet,* you're still in the process of learning.

Learn the wrong way to do things too, it'll help you figure out the right way to do things. Write shitty spaghetti code. You'll improve over time.Try something simple like building a number guessing game. Add features to it: make it so you can select a difficulty which sets how wide the range of numbers are. Implement a limited number of guesses. Etc etc.Take what you learned from that and do something more complicated. Try making a shopkeeper for a fake rpg game. Add items to buy. Make them have descriptions, and a cost. Give yourself an inventory. Give yourself a wallet. Make it so you can list items in the shop. Buy said items. Maybe use CLI-style commands to buy the items. Make it so you can buy multiple at once. Add ways to earn money. Make them more complicated. Eventually turn it into a playable CLI game.There's just so many ways to learn how to code that are better than staring at tutorials all day. Learn how to think like a coder first. When you have all these requirements/constraints, sit down and think about how you might write code to make it happen. Look up how to actually do that thing you need. For the guessing game, clearly you need a random number, lets say between 1 and 10. Look up how to generate a number between 1 and 10 and store it. Look up how to get user input. Look up how to compare values. Look up how to let a player guess again if they are wrong (aka how to loop). Etc.

n42263f,"Whoa there's a lot to be said here. But I'm in a somewhat similar situation at the moment and quite burned out, so I'll try to cover all the important stuff:1. Whatever you want to do (career change, learn new stuff, etc), ensure you have a way to sustain yourself. In this case, ""sustain yourself"" could mean leaving your current job and living off savings for a while... Enumerate your options and pick any option that works for you. There may be multiple correct answers and multiple wrong answers1. Using one extreme case as an example: let's suppose you choose to stay at your current job and try to learn new things in parallel (this is more or less your current situation). Realize that your bandwidth is limited and the more burned out you are, the faster you will subsequently burn out if you don't let up on the pressure. 1. Learning while on the job: if you are able to draw a connection between your current job and programming, you might be able to pitch it as a professional development exercise to gain employer support1. I recently read [an article about Amazon employees reading 1-4h every day][amazon-reading]. Maybe there's something to it and your daily reading could be programming1. Learning programming is less about reading and more about fiddling/tinkering. At least for me, the learning correlated more with practice than reading earlier on. Later in my practice, I was able to learn more from reading than I was previously able to, but tinkering (trying out new ideas that I've read about) has always been part of my learning loop.1. it sounds like consistently finding bandwidth is an issue. Consider that your learning journey could be slow and bursty. So read about a small topic today and practice it for 10min. Practice it again tomorrow for 10min. Maybe you'll have more bandwidth day after, so practice it for 25min. The following week, start the next topic. In this example, I mean ""topic"" to be something as simple/small/atomic as list slicing. Adopting this strategy will keep you within your available bandwidth (and thus avoid/mitigate burnout), but it is slower than (for example) a bootcamp or a structured course.1. Eventually (on like a long weekend or something), try building a side project. Once you start down this path, two things happen: (1) you'll start trying to apply all new concepts to your project and (2) your project becomes your guiding light for what to learn next. This second thing is a super powerful driving force in helping you learn new and useful things.1. Remember always to listen to your burnout meter. You can't learn if you're burned out. It's counterintuitive and difficult to implement, but if you're feeling the early stages of burnout, STOP. Write out your ideas on a whiteboard or a piece of paper... or record yourself on TikTok; find a way to externalizing your ideas so that you're not constantly ruminating over them when your brain is asking for a break (I used a notebook and a pen... I guess I'm old school like that).I'll stop for now (my brain needs a break), but feel free to ask followup questions and I'll be happy to answer to the best of my ability[amazon-reading]: https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/former-amazon-principal-engineer-says-he-spent-1-4-hours-reading-daily-and-it-s-part-of-the-company-s-secret-sauce/ar-AA1Iw4QO",inspectorG4dget,2025-07-19 20:49:53,3,learnprogramming,t3_1m3jiom,False,

So unless you believe one of the most valuable companies in the world (Microsoft) is outright lying in their privacy statement, then you can not worry about this possibility.Legal policies can't play games like assuming everyone knows Copilot training on private data is part of ""the integrity of the Services"" - they have to be explicit.If you think they are outright lying or twisting words, then I guess you should immediately stop using any Microsoft products, and consider any information you've ever entered to be public.Similarly, GitHub once mentioned that ""no human eyes"" will ever see the code from your private repositories. A lot of people immediately assumed this means that they are obviously training Copilot on your private data (not human eyes). But again, it's not worth the risk to a company as valuable as Microsoft to play these kinds of games. Your private repositories are reviewed by some kind of machine, because that's how GitHub indexes your repositories for you! That way you can search for keywords and symbols, and so on. How else would they do that?Ultimately: your code isn't worth the risk to Microsoft.

n3hj8sa,"Depends a bit on language and framework, but basically imagine a package you're importing offers you 4 functions.You only need 3 of them.Compile time is when your computer turns your code into machine code - it does this because it's much, much more efficient and fast to read for the computer, and you don't really need to read it anymore at that point.When your code compiles, it will ""build"" those 3 functions into your program, but will not copy the one you didn't use, saving you some space and efficiency in the compiled Software.Again, depending on the language it may do this automatically or it can be helped by modularity by the provider of the package.Imagine a company offers you packages for different of their products, let's say LED lamps integrated into furniture. You could then customize your home control depending on what products you actually have, like import IKEO.Table import IKEO.WindowBut not import the IKEO.Door package that you have no use for.

If you are running two GNU programs at the same time then each has to be loaded in to RAM. With the BusyBox single program only 1 copy is loaded into memory and both programs can use the same code, thus reducing memory usage. Again great for embedded environments, not so important with desktops.Since as you might have guessed people who use BusyBox don't have much disk space or memory, if you don't need some of those programs then you don't compile them into the single executable.

Past experience found that the eight position may later be populated when a corresponding syllable is found in a language when it begins using Ethiopic script for its orthography. Accordingly, U+1E7E7 may later be populated with a HHYWA or HHYOA syllable if its availability is later found to be required by another language. The remaining unassigned positions, U+1E7EC, U+1E7EF, and U+1E7FF have correspondence with syllables still in use from the prior orthography that might have otherwise occupied these syllabic and code positions (U+1380, U+1383, and U+138F accordingly).",OldWar6125,2025-07-21 12:00:31,1,learnprogramming,t3_1m5g9ls,False,

n3fetih,"> I noticed today that if you free(ptr), and forget to set it to NULL, then you have no way to know later, when trying to access or modify it, that it was actually freed! It will keep pointing to the same address in memory, but that address may now be of other, unrelated variables. This may not even cause the program to crash, right?Correct, dereferencing a pointer after the end of the lifetime of the object it points to is [undefined behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior) and technically, the program is allowed to do absolutely anything from that point on.This doesn't just apply to memory allocated with `malloc`. It also applies to local variables, whose lifetime ends when at the end of the corresponding function or block.> Is there any downside to always using this macro, rather than always writing 2 lines manually?Well, the C preprocessor is just a dumb text substitution engine. So in terms of the compiled code, using your macro is exactly the same as writing the statements directly. (The [`do { ... } while (0)` construct](https://c-faq.com/cpp/multistmt.html) is a trick to make the macro behave correctly as though it were a single statement.)The biggest issue I have with your macro is that the name is misleading. It's not really ""safe"" because it doesn't prevent the underlying problem. In particular, if you ever pass around copies of a pointer (which is common) then just setting one copy to `NULL` doesn't affect the other copies. So if you're uncertain whether an object has been freed, then checking whether the pointer is `NULL` is not reliable on its own, unless you also know that nowhere else in your program is calling `free` on a copy of the pointer.And likewise, calling `SAFE_FREE` on a local pointer variable is not *necessary* when the pointer variable is going out of scope. If the variable is disappearing, it doesn't matter whether you set it to `NULL`. (In fact, the compiler would probably optimize out the assignment statement.)If I were reading your code and I saw something like `SAFE_FREE`, I would have to look up the macro definition anyway to see what it was actually doing in terms of memory management. Writing `free(ptr); ptr = NULL;` directly is clearer, in my opinion.In general, C is a language that *demands* you constantly pay attention to memory management at all times. This is just a habit you need to develop. Other languages provide better tools to assist you with this. For instance, C++ has ""smart pointers"" that act as an abstraction layer above regular pointers. The smart pointer is responsible for knowing when it's safe to call `free` on the underlying pointer.",teraflop,2025-07-16 11:24:59,8,learnprogramming,t3_1m19foy,False,

n3fhzgo,"> [A freed pointer] will keep pointing to the same address in memory, but that address may now be of other, unrelated variables. This may not even cause the program to crash, right? You are correct. If you incorrectly try to resuse something that you alread ""freed"" then there is no rule that says that your program will crash. It is however undefined behaviour, so the technique you are quoting here is a fine one, and many programmers do that. It is a well-known technique that is commonly used, which is probably the reason the LLM is giving it to you as if it is something special.As mentioned elsewhere, the benefit of using a macro here is perhaps slim to none. When I've seen this done in code, it's normally just done without a macro, by using an explicit assignment of NULL to the pointer after the deallocation is done. free(my_ptr); my_ptr = NULL;The same thing is done when programming in C++, when using new and delete (many C++ programmers will assign the pointer a value of NULL or nullptr after delete'ing it).Clearly, setting the pointer to a value of NULL should not be needed, but the reason it's considered ""safer"" is because it ""almost guarantees"" the behaviour later if you do make a mistake and try to reuse that pointer. For example, if you ""accidentally"" call free again on that pointer again down the line (I don't know why you would), then free is guaranteed to do nothing in that case.The more important mistake that you want to catch is if your code accidentally deferences that pointer later on as if it were still pointing to valid data. If it's a NULL pointer (because you are using the ""safe"" technique""), then on all systems I've seen, dereferencing the NULL pointer will crash the program. Formally speaking, though, derefencing a NULL pointer is either undefined behaviour or ""implementation defined"". But for all practical purposes, you can rely on a derefence of NULL being a fatal event on most systems (at least on all Desktop systems). It's a bit funny that we consider crashing the program to be ""safer"" than not crashing, but it turns out it's much easier to debug a crash caused by a null pointer dereference (i.e. ""segmentation fault"" on Linux) than it would be to debug accidentally dereferencing a ""stale"" pointer that was pointing to some old data.",chaotic_thought,2025-07-16 11:47:22,1,learnprogramming,t3_1m19foy,False,
n3fj90h,"Consider the following code, which isn't an unusual pattern to follow. Notice where the SAFE\_FREEs occur: typedef struct Foo {     // members     InnerMember* innerMember; } Foo; Foo* createFoo() {     Foo* foo = malloc(sizeof(Foo));     foo->innerMember = malloc(sizeof(InnerMember));     // init inner member     // ...     return foo; } void destroyFoo(Foo* foo) {     // Free inner member     SAFE_FREE(foo->innerMember);     SAFE_FREE(foo); } int main() {     Foo* foo = createFoo(); // Do things to foo.     destroyFoo(foo);     return 0; }In the first SAFE\_FREE case, you're setting innerMember to NULL, which is unnecessary, as the pointer itself will be going away. In the second SAFE\_FREE, you're setting the passed pointer to NULL, and it goes away as well. The pointer that matters is the outer pointer, which is *not* set to NULL.I'd say that, unless you're legitimately writing lots of free/nulling pairs, the macro is not only going to not help, but it's going to give a false sense of security. You need to set pointers to NULL in a meaningful way, and that often means NULLing them some place besides where the *physical* free takes place, happening more where the *logical* free is occurring (e.g. destroyFoo being the logical destruction point).Only you can say whether it will help you or not. It may be a less verbose approach. But I wouldn't consider it a *safer* option if it stops you from actually thinking about who is owning memory and making sure that state is handled consistently, not just looking locally at the point where the actual memory freeing occurs.Edit: if you had a function like destroyFoo, you could make it take a Foo\*\* (pointer to the pointer) and then NULL the outer pointer out at the end.

Enums are generally used as like a switch… lets say you had something with three different states, Running, Idling, or Off. While you could store this as a dictionary or array, this is what Enums are built for. They are a very simple data structure. Arrays are best for lists. Most languages support adding new items to your array, removing items from your array and have support for doing something to every item in an array. While in this case, you have an array of strings, commonly the elements within the array are more complex. Consider storing a list of books… you will want an author, a book name, a genre, for each item in the list. Enums can’t do this, and while a dictionary could, there are some drawbacks to using a dictionary in this way. Dictionaries are great for things like your actual book object. They have constant time access, so it’s easy to store a value and look up a value in this way. You can also assign more complex values to dictionaries, not just strings, which makes them better for anything more complex than an enum. They however are not the easiest to iterate through, and adding values requires you to also have a key to store the value to.

n3snlg3,"*Note: I don't know about the specifics of GDScript, so this is a generic answer that should apply to all languages.*The only practical difference between the two versions is that enums uses simple numeric indexes, and dict uses strings (or any other kind of objects) as keys. Enums are technically faster, but that rarely matters.What is a huge difference though, is the errors you might get when compiling and the help your editor gives you in avoiding those errors.If you tried this with the enum version: print(fruitColor[Fruit.PEACH])you would get an error telling you that PEACH isn't defined, and you'd probably discover it early when trying to write PEACH, and autocomplete didn't help at all!But if you tried this similar thing with the dict version: print(fruitToColourDict[""peach""])you would get a print or NULL or Undefined, or nothing, depending on the exact language used. You probably wouldn't be told that ""peach"" did not exist in the dict, and you also wouldn't get any hints from the autocompletion while writing it, that it might be wrong. Enums aren't just ""lists of words"", they should be considered more like a custom variable-type, like a boolean that can be `true` or `false`, you can create your own types, like a return value that can be `true`, `false` or `fileNotFound`. They are extremely useful when writing code, because you always know that you only use values that the rest of the program will expect.Dicts on the other hand, are used more when you don't know all the possible values when writing the program - and you might want the program itself to add more keys to the list of known values.",peterlinddk,2025-07-18 11:06:04,1,learnprogramming,t3_1m2sgve,False,

You can't add to them or remove from them.For Dict vs array, if you want to find something in an array you need to loop through it and compare.This is slow, especially on a hot path (something that is called often, e.g. in a loop)You won't see much of a difference in simple code that doesn't do much, or with small arrays, but as you get into thousands of objects, using a dictionary to store a reference to something that is not an index will be far faster than an array search.As always, it depends on what you have and what you want to do.",rupertavery,2025-07-18 13:01:16,1,learnprogramming,t3_1m2sgve,False,

This is quite easy to hit, even if you don't have many concurrent users. Fortunately, this is easy to test as well — just make a test script to write recipes to the database, and then use your website — see if there any issues when pulling out a specific recipe, or searching through recipes.The next ""10k"" limit you'll reach is 10k regular users. This is not too difficult; any scalable, modern, hosting provider — like Vercel — should be able to handle this with no issues. You'll simply want to check that you can afford whatever they are going to charge you, so this simply involves being familiar with their pricing structure.Finally, we come to what you said — ""10k concurrent users"". This is a *really* rare situation — this is going to be getting close to a really popular website on the Internet. At this point, there's no guidebook on a guaranteed, step-by-step way to handle this. You'll need to have a lot of logging in place, so that you have visibility into load times, and exactly *where* are the slowdowns. Once you know that, you can start figuring out solutions to speed up those specific slowdowns. However, it's important that you know *where* the slowdowns are first, because it's a bit waste of time to optimize something, only to find out that that wasn't the true slowdown.To test this, you can use one of the many load-testing software tools out there, once you have appropriate logging in place.",abrahamguo,2025-07-20 20:49:40,1,learnprogramming,t3_1m4yhzw,False,

Let's look at his assertions**Learn this language and you're set for life**Python is popular and it will get you far, but much like learning a second (or third language), you gain a better appreciation of the first language and its quirks when you learn a second one. Most find the second language intolerable because it does things differently from the first, especially if the language is quite a bit different. If you went from C to C++, that's like learning more C. If you go from C# to Java, they will feel like similar languages. If you go from Python to Java, Java would likely seem way to verbose and too concerned with types.It's nice to know a few other languages, but for now, getting decent at Python is a good first step.**Learn Selenium**OK, that's out of left field. If you can't build a web page, learning Selenium seems advanced. It's often used to run automated steps on a browser, often for testing purposes. It's a little like learning to fix a car before you learn how to drive. I suppose it can be done, but it seems advanced.I wouldn't worry about Selenium for now.**Taking a Course**There is a free course here: https://programming-25.mooc.fi/This is a real college course and there are some quizzes and such.

But once you have the job, use everything at your disposal to own some serious projects at the company. Make it so those projects practically rely on you for development and would cost to bring anyone to replace you. This gives you leverage and the ability to negotiate your salary to what you need.Now in terms of either learning MERN or data science or AI/ML, do all three. MERN gives you the ability to create apps. Data science gives you the ability to analyse and use large quantities of data. ML/AI gives you the ability to create more autonomous applications. You can combine all three and having all three gives you more leverage and flexibility when you want to land jobs.I speak from experience, I did an AI and robotics degree at uni. I’ve done ML and worked with current LLMs. While doing my degree I learnt the MERN stack. However my current job is a senior full stack software engineer where I use primarily next.js with sql and other tech stacks. But it can shift from different languages like Python some times too for data analysis etc.I mainly learn the MERN stack from Brad Traversy on YouTube he has great free tutorials.I believe everyone in the tech world should have at least one front-end and back-end tech they’re comfortable with so they can build stuff quickly and MERN can be the one for you.

n47f0rw,"I have worked at Microsoft for around 20 years. I have one child because of the hell i went though, and honestly, the career tradeoffs I made to get here were massive. I got into computers in the 80s and 90s because I loved tech. It wasn’t for money. It was about building real things. My first job I made very little with a master degree, and houses were 700k in my market so what choice did i haveToday, it feels like that’s mostly gone. The environment is toxic. Long hours. Metrics over mission. Leadership focused on checkins and politics. AI is treated as a silver bullet, but it can’t support production systems, do system-level architecture, or even explain tradeoffs. Meanwhile, junior devs are skipping fundamentals.The deeper issue is consolidation. I’ve been saying since 2010 that tech consolidation is killing innovation. Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia — they’ve absorbed everything. These companies hire away the best talent, buy or kill their competitors, and dominate infrastructure, tooling, ads, and now AI.And it’s not just technical. These same firms dominate lobbying. They block regulation, slow down privacy reform, and sideline competition. The result is fewer paths for meaningful work, less room for diverse ideas, and an industry stuck in its own gravity.If you are early in your career, ask yourself — what are you building? What will still matter in 10 years? What kind of work do you want to look back on? I’m almost 50 and only now able to pivot toward something more meaningful. Not everyone gets that chance.Big Tech is locked in a late-stage consolidation loop. The real risk isn’t that AI will take our jobs — it’s that these companies already own everything that matters.I recently spoke to an intern that quit biotech to come to microsoft because of the money. Bio tech was too long of an education for a small payoff. I did the same thing i told him decades ago (ironically it was machine learning at the time for me). Examples of consolidationMicrosoft buried Netscape in the 1990s and early 2000s. They bundled Internet Explorer with Windows and effectively crushed Netscape. The DOJ sued Microsoft for antitrust violations.Google crushed the independent web between the 2000s and 2020s. They bought DoubleClick YouTube and Android. Promoted Chrome through their services. Changed SEO and AMP to shift power away from independent websites.Amazon destroyed retail margins between the 2010s and 2020s. They used AWS profits to subsidize logistics. Cloned successful sellers. Took over cloud pricing and APIs.Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014. These were classic defensive acquisitions bought to prevent competition.Apple locked down iOS during the 2010s and 2020s. The App Store became a monopoly channel. A thirty percent fee was enforced. Alternative payments were blocked. Global antitrust cases are still happening.Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018. They took over a neutral developer platform and deeply integrated it into VS Code Copilot and Azure. This ties directly to the subject here. Google Meta and Amazon now dominate digital ads. They control over seventy percent of US ad revenue. Independent publishers lost funding. This led to lawsuits and legislation.In the 2020s the AI land grab began. Microsoft gained exclusive rights to OpenAI. Google folded DeepMind into its core cloud and search. Meta released controlled open models. Open labs cannot compete on compute or data.Regulatory capture and lobbying is widespread. These firms lead global lobbying budgets. Amazon and Google each spend around 20 million dollars per year in the US. They consistently resist antitrust data privacy and right to repair efforts.These companies buy all the AI tech. Absorb the talent. Fold it into their own platforms. The same thing happened with general tech talent. They inflated salaries and pushed smaller companies to the margins. This is not just a tech problem. Comcast charging for Netflix access is the same idea. This is why we had to fight for net neutrality.At some point hyperscalers need regulation.

n3qfg8y,"Congrats on spotting the burnout before it completely consumed you. A lot of people let it boil over and ditch the entire industry because of itFor future reference, there's a middle-ground between sacrificing your mental health and burning out, and quitting cold turkey: Establishing very clear professional boundaries, and sticking to them no matter what.I value my WLB very much, it's literally the most important thing to me about the team I'm working on. If I somehow ended up on a team that had a bad WLB, I'd start looking for another job. I know I won't change that teams culture, it is what it is.Instead of quitting though, I'd make my boundaries very, very, very crystal clear, and I would stick to them. I'm available 9-5. Hard stop. That's not negotiable. If I'm asked to do something at 5:30, I just won't respond. Or if things aren't terrible and I still have a decent relationship with that person, at most I'll give them a courtesy: ""OK, I'll take a look first thing tomorrow morning"". I don't care if deadlines get missed, not my problem, that's a planning problem. I don't care what insane committments my boss made. I work 9-5.Boundaries are what let you escape work mode. I don't work after 5pm, and I've taught my brain that same boundary, so it doesn't think about working after 5pm. If you lack that boundary, you can't escape ""work mode"" *because you're always working*. Your brain knows you're always working. You taught it that, why would it let you turn that mode off?In the same vein, sounds like your boss was an ass, but I also don't let feedback get to me. I do my best, 8 hours a day. If my best isn't good enough, not my problem. They hired me, that was their mistake, not mine. If my boss hates my guts, thinks I'm underperforming, or using AI? Tough. I'm not thinking about that after 5pm, and I'll just smile and nod during my 9-5, without changing a thing.The reason boundaries like this are so important, and so powerful is it lets you keep your mental sanity, even when you're at an aggresive, fast paced, toxic company.If these boundaries aren't acceptable for your employer, guess what happens? They fire you, and you're *exactly* where you just put yourself voluntarily anyways. But the hidden truth people aren't talking about is it can takes months, sometimes *years* before a company decides to pull the trigger on firing you over this kind of stuff. So you just bought yourself a whole lot of time to search for another job on the side, all while staying sane.Keep these things in mind for your net gig. Props to standing up for yourself, but at the same time remember there's usually a happy middle-ground hiding between the 2 extreme options of quitting vs burning out.",SouredRamen,2025-07-18 00:44:45,91,cscareerquestions,t3_1m2nz4j,False,

n3w0n8r,"Here’s the conclusion I’ve come to: many FAANG grads are struggling to land jobs now because they were hired during a boom when top companies were scooping up talent, even those without real, developed skills, just to meet the demand of a rapidly digitalizing world.Remember, before COVID and the work-from-home shift, many legacy companies were still doing accounting on paper and hadn’t even integrated Excel into their workflows. Modernizing these dinosaur companies in such a short timeline was a massive undertaking, made possible by near-zero interest rates and tax breaks on developer salaries. It created a tech hiring bubble.Many grads hired into FAANG during this time barely had a chance to gain real experience before being laid off. And what does that signal to recruiters? Fair or not, it suggests you were in the bottom performance tier and got cut. It’s rough but not necessarily your fault. You were supposed to have time to grow, learn, and move up or out. That chance was taken away.Now you're competing with other laid-off peers and fresh grads some of whom companies may prefer because they're seen as more malleable and come without the layoff baggage. And if you have under four years of experience, you're often not seen as experienced enough for mid-level roles, but no longer ""new"" enough for new grad positions either.",TastyBunch,2025-07-18 21:22:19,157,cscareerquestions,t3_1m3e0t8,False,

The fact that it constantly has to make these ""AI doesn't do anything useful"" type of posts/comments betrays a real discomfort at the way software development is changing. It's essentially an attempt to convince itself that it won't change (e.g. copium).But technology is always changing. Even programming itself has changed significantly in the past 50 years. Computer programming literally used to be done on [punched cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era). And then programming languages came along, and over decades, it became more like English and abstracted away to the point where we now have Python.I think we are seeing something similar with AI in software development. It will become literal natural language being fed into a processor (LLM) to write a program. From punch cards to pseudo-language to natural language sounds like a reasonable evolution of creating computer programs.My advice is to ignore both the AI hype and the AI naysayers who call it a ""grift"". There is a real utility for AI models. It won't be a perfect solution but it doesn't have to be perfect to make an impact. It just has to do enough.If you are worried about your job being taken over by AI, you can avoid that by learning how to use AI tools effectively. So maybe try Cursor or Claude Code. Or Windsurf.

Because they were small they didn’t have specific recruiters, it was the head of development usually interviewing me. I did have a personal project I had been working on and was excited about it. It wasn’t a standard tutorial or project that everyone had done. I like to think it was that my excitement about my project shined through, because at several places I pulled out my laptop to show the project, and each time it usually ended up with me doing 15 minutes of pair programming with them.

If your country has a bias towards math degrees that's something to consider, but CS is prolly just a lot easier to convert into concrete/hard skills than math especially with respect to getting a job out of any of this. I actually really love math and theoretical CS, if you angle your CS course load correctly you could essentially study the overlap of both fields (Type theory and functional programming in CS has strong relationships with Logic and Category Theory in Mathematics). If you at all consider moving to another country, CS will prolly be a lot more immediately transferable.Unless you're interested in some specific fields of mathematics that don't lead into the CS route/lead into other career routes (analysis, probability theory, etc), go the CS route.Also as someone wanting to one day go into CS grad school, getting into CS grad school from math may not be impossible but it feels like it's definitely not as direct as having a CS bachelors ;-;Honestly, to me, CS and programming feels like applied algebra. Especially if you go in the functional programming direction and have a nice, strongly typed language with things like algebraic data types, designing a program getting statically analyzed by a compiler feels like algebraic mathematical thinking. Even if you're more of an imperative programmer or like low-level stuff, math actually is even farther away from that.

It took me 1k+ applications, 20+ different position interviews, to get 1 decent offer (that is still a pretty big downgrade to my last 2 jobs).I have anxiety and have a low stress tolerance, so I was fighting twice as hard because I couldn't make myself study more than 1-2 hours a day + I would get super nervous during interviews and it made it very hard to recall what I studied for.Maybe it was because I took it easy for most of my work life, maybe I just was supposed to be interview prepping during down time. For whatever reason, I could not adapt to what it took to pass interviews.The random trivia questions just get me. I don't have memorized small little stuff like making random SQL queries verbally or specific syntax or concepts for coding languages. I've gotten better at it studying and getting live interviews for months - even then I'm still missing questions sometimes. I HATED that feeling of completely blanking out on something that sounds easy, but the pressure and the fact I just Google this stuff when I need it at work made it so hard for me.Part of it was me stretching the truth in my resume, but early on they wanted me to be able to talk more deeply about CI/CD, and cloud/devops + QA experience. I just didn't know that stuff and lost a lot of early interviews bc of that. After I studied some major concepts and talking points - it was good enough for most interviews but some people would DIG in and expose me.I'd get a small coding live assignment that would be similar to a homework you'd get in first/second year college - but you have 10-15 minutes to do it. I immensely struggled with the pressure even if it was ""easy"".  I started timing myself doing LC easies and pretend to try to simulate that pressure.I'd get Leetcode, the worst I saw was Mediums in interviews. I wasn't that good at it, but at least that one is straight forward on how to improve even if it's many hours and hard.I got a take home once + did one personal project, and used AI to make it. I then went back and revised it after it was working to make it feel more like ""my code"", and then studied the code base with AI until I could defend the entire codebase. I did end up passing that specific interview.
