I find SQL is perfect for tables building and pivoting especially if it involves things that mostly revolve around filtering, grouping, sorting etc. whereas Python is great for automating steps, cleaning data and doing any sort of stats or ML.Beyond the things that Python can do that are wonky with Python (like visualizations), which probably isn't applicable to your job, Python has a ton of really great libraries and tools to clean data, parse fields, run stats and ML models etc. I think perhaps the risk in your role that I suspect others here might point out is that you're probably dealing with large volumes of data and you need to be careful when working with Python in that scenario. For example just automatically converting tables to pandas dataframes and processing that way could cause some big inefficiencies, especially if you could just perform the operation in SQL to start.A good place to start might be to look at your existing pipelines and process and figure out where the rubbing points are and seeing if that's a place Python could help with.",full_arc,2025-05-30 15:27:46,16,dataengineering,t3_1kz6t8f,False,

Nobody can really disagree with that without sounding bad themselves. So in specifics, I expect every ticket to give me an idea of how much time it's going to save someone, or how much revenue it'll bring in, or what revenue we'll lose if it's not done by a certain date, etc. If the ticket doesn't, I ask for this info via the ticketing system and it goes on hold until I have it.",sjcuthbertson,2025-05-31 20:43:37,10,dataengineering,t3_1l049w2,False,

mvr9bzt,"I need to headline acknowledge that this is complex and generalisations are always going to struggle on a topic like this. And I'm likely to get downvoted for a practical non-theory answer, I know.BUT...Data engineering and software engineering are two different disciplines, so you can only draw parallels so far. And within data engineering, there's a huge difference between (1) a pipeline that supports a piece of software used by millions, or on which lives (any number, small or large) might depend, and (2) a pipeline that just ensures Sally from accounts payable can see the latest invoices in her report, which she only looks at once a month anyway, and occasionally forgets to look without anything bad happening.The same difference exists within software engineering, between that million-user piece of software and a script running on a server in a medium sized business to do something useful but not business critical, and that hasn't had a code change in 4 years. Those two things won't (or at least shouldn't) have the same amount of testing effort even if the same software engineer did both. Ditto for the two data pipelines. Ultimately, testing of any sort takes time that could be spent on other things, so for a business, it needs to provide more value than it costs, or you shouldn't do it. I see people forgetting this sometimes. Nobody should do testing purely dogmatically, except perhaps for FOSS projects, and any kind of libraries, which are a very different story. Another angle is that user-facing software typically has lots of code branches, conditionally-executed code, and complex object interactions. Data software _might_ have that too (in which case it has the same potential for testing), but it might be very simple and linear.

The requirement to authenticate in the VS Code extension, along with its acceptable use policy, seems aimed at identifying medium- and large-sized organizations using the free tools and pushing them toward buying a cloud license.This isn’t just about drawing a line between core and cloud — it looks like an intentional effort to murder core without causing too much backlash.

The only restrictions are around building competitive managed services or circumventing the license keys. If you use dbt core at your org for your data pipelines today, you can use the dbt Fusion engine for that same work in the future.

Originally, we just used DbtTaskGroup() from [astronomer-cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos), but this approach introduces a lot of overhead for large pipelines with many small models. Essentially, it executes 1 dbt invocation per model. When you have dozens or hundreds of models, and you're waiting both for Airflow to schedule tasks and then for the tasks themselves to spin up k8s jobs, this can propagate delays through your pipeline.

mur1amk,"I predominantly started my career on fully driven SQL solutions, so my adversity does not arise from my lack of familiarity. I don’t entirely disagree with you, but I do disagree with you in many cases that exist. I believe this is why complex ETL tooling does transformations in an application layer versus how ELT focuses on the database layer. Having managed and dealt with fully driven sql ETL solutions, one can see the performance benefits and the performance pain points. Separating those concerns between db and app helps to determine what type of tool you need. I’m generally dealing with a significant volume of transformation and mapping logic, to consume a hundred different pictures of sources routing to the same final destinations. This part has never done well in sql server, and we won’t even get in to the concerns on flexibility, scalability, and bloat, to use sql server for this particular piece of the paradigm, if it is a concern you are even battling. If not, I’d argue in favor of something basic, and full sql can be totally fine in this regard.

muoh5j9,"A big question that others have brought up is: ""what is fast enough"". A couple of ways to look at that include: * Cost of running the process * Complexity/manageability trade-offs to make it faster * How quickly do the users need it? It's rare for them to need data within 10 seconds, but 5-30 minutes is common - so that they aren't waiting around for data they just updated to be reflected. * How quickly do the engineers need it to run in? Keep in mind that if a production process fails on the last step, and if you can't restart from the last step then an 8-hour process might now take 16 hours. What if it then fails *again*? And what if this is going on during a holiday, or the middle of the night when it's hard to get expertise to help? For these reasons I push back hard on any process than takes more than 60 minutes to run, and strongly prefer incremental jobs than can run in 5 minutes.",kenfar,2025-05-28 11:12:57,2,dataengineering,t3_1kxb3ip,False,

Having a good mentor can help steer your own career. Working in FAANG it shouldn't be difficult to find one and they don't always need to be within your own reporting lines.- Teach, don't do.

Exposures were nice in theory but nobody maintained them. Snapshots were a mess - ended up just building those in our warehouse directly.Orchestration: Airflow + dbt is still clunky.

If I started today, I'd use Dagster since it has first-class dbt integration.For non-technical folks: The lineage graphs in dbt Cloud are nice but rarely used by stakeholders in my experience. They still just message the data team.Challenges: The learning curve for non-SQL people is steep, especially with macros and Jinja. Performance became a bottleneck with 500+ models. dbt Cloud's git workflow is rigid compared to local dev.Would I adopt again? Yes, but with caveats.

The documentation generation and lineage tracking have improved our communication, though the semantic layer features are still maturing and often feel overhyped.The real challenges I've encountered emerge around orchestration and performance at scale. While dbt handles transformation DAGs elegantly, integrating with Airflow required planning to avoid duplicate logic and scheduling conflicts. For managing data from multiple sources, I've found that solutions like Windsor.ai simplify the upstream, consolidating data from various APIs and platforms.Given your junior team's situation, I'd recommend starting with dbt Cloud despite the cost, the GUI, builtin scheduler, and easier onboarding reduce the learning curve compared to Core's CLI-heavy workflow.

For example, not many people using versioned models, unit testing, etc.What people do use; docs, lineage, data testing, and the bread and butter of dbt; snapshots, incremental models, etc.All this being said, dbt alone isn't gonna fix anything. The teams that realize the best outcomes change more than the tech. They add things like CI/CD, implementing tools like SQLFluff, dbt-checkpoint, etc. They rethink the whole process not just adding dbt. You also need to worry about improving how data is modeled, because that will have a big impact as well.Many people do use Airflow with dbt including people on dbt Cloud.

Sometimes this is due to their philosophical differences. e.g. not letting dbt manage the dependencies but trying to manually recreate them in Airflow. As for dbt Cloud pricing, it can be an issue as teams grow. Their teams level is limited to one project and up to 8 users, so that becomes an issue when teams pass those limits because prices jump quite high.Google ""dbt alternatives"" or ""dbt cloud vs dbt Core"", lots of resources out there.

Obviously you can do your own research and see what we have implemented and compare it to what's publicly available for dbt.SQLGlot, the library behind SQLMesh's SQL understanding has the same ""3 levels"" as Fusion / SDF. We just take slightly different approaches. SQLGlot can parse 20+ dialects. https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/parser.pyIt has type inference and logical planning.https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/optimizer/annotate_types.pyhttps://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/planner.pyIt even has a Python based physical execution engine.https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/blob/main/sqlglot/executor/python.pyAt the end of the day, there's been a big media brigade by dbt trying to hype up catching up to us. But it's the equivalent of boasting about making your GPS (compile time of SQL) when your engine is still slow (run time and execution of SQL). dbt core + fusion still doesn't have state. There's no scheduling / cron. So although they can now validate SQL queries, it still can't do something as simple as remembering what days of data your transformations has run for or when it should run. Compile time of SQL queries really should only take a couple of seconds, so they're solving a problem that shouldn't have been there in the first place.

Without their participation, it would be an exercise in futility, if not a tremendous waste of time, trying to find the metaphorical ""one piece"" treasure, without any knowledge of what and where it is.

Documentation is often in short supply, and recommiting the original sin of insufficient documentation is an act of self sabotage.

Dagster, its an incredibly powerful tool, it has some incredibly features like sensors and automaterialization, however, the amount of fuck around to do some things like complicated incremental loads is a headache, especially because the way it's been designed almost forcing you to do things a certain way.I dont like the amount of inline written sql in dagsters documentation, seems like a huge fuckin liability ah, this should be handled through schema drift detection, it should be more flexible in that sense like dlt is, so easy to set up incremental loads, use state to prevent additional loads of already processed records.It feels like a serious amount of vendor lock in, im sure the software devs love it, because they want the intense finetuned control, but it'll become a headache long term.I also find retrieving data real time from the database to control current loads via looking for gaps in data or controlling max or min dates ranges for countries for example is much easier in dlt which works better with prefect or airflow mo.Dagster is amazing, I still use it, im keen to get more experienced but fuck me the documentation feels messy, 100 ways to do everything, constantly running into ""that's the old way"" It seems like a bloated tool... and that's compared to airflow which has been around more than twice as long.I'd go with prefect or airflow unless the team are software devs, they'll prefer dagster but it'll become a huge liability when the team grows imo",Snoo54878,2025-05-31 14:36:09,5,dataengineering,t3_1kz7tje,False,

Right now I'm taking an entrepreneurial class that's helping me refine my pitch in my financial forecasting models and stuff like that. My idea much like your own is that analyst team still spend a lot of time doing data prep writing connectors. I've been doing it for so long that I can pretty much do it with my eyes closed so I would love to build a system you know that's managed version controlled it's got row level security, everything is a description attached to it easy to use for anybody including non-technical people. So far I've got one client, but they are a bit more involved it's helping me keep afloat in the meantime. They pay 5,000 usd monthly and do a lot of things manually have a lot of data sources that are pretty complicated Don't have API connector stuff like that. I've got lots of insights but no diamonds yet. At first I tried really small businesses like Mom and Pop shops around town, it was really hard to educate them and also they have no money. Some other key things I learned is that in person referrals are worth their weight in gold if someone else can sing your praises then the person that they're singing to doesn't really need to do any further validation that you will be able to solve their problems. This is hand in hand with finding complimentary businesses that might need to outsource their work. So if you can meet with as many people who do similar work they may eventually have work for you. The other thing is social media if you can manage to figure out what your customers paying points are specifically and then regularly make content around it that may produce leads for years to come. I suppose alternatively completely cold outreach has not worked for me yet. I tried messaging on LinkedIn I've tried to emailing people, mind you not in the hundreds but rather and let's say the tens. But still 0% response rate on any of that and most of the time you just get ignored. After a lot of talking and thinking I realized that I'm really trying to solve my own problem as an analyst for so many years. So I'm doing a micro pivot and trying to focus on helping maybe slightly technical marketing teams or analyst and scientist teams that struggle with disconnected data sources and they would like a modeled data warehouse as a service. Including all of the business metrics reports dashboards The whole works. My pricing is pretty similar to yours, depending on the number of data sources I was thinking somewhere in the ballpark of 4,000 to $10,000 for a setup, and then a retainer feed to manage everything going forwards anywhere from you know 500 to $5,000.

The general flow is:Find clients: Upwork Upwork has significantly declined in volume and quality of clients lately so unsure if this route is still ok for beginners. In ODesk times and the earlier days of Upwork it was way easier to find quality clients. I worked for a very large well known production studio after slogging through lower quality clients in the beginning. Once you find clients you can start to build relationships with the good ones, and you'll start to get referrals from them to others. Pricing: Don't do flat pricing with new clients. Charge per hour and then once a relationship is built you can discuss flat pricing. Overall most clients think of things in terms of ""If I pay X, I get Y"". As engineers/analysts we know it doesn't work that way (bugs come up, requirements change mid-project etc.) but when you have discussions around pricing try to build in this uncertainty when you make hourly estimates. Anything longer than a 30 min intro discussion gets billed. Pitfalls: \-""I don't have a budget"" does not mean they have no budget, it means they don't have enough technical background to know what something takes and haven't done any due diligence to try to ballpark it. \-Intense technical grilling at the onset of the discussion. I've found that clients that do this are the opposite of the above client. You will never appease them because they think they've figured it all out and if you deviate from their plan they'll get upset. \-""Ideas"" clients. Sometimes a client will come with some vague idea of what they want. They won't be able to answer even the most basic questions because they want you to fill in the gap.

While your current role might not feel like pure data engineering, it is still giving you valuable exposure to tools and processes that are widely used in the field.Writing ingestion scripts in PySpark and creating views for analysts may seem simple, but these tasks are part of a much bigger pipeline. You are interacting with Databricks and the lakehouse architecture, which many companies are still trying to implement. This means you're in a strong position to understand modern data workflows from the inside.If you're concerned about limited learning opportunities, try exploring what surrounds your current tasks. Ask about the scheduling systems they use for ingestion, whether it's something like Airflow or another orchestration tool. Learn how they handle data quality and transformation. These areas can give you new learning opportunities without needing to change your role immediately.For self learning, continue strengthening your Python and SQL skills. Then branch out by focusing on the tech you're already exposed to. Look deeper into Spark optimization, Delta Lake, and how Databricks operates in cloud environments. You can also study data pipeline orchestration using tools like Airflow or Prefect. Tools like dbt are also helpful for managing transformations.If you prefer structure, try building a small personal data project. For example, collect data with Python, store it in a cloud database, process it using PySpark or Pandas, and visualize it using a dashboard tool like Streamlit or Power BI. This hands-on work will connect the dots and show you how the tools work together.The internship you have now is just a stepping stone. You are not stuck.

We only did PoCs with ClickHouse and Starrocks - I'd say those are kind of ""second generation real-time OLAP"" where Druid and Pinot are first generation. The difference between the ""generations"" seems to be mostly operational, and also ClickHouse and Starrocks can also do data transformation, while Pinot and Druid seem to expect the data goes out mostly in the same form as it goes in.The data transformation is also the key challenge, as for the data to be transformed you have to translate the logic into materialized views, which have some limitations.

That gets you:1. Extraction patterns. This can be DIY Python scripts or an ETL tool like dlt or Airbyte2. Scheduling and orchestration. Maybe it's as simple as cron jobs, or maybe you'll stand up Dagster or Airflow3. Database management. You can probably comfortably do everything in DuckDB, but if you want to get fancy, you can use a single-node Spark cluster to write out to Iceberg or some other table format4. Data modeling. Your data may have quality issues or just isn't structured in a way that's easy to work with, and you can learn about patterns like dimensional modeling and Data Vault. You can also pick up a transform tool like dbt or SQLMesh5. Optional: you can do some (simple) ML with keras / Tensorflow or PyTorch. Think simple classification or prediction6. Visualization. Make a dashboard. There are a billion tools out there, both OSS and proprietary: Power BI, Tableau, Looker Studio, Lightdash, or Superset are just a few. Pick one and make a dashboard to help you understand the data you've extracted and transformed7. Optional: A lot of this stuff can be managed either via cloud resources or locally-run via containers. There's a lot of opportunity to learn about cloud infra, IAC, and CI / CD",onestupidquestion,2025-06-01 14:14:41,20,dataengineering,t3_1l0orse,False,

mvd1snb,"I'd keep a reasonable history. I keep all minor versions of the last 3 major versions. Probably more than actually needed but it has come in handy. A lot depends on what exactly the image is doing and how you are running it. I'd recommend only building the environment in the image and don't bake the code into the image directly. Use a volume (or bind) mount or a side car to expose your code to the container at runtime. Something like git-sync makes this easy but there are a lot of different ways to handle it. Now your version updates to the base image decreases substantiality, reducing build time and storage costs. It becomes much more practical to store many versions of the image. This has other benefits as well. Want to upgrade one pipeline to a new version? Just pin a new image version to the job. Testing becomes significantly easier by disconnecting the two pieces. Good advice when running in production is never rely on the 'latest' tag, always pin your dependencies. That goes for images as well as Python packages. tl;dr - Mount code to an image, don't build a new one every time.

mvmd3gx,"Not at all. The purpose of the container is to make sure the context with which your code runs is consistent. Your image should behave exactly the same way regardless of what server it runs on, that's the entire point of containers. This does differ from the approach you would take if you were building something like an API or a Django web app. In that case rebuild the image every time, for a lot of different reasons you wouldn't volume mount code in this case.For data pipelines there really isn't a good reason to do so. Build your python environment and install your required libraries as part of the image. Your pipeline code should not be responsible for managing its environment. You very much can put the code directly in the image and it is perfectly acceptable to do so. You'll just be building images extremely frequently and be storing a lot of them. If you are using cloud storage or Vms to build the costs add up at scale. At the very least though make sure you have an image per pipeline. You don't want to fall into the trap of needing to test every pipeline if you want to upgrade your image in any way. How you accomplish this can vary. Are you running on bare metal, k8s, some kind of runner? For example running in k8s using airflow as a scheduler kick off jobs from a yaml file. The yaml includes image tag, version, command to execute, some inputs or outputs depending on the pipeline. Git-sync container runs as an init container to grab the code and your image executes the desired pipeline. This makes the development cycle short and keeps testing easy.

I actually review this list of past flubs every time I interview and my own mistakes have made me better over time. In this case obviously it might have been better for you to be able to just take a step back and see you had simple problems in front of you. Or, if you felt uncertain, to say “I see a simple solution to this question or I could offer a more sophisticated approach, do you have a preference for how I tackle it?” But the point is no one answer is going to help you here because the next round of interviews the opposite situation could arise.

Postgres is great and all but there’s no reason to do extract/load that you don’t need to, and if you’re licensed for MSSQL then use it!Having an intermediate layer means another tool chain. What would you use? I tried dlt for that and it can’t properly handle MSSQL sources or designations; its reader library fails on large column types and the writer library writes everything as varchar rather than nvarchar! I ended up rolling my own (for MSSQL to MSSQL). But also for performance tuning and investigation tooling wise, MSSQL has it all. I’d keep it all in there. I haven’t used dbt but I’ve been trialing sqlmesh which is a kind of successor to it. It’s good at managing nested views on top of data and materialising it, and I’m contributing a patch to make it run better on MSSQL also for my own purposes.To expand on that, sqlmesh works perfectly for all of the MSSQL data types I’ve thrown at it so far. Because you aren’t moving data through it and just managing views, that’s all it needs to do, and so in that case it’s great.It reads in your source tables and data types. You create your views and it understands what output types should be there, even in views that reference views too, and creates the output heaps to dump into with all of the right data types (they say you should explicitly declare them but I don’t want to and it seems to work without it, so why would I? that’s the whole point…).So there’s no repetition of basic data type information or table management. Just write your views and go.My patch is around improving the way it does its merge for incremental updates to the views. But also the output tables it creates are just heaps, there are ways to add indexes after the fact though and even in an automatic kind of way, it’s just not as intuitive as it could be.

I like the SQL-centric approach - we do the same thing but for analytics workflows where you want to pull data, transform with SQL, then visualize. Had a client last month who was trying to build a lead scoring system by pulling CRM data, enriching it with third party APIs, then running SQL models - preswald handled the whole thing but Sequor might be better for the integration part.

muu3hyj,"Thank you for your reply! At my company we have different internship programs for undergrad and grad students, I work only with the undergrad program. We don’t have a specific rotation plan. Since we’re a consulting firm people tend to naturally rotate projects, and interns follow that once they convert into full time employees (usually happens after around 1 year of internship — in my country internship contracts can last up to 2 years, and at my company we aim to convert interns into FTEs, we don’t hire juniors, they come exclusively from the internship program).

mvkmrf9,"> It would be useful if you could list what you're trying to solve for in making changes.Mainly, we hired a new Data Analyst and one of the big noticed pain points is that are data structure is kinda of all over the place.We generally have the two primary data sources that are in real-time sync atm, but the thing keeping them in sync (Power Automate) constantly breaks and constantly causes headaches. So one job is moving that into a more robust ETL/ELT/sync solution.The second problem is ingesting data for analysis is difficult. Right now, the reports that are ran directly on the web database have to be refreshed manually after opening an SSH tunnel (the DA opens it through PuTTY right now). Instead, I want to have this data pulled into a more accessible place. The data from D365 and our other tools would also benefit from being in here, as we'd be able to leverage something like ELT to transform these datasets into something easily useable for PBI reports or synchronising with each other.So, the problems I'm looking to solve are to find a good place to centrally store our data for reporting / analysis, and to then find a good way (not Power Automate!!!) to move that data there.> How many data sources are you trying to sync? I'm still a bit lost on how you're using both Power Automate and Service Bus.Main 2 datasets are MySQL are D365. This is through power automate. When one makes a change, it gets put into a service bus to be processed.Additional sources are:External API from a similar org that uses Power Automate to pull into D365. This runs on a schedule. Every change made then syncs real-time with MySQL.Series of spreadsheets from another service we use for raising tenders (it's complicated). These are processed by Power Automate on a manual basis, pushed into D365 which then synchronises realtime with MySQL.MailChimp also synchronises here, pulling data from I believe oth MySQL and D365. We're apparently contacting our D365 vendor about a quote for having this data more closely married with D365.> If you need low-latency, I don't think a data warehouse with reverse ETL is going to be a good solution. My guess is that if you have decent data volume and velocity, it's going to get costly pretty fast. If your message bus isn't getting you quite what you want, you could always look at Event Hub or Confluent for managed Kafka. Either way, you're looking at some amount of custom code to read / write data to / from your queues / topics.Got it. I've heard about Kafka, the other two will probably be similar enough. Custom code is something to consider.Generally, I think the real-time requirement is one that causes more problems than solutions. Changing an accounts name on CRM might be nice to have immediately show up on the website, but I've found achieving that so far is difficult and time consuming.> I have literally never read anything positive about Fabric.Lmao, me neither. The only benefit I see is it makes setting something up a little bit easier.> I think your team is too small to take this approach, but it depends on your company's cost sensitivity.

You will certainly have some custom tooling and processes, but make sure that you're getting good value: the commodity solution is very expensive, or you can build and maintain a solution with minimal resources.This is something I've realised / been realising. Hiring an external vendor to build something is gonna be costly/ difficult to get to pass, but would be at least a decent idea. The vendor we use did suggest adding Data Factory to the unused Synapse instance we have, but with Synapse now being effectively discontinued I'd rather find a new solution than depend on it even more.> It still sounds like you want a data warehouse for reporting.

Main reason for a data warehouse / lake is that the main existing alternatives would be Microsoft Dataverse which isn't a great idea imo, or wrangling the Azure SQL DB that's sitting empty. A little more feasible, but wouldn't offer as good a feature set as something made for warehousing.> If your data is relatively small, I'd at least look at a recent feature from DuckDBI've heard a fair bit about DuckDB, it might be time to give it more of a look.",A_SeriousGamer,2025-06-02 11:47:54,1,dataengineering,t1_mvkjpfi,True,
mvkiogx,"Yeah, that's a generally correct understanding. The data is by-and-large all kept within a Dataverse / D365 instance, although some bits of data are kept external and instead pulled directly into a PBI report.It's a solution that's been built over the course of a fair few years.The end goal would be either finding a new central data store or improving how we use Dataverse as one, and making sure everything is accessible within it.Dataverse / D365 we use generally as a standard CRM. The website contains much of the same information, on top of some additional website specific data: the actual quote requests raised and reported spend being the main pieces.We had originally used a vendor to move from a Dynamics 2014 system to 365 back in around 2020 and the requirement was to make the synchronisation between the new CRM and the website realtime as they shared a lot of data. From what I know, that requirement is intended to stay for the time being.Hopefully, depending on however the solution we end up with shakes up that requirement might change. But generally if say an Account (eg one of our members) has some of their details changed on say the CRM then that change needs to be propagated to the website on-demand rather than on-schedule.I am aware that's a rather big ask.

In ADF you are completely dependent on Microsoft for connectors and new features. Some people call SSIS legacy. However, the reality is SSIS is still the best ETL platform on the market and people not only continue to use it, but the use is increasing.

mutzeq1,"Gotcha! Thank you for the clarity. This is actually a project I've completed recently - moving processes from legacy to Fabric PaaS. Yes! A lakehouse definitely can be the origin for a dataset and be the only 'source' for this data. The important aspects to consider before choosing to use the lakehouse as the origin location for the data will involve your governance and auditing practices, how robust your lakehouse setup is, how reliable your processes are to ensure proper testing / auditing. Etc. Its the same concern you'd have keeping a data set in any location. In reality, depending on your use case and how your data sources store the data once its extracted, once your lakehouse ingests the data from the external sources, the external source may not always maintain a copy of that data, leaving it only in the lake of the lakehouse. Same sort of idea as using the lake & lakehouse as the data origin for a 'new' dataset that isn't derived from a raw external data set. If you're performing transformations on the raw 'bronze' or even 'silver' data, you are creating new datasets likely being held ONLY in the lake or lakehouse, unless you then moved those datasets into a different warehouse or system.These new transformed datasets may be derived from the raw external data, but they are new datasets in tables in the lakehouse. I think you'll find lakehouses to be powerful and friendly for rule-based processing. If the lakehouse is ONLY being used as a glorified ETL platform, it's kind of a silly misuse of the power. (If you have a strong data governance program requiring you to maintain storage / system of record elsewhere, then obviously the lakehouse is not the long term storage place. But this has not been the case in my experience, outside of heavily regulated industries... which generally have so many redundancies in place the data ends up living in multiple places )For clarity in how this is possible: constraints being business setting the rules and editing the data set.im not sure exactly what platform you're working with or what type of lakehouse you have, but an example way to do this for microsoft fabric: 1. Create a rules table that lives in the Fabric Lakehouse (Delta format).2. Let business users edit those rules (via Power BI, powerapps, excel ).3. Build a processing logic (in Notebook or Dataflow) that applies the rules to a dataset. 4. Trigger the Fabric pipeline when rules change or on a schedule.5. Store the final result back in the Fabric Lakehouse. Because the users can change the rules themselves, be mindful to keep a table with every recorded change if you're concerned about data loss or potentially having a need to review the intermediary changes that occurred on the datasets.[Big ND energy over here - hope the details help]",nomdeplume2,2025-05-29 05:07:34,2,dataengineering,t3_1kxzcuu,False,

This is a very radically different way of writing code compared to the languages you have experience with.Similarly [Rocq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocq) (previously Coq) is an interactive theorem prover, where you wrote code that describes mathematical logic modeling something and can find formal mathematical proofs about it. It is possible to write programs and verify their correctness in Rocq as demonstrated by the [CompCert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompCert) C compiler.[Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html) is a functional programming language with algebraic effect types, which clearly define what kind of side effects (if any) a function is capable of causing.[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is an extremely powerful functional programming language with an absolute crapton of functionality that can be enabled for all sorts of advanced type level programming. As a bonus, since everyone loves to create custom operators, it's not uncommon for Haskell code to look like symbol soup with a handful of recognizable names mixed in here and there.[APL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) and other array languages treat everything as arrays and provide a bunch of super basic functions to manipulate them, leading to solving problems in a very different way than you might in other languages. As a bonus, APL specifically uses a bunch of custom symbols, leading to code that looks like this: life ← {⊃1 ⍵ ∨.∧ 3 4 = +/ +⌿ ¯1 0 1 ∘.⊖ ¯1 0 1 ⌽¨ ⊂⍵}This example implements [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in APL.You could also try Racket, as another commenter mentioned, or any other Lisp really, as they are different enough from what you're familiar with to require learning to think differently about solving problems.There are tons more languages in various different paradigms you could try, and they would all be valuable right now. All the languages you;be learned sit within a very tiny corner of the world of programming languages, and offer only the tiniest glimpse into the variety of languages, paradigms, and ways to think about solving various problems.While I respect that you aren't interested in learning something just because it's ""useful"", I think putting emphasis on the ""uselessness"" of a language is not the best way to think about this. Instead you should consider ""how different is this language from what I'm familiar with"", because the more different and alien a language feels, the harder it will be to learn, but it will also reshape how you think about solving problems.Edit: fixed APL link (at least on mobile)",Bobbias,2025-06-02 20:25:21,36,learnprogramming,t3_1l1qdkg,False,
mv10pn8,"As a full-time TypeScript / Node developer, I really, really like Go.Go is a batteries included language, you can start writing useful applications with nothing but Go itself, it has formatting and testing covered out of the box as well. Compared to PHP or Node, where you pull in tons of packages just to start writing any code, it's a really nice experience. Creating a new project is literally just creating a `.go` file and writing code.On top of that, the language surface is small and can be learned very fast, there is depth to it and gotchas you'll eventually, sooner or later, come across, but at that point you're already writing useful code.It also builds into a single binary which is easy to distribute, it has a far smaller memory footprint than Node and significantly faster start times. The builds are also very fast, making the development cycle very fast, almost like PHP or Node (in watch mode).Also, Go is often praised for its concurrency model.The syntax and paradigm of Go doesn't fit everyone, the language is definitely less expressive than TypeScript, and its type system is more rigid, at times it leads to lengthy code, but it tends to be easy to follow and understand, even if wordier than others.Go is just pretty good. Easy to write, readable, produces efficient apps, easy to deploy, if you don't mind its paradigm and wordiness, you'll generally enjoy using it.",xroalx,2025-05-30 07:15:27,283,learnprogramming,t3_1kyxbmi,False,
mv2hgye,"Go has several things going for it:1. It's a small, simple language that can do a LOT. No endless boilerplate, no forced OOP paradigm. It's got just enough features to be powerful, but few that lead to bad design patterns. This also means that whole teams can learn it quickly. I have presided over a team learning Go and getting them ramped up, it was fun and straightforward.2. It has a static, strong typing system, which both eliminates a whole category of errors found with languages with dynamic type systems, and frees up computational resources that dynamic languages use to reason about data types. If you like data correctness and unambiguity, you'll like Go.3. While garbage collected, automatic garbage collection is great in 99% of cases and you're likely never going to run up against it in your day-to-day. Also, and sorry for burying the headline, but **Golang is almost as fast as any other compiled language like C** but monumentally safer and free of a vast majority of memory pointer errors (the biggest source of critical errors in compiled software).4. It produces all-in-one binaries that run. *And a cross-compiler is included.* Want to compile for Linux on ARM64? Windows on x86-64? NetBSD running on a PowerPC for some reason? Go's got you covered.5. Along with 4, the included tooling is fantastic - one download and unzip, a slight modification to your shell's rc script, and you're cruising. You have a compiler, a robust stdlib, a linter, etc.6. Edit: I forgot a big one! Go's concurrency model is easy to use and easy to reason about. I have found so many uses for it.There are a couple of pitfalls though:1. It can hard to be understand at first how files, directories and packages are related to each other. 2. When you tread the usual, safe paths Go is absolutely phenomenal. However, that comes at a cost, so when you have to venture into things like runtime checks or the `unsafe` package, you get into a deep rabbit hole quickly. For example, working with a large volume of JSON data gets really tricky if you need it fast.",InVultusSolis,2025-05-30 13:55:53,27,learnprogramming,t3_1kyxbmi,False,

mv1nr9a,"Go is new, simple and fast, and so anaemic on features, the built-in json parsing lib needs to have a special syntax just to make parsing json somewhat bearable.It's an incredibly nanny-ish language that refuses to compile ""for your own good"", as it demands production level code quality even in the exploratory phase of programming.It's a ""simple"" language with a shrodinger's null, which either does or doesn't equal itself based on the implementation details of the particular type of the variable you're storing the null in.It's got a very simple and effective error handling that's easy to learn, ugly and 100% relying on the programmer's vigilance.A forgotten error check = no error. I don't mean runtime error, this isn't like exceptions that propagate. I mean **no error**. The call seems successful, except you get nulls as a result. Nulls which you can't easily check for: see above.At this point I should note here that for a string value, null == """", for a number, null == 0, etc. Fun!So, what's this simple idiomatic and ugly way to check for error from the last call i hear you ask??You... you compare its second return value with a null........ go figure.Go is basically what you get when you take C, add garbage collection, and prohibit pointer arithmetics. That's the good side of go. The bad side, you're essentially in a stripped down C.They try to be ""clean"", yet keeping all the C weirdness. Like \* in arguments meaning the thing is a pointer, but \* everywhere else meaning the thing is no longer a pointer. But some things are pointers even without the \*, and you need to remember which ones those are, because that dictates how can you check those for null values.For some strange reason you can't do nested struct literals. Also, you need to call some built-in initialization things to properly initialize a hashmap. Good thing is, we now have generics. Bad thing is, they're weird, don't work on methods, and they overload the interface syntax for type definitions.I actually like their OO in theory, because having methods separate from the structs allows for multimethods. Except go doesn't have multimethods.Instead, they use ""interfaces"" who's main feature is that they convert null pointers into semi-null pointers, which don't equal to null when you compare them with null, but then fail on null pointer reference anyway.Despite this, it's not actually that bad, if you embrace all the discouraged practices, which the standard library devs use everywhere anyway.It's pretty neat for small and performant production level projects. Just don't use it for anything big. It doesn't have the abstractions necessary.And if you can't make big projects, this makes their insistence on having a fast compiler pretty strange. I guess they need it to be fast to churn through all the copy pasted code.It's worth learning I'd say, it has its use and does have some redeeming qualities.But the community of apologetics is so high, you'd think that this whole thing is just a front for a large copium smuggling cartel.",paperic,2025-05-30 10:52:38,27,learnprogramming,t3_1kyxbmi,False,

These are usually fairly straight forward to understand. Though, finding your preferences is a bit of a trial and error experience. Most people are fairly happy with Visual Studio Code for the editor. Try that and see what you like or don't like about it. If you're happy, move on to figuring out what additional plugins and tools make it work best for you. If not, figure out what you like and don't like about it and see if there's something that better fits your preferences or if there are plugins that fix what you don't like.For organization and tracking progress, it becomes even more personal.

Do this at least 6 months to a year, and then start prepping for ""real interviews"" learn your algorithms, do leetcode, etc. You'll never be ready but as long as you have ok understanding of data structures and most common algorithms on those structures you'll be good. Don't forget to also study software/systems design/architecture.Then, start applying to companies where you'd like to work or ones where the work has meaning to you, otherwise you'll suffer. Don't believe the promises startup will make and if you're either bored or tired of a low pay then jump ship to a bigger company, this time ""the bigger the better"" you want this second company to be crazy big, avoid big companies whose main focus isn't technology, i.e. prefer Uber instead of Lenovo, streaming at Disney rather than IT at Boeing. There you'll learn about big scale and other engineering practices, this is where you go from midlevel engineer to senior, but to enter these companies sell yourself as a senior. Again be proactive, don't limit yourself to be a developer, you should also do the deployments, monitoring, become a generalist that goes deep. At least 3 years in a company like this will do. Don't fall in to the politics governing these big companies, you're there to learn, let them play their little games.After that the world is your oyster, you should be looking for companies that are surfing a generational wave, for example nowadays looking at Anthropic or OpenAI would be good, every ~10 years or so there's a big trend you should follow, personally I've found my sweetspot is remote companies of around 100 people, maybe 50 engineers, not everything depends on you but you still have impact on the future direction, no politics and no drama.

What that really means is *you’re not standing out yet* — and maybe you’re not putting in enough work. If this is enough to discourage you, then maybe you don’t actually love or care about this enough to go all in.Think about actors — look at what age most of them got their big break versus how long they had been grinding. If you're ready to give up now, then yeah, quit — because the pressure this industry will put on you will be way worse than this.Your first dev job won’t be easy. It won’t be smooth sailing. You still have to learn how to communicate well, adapt quickly, and solve real-world problems. I used to volunteer, I used to code for free just to get experience and feedback from senior devs — some who worked at Amazon, Google, and Netflix.I’ve led teams while volunteering, participated in hackathons, and mentored people — taught them how to lead and grow. On my *days off* from working a warehouse job, I would go into coding Discord servers and help people debug their issues.I tried college — it didn’t work out because of life circumstances. Everything I know is self-taught. I couldn’t afford bootcamps, so I found free ones. I hunted down Udemy courses on sale or found ways to get them free.There are **plenty** of ways to make money coding. Go find one. I used to be homeless, and I was still learning, still listening to lectures and podcasts, still grinding.My first contract? Made me $300 and $7/month. My second? I built software for a company, but the staff all quit before it got deployed. I still got paid. Now? I’ve got a pending contract with a startup and I'm building a demo for someone else.I’ve been doing this for about five years now. I’ve worked with people in Canada, Africa — folks who don’t even have consistent electricity or stable internet, and they still made it work.So I’m saying this: If you *really* want it, then you have to *work* for it.

If one doesn't, then move it out of the class. \* Check that every method is valid to use right after the constructor finishes. Does it make sense to invoke unload if I don't invoke load?

You'd check for compile errors, then fix the compile errors, assuming it was identifying the correct line. Sometimes the error occurred much earlier than the line that caused the problem.Once you got the code to compile, you'd run the code, test it, see if it did what you wanted to do, and repeat until it worked.The worst errors were accidentally deleting your code and starting from scratch, but errors similar to this where you misspelled something were super common. It taught programmers to read and re-read their code because the edit-compile-test cycle was so slow.Nowadays, a good IDE points out errors as you edit.One possibility is to run the code through an LLM, have it identify all the variable names and list it in alphabetical order.

muv5xrk,"searching for a given key inside a hash map is roughly an O(1) operation (depends on the implementation of the hashing function, but lets say it's O(1)). however, searching for an element inside an array (in this case, a python list) is an O(n) operation (with n being the number of elements inside the array), which means you are going to scan the array linearly looking for your element. if you do this linear scan for every element on your array, the time completixy of your full algorithm will be O(n\^2). there isn't a problem with it per se, but if for every n array elements you're doing n\^2 operations, your algorithm becomes very inefficient for dealing with arrays that have a really big number of elements.in contrast, your algorithm that uses a hash map (in this case, a python dictionary) has a total time complexity of O(n \* 1) (which is just O(n)), which means it scales linearly with the number of elements inside the array.it's also important to point out that there is a memory trade off in this case, because you're using additional memory to store the key-value pairs of the dictionary (in order to do faster lookups for the complement you're searching for).",rodrigowb4ey,2025-05-29 11:31:41,1,learnprogramming,t3_1ky7n2p,False,

To be more specific, you have to completely iterate through the array in the time it takes the hashing to complete. That said, I've played around with a problem that fit this scenario, and the performance difference was negligible on an array with a max size of 20 elements in Rust.

mv6zuqn,"The devs who create APIs are backend devs, and they typically work in languages like Java, Python, C#, and even JavaScript. They often use special frameworks for these languages that have built-in features that make building APIs easier or more performative. Typically they also work with databases in some capacity, as a core function of most APIs is retrieving or saving data to a database.Typically the devs consuming APIs are frontend devs who need data to display on a GUI. However, APIs can also call other APIs, so consuming APIs is something done by devs front or backend. It's becoming more common to become a full stack developer where you both create APIs and then consume them on the frontend. Often times though even full stack devs will specialize in one over the other. You'll find when you do this kind of work, you don't need to be a master of a language or framework to create passable features. Obviously it depends, but if your API consists of a lot of CRUD (create, read, update, delete) work, most devs can produce these endpoints with not a ton of experience needed.A great tool to start messing around with APIs is postman. You can call API endpoints from this tool and see exactly what type of data they return. Then you can start imagining how you could use this data, or how to build your own API that produces data you need. A real life example I'm currently working with is that I'm creating an app that uses flood data. Weather.gov has a great API that allows me to get flash flood alerts. Instead of just calling this flash flood API from my frontend, I'm actually calling the weather API from my backend. I'm doing this because I need to alter the data to fit my needs before using it. So I'm using my API to grab data with weather.gov's API, manipulating that data into a usable form for myself, storing that data in my own database, and then calling my own API from my own frontend to get that data out of my database so I can display flood alerts to users in the way that I need.

mv77ve5,"One good way to think about APIs is a way to connect 30+ different services, instead of having a single service that tries to do it all. You need a way for service 1 to talk to service 3. This is done through APIs. Here is a long winded example:Imagine you have one central platform that users interface with (the UI/website).But then you also have three services {A1-3} that take in data at the start, from three different sources. Say the data coming into A1-3 is different user activity, say everytime a user logs into some systems {S1-3}. Those systems send data in different ways to A1-3. A1-3 may transform the data in some way and send it down the pipeline. Possibly convert it into some central schema, since the three sources {S1-3} provide different sources data formats.Maybe one of these data-consumers {A2} needs to query some other service {B1} that provides additional user data. Perhaps A1 and A3 already get this additional data directly from their sources, S1 and S3. B1 is a service your company created that just stores a bunch of specific data in a database. When the service A2 queries it (or any other service), it returns some useful information. Maybe the database holds user host information (like their computer name). So B1 is an API that takes in a User ID, and returns their hostname/Mac address/location, ect. It just queries the database by user ID, and returns the information. So you might say, why not just have A2 query the database directly? Well, what if later on you have another service that wants the same data. So you made the API B1, which is the only connection point to this particular database. Once A1-3 enrich and convert their data into a central schema, they send that data using some messaging service (e.g. Kafka) to one consumer, C1. C1's job is to just store this data in some database. All it does is read data from A1-3 and store it (in a DB), and then it provides an API to retrieve this data on-demand. All of these could be called 'microservices'. Instead of having a single service that does it all, we have 6 that just handle their own little section. The user interface (the front end), needs to be able to provide information to customers. If the customer needs to know when User#45 last logged in, it queries C1. This event has the original data A2 consumed + some enrichment from B1. Now is the best part. Remember how we made B1 its own independent service? When the UI wants to give the latest login info about a user it query C1.But what about when it needs to provide just hostname information (which is not directly tied to a particular login instance). These hostnames are unrelated to the login information from C1 (even though C1 has some hostname info, but only when related to logins).So now the UI can query B1 to provide a bunch of hostname information. In this long example, we only have two APIs, B1 and C1. But whilst populates B1? Imagine we also need to manage payment information, basic account info, ect. If it's closely related, it could be with one API and in one database. But often there will be disparate data from different sources. Better to make everything modular.

This goes for REST as well -- if you work with microservices, it's very common for the individual services to all communicate via REST APIs. Each service exposes its capabilities via REST verbs and endpoints, and in turn consumes other REST endpoints.

The reason you might want this is to improve security further, it means if an attacker chooses the password ""password123"" and they somehow get access to the encrypted passwords, they won't be able to know everyone else that used the same password (since they will have different encrypted passwords even though they had the same original password).Whenever you generate a password with a salt, you are supposed to store that salt and use it again when validating the password.

HTML + CSS, the default option for simple sites 4. JavaScript for interactivity 5. Python/PHP (or other languages) for server implementationsThe ""correct"" choice really depends on what you plan to make and what you plan to use it for.The long answer: HTML is technically not a full-fledged programming language, but more a tool to build the skeleton of the website. Basics you can mostly learn in a day/week. CSS is for everything style (fonts, colors, layouts, ...) and works as addition to HTML. For real-time interactivity, you need JavaScript. There are variations, but JS is the only language supported by basically all browser, which is why it is the go-to programming language for this.If you want your page to have the ability to save/access data, through a database or multi-user interactivity or such.. Then you generally need to have a programming language on the web server. PHP was most common for a long time, but nowadays you see a lot of people use Python instead. You can generally use any programming language you want on the server, it will effectively read data coming in from web pages, and produce web pages as output. It also deals with a file systems or databases.Unlike HTML and CSS, any programming language will take a lot of effort to master. So if you really want to build a web page that sits there and shows information, you'll be fine with HTML and CSS.Easy-Mode: HTML + CSS Medium-Mode: add JavaScript Hard-Mode: add PHP or Python (or other...) for server based interactions and databasesKind regards, Mr. Prototype and the Broken Pony Studios team (I am just an indie game developer who made his companies website :D)",TS_Prototypo,2025-05-29 08:50:21,1,learnprogramming,t3_1kxparp,False,

Make an interface (a set of functions) for managing history in your web app. Then implement it as modifying some array in memory.

Your frontend can then make requests to the `/api/recent` URL using the browser's Fetch API (or any number of wrapper libraries around it).Writing an HTTP server in nothing but Node is doable but you have to deal with a bunch of low-level details yourself (e.g. URL parsing and routing).

muvxdru,"""Documentation"" is a pretty general term and typically falls into a number of sub-categories with different use cases:* API documentation: what classes/methods/functions exist, what arguments they take and what they return. This is useful a reference for people who *already know* how to use the library in question and need a reminder. Also a nice way, once you know how to use the library generally, to fully explore all the things it can do. e.g. what methods exist on \`class Router\`* Guides: Explore a single topic in *depth* ""How to route incoming requests in Framework X"". Good for seeing how classes/methods/functions can be used to solve real world problems in a single focused domain. E.g. [https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html)* Tutorials: Explore a set of related topics in a library (perhaps in combination with other libraries that commonly go together) in *breadth* to accomplish some real world task.

Learning, and indeed authoring, code is considerably more than answering a question or completing a task. As you read API docs for one method, you stumble upon another that might better solve your problem. When researching ""how do I route with an optional parameter"" you also learn a bit about how the library processes routes in order; a month later a ""weird routing bug"" has an obvious and simple solution to you (""this route just needs to be higher precedence"").To write new code you need to read existing code, sometimes code right where you're working, sometimes code many hops away in a callstack. The more you read, the more you slowly build up valuable context about the code in totality, the better your future code comes.The acceptance criteria for AI tools in their current form is the same as an incredibly eager intern or early career professional: ""Well, *it works"".* A large application that is an accumulation of tasks completed to a ""well, it works"" level becomes increasingly difficult to understand and change.

Other things are a matter of comfort, and you can always re-learn and remember once you start working back in a language, framework etc.To specifically answer you:1. It is definitely okay to go with web dev and frontend path now. 2. Use LLM as a resource to learn. Write code to do simple things and make projects. And show that code to LLMs to ask for improvements and suggest conceptual lackings that are present in that code. 3. Titles are unimportant imo.

The goal is not to memorize how to do everything, but to just do a lot of simple things until it's conceptually super easy, then you can try something one step harder.For instance, if you told me to make a chat app right now, i could easily break it down into, ok, some kind of client with a UI, prompt for user input, then we have to send the input to the server, then, ok, the server has to be python or node or whatever, then we have to store all the chat sessions that come in, and propagate messages to the receiving end, then that client needs to process it and display it in the UI, and maybe cache some stuff or whatever. Then I could just go implement one little thing at a time and make sure it works as expected, and see if other little surprises crop up.But I can only do this because I spent so much time at one point just making trivial client and server, or just making a trivial web UI that does nothing, or just really basic data structure stuff, etc.You also need to have a reasonable environment where you can run your code very often comfortably, and be ready to print things or use a debugger to inspect what's going on.

The *core* of the project would stay intact, and it would be just as valid and useful regardless of what the UI looks like.Where it's really tough, is when you're under a lot of time / financial / social pressure to release a finished project fast, and although you would *rather* roll your own for certain parts of the project...

Breakpoints, step over and step into are nice, because you can see what is happening step by step.In web development, it can be server-side code mixed in client side, where it requires the ' instead of "" or sometimes miss spelling of html methods or even simple things like missing semicolon or the compiler removing shit with IntelliSense etc.I would even say unit testing could help fix bugs or find errors within logic of the code. This is awesome in figuring out edge cases or if QA reports an issue can you replicate it with a test environment. Then you can create code coverage for the future. I like this approach, because you can define a wide range of test for fun and see what fails and what passed and try to debug the logic or even step through specific cases.",Rawrgzar,2025-05-30 22:20:26,1,learnprogramming,t3_1kzfy86,False,
mv666zm,"When it comes to debugging, while simple methods like console.log, print statements, or dump and die are useful for inspecting values and responses, effective debugging requires a more structured approach.My general advice is to start by isolating the issue and confirming each part of the workflow independently. For example, in web development, if I'm passing a value from the backend to the frontend, I would first hardcode an expected value directly into the frontend to verify that the interface and frontend logic behave as expected. This helps determine whether the issue lies in the frontend or further back in the stack.Once the frontend behaves correctly with the hardcoded value, I would then pass the same value from the controller to confirm that the data flow through the backend to the frontend is working as intended. If this succeeds, I proceed to review the logic within the controller itself. Essentially, the idea is to work backwards from a known, working state toward the suspected issue.For game development, I take a similar approach. If, for example, I encounter a bug in a movement script, I would isolate that script by moving it to a new, minimal scene with a single object. Once it works correctly in isolation, I would then reintroduce the object to the original scene and observe whether the issue persists. This process of isolating and testing components individually allows you to narrow down the source of a bug systematically.In both cases, the principle remains the same: isolate, confirm working states, and incrementally trace the problem back to its origin.One last trick is the rubber duck, honestly works :flexed_biceps: explain what your trying to achieve to a rubber duck or colleague in the explanation, you will realize where you went wrong.Good luck, troubleshooting and debugging can be super fun when you get some wins :flexed_biceps::thumbs_up:",the10xfreelancer,2025-05-31 01:09:23,1,learnprogramming,t3_1kzfy86,False,
mv67ljj,"Idk if I can answer your question but I think I just want to give you advice. One advice I want to give you is you would want to befriend bugs. Be happy to see red marks more than blue marks. Because every red mark is a step forward to improving your skill.and here are 2 things you can do also to help you 1. Read the Error Message Error messages are your first clue. They often point to the line number and type of error (e.g., “TypeError: undefined is not a function” in JavaScript). It might sound cliche, but most people really get stuck on a problem just because they didn't read the error message properly. And you will want to read error messages when you first 'befriend bugs'.2. Break your Code Intentionally Test small pieces of code to isolate the issue. Comment out parts to narrow down the problem.Remember that debugging is a skill. And the more bugs you deal with, the better you become at it. Solve it yourself first, and if you get really stuck on a problem, don't hesitate to ask others online.

mv6khng,Did your professor learn how to code in COBAL? I very rarely print out my code. The only time I ever did was so I could highlight important parts and add notes. I wouldn't do that when debugging.Normally I attempt to figure out where my code is getting unexpected results. As others pointed out a breakpoint is a good way to find that out. You can then look at the values of your variables while stepping through your code.If you're IDE doesn't allow for breakpoints then you can try adding print statements in your code in order to gather more information. This also works if you are testing in an environment that doesn't allow you to use breakpoints.Lastly you can try commenting out parts of your code.

Most of my time goes towards behavioral prep and STAR scenarios, but a decent chunk of time goes towards very general technical prep. Language-specific terms/concepts, differences between versions if it's relevant (Java 6 vs Java 8 for example), re-reviewing data structures, SOLID, the 4 fundamental OOP concepts, design patterns, etc.Basically a review of all the fundamentals that are things we don't consciously think of during our day to day, but we're doing subconsciously. The exact kinda stuff pop-quiz style interviews tend to poke at.For example, if I asked you what the L stands for in SOLID, and explain it, could you do that right now? I know I couldn't. But when I'm looking for a job, you bet your ass I could rattle off any of those letters from memory and explain them. I *have* absolutely been asked about SOLID/OOP before. I remember one interviewer off-handedly asked me ""What's your favorite design pattern?"". I'm not a theory guy really, so I'm not really thinking about the textbook names and definitions of design patterns day to day.... but I had prepped on design patterns, so I was able to give a great answer that cultivated a good discussion. My answer wasn't ""Builder... because it's the only one I remember"". I got that job.There's a lot of stuff in between a pure leetcode interview and a 2 hour pop-quiz session, most interviews may settle at a natural blend of the 2 types of questions.

Instead I was looked at as a leader following a company mandate ( saving money ahead of downsizing - in 2015). Other guys asked me what they thought they should be doing instead. I had no idea and I wasn't ready to be a manager of others.Looking back, your manager needs to put aside through put to a degree whilst also acknowledging that maybe you don't want that person to work, maybe like I did all the time, they may regret not taking it a little slower and not enjoying the role more. And if they at all care about the person, they unilaterally should and it should be a concern discreetly shared to his peers, like you.As for letting him fail, I'm not surprised it being stated but still feel awful hearing other people say that and probably did about me. There's better ways and conversations then to just let someone drop and if I'm honest, you've probably got no idea if you're really testing him in the role. What I mean is, this may not be a strain for him or even considered work. This might be a passion and something they take a great deal of pride in and not even work but is paid to be. You have every right to raise a concern though and your manager needs to look at the person aspect. You all do but do it with them in mind as well as yourselves, maybe with their skills, they can learn to articulate them and go towards the team.

murbal1,"The answer is easy. AI 2027 is a load of crap that is literally coming off house rules table top guessing games. It was written by a lot of people who have vested interest in AI hype staying as high as possible. This paper just happens to come out when we are seeing chatgpt fail to release 5.0 and revising what it's supposed to accomplish down harder than the old 5g definitions. It is becoming more apparent that AI is being used as a marketing tactic to do layoffs and still raise stock prices. AI hype is almost single handedly floating the stock market. The AI 2027 paper was also spread ad nauseam by other people who have even More vested interest in the hype train staying rolling than the authors themselves. Not that I really care what Bill Gates says in a press release. It's not like he is transparently sharing insight or anything, it is also PR and marketing.I'm sure I'll catch plenty of downvotes over it, but you asked where we saw this going ourselves. Personally, I'm of the mind that AI is already showing fundamental issues that more compute won't solve, and there will be a breaking point that VC money stops fueling AI research companies. The public gets compute time on a supercomputer for a Google search summary now. That is not a reasonable business plan, they make no money doing that for you. Why do it? Stock. Google can't be the only giant left behind. Once investment money isn't forcing the business plan to work it'd probably enshitify. Think about how good and revolutionary Uber/DoorDash/AirBnB were when they first came out, and how those disruptor business evolved over time into nickel and dime hell holes. For all of those, we went from the old inconvenient model that had full time employees, to now the gig economy with no benefits and lower wages. We disrupted those markets so good. I'm well aware that I would be considered an AI pessimist, but it boggles my mind at how uncritically everyone is accepting a home brew board game research paper saying we hit singularity in 18 months.

mvox3a7,"Approximately 1/50 application to interviews is pretty good in the current market. My advice would be to try to figure out what went wrong in the three interviews you did get, and work on fixing that in addition to applying. Because if you can fix that, you just need 1-2 more shots and you're good! Assuming you posted your resume to solicit feedback, here's a huge text wall of resume advice you can take or leave: As another user suggested, you might want a different template. I linked one at the bottom. I'm not sure if your template is the issue, but it doesn't hurt to try something different and test results, you can always circle back to what you have now. I'd also include a projects section, put your 2-3 most impressive school projects with some jazzed up bullet points (you can get an llm to help you with jazzing them up) and work on a project yourself using industry tools in the space you want to work in. Using and mentioning industry tools in projects is a great way to get through ATS assuming it's checking for keywords (for example ""Docker"", ""React"" and ""Java""). Here's an example of what I mean by a personal project, say you want to work with python full stack? Make and deploy a django app or something. Link the frontend on your resume, maybe the github too. What kind of app? I don't know. It doesn't have to be crazy, but try to use docker, a common database, maybe make the frontend with react that's popular af. If you can't get actual work experience in a company, try to get a bit of experience doing a project. You don't have to use industry tools to make a toy project, but doing so gives you a little practice and exposure to them which is what's valuable, and can help you get through ATS. Maybe even better than a personal project would be if you could contribute to an open source project and put that on your resume under the projects section. TLDR get a projects section and have your 3-4 most impressive projects on there until you get enough work experience to de-prioritize them. I'd shorten the skills section up to make room for the projects, mine is only two lines, languages and frameworks. I had an interview where the person was like, ok i'm going to list stuff from your skills section, you tell me on a scale of 1 to 10 how good you are with it, then proceeded to ask me corresponding difficulty questions about that skill/language/framework. After that, I trimmed my skills section up to stuff i'm at least a 4/10 confident in and it hasn't had a negative impact on my response rate.I'd consider putting one or two of those summer jobs back, you could put them under ""additional experience"" section at the bottom or something, just one liners very brief, if you give a description I think that describing teamwork and communication would help the most. For a template that has additional work experience I think the ""additional expereince"" template in this google doc from Codepath would be a good start (make a copy don't request edit access). [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDGkSD5l--GjKu56jw6frHmjr075QHbr\_wfma\_gmv8s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gjdgxs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDGkSD5l--GjKu56jw6frHmjr075QHbr_wfma_gmv8s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gjdgxs)You might want to consider making tailored resumes for different roles like swe, data analyst, etc where you put the popular keywords in. For example in your data analyst resume put a data project you did in there that uses powerBI or something at the top of the projects list, maybe change the skills up to include numpy pandas excel and tableau. Anyways, good luck. I'm curious from a scientific perspective if your response rate will improve after tweaking your resume. If you do change it up, you'll have to let me know if it made a difference.",GoldenBearAlt,2025-06-03 01:07:29,24,cscareerquestions,t3_1l1wug6,False,

mvist13,"One very important thing to keep in mind is that the markets from 2010-2022 were not all the same. We can't just give a single description/anecdote to describe that entire period.2010 for example was the recovery period from the Great Recession. Hiring was picking up compared to 2008-2009, but it was still slow and cautious. Companies were not hiring with confidence.2021 for example was the golden era of SWE. Companies were massively over hiring, the demand for SWE drastically outpaced the supply of CS grads, and that single-handedly created an entirely new sub-market of bootcampers and self-teachers. People already in the industry were job hopping and getting insane 100% raises,.That said, in my experience, good market or bad market, thing's aren't all that different. I still do the same interview prep, there's still the same kinds of startups/companies hiring, the expectation of this industry is still that you have a CS degree, etc. The difference I notice between a normal market (2011-2018-ish) and a bad market (2023+) is that the response rate is much lower. You need more applications to get responses. When I was applying for jobs in 2016 I did 10 applications total. When I was applying for jobs in 2021, I did 11 applications total. When I was applying for jobs in 2024, I did 82 applications total. I didn't feel like there was any difference in the process itself between those markets, once I got a company to actually interview me, the process was the sameFor your second note, I think the insane over-hiring of 2021 is what ruined todays market. Not AI. We're still recovering from that overhiring. A lot of people that wouldn't have had a chance of being hired in a normal market broke into the industry in 2021, and the industry is trying to self-correct. It's a slow, and painful process.AI is a valuable tool for SWE's. Some companies are buying into the hype, and might try to reduce headcount as a result, but it's still just hype. There's always some sexy new hyped up thing in the industry that companies try to chase, and might make them increase/reduce headcount. AI is no different.

When I first started, I was told ""Go build an integration between our product and X CRM"" and that was about as much interaction as I got.Same thing where everything is always urgent, everything is always broken, everyone always needs something from you CONSTANTLY. I think that's unfortunately pretty common in SWE, but even more so at a startup.My advice would be first, to stop caring so much, and second, keep looking for new opportunities with a healthier company. I'm not saying give up, or slack off, but I am saying that you should understand and accept that you will always have work to do and tickets to complete, and if you put forth your best effort and don't get all of those tickets done, it's not a reflection of you or your productivity, it's a result of poor management and unrealistic expectations.When I first started, I felt like I had to grind late nights and weekends so that I could meet the needs of every customer, and I would often work 60+ hours a week just to push a project past the finish line. Time and time again, I would put in all of this extra work and a few weeks down the road, the customer would churn for a reason unrelated to my work and then suddenly all of those extra hours were for nothing.Nobody else cares about your mental health as much as you do, so you need to learn to set boundaries to protect your mental.I adopted the mantra ""Not my circus, not my monkeys"" lol. At the end of the day, if this company lives or dies, your life will ultimately be the same. Don't let it consume your life or your mental health, because one day you will find that it was all for nothing. My only other coworker in my department was just like me -- he stressed out about customers after hours and worked extra, and guess what? One day they decided he was too expensive and they canned him. All of those late nights and extra hours for nothing.Put forth your best effort during the work day and try to leave the stress in the office. If work is unfinished, it's unfinished, but it's not your problem because you already did as much as you reasonably should.I could go on and on, but my point is, *while you're looking for another job,* try to at least make this one more tolerable in the meantime by learning reasonable ways to protect your mental health.

Prospective employer says thanks, hangs up the phoneAnd if your title/tenure doesn’t at least kinda match what is in your previous employer’s ERP, you have introduced a new line of questioning for your prospective employer.In so far as job seeking is concerned, nothing title-wise really matters outside of very large tech companies with well understood levels.

Most people find 45-50 hours a week with short bursts above that sustainable, and I think that's a good place to target. You will be be pressured to work more; be ready to gracefully wiggle out of it.2. Whenever you ask someone for a piece of information (""what is X?"", ""how do I do Y?""), also find out how they know/obtained that information. Getting questions answered is good (and you should ask a lot of questions), but you should also be learning how to find answers yourself.3. Underpromise and overdeliver. You should describe every single task task you complete as both absolutely amazing and the product of tons of hard work.4. Optimize your commute. If you spend an hour sitting in the car each way, that's equivalent to working an extra 10 hours a week. Live close to work, work from home, or go in early and leave early to beat traffic. I usually listen to a podcast on the way in and call out of state family on the way home, much better than feeling your brain bleed out your ears as you sit in traffic.5. Be *very* careful when it comes to agreeing to take responsibility for something. Once you take responsibility for a project or feature you become the person on the hook for it, and if/when things go poorly you're going to be working 80 hour weeks while out of your mind. You need to be strategic, you need to advocate for yourself, and you need to resist peer pressure.6. If you're on a team of workaholics, just lie.

mvic3s6,"On going to college in general: If money is not an issue (which it sounds like it isn't because the state program is helping you), then going to college is generally a good idea, regardless of major (see [https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2011/collegepayoff.pdf](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2011/collegepayoff.pdf) for how much it's worth in $$$). The piece of paper you get at the end is one thing, but what's more important are the general skills that you can learn from pursuing a college degree: time management on a progressively longer scale, learning independently, collaborating with other people. Of course, these may be skills you have picked up from elsewhere, but if they are not (or if not to the level you would like), then this is an excellent opportunity to pick them up. Note that these are not necessarily things that happen automatically, though; graduation requirements get you the piece of paper, but how you spend your time engaging with your coursework determines what skills you'll actually get out of your degree. This is especially true if you're able to go full time and not worry about work during that time, because otherwise you will rarely have the time and energy to spend as you like on thinking and learning as you will during those 4 years.On majoring in CS: choosing CS because you ""like math and computers"" is a much better rationale than choosing it because of the job market, and part of why there are a lot of people complaining about the job market now is because a lot of people entered this field only because of the second reason back when the market was good. This of course does not guarantee you a job, but it does mean you're more likely to engage more deeply with the material in the degree, which means you will get more out of the degree one way or another. That said, do you know whether the program will allow you to switch majors? While you shouldn't switch out just because some class is harder than expected, if you discover that CS is really not for you, having the option to switch into something that better matches with your interests will make starting the program feel less constraining.On getting a job after: Let's be honest, no one actually knows what the job market will look like 4 years from now. Will it be challenging, especially with your nontraditional background? Probably. But would it be so bad that you would regret even \*trying\* in the first place?

The Odin Project is a great starter resource if you're into / want to try web development. If you choose the school route, go to a community college first to save some money, then transfer to a state school. See if you qualify for any grants. If not, check out scholarships. Regardless of your decision, I don't think you should base it solely off of the opinions of people from the internet. Not saying you are, but I just wanted to make note.

It's going to take a bit of time to read, to process the noise, to think of a solution and it takes time to write the code for question 1 and by the time you finished writing the code for q1, you are met with a bug. Then by the time you solved the bug, you now only have 10-20 minutes left to work on question 2. There is no time left to work on q2, especially when both qs are leetcode hard. Not sure if that's very reflective of the industry, at least in the internship I did, it wasn't like ""you must solve this in X minutes, otherwise we are all doomed"".The other thing I don't like about leetcode questions in general is that we can't use debugging tools. I use my IDE to debug my code, to understand where my logic is wrong, to better understand my thought process and to fix them accordingly. This is also what happens in the industry but I can't use them. And so I am left staring into the screen trying to understand what I am doing wrong, I am trying to guess where I fked up. Sometimes print statements are not helpful because you don't know where you are going wrong. It all takes time.It's like they are looking for robots/AI who can process everything in seconds and write up a solution in minutes. It's like they are not looking for humans.To solve these questions, you need to have tons and tons of of leetcode practice. It's why I tell everyone to start DSAs asap, and to start leetcoding asap.

So don’t be so surprised to see the same thing at interviewsThe only thing I would raise an eyebrow on this is, this might be too much for a new grad.

It was off by one on every function, because it does not understand anything and is just predicting the next token which breaks down when something goofy is asked for like in the assignment.

This career doesn't have much stability and finding a good fit can be really hard.Additionally, my experience has been that people who stay with the same employer for long periods of time (5+ years) tend to have less varied/useful amounts of experience and will not generally have as versatile (or up-to-date) a skillset as someone who has had 3 different jobs in the same amount of time.There's definitely a lower limit though, a career that's only multiple years of 6 month contracts/employers, for example, does not look great to anyone, as it appears to signal that the employee can't ever meet expectations well enough to stay on anywhere.",SanityAsymptote,2025-05-28 16:36:16,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1kxh0ew,False,

mumsvub,">Is this a realistic/solid approach for someone starting from zero to become interview-ready and landing an internship in just 11 weeks?As far as learning CS, I think it's a good plan. The timeline is aggressive though, and I don't think this would guarantee an internship. I feel like this would place you roughly equivalent to a post freshman year CS student, I would estimate your luck at around 30-40%. TBF I don't think there's really any 11-week zero-to-hero plan that would guarantee you an internship. > I know the importance of applying early in august/early September so I was also wondering if applying in January would even be worth applying since it might be too late.If you don't have an internship, it's always worth applying. I would spend a couple hours every week to see if anything new pops up and apply accordingly. Does your school have a CS club?

muumqrm,"The biggest challenge isn't learning Python or even basic DSA concepts, it's that most successful internship candidates have been coding for at least a year and have multiple substantial projects to show. You're essentially trying to compress what typically takes 12-18 months into 11 weeks, which means you'll need to be incredibly focused and probably sacrifice some depth for breadth initially.Your backup plan to keep applying through January is actually smart because many companies do have rolling deadlines, though the competition gets fiercer as spots fill up. The key is making sure your projects stand out - instead of building generic todo apps, try to create something that solves a real problem or demonstrates genuine technical curiosity. Focus on one language really well rather than jumping around, and make sure you can explain every line of code in your projects because interviewers will dig deep. When you do start interviewing, [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) can help you navigate those tricky technical questions and coding challenges that often trip up newer developers - I'm on the team that built it specifically to help people handle the pressure of real-time problem solving during interviews.",akornato,2025-05-29 08:45:26,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1kx5oo7,False,
