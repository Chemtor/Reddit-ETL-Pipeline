The China team was very effective despite the time difference, the India team was not (and frankly, the competency gap was embarrassingly stark).This resulted in a ""snap-back"" in jobs that there offshored back to locations in NA (the US specifically). Essentially, almost all offshored employees were laid off, and all contracts canceled.The business argument that was made was basically: ""It costs almost as much to employ Chinese DEs as in the US, with comparable competency levels, but a timezone gap issue. Meanwhile, we can employ 2-3 Indian employees/contractors for the cost of one competent US employee, but not only is there a timezone gap, there are seemingly a ton of communication issues, like sudden unannounced PTO/Holidays taken during product launches for example, and even when you can reach them, you're lucky if even 1 of these employees can write basic SQL code.""The result was a much more robust vetting of US based employees, including several rounds of technical interviews, and thorough background checks...Edit to add context: The hiring practices when offshoring to India were pathetically lackadaisical.Basically, the process was: Recruiter: ""Do you know SQL?"" Candidate: ""Yes"" Recruiter: ""Are you willing to work for peanuts? (~30-40% of US-based DE)"" Candidate: ""Yes"" Recruiter: ""You're hired!"" Candidate: ""Yes"" Recruiter: ""Great!

This is called bronze in a medallion architecture - A clear area where you have data that has been validated for quality and consistency across sources, with as little detail as possible lost. This serves as the source of data for more comolex/aggregated reports/analyses, feeds your ML models (if you have them), offers consistency across different domains for general business rules for derivation data (when it applies across the board and at a granular level) and is overall the ""single source of truth"" for all your data platform. This is called Silver in the medallion architecture- A number of schemas serving specific business applications/domains/data products, with heavy transformation (often aggregation) to fit the specific requirements of each, also optimized for performance for specific access patterns and tools.

In the medallion architecture, this is called gold.The 3 layers above are pretty much the standard and have been so even before the name medallion architecture came along. I remember calling them staging/ODS, DW and Data Marts over 25 years ago.Besides these 3,there can be a number of intermediate structures to help the data engineering processes integrating them. These intermediate layers are more specific to each case, and may not have nearly as much persistence. I have seen designs where I could count 7 layers, and I guess there may be more in some places. But most places will have at least the 3 I named.It's also not unusual to have a one or more lookup, control and Metadata layers, but these are more support for the platform than actual data layers (some people will disagree).I have also seen cases where some of the 3 basic layers was skipped, but that makes it harder to manage things after a certain size.

If anything, I argue that data profiling is more closely tied to data observability, which complements data contracts but serves a different purpose.I argue that data contracts need enforcement where data is either first generated, captured, or ingested. In the Glassdoor case study above, they use static code analysis to extract metadata from the code to determine what function calls in the application relate to a data asset. Then apply LLMs to this highlighted code to determine the codified business logic irrespective of the data. Enforcement of expectations on the code ensures prevention via CI/CD before the code is deployed and thus before data is written.My recent article [*Your Data Contracts Are in the Wrong Spot*](https://dataproducts.substack.com/p/your-data-contracts-are-in-the-wrong) goes into more detail on this.",on_the_mark_data,2025-10-29 23:39:14,1,dataengineering,t1_nm2rzjf,True,

Our mission is to unify batch processing, stream processing, and compute-intensive AI workloads all in one compute engine.# What’s New in Sail 0.4* **Native Apache Iceberg integration:** Iceberg tables now run directly inside Sail’s Rust-based query engine for a unified experience across open data formats.* **Added support for the Iceberg Catalog REST API**, including **Polaris** and **R2 Catalog**, enabling connectivity to standard Iceberg catalog backends.* **Reengineered Delta Lake integration:** Delta operations have been refactored into modular nodes for scanning, writing, and committing, enabling more advanced DML operations.* **Shared abstractions across Iceberg and Delta Lake:** A common foundation that paves the way for a unified, format-agnostic lakehouse architecture.# Join the Slack CommunityWe invite anyone whose interested to [join our community on Slack](https://www.launchpass.com/lakesail-community/free) and get involved on [GitHub](https://github.com/lakehq/sail)! Whether you’re exploring Sail for the first time, migrating workloads, or contributing code, here you can collaborate, ask questions, and help shape the future of data infra.Check out the full release post here → [https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-4/](https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-4/)Would love to hear your thoughts!",lake_sail,2025-10-29 19:49:32,7,dataengineering,t3_1ojemmf,True,
nm7choh,"Super cool project. Couple of questions - 1. Both your Iceberg and Delta docs state that 'it is not recommended to use Sail to overwrite or modify existing [tables] created by other engines.' Does this mean the migration process for existing tables is reading the existing table, writing a new one, and removing the original? What about in reverse - can I write a table with Sail and update it from Spark?2. What's your funding model? Hosted platform / services at some point?",wieschie,2025-10-30 15:07:23,2,dataengineering,t3_1ojemmf,False,

In the past, we did see subtle compatibility issues due to implementation differences across engines (e.g., https://github.com/lakehq/sail/issues/830). So we called this out in the docs as a safety measure. We’ll keep expanding our test suite so cross-engine interoperability will improve over time. Regarding the reverse, we aim to support it fully.

But I've never seen any who do that in real life.Back in the old days, car dealership software had that stuff down to an art. You could buy books on KPIs and every software system was pretty much designed around implementing them. Tracking mechanic efficiency on reports, which fed into percentages which fed into accounting systems. The internal cost of every shop rag and oil change. Parts aging reports that track how old stock is, and help calculate reorder amounts for future stock based on how often they get sold, plus all kinds of discounting strategies.

Anyone can click and drag columns around into the nice visuals that do all the hard work for you with most modern BI tools, it takes a bit more effort when you need to do some transformation or transpose data but it's okay, but genuinely good analysts go through the extra step of understanding the business needs, the data, and what metrics are truly important, to then supply those, but as I said before, encapsulation and role restraints often get in the way of actually supplying the best service.",Blaze344,2025-11-03 16:10:00,2,dataengineering,t1_nmvniwn,False,

With it in market 3 years now.I will say Fabric would be a WAY easier transition for folks because of the integrations with Power BI, Excel and power query and you can grow into more SQL based things.

nm1hxhj,"I'll comment from a Snowflake perspective on the numbered points you raised ...1. Snowflake have recently released OpenFlow but it has a limited number of connectors, so may not meet your needs. People generally use tools such as Fivetran to pull data from source systems and push it into Snowflake, or they have some process that writes source data to cloud storage where Snowflake can load it (using COPY INTO... commands)2. Straightforward to transform data using SQL (normally wrapped in a Stored Proc if you're building pipelines). A lot of people use dbt for transformations and Snowflake have recently released the ability to run dbt within Snowflake. If you really want to go down the low/no code route, have a look at [coalesce.io](http://coalesce.io)3. If your analysts can write SQL then they should be fine. You can also write/run SQL in VS Code if you want to (and probably in other tools too)4. Not sure how this differs from your point 1?5. Snowflake can probably do all this; depends on your precise requirements6. Depends on your definition of ""seamless"" but making Snowflake a datasource for PowerBI is pretty trivial7. Snowflake allows you to keep data within Snowflake or externally (Iceberg and external tables). It also separates storage and compute so you can scale the compute power you want to use for running a query independently of the data being queried, and this happens almost instantaneously. I can't imagine a scenario where Snowflake wouldn't be able to scale to your needsSnowflake documentation is pretty good, and readable, so is always a useful place to start if you want to get a better understanding of the platform in general or specific capabilities : [https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide-getting-started](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide-getting-started)",NW1969,2025-10-29 17:17:50,7,dataengineering,t3_1oj8uaq,False,

There's direct and native Power BI integration either through direct lake storage modes for semantic models, or through just importing into a normal import mode models. But also Power Query (Dataflows Gen2) are a great tool for the low code analysts that already know those tools. You can use dataflows pretty much anywhere on the platform.

If you ho with databricks, pick Delta Live Tables, Databricks asset bundles, streaming tables etc and almost certainly CI CD. DbT would be another thing to think off.

nmscbyr,"I work for government: city-level economic growth data.The first thing in the morning I do is to ssh into our Linux virtual machine, manually run a pipeline I should have automated ages ago but haven't done so lol. This specific pipeline lives in our Virtual Machine of our Azure subscription, in which we integrate our Python scripts/modules and our Postgres server. So I am basically just typing some commands in the terminal until the pipeline completes which is a very simple report that ends up in a Google Drive folder for end users of our organization to see.I then go to Microsoft Fabric (the tool chosen by our organization for all data things), go to the monitor tab, see that the scheduled pipelines and any other job is running accordingly, maybe check the Excel reports we are generating to see everything is in order even if we are confident that things are fine.Attend a virtual call only me and project manager, in which like 5% of the whole call is talking about data, issues, tasks we have to do, and the rest of the call we talk about our lives lol.That's always the same, independent of the project.Now, depending on what we are working on, the rest of the day would be doing exactly that.For example, right now we are trying to organize more our workflow, so we are trying to implement the medallion architecture. So this last week I have been creating lakehouses in Microsoft Fabric (an object that lets you store structured and unstructured data within this ecosystem) where our bronze data will reside, ideally, I am separating a lakehouse for each data source (so we got sources like ArcGIS objects such as tables and PDF attachments, Postgres tables, nighttime lights satellite rasters of the Earth Observation Group, the typical Excel/CSV/txt files in a shared Google Drive folder, etc). We want to work less with Fabric notebooks because it lends itself to poorly organized code and workflows, and replace those with suitable items like Dataflow and such.But for 4 months I worked in implementing a system to gather real-time info from one of our ArcGIS social programs surveys. This again resides in our virtual machine, not in Fabric. I did this by deploying a web server and activating webhooks in ArcGIS and a receiver in Python, so ArcGIS basically sends a post request to our server every time there's a new registry or a change in the survey, we then transform this json payload (do some calculations, merge it with other existing data —data which can be obtained via API calls—) and finally upload the structured new registry in our Postgres tables which follow a relational schema. We haven't yet implemented this infrastructure to the Fabric workflow, so that's a task I am also working on.The Fabric notebooks we have are basically for data cleaning and transformation in either Python or PySpark.There's little routine in my job, since once we have something under ""control"" we are always thinking what else we can do to implement cool tools or new data or make cool analysis. For example, by December we want to be able to implement in our workflow a ML model one economist in our team is running about city's quarterly GDP prediction by grid, but first we must automate the ingestion of the inputs of the model such as .shp, geojson, etc files and create the full pipeline so that we then run that model.Disclaimer: I didn't study anything remotely related to software or data engineering. I studied economics but my career path took me to a much more data engineering roles for reasons I don't even know lol, life just surprises you sometimes as I never had this remotely in my mind. So far I have enjoyed it a lot! I work from home, I am free to make my own decisions, people hear my suggestions and ideas, and we can implement things freely. No micro-managing whatsoever. Also, there are routine things, but most of the time we are thinking in new ideas, so we are free to be creative.If you have any questions I am glad to answer them!",RoundAd8334,2025-11-02 22:57:30,6,dataengineering,t3_1omf6qa,False,

General dev pods for engineers/devs/datascientists 100 GB NIC. Use case is a bunch of image processing some machine learning . 7 servers 6 compute with storage in and 1 GPU node might expand to more depending. Most work isn't LLMs but Machinelearning and Vision. Data is mix between Postgres/small appdbs and lots of blob storage. 2 GPU for LLM 2 GPU for other work. Probably need a few more GPU nodes depending on how much more people want to GPU accelerate. Whole stack is open source and currently dreading about Bitnami pulling up the ladder on container maintenance/closed sourcing stuff. Current stack about $300k recurring costs for software about 1k/node/year(OS License). My time and sanity however are not tied to a dollar amount. On prem for Security/cost once yo u start getting into PB scale or higher in data those cloud ingress/out fees along with storage capacity add up if you want it hot you can play with the Azure/AWS storage calculator to see. Cloud storage is great for arctic/freeze data for backups or old data costwise if you can spare it so hot -> cold cloud was always a good discussion.Took us a long time to organically set this up from scratch and bare metal and learn from scratch but I was happy for the opportunity.

You can use multi asset decorator to deal with this quite well.AssetSelection for jobs can get annoying if you have a mix of dbt source + ref tables in them. There should be an ability to override skipped materializations so that they don’t cascade down the dag override downstream materializations. If I have 3 ingestion branches that are referenced in a downstream table, if one of those branches doesn’t have new or updated data, then I don’t want to churn the tables. I wish I could in that case mark specific assets with a “Skipped but successful” status so that if there was new data in the one of the other branches the final table rematerialized to include the new data.

I had a dataset in the hundreds of millions of rows with fields of of text for medical notes where I had to identify specific key terms related to specific medical codes (eg ""Used X medical device to do Y procedure.""). The problem is that this wasn't just for one hospital, this dataset captured 80% of hospitals in the US, and all have their unique implementation of medical records.Where to start:1. You have to understand the business logic and what a ""meaningful"" match entails. This was especially true in medicine where I had to coordinate with doctors employed by the startup.2. Create regex for each form of business logic and validate that it accurately matches data for samples. You will quickly start seeing edge cases (note them, but don't optimize for them yet).3. Create a script to apply the business logic and regex matching, then run it on a sample of data if the data is large (in my case it was the difference between running in 30s vs 3hrs). 4. Apply the script to your dataset (or sample) where you only count how many times a separate piece of regex matched with a row. You can then quickly see your coverage (ie match count greater than 0) and where your logic could be wrong (ie match count greater than 1).5. Determine what level of coverage and accuracy is needed for your stakeholders (they will always say ""as much as possible"" to which you respond with time/effort tradeoffs). Since I was in medical, it had to be high, but a lower threshold could suffice.6. Take a new sample of the data (about 1k records) and manually label them with what they should match with. Then apply your script to the sample and determine your accuracy. I often represent this as a confusion matrix (my background was data sci before eng). Id often pull in some of my colleagues to help with the labeling if we all benefit from the data asset.You now have levers for coverage and accuracy, iterate on your regex logic script until you meet the requirements of your stakeholders.

This becomes a single source for multiple departments and business teams within an organization, this in itself solved a lot of things and improves productivity and business insights.Examples I have seen,- better(faster) customer onboarding and handling with the Customer master.- Improved vendor insights using supplier mastering.- I have not done product master implementation but I have seen a lot of top companies doing that as well.Cons:- MDM projects might fail if an organization fails to involve a business rep (MDM requires a lot of business involvement to deliver)- MDM projects unnecessarily extend and fail to deliver if an organization has short term vision- Vendor lock might be a problem as MDM is offered as a Software product- Sometimes it can be too complex- Before bringing mdm it is important to educate clients on what value MDM can provide and what are the limitations of MDM.

nmvsosi,"MIchael Stonebreaker wrote about this in his whitepaper ""One Size Fits All: An Idea Whose Time Has Come and Gone"" and identified this problem two decades ago, but we're still trying to cram everyting into single systems. (Ironically now we want to jam everything ino columnar store table file formats, that can partially trace to Vertica - Stonebreakers columnar OLAP db (fit for purpose)). The core issue is that our infrastructure layer never evolved to make fit-for-purpose systems practical at scale. We know different workloads need different data structures, different storage engines, different consistency models. But the operational reality of managing multiple specialized systems, keeping them in sync, and reasoning about data flow across them remains prohibitively complex for most teams. State management is a big reason for this.So we get stuck with pragmatic compromise. Teams choose Databricks or Snowflake or whatever and then bend their problems to fit the tool, because the alternative is managing a constellation of systems that might be technically superior, might better fit the different business needs, but is operationally untenable.There is a ton of conceptual inertia in industry too. We think in terms of linear data flow: source to warehouse to consumption (ETL or ELT). But that framework doesn't naturally accommodate materialization into multiple fit-for-purpose targets. The tooling, the abstractions, the operational patterns are all built around central systems of record (BI, Analytics, Dashboards), not around dynamic materialization.This is a key problem I'm working on. Until we have infrastructure that makes it trivial to materialize data into whatever shape and system the workload actually requires, without creating operational chaos, we'll keep defaulting to whatever single system we've already adopted, even when we know it's not right for half (or more) of what we're asking it to do.The inertia isn't just conceptual.

nmamuo2,"Assuming the data is a time series and query range is unpredictable a single shard with more replicas would be best. The query workload will be distributed over the replicas and all nodes have all the data to handle any query, so you can achieve maximum distribution/parallelism. But note that a single node performs better with double the resources compared to adding another node to the cluster with these resources.If you partition data over multiple shards distributed over nodes you'll have less parallelism but might perform better on specific queries or when running many queries at the same time. But a query that requires data from a single shard cannot be executed on a node that doesn't have that shard or a replica of it.Bottom line: adding nodes and replicas will improve query performance linearly due to query distribution. For sharding you'll need a more complicated strategy. But if you're ingesting terabytes of data and already know your workload it's almost certainly a good idea to develop a sharding strategy, even if you'd have all shards on the same node or when every node has replicas of any data not in its own shard.And finally for a few terabytes of data on a cluster of 2 nodes with 32 cores and 64GB seems sufficient. If it's all one data stream I'd rather upgrade my server RAM and cores if possible than adding nodes.

For historicals, don’t chase “active only” upstream land everything and model “active” as an attribute. In dbt, use snapshots (Type 2) with unique\_key = that surrogate and check\_cols='all'; you’ll get valid\_from/valid\_to/is\_current without depending on Oracle MVs. For incrementals from Oracle when you can’t do CDC, keep a high-watermark table in Postgres (last seen version or updated\_at), and also compute a row hash; diff by hash to catch silent changes.

But I need clarification: should `is_active` live in the dimension table itself, or should I create a separate `fact_active_jobs` table and build off that?**On CDC and row versions:**Right now I'm pulling from an Oracle view that filters the ERP's fact table down to active jobs only—but that fact table has no `rowversion`. Should I (A) remove the filters at the view level and hash the full fact table as-is, or (B) go down to the base tables, use their `rowversion`, and rebuild the fact tables from scratch in dbt?Also, on the `is_active` dimension question: should that column live in the dimension table itself, or do I need a separate structure?**On soft-deleting dimensions:** I thought dimensions were supposed to maintain unbroken history by their nature. Wouldn't adding `is_active` and deleting rows break the sequence? And isn't it the fact table's job to differentiate active vs inactive in reports?**On dbt and orchestration:**1.

nmii5rn,">use string functions to extract values then arightematic('arithmetic')Agreeing with the other reply - this would be the 'good' way to do it in a real-world business situation, in my opinion.In real-world situations you don't get the choice of what data is given to you, and you won't be getting informed when new data is added. So you want to choose approaches that work for the data as it is today AND will continue to work as the data changes in the future, without you ever examining the data again later.You should have a test somewhere that all the data conforms to a general pattern of ""number + text"", then extract the number part and convert it to a database numeric type (integer or decimal, as required). Separately extract the text part, to another next column. You will then need to hard code the SI prefixes to factors: K means x1000, m means x0.001, M means x1000000, and so on. But these are a universal system worldwide, and there are only so many possible values. You should capture these in a data table that you reference or join to, rather than in code.Then do arithmetic using the numeric part as you were thinking.Hard coding would break if the data changes later once this process is in production and you've moved into a different project. Just looking at the top 10 values is based on how the data is now: a different unit might be in the top 10 next month or next year. So again, it's a fragile approach.

Not suggesting a problem, just you haven't given any directions on doing it.\- Are there unit tests? What's the testing strategy?\- Looks like transforming comes before validating. The code makes sense, but to me this part feels off somehow, because upgrading data is often a reaction to validating it. At least that's how my head works. \- Saw your bullets for possible future work. Do you plan to support XML, object JSON (as opposed to JSONL), or even SQL tables? Document-oriented validation is pretty different from row-oriented validation, but there's a need for this kind of thing for both. CsvPath is definitely looking at XML, JSONL, JSON, and EDI.\- Who do you see as the user? What kinds of businesses and use cases are you targeting? How do you motivate adoption?\- What made you build this? What situation did you see?\- How does the performance look on gigabyte-scale files? I could see parallelizing this kind of like a spark job.

For two main reasons, they are not the funny part :) and i am not a software developer. So, the testing strategy Is very hand made. I Just create many CSV files, everyone with the errors and rules i want to test and the system must trasform or validate as i excpect. \- mmm i could answer in many ways to this point of validating before or after. In my head you can do as many number of validation/trasformation steps you want In the order you want. You can validate-> trasform or trasform -> validate, but also validate->trasform-> validate. Obviously for every step Is necessary a regisitry with the validation or trasformation istructions. Theorically the cases are infinite, and who knows that before you knows somthing Is right you need a trasformation before.\- in relation of xml and Json i am currently thinking about It. But for the moment i decided the focus myself on the easiest case structured data.\- i think can be helpful to: - consultants receive data from customer recurrently a template like that permit you tò do a data inspection and cleaning and send back a generated report that explain why the data are not valid. I worked as consulant and this tool could save me time in the past. - a machine learning (time series) model could not work well if there Is a hole of 3 months of data (situation really happened). What can we do? Block the ingestion and wait for human inspection before training.- in a enterprise appropriate solution, in every situation there Is a shared and strict agreement, on how data should be received or sent.

Similarly add other tables based on the available entities. Add tables to track Financials, End of Period, Beginning of Period stuff. Basic DB setup and modeling. After all of these cleaning and organizing, once data is ready, building dashboard should not be a problem. You may star with less number of table at first, but breaking down data into a normalized form will help you with traceability.

nmdgiyu,"Totally valid. You're probably seeing a few things here. The first is abstraction. Professional code bases use services and third-party libraries for a lot of their functionality, so you have to use your IDE to find those and figure out what they do. If it's a third party library, you might have to check their documentation to figure it out. They may also be using more advanced programming concepts and design patterns, and if you haven't seen those before they might give you some WTF moments. They're also most likely using dependency injection, which again might reference third-party libraries. But what you're doing in trying to read those codebases is a great idea. My advice is to get help from AI. Ask Copilot or Claude specific questions like ""Give me a detailed breakdown of what this class does"" or ""explain line 149 to me."" I've been coding professionally for ten years and I still ask questions like that. It's very helpful. In my opinion, it's actually the *most* helpful thing that AI does. If AI tells you something is a library, go look it up and see what it does. If AI tells you something like ""this class uses a singleton pattern to do x"" you can follow up with ""what the heck is a Singleton?""If the code inherits from something else, trace it back. It's not always super important to know exactly how the parent class works, but it's good to know what it does at a high level. Again, AI is very helpful for this sort of thing.Navigating codebases and figuring out what they do is a core skill for developers. You'll spend a lot of time doing that in your career. If you're talking about an Enterprise code base, it can take months to get fully comfortable with it.

I rarely have documentation, and almost never have any sort of design document. My trick is to try to find a ""start"". In the language/environment I'm in, this is often an API Map or API router. Then I start drawing or creating a map of the code flow. I'll usually start with listing classes/methods (it works in my environment) and essentially making a class map, but for methods. What parameters, can I quickly guess what it does by the name or the code? What does it return? And then I get any methods or objects that method creates or calls. I work down that list. Essentially figuring out where I am in the web of function and method calls. As far as reading the individual methods, I literally rewrite it into ""make a PB&J sandwich steps"" like this:If my pseudocode looks like this: int[] myMethod(int pAddToI,obj thing){ int[] retArr; for(i=0;i<thing.size;i++){ retArr[i]=i+pAddToI; } return retArr; }I might write:**Function: myMethod** ?Creates an array of integers based on size of object**Params:****Integer pAddToI**: number to add to i, **object thing**: object with a size.**Returns:** Integer array**Process**: 1) Creates a integer array for return2) Loops over i thing.size times, adding pAddToI to i, and putting it in the retArr at i. 3) Returns retArr---------If there's any steps or symbols or syntax I don't understand, I *stop*, look it up. Look at documentation, ask co-workers. My language is not indexed well by any AI (proprietary language, most of the documentation is hidden behind paywalls), and sometimes I do have to talk to *gasp* real people or RTFM. But step by step, I learn the new (or probably 40 year old) thing, and once it's written down, I now have my own reference for what that does.I usually keep all this in a Obsidian notebook, and I create links between the methods, so as methods are called between on another it's easy to click and follow the process. I also have a custom template that has some JS Code that uses custom ""Calls"" and ""CalledBy"" properties of the markdown files to build me a call flow diagram of each method. I can quickly see who it calls, and who it's called by, up to 5 levels of grandparents. My real notes are much more detailed, and will often contain a ""model"" of the objects given an example starting point (like values sent into the API). The benefit to doing this is by the time you're done you've got well written technical documentation for whoever is modifying the code (even you) and you can build a good understanding of potential errors in the code. Even reading single methods and writing them out, in ""make a pb&j sandwich steps"" will help in the long run.

nm34buk,"> So I decided to build something, and http server in c++This is an excellent exercise and perfect for your academic level.> I know nothing about network programming, sockets or even portsYou don't need to know shit about any of this.HTTP is a text protocol. That makes it REAL simple... And - as it happens, standard streams are text streams. It's a marriage like it was meant to be.This means you implement the HTTP protocol: namespace methods { class GET; class POST; class PUT; class PATCH; class DELETE; class HEAD; class OPTIONS; class CONNECT; class TRACE; using method = std::variant; }I'll let you fill those out in detail, but I'm going to still jump around to get to my point.Next you need a request and a response type: namespace messages { class request: method { /* an incoming request is implemented in terms of one of the HTTP methods */}; class response; }Now here's where we're REALLY going to build on some of the magic: class request { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, request &); }; class response { friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &, const response &); };Barring the rest of the class details, you need these functions. Now when it comes to the request, you'll start parsing the incoming text stream until you get the HTTP method, and then you know which method type above to instantiate. Then your method types implement their own stream extractors, and THEY extract their own bits. So understand that transport protocols tend to have enumerations - whether they're numbers or text tags, doesn't matter. We don't need a data field to store the method, we can translate that into a C++ User Defined Type. The enumeration of all the methods? That's implied by our type instance stored in the variant. That's you enumeration! We've enumerated the method types with actual types!I'm droning on about that because you wouldn't believe how much code I end up seeing where people read data out of a source and plug it right into a runtime data field. Wholly unnecessary and missing the point.But this means that all your IO is over text, and it's over streams, and your types work with ANY stream, including... `std::cin` and `std::cout`.See, you don't have to know shit about networking because you don't have to write any of it. C++ is a systems software language, you're expected to make systems of software, not these gigantic monoliths. The desktop and the GUI is not the operating system, an operating system is a system of software FOR YOU - THE ENGINEER. You make this one part that can extract and then insert HTTP, and then you can combine it with other software to do the networking and the encryption. > nc -l 8080 -c your_serverSo now when a request comes in on port 8080, an instance of your program will launch, and all TCP IO will be redirected through `std::cin` and `std::cout`. Your program doesn't know, doesn't care.You want that shit encrypted? > nc -l 8080 -c 'stunnel | your_server'It's a bit more than that, but it's the basic premise. It's why unencrypted HTTP is default port 80 and encrypted HTTPS is default port 443.As for servicing the request, you've got a variant, which means your handler is a visitor, and of course you can make a visitor that can dispatch to different handlers for each type. You can initially make a catchall visitor that always returns a 501 - not implemented. If you can hit your server with your browser and get a 501, that's not nothing, that's something - proof that your server actually worked and talked HTTP with your browser. Remember, a response is going to be in text!So now all you have to do is read the HTTP standard and figure out the nature of the protocol. Are fields fixed or floating? That is to say, are they order and formatting specific, or can fields be anywhere in the message payload? Which ones are optional and which are mandatory? You know - I'll give you another hint, that URL and RESTful resources LOOK like a file path for a very good reason... You can also deliver binary payloads, but I'll let you figure that one out, and it's also common to base64 encode content because it turns binary into text to get past some of the text fuckery that is assumed by the protocol and implementation, like how line feeds and carriage returns get mangled.Continued...",mredding,2025-10-29 21:53:21,11,learnprogramming,t3_1oj1nr8,False,

nlyrgzo,"Let's take the square root example.If your function is just calling sqrt(x) and returning, then no that'd be silly to unit test - but then again why would you have such a function in the first place?Let's say the function is actually computing the square root using Newton's Method. Then wouldn't you want to test that it works? You could easily have a bug in your code. What if it works most of the time but fails for small numbers? What if it crashes if you give it a negative number?Unit tests can be useful for this sort of thing - trying a wide range of inputs to a function to ensure it works correctly.As far as where to put them, the standard practice is to make them part of the same repository and to make an easy way to run all of your tests. The idea is that every time you change your code, you run all of your tests and make sure you didn't break anything.So that brings up the second value of unit tests - they catch future problems. Suppose you want to speed up your code by using SIMD instructions to speed up math. You could rewrite your square root function and then re-run the unit tests to make sure it still gives the correct answer.There's no rule for how many tests you need, but one goal that a lot of people strive for is to cover every line of code with at least one test. So if your function has an ""if"" statement in it at the top level, you'd need at a minimum two tests to cover it - one test that covers the true branch, and one test that covers the false branch.There are tools that will run your tests and tell you exactly which lines were and weren't covered by tests.Finally, as to what to test, unit tests are generally for testing individual functions. A good rule of thumb is to test all of the public interface of any class. So if there are some helper functions inside of a file that can't be called from anywhere else, you don't have to test those, but you should test whatever public functions or methods other parts of your code might be able to call.Testing systems is also a good idea, but then they're not called unit tests, they're called something else, like integration tests. They tend to have different tradeoffs, like they're usually slower so you can't have as many of them, and you might care more about the tests being robust than them being comprehensive.",dmazzoni,2025-10-29 06:24:32,73,learnprogramming,t3_1oiwnd1,False,

All of the following questions could be behavior you want to test so a) you know it’s working as designed, and b) you know it continues to work every time you run the tests.- depending on how strict the type system is for your language, what happens when the user enters “fish” or the string “42”, rather than the number 42?- What if the user provides a negative number - how do you want to handle that? Do you check the input before the calculation and exit gracefully? Or attempt it anyway?- Do you support the imaginary portion, or do you throw an exception? - What exception do you throw, and what is the message?- you may want to know if the input was abnormal or caused an error, do you have logging? You can unit test that a log message was emitted. - what happens when you provide 0? Or the largest input number?

nlz8mnu,"Lot's of good answers on the technical implementation but I think some things were left unanswered.1. How many people are working on the code2. What is the domainIf you are working on your own you can think more greedily about your own productivity. For example, only create tests when you start developing something and you know it's going to be annoying to test manually (like someone mentioned, a reimplementation of calculating a square root). Another good point to write some tests is before a big refactor.Once there are more people working on the project it makes sense to add tests to provide some stability to the project. Most contributors are not able to test a project comprehensively, often code lacks the proper data to test the program, and tests can provide that. In general, a small team of experienced developers can work with less tests, only adding tests were it truly makes development easier. Once you go into bigger organizations or open source you will need more tests, because there is going to be people whose main task is to review and merge code and their life is made so much easier with tests.Second, what is the project? I've seen application UI code has usually less tests because a lot of the output is visual. Sure there are some methods like monitoring visuals changes, or component libraries where you can click though individual components. Something as simple as just checking all components render can be a good enough test. But in general the passing test for UI is that it looks good and is usable, and that needs more often than not some manual testing anyway.Data processing oriented code, infrastructure code, and code that has difficult inputs or outputs on the other hand rely more on tests. Like how are you ""manually"" going to test that some data objects coming through your kafka stream are processed correctly so they can be sent to the database? The whole premise just asks for some kind of programmatical test.While 100% code coverage can be good, it is not the ultimate milestone.

Ofcourse this a rediculous example but in the real world even a lot of short and easy to write functions dont have a super obvious expected output and sometimes multiple outputs are equally possible but you this case needs one and another case needs another output.

It's probably not a good idea to make unit tests for each function, but what about per class? Should it be done per system instead?Per function is absolutly a viable option. if you know each function gives the expected output and your code is deterministic (which it should be) your code should pretty much never fail.

Maybe, but it depends on what you take from it. If you have a masters or undergrad in computer science, but can't program anything or speak on certain subjects, you likely won't get the job. Believe it or not, this is a common thing that happens. This is the reason why cheating and similar is discouraged. Not just because it is dishonest, but because you won't learn anything by researching documentation and spending hours trying different things out. That's where the learning happens.The masters program I am in is Georgia Tech's Online Masters of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS). From what I understand, this program is very welcoming to non-CS undergrads, but you need to be able to speak on your abilities to accept the intense CS workload. If you don't know a single thing about computer science or programming, you won't succeed.

nmunn5u,"First of all, you have your boiler plate stuff. Creating the solution and the main project, setting up configuration. I have separate projects for different parts.* Main program - UI / API (+web) * Business layer - called by the UI, contains operational logic* Data layer - called by the Business layer, houses Entity Framework code or anything that accesses the database.* Models - usually a sub-folder in the business layer, this is where the DTOs go* Services - also usually in the business layer, this is where classes that do stuff not directly related to the business logic (fetching/processing external data like HTTP or file calls, CSV, etc)* Database scripts - I'm a database-first guy, I like to write SQL, and use EFgen to (re)generate the context and models whenever the DB changes. I use DBUp to sync changes across environments. This is obviously optional. Then I think about the data it's going to be working with. I usually start with the database first, creating tables and indices, thinking about what kind of data I need to store. I might miss a couple of things that can go in later.I then think about how I want to access the data from the outside. I create a business layer class for each ""domain"". A domain is usually one table, but it may access other tables as needed. I don't do repositories as they are mostly just extra work, also EF is a repository, but you do you.The business layers job is to restrict how data can be accessed. What goes in when you create a new object? Usually the pattern is* Search - a way to list and possibly page through a set of objects, returning a summarized, smaller object that contains only the stuff that needs to be displayed. If paging is required, I have a generic class that returns the paged set and the total count. I also have a common extendable filter class.* Get - returns more detail about the object. May return child objects as needed.* Create / Update / Delete There may be more, specific ways to interact with the domain, those get added as needed. Sometimes you want to update only one field, like status, progress, without updating the entire object. Separating thouse out give a nice, clean, clear API and shows intent.If this is a web project, the controllers are mostly interfaces to the business layer. I can sometimes call multiple business layers in one place, but I never try to reuse code from one business layer as-is unless it makes complete sense. Don't be afraid to repeat some code. Or if you do, push it to a service that gets shared. The main goal is that each method should be doing something unique, and that if it changes, then everything affected should be minimally affected, i.e. the change shouldn't affect their core behavior.I separate (as much as possible) security from the business layer. So business logic should only care about what to do, not who is accessing it. Sure you will pass in some user information for filtering, and you will have logic that changes based on who is accessing the data, but you should have up-front checks before the business layer is called. This way you can test or use your business logic, either via unit tests or in a prototyping project without having to deal with setting up security contexts.",rupertavery64,2025-11-03 09:06:10,2,learnprogramming,t3_1on6g8o,False,

They don’t care about backlinks or meta tags; they care about context clarity.Think of it like this: instead of keyword density, LLMs look for meaning density. The cleaner the structure, like H1 → H2 → lists → short paragraph, the easier it is to turn into embeddings that make sense during retrieval.It’s a mix of HTML parsing + embedding similarity. The model doesn’t want to guess what the content means; it wants to know with high confidence before it recommends it.I’ve noticed smaller sites win here because they’re often simpler: fewer pop-ups, less CSS noise, and more direct semantic HTML.

Once a site has too many layers, widgets, modals, marketing blocks, or “creative” layout choices, the core meaning gets buried. The model can’t reliably extract one clean representation of what the business does, so it defaults to safer, simpler sources.And you’re right about agents. They can technically navigate and interpret more, but the cost and latency make them impractical for widespread retrieval. So most LLM-powered answers still depend on very plain, parseable structure.It’s interesting to see how that pushes the web back toward clarity.

I'll say that I learned both C++ and Java in college and nobody ever paid me to code in either of them, instead, all of my jobs were in languages that weren't taught in my colleges at all. While I can't see the future and advice is a dangerous thing, there's a good chance that you could learn C++ now and get a job in Java later or learn Java now and get a job in C++ later. Or learn both now and get a job using some other language later. Or learn both now and get a job using both later.Again, though, I learned those languages a quarter of a century ago and I don't know what things are like today. It was fun to learn both of them.Another thing I will say from my own experience... without actually doing a specific type of coding as a job it was hard for me to predict what I would or wouldn't like. Most coding I found enjoyable even if I assumed I wouldn't before-hand. So perhaps you would love being a backend engineer. For me, it was very hard to predict. I had to work on real projects with real people to actually know what I liked. I'm not sure if that will be the same experience for you or not or how common that is with others.I do get that there's jobs that will have requirements like ""Minimum years experience with "" and I can get why one would want to pick the ""right"" language as a result. I don't really agree with these requirements as a good C++ programmer should be able to be productive in Java in a week and rather proficient in a month and (mostly) vice-versa. I don't feel like you're ever really more than a couple months behind if you pick the ""wrong"" stuff to learn with.So, those are my thoughts. If you are enjoying C++, I really can't make an argument for you to not learn C++. Or just learn both at the same time. Personally, I feel like I got more out of learning Java than C++. This is because I already knew C and so learning low-level stuff wasn't as crucial for me, and I felt like the types of software-engineering challenges I personally like revolve more around managing domain complexity in which case a higher-level language lets me be a bit more focused on the stuff I like. But you could be the opposite. Only you can really know.I will also say... and maybe I'm wrong about this expectation... but I feel like university students, at least by the 2nd year, should probably be able to learn any language necessary on their own quickly without it being the main focus of a course (maybe I'm wrong about this, though.) Meaning, at that point, the language is irrelevant and not what the teacher is actually trying to teach. It's just a vessel for teaching the real lessons. I think one has to get past the language-learning part and into the deeper software-engineering challenges and other concepts at play. Not the syntax/mechanics of a specific programming language. I think learning programming languages themselves is something you should just be able to do rather quickly as-needed/desired. Along those lines, if the question is... I can take a CS course taught by teacher A using language X, or the same exact course but by teacher B using language Y, I really don't think it matters that much to be honest. If X and Y are Java and C++ then just pick C++ if you predict it will make the class more enjoyable. Whether teacher A is better at teaching than teacher B is probably more important, actually. But, I think there's a good chance you might learn the actual lessons of the course better using Java than C++ so if you really can't make up your mind I suppose I would recommend Java for that reason but my suspicion is that I don't think it will matter much in the grand scheme of things and that it's not as crucial of a decision as it seems to be at the moment.Not sure if good advice but that's my experience with this stuff.",azimux,2025-11-01 21:45:03,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ojx0op,False,

Your job prospects would be very different.Generally it isn’t super recommended to do a bachelors in data science because you’ll be better served with a data science minor and say a stats degree. A lot of institutions only offer a minor in data science for this reason.Computer science is a very general degree that acts as a framework for you to go into anything in tech. The elective classes you take, projects you do, and internships all determine what you do as a career. That could be cyber security, software engineering, or even data analysis. Yes there is overlap between the two fields but data science is super stats focused while computer science is math focused. Since it’s so general a CS grad can totally become a data analyst or do a masters in data science if they take the right electives. A data science grad could not do the work of a CS grad just because there’s so much fundamental knowledge that is not covered. In DSCI you’ll barely touch programming outside of maybe a first year intro class let alone any computer theory.To go into anything machine learning you’ll need either a masters in data science or an extensive resume. So this Data Science and AI degree would really set you up poorly unless you plan on going right into grad school. The CS degree will be harder but it will set you up better. I just have to make it super clear that a company hiring for a CS position would 100% reject someone with a Data Science degree, they’re just different things.

So when writing that, (the following is pseudocode)def factorial(int n):return n * factorial(n-1)Now, factorials only work for positive numbers, so put an if statement in there at the beginning to make sure n > 0. And also, we want to stop the recursion once n = 1 (or 0). Essentially, we don’t want to multiply 0 to our return stack. So either if n=1: return 1, or you could also do if n=0: return 1, cause it doesn’t matter how many 1s you multiply to it. That’s the base case. It’s the case that you don’t call the function, thus ending the recursion and letting the whole stack catch up. You usually put the base case above the rest of it, because most of the time, you hit a return statement, it auto exits the function, put you could have the recursive part in an else block.

By either eliminating distractions or drilling down into the details, I can often cross the intuition gap.Using recursion as an example, let's say that I've seen the code```rakusub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) { given $n { when 1 { return 1 } when 2 { return 2 } default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) } };}```So, let's analyze: I can see exactly what happens when `$n == 1` and `$n == 2`. The default case, however, recurses, and it's not clear what that means. I can do a refactoring, making the code worse in order to look at it in more detail. For example, I can add the `$n == 3` case explicitly:```rakusub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) { given $n { when 1 { return 1 } when 2 { return 2 } when 3 { return fib(2) + fib(1) } default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) } };}```Since I've already determined what `fib(1)` and `fib(2)` are, I now know exactly what happens with `fib(3)`.And I can keep doing this, substituting the value of subexpressions into cases to see how the expansion would work. By the time I'm at `fib(6)`, that expansion looks like this:```rakusub fib(Int:D $n where * >= 1) { given $n { when 1 { return 1 } when 2 { return 2 } when 3 { return fib(2) + fib(1) } when 4 { return (fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2) } # fib(3) + fib(2) when 5 { return ((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1)) } # fib(4) + fib(3) when 6 { return (((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) + (fib(2) + fib(1))) + ((fib(2) + fib(1)) + fib(2)) } # fib(5) + fib(4) default { return fib($n -1) + fib($n - 2) } };}```By making what each recursive call does explicit, I can see the relationship between the last line and the lines before it. And I can see that in every case, the subexpressions are simpler than the overall expression and lead inevitably to the base cases.Anyway. That's one technique. Might work for you, might not.

nmkrlra,"I am not a REST evangelist, but the STANDARD approach to REST is that an endpoint set should refer to a RESOURCE, and a good litmus test for that is ""can I assign an ID to it without it getting weird"". And then you spread CRUD operations (create read update delete) across the verbs (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) for that resource. If you're more familiar with SQL, thinking about how you'd normalize the tables and what gets a primary key can kind of give you an idea what a ""resource"" or ""entity"", etc. would be.In your case, I'd probably have something more like1. POST /api/cart - CREATE a new CART2. POST or PUT /api/cart/{cartId} - Update metadata about the CART {cartId} (not necessarily its sub objects)3. POST /api/cart/{cartId}/item - CREATE a new item in cart {cartId}4. POST or PUT /api/cart/{cartId}/item/{itemId} - UPDATE an existing item in cart {cartId} with the id {itemId}. Your quantity update would go here.For the item model I'd probably have something like (BASIC) itemId // the id of the CART item productId // the id of the product in your catalog quantityNote I dont put things like PRICE, etc. in there: the PRODUCT linkage should let you get the price of the product in your catalog and do the math to present price information. You don't want to put things like that in your cart model, because it gives attackers a target to EDIT something they shouldn't, and suddenly they can update something in the cart to give it a price of $0. There are like a half dozen different suggestions about proper security design that go along with that, and I know you didn't ask about that, so I'm not going deeper.Also note that endpoint split is a little obvious for REST stuff, but there's others that aren't as obvious: like do you have an endpoint for SHIPPING information, OR is shipping information just part of a CART update call? ie:1. POST api/cart/{cartId}/shipping - ""create"" a shipping record for cart {cartId}?2. PUT api/cart/{cartId} - or just update the shipping information on the cart record itself?These judgement calls can be driven by LOTS of things. I might want to split shipping info updates to its own endpoint because the UI segregation of that operation vs other cart update operations kinda suggests it. Or because my DB design says that ""ShippingInfo"" is a 1:1 record with a Cart, and I want to adhere a bit to my data structure case, or dozens of other reasons.Another fun one, what type of endpoint would you use for a SEARCH endpoint? By REST standards its conceptually a GET, but robust search often becomes a POST out of necessity of supporting larger POST bodies. Plenty of GETs in a larger ecosystem migrate to POSTs to support request bodies too, because REST doesn't really deal with that, and you absolutely will hit a point where you have to send a body on a GET at some point because URLs can't support the size. Be pragmatic when its called for.Hell you don't HAVE to use PUT for updates. I've seen plenty of people only use POST as just ""POST is an upsert"" instead of dealing with PUTs at all, or reserving PUTs for PATCH operations and using POSTs for full object updates. REST purists will get all up in arms about that but... you should really ignore them. Almost no one does the pure thing in reality.",i8beef,2025-11-01 18:49:22,5,learnprogramming,t3_1olpqwa,False,

REST rules are about finding a kind of consistency, but real world API's often have edge cases. You just do the best you can to make it as logical and as consistent as possible.For DELETE, you really want to leave that for killing stuff.

The _cart_ is the resource routed at /cart/{id} and the action you’re performing is a custom action addQuantity. I used a google/microsoft-ish convention for custom actions, but you could also do /cart/{id}/addQuantity (but this is a little less RESTful because addQuantity is an _action_ not a resource) or PATCH /cart/{id} (if you know the current quantity and can just PATCH in the correct new value).",reallyreallyreason,2025-11-01 23:07:40,1,learnprogramming,t3_1olpqwa,False,

Without the link step, every little bit of code must be compiled each time a change is made to any part of the program. This can be a time consuming process even today, but back in the day they could measure this in hours and days, rather than seconds or minutes.To reduce the time needed for recompiling library code that hasn't actually changed, they invented the concept of relocatable code, that is code that only requires minor alterations before it can be placed anywhere in memory (and therefore anywhere in the output file). Those minor alterations are the *entry points*, typically functions and other things that the library exposes in order to be useful. All you need as a caller is to know their names/signatures, which is why these are placed in a header file that you #include in your program. The compiler then knows the names and can verify you are using them correctly, but doesn't have to care about how they are defined.The linker then takes your compiled code and figures out (by size) exactly where each piece fits, then changes all the necessary addresses so whenever you call a specific funtion, you actually call the correct address. In order to do this, the linker needs to know what object file(s) each of those header files were for.

In that case, you build the new stack bit by bit and slowly transition calls over.

If everything looks good, then you can start bringing over more traffic and slowly increase the load on the new stack until that use case is fully moved.

This is where you can create flags in the code that can be updated live on the running system (which are usually just booleans like `ENABLE_X_THING` but can be anything). Then in your code you introduce the feature flag to divert calls to the new stack: if (ENABLE_X_THING) { return // result from new stack } return // result from existing codeTypically in these feature frameworks, the state of the flags is attached to the individual requests, it's not a system-wide thing. This lets you turn it on and off for individual end users, or only for a sampling of requests across users, or whatever you want to do. It also allows you to selectively enable the feature in test envs so you can keep the old tests running on the old code path and add new tests for the new code path.So now you deploy it, add the new code with tests, and if everything looks good now you can start playing with it in prod to do manual testing, enable e2e tests with test user accounts, etc. Then you start rolling it out to actual users and if anything starts going wrong, you can always just flip the flag and shut it off.After you've moved everyone over and it's fully deployed for a few weeks and everything looks good, you can go in and remove the old code path. Once that's fully deployed, the feature flag now no longer controls anything so you can remove it from the feature flag framework as well and you've moved this use case over.",severoon,2025-10-30 19:32:09,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ojukgn,False,

nlvhuqk,"As a college graduate - I don't care what language you learned in college.Introductory materials only teach you the grammar and syntax. You're not learning how to USE the language, and they're not teaching you problem solving skills. Your programming classes give you some context for your other classes - computation theory, DSA, applied mathematics... It also gives you some exposure - this is the job, staring at a screen, walls of text, arbitrary decisions, bastard bugs. Is this something you want to do all day, every day, for the next 45 years?When you graduate, your education didn't finish, it only just begun. You don't pop out an expert. The end of college is only the beginning of the rest of your life. WE KNOW you don't know shit. THAT is why we hire junior developers - not because you're cheap, not because we couldn't afford a senior, but because juniors tend to multiply the force of a senior, because we can mold you into what you need to be successful here.I'll bet when you're done with this semester you couldn't actually tell me what OOP even is or adequately demonstrate it. It's not a judgement on you - all programming and college courses are saturated with dogmas and traditions. They call it an OOP course but don't actually teach it, typically because your professors don't actually know, either.So when you graduate, your programming experience isn't terribly relevant. C++, Python... What I need to know is how you think, if you can learn and adapt. Can I mold you into the person I need here to solve our problems? Ostensibly, the answer is ""yes"", so the major difference between you and another candidate is not what you ""know"", but the aptitude you both demonstrate. Obviously I'm going to hire the one with the greater potential, insofar as my hiring process can deduce. We don't have great tools for this - your GPA is SOMETHING but only tells a particular kind of story. It can mean you can learn a lot and make connections, or it can mean you can memorize the material long enough to ace a test. So GPA alone isn't enough. Your personality also counts for something - can I see myself working with you for the next 5 years? Are you going to mesh well with the personality of the team? You don't have to be smarter than the other guy to be the better fit.Once you get hired here, we'll teach you what you need to know to be successful. So don't sweat it. If you're hired, it means you're good enough, you've got the right stuff, and that we want to build you up and see you succeed. We know that's going to take time.Watch out for puppy mills - places that want junior graduates to also paradoxically have 3-5 years experience. That's not junior, that's not entry level. Also, if a company doesn't hire you - they're doing you a favor. Often it's because it's not a good fit - and that there is a TWO-WAY street. You DO NOT want to work for a place you don't fit in, that kind of misery WILL take years off your life.So focus on your fundamentals, your problem solving skills, and your joy of the craft. A good GPA won't hurt, either. Very quickly, the programming language fades away, and becomes a tool, a means to an end - you won't even see the code anymore. What you'll see is the problem before you, and your solution will be sculpted and painted - the epitome of elegance.",mredding,2025-10-28 18:44:20,15,learnprogramming,t3_1oigzfi,False,

Dropping and manually sizing, aligning, etc. each individual element, or using a loop that places each element and directly adjusts the attributes? I've learnt to value textual GUI creation with Java Swing. Much faster, much easier, much cleaner code.

nlszwh6,"I remember that. I like Qt Creator and Godot for letting me drag stuff around. But I do not like to work on other people's projects in those things.There are a few fundamental tradeoffs here:The code is the truth. Whatever the wysiwyg editor makes must translate to code. Whatever the code says must be presentable by the wysiwyg editor. This usually breaks down as soon as you do something with the code that the wysiwyg editor can not handle, like some custom widget for example. To make that work you have to write extra code just to make the wysiwyg editor compatible with your code again.On the flip side a lot of the frontend code has structure that the wysiwyg editor can not show. DOM has a box model that doesn't allow you to simply drag/drop a button anywhere. The only way to do that is to position it with absolute. You wouldn't do that because it breaks responsiveness with different view-ports. Instead you would work with padding, margins, grid layouts etc to get the desired effect - but the wysiwyg cannot show that. It can only hint at that.This in turn usually leads to people who're used only to the wysiwyg editor to forget about the underlying structure. There's plenty of precedent for that. LaTeX for example is about code representing structured text and styles to render headlines differently than normal text, Microsoft Word simply allows you to make text large and bold to emulate a heading. But the loss of structure also means you can't do the other stuff LaTeX can do like creating content listings and reducing page breaks immediately after headings. Designers who create mockups in Figma _can_ do really great work, or they can simply slap some shapes there and call it a day. But since the code will be the truth eventually, someone has to translate those shapes into the structure anyway.Lastly, the people who work with code all day have a different problem than the people who rely mainly on wysiwyg editors. Graphical user interfaces are about discoverability of features and a quick preview of the final product. Material pipelines in Blender for example work very well as boxes connected with wires. Code has about information density, and is easier to work with. No graphical tool can fit as much information on a screen as well written text. Copy and pasting text works between tons of editors, but copy and pasting graphical elements only works in the same tool. You can check text into version control and get diffs or even move detection, that doesn't work for graphical elements unless it compiles to text first.",aanzeijar,2025-10-28 10:33:19,2,learnprogramming,t3_1oi54ny,False,

I would strongly advice to NOT find random tutorials, walkthroughs etc. to help you with this. The main skills you want to accomplish solving these problems goes (IMO) something like this:1. Creative thinking: How should I even tackle this problem? When I think of ""create a program that does X, Y, Z"" - which subproblems does X, Y and Z actually consist of. This is a skill that you cannot really read your way towards, you have to DO it. If you find yourself stuck it is of course alright to look for solutions to subproblems, but again I would avoid copy/pasting code, look for general ideas you can apply to the problem solving at hand. 2. Just experience writing and debugging code. This is another area where reading the answers just don't help. You need to learn the error messages of whatever tool you're using and how they relate to problems in your code. This is probably the most frustrating part of all of this, as sometimes it can take hours only to realise it was some small silly thing that was wrong. But just to give an example of what I think about here (I don't know if this is still the case or not), but back in the day whenever reading error messages, regarding syntax, from PHP, usually the error was on the line above the one mentioned in the error message. Figuring out stuff like this, finding shortcuts for yourself in how to debug your code and general issues will enable you to write code for yourself. 3. You need some experience designing systems, as you become more and more skilled your systems will become bigger and probably more complex - and likely also more messy. I cannot remember how many years I wrote code before I was able to look back at code from just a year prior without thinking it was total crap. Nobody expects a junior to create beautiful architectured code, but you need to have experienced this epiphany of ""I wrote this, and it's trash, I should have done so and so"".Of course reading about code, be it design patterns, or something else entirely is also good.

On Unix this is done with signals. If there is no handler, the process will crash. - But if there is a handler, it can convert a machine exception into a language exception, which can then be caught. This happens in most managed languages - Python, Java, C# etc.C and C++ generally do not provide such handlers.

Kind of like you can `break` out of a while-loop.I like to think of the try-catch like an if-else, where the try-block is like: ""if everything goes well"", and the catch-block is like ""else do this"" - with the crazy change that you can break out of the ""if"" and jump into the ""else"", unlike normal program flow.I know that these comparisons aren't correct - but they do help me understand how to write the code, and what to expect to happen.

Why? I mean, microservices CAN be great, but they always increase complexity, both to develop and to deploy. If you can't give enough good reasons as to why you need microservices, a monolith might be better. 3. I don't know what you mean by ""completely""? It is probably not necessary to learn postgresql ""completely"" (that would take a loooong time), because in all seriousness: your app will most likely not need 100% of all possible performance out of your database. Even if everything you write is 10x slower than possible, it will still be more than fast enough in reality. 4. Monolith is simpler, Microservices scale differently and can do a clean separation of concerns. Monolith should be your default!5. afaik you can just deploy docker images to kubernetes, no? My understanding is, that kubernetes is just a more fancy way of managing deployed images, and stuff, but I am not very experienced in deployment. 6. Again, why do you need this? Ci/Cd sounds good on paper, but especially the CD part adds a lot of complexity to your deployment phase. If you can't articulate, why, default to a normal, manual deployment whenever you think a release is ready. 7. Cloud is just an invisible server. You can get a VPS for very cheap, which doesn't run the risk of increasing your cloud bill into the stratosphere, if you use too many CPU cycles. Start there. As with CI/CD and Kubernetes, this is really not a developer issue. It's a deployment and DevOps issue. At small scales, you can do it yourself, but you really don't need a lot of complexity, and when you are working at a company, there will be a separate position for this. 8. This is legitimately the most important point on your list for a developer, and there is no single correct answer. As with all design decisions, there are a lot of possible tradeoffs. While I don't have a good book for that handy, I would suggest reading up on your favourite API Design (REST for example), because much ink has probably been spilled about that topic. Also: experience. Just build some APIs and see what works, and what gives you more issues in the long run, when you try to refactor a new feature for example. 9. So, this is complicated: Most backend system have a proper event system / observer pattern thing going, like flask or axum both have pretty good signals internally. As long as you build a monolith, this is really good and should definitaly be used. Kafka is just a way to send signals over multiple microservices, which CAN be useful, or it can just add more unnecessary complexity!

The important thing is: no one can have an accurate mental model of 10k lines of code, and that is pretty tame as far as big codebases go. In the last corporate project I worked on, we had 3 main (and several smaller) microservices with about 30k-60k loc each. So instead of memorizing files, I learned the structure of the project. When I was asked, where to find a feature, I could then think through it logically. This only works, if your project is internally consistent, so if you have every piece of code placed correctly. For example, we had all models in a folder, all endpoints in a folder, with subfolders for very large collections of endpoints, all validation code was together, all signals where in a single folder, and so on. At that point, it's just like following a map: ""Okay, you want to know about the bookmarking function for an article.

Haskell has lazy eval, is functional, has great support for ADTs, interesting ad-hoc polymorphism system with type-classes etc. lot of those are things which you can realistically never have any experience with from JS/TS and it will enrich you to learn them.C is basically lingua franca of systems programming, everything has to interact with C ABI at some point so it’s worth knowing it. You can also learn about manual memory management that way. It can also teach you lot about parallelism if you start doing multiple processes and multiple threads. Again those are things which you won’t have any experience with from TS and it can help a ton to learn them.Beyond that learning a bit of assembly is always worth just because it can demystify bunch of stuff. Scheme and C++ are both very interesting if you want to learn what cool stuff you can do with compile time meta programming, since they these languages are kinda kings of that. Erlang and co can be interesting because of the OTP and in general CSP/Actor style concurrency. Learning prolog can be pretty interesting educational experiment since the whole highly declarative style of programming is very unlike anything you might see elsewhere. Elm is also really interesting take on declarative UI programming. Idris is amazing take on dependent type systems. Rust is obviously pretty cool and popular take on affine types etc. There is abundance of cool languages which can teach you a lot.The holy trinity of corporate languages (Java, C#, Go) are not particularly interesting, nor can you gain a bunch of great insights from learning them… Sure maybe some things about parallelism can be learned, and Java and Go are both decent enough takes on the whole CSP concurrency model, but mostly they are kinda boring, which is kinda the whole point of languages like that.

Even if they had the concepts of ""line"" or ""curve"" and the math built in, they would still need to interpolate through several algorithms to produce the output on their natural display grid.If you were to hand draw your line, your hands intrinsically and sub consciously do very complex calculations similar to what computers do, plus, contrary to computers, you have your visual feedback loop. Try drawing a curved line in pitch dark as this is basically what a computer can see - nothing. Have you ever tried to draw a curved line on an ""Etch-A-Sketch""? Similar problem. Or, get a CAD program to precisely draw your curved line. Or, get a 3D printer or a CNC machine to follow your curved path. All these are far from simple.Curves in general are no trivial math, no matter what algorithms or what curve systems you use. Every trigonometry or math professor will tell you that.What we humans classify as ""simple"" doesn't mean it is really ""simple"" in an objective manner.Computers are generally very dumb devices that are only good in one thing: calculatingYou have to tell them every single minuscule step that they have to perform.Once you accept that computers are extremely dumb and that you have to tell them every minuscule step you are on the right track to becoming a programmer.

We have bloated middle management who only care about the bottom line.It got so bad that another senior engineer just quit. He HAD to be backfilled asap as the work is quite skilled.

Nope, you lose.Senior nice guy has horror stories about the job market. He no longer does anything extra. He'll let you watch him work but won't comment and just puts his head down and outdoes most everyone else. Making it worse on the junior staff as they take longer and their numbers are dropping.

nm0mez8,"Hate to be that guy but whenever I explained things to my friends throughout the years they have always wondered when the whole thing would topple over onto itself. People don't really want to talk about it, but there have always been a tremendous amount of people in the industry who did very little. At least that's how it has been since I started in 2007.The reason why it used to be like that is because you used to be able to predict revenue growth by adding warm bodies and new projects, but now that tech (particularly the web) in a lot of ways matured its a lot harder to increase profits in this way. There are far fewer obvious ideas not being done out there that you can make bank on by doing. Thus the incentive has become cutting through the layers of fat and excess in engineering orgs.Going forward I see tech as being far leaner than it has been and more focused being placed on building high-performance teams that are spearheaded by high-impact individual contributors. Whenever those teams yield significant results you'll probably see them hiring reliable warm bodies again to maintain and extend what they've built. Even with lower interest rates I don't really see this dynamic changing much. Because back in the day you could just mill out CRUD apps and rake in cash but that game is tapped out.With that being said the experienced engineers who aren't finding jobs are the ones that never really applied themselves to achieve significant things for the organizations they worked for.

I came across similar feelings. At first I just applied to tech jobs, but I soon figured out that that was just small thinking on my part. There were layoffs (not as bad now), but super competitive considering much of the roles that a new grad would take was not only outsourced, but also those positions in the U.S. wanted decades of experience to work with the offshore teams. So I started looking at big corporations not known for IT with an IT department. Randomly applied for a project manager position where they needed someone with a working knowledge of computer languages and know how to speak to people. Took the job at a publishing company where I did more data analysis and project management. I got laid off after two years post graduation. At the time I was just looking for a job and landed at a revenue cycle company. They didn’t have an IT department they contracted with IBM at the time. While I was working in medical records, I continued to keep up with cs trends and followed my current employer on LinkedIn to keep up with what they were doing. It’s funny how many people do not keep up with what going on with their employer. (This is relevant) Believe me I tried applying at other well known IT companies like IBM, Apple, Google etc  and interviewed but never panned out during my tenure as a medical records specialist. Then my current employer announced internally that they were creating an IT department. Which led to subset departments like software engineering and data analytics. I also had read in Wall Street journal they had just landed a 10 year contract with one of the biggest healthcare providers in the U.S. and part of the partnership employer acquired a few of their subsidies, one of which was analytics. Knowing things were coming up so really watched for the job posts and applied to nearly of them. I landed in data analysis and I think it’s because I had a background in healthcare ops and computer languages. I could speak to people non technical and understood how to speak to engineers. So while I never thought I’d be in data analytics, I just went with the flow and kept applying for jobs I got my degree in. Oh and due to the fact that I follow my current employer on LinkedIn, I was able to stay ahead on their partnership with an AI company. Learning about AI company because I had a feeling one of the products I oversee is now part of companies KPI - they would want to use part of our data.

There's a chance that you can apply to go remote if you get your manager on board. It isn't guaranteed of course but for L3+ with a good performance record, you have a shot. In the short term it may be worth the trouble to get a short term rental with a less insane commute while you decide if the role is a good fit.You should absolutely include RSUs in your consideration for this role. Stripe has had 1-2 tender offers annually for the last couple years so there are plenty of chances to get liquidity. Yes, RSU grants are taxed at your marginal income tax rate (about 50% for me), and you will pay capital gains if your shares increase on value after vesting (this is a good problem to have). If you are a high performer, you can stack additional RSU grants that vest over 1-2 years and sweeten the deal considerably.WLB varies by team of course but I don't think it's as bad as some people say. You can try to get opinions for your team/org by asking on Blind. It's definitely not a place where you can coast but I rarely work over 40 hours a week.

Our on-call can be brutal and all of the things we own are critical so it can be stressful. It’s not friendly to early career, especially if it’s not the type of work you are interested in, and it has been a struggle. I was told that this experience with systems would be great for my future career opportunity so I went along with it. What I’ve found is that I’m missing out on a lot of traditional early career exposure. I don’t have much OOP experience and I don’t know much about writing or owning the destination services themselves. This has made it tough to change teams (I’ve gotten direct feedback that they want more code experience) and it means that to land another job I will have to be “creative” on my resume and when interviewing. In the current market, people want specific tech stack experience, not generalists. So yes I very much feel pigeon holed as a result of the bait and switch and it has impacted my career trajectory and my overall happiness in the industry. I don’t write code or build things: I put out fires, stare at dashboards, and debug kubernetes logs. I’ll spend an hour figuring out an esoteric 1 line yaml configuration change which could literally take down the entire business if it’s done wrong, and then a teammate will ask why it took me so long. I am expected to understand the entirety of our system as opposed to just my one vertical. It is not at all what I expected when I chose this career. I do not recommend taking an SRE job out of school. As others have said, it’s something people usually choose to get into later in their career, it assumes a lot of underlying knowledge, it’s high stakes, and it’s not the type of work everybody enjoys or excels at.

This system does has its perks that you can escape a bad fit the second rotation, and you get to try new things. But internally? There’s a lot of teams who hate TDP/Coda hires because they are basically assigned one and they can be a net negative. That attitude is awful in a pip culture because everyone already wants to save themselves and claim as much visibility as possible (first person to turn in performance reviews can claim milestones and others then have to go to extra efforts disprove them). Imagine being a senior engineer and you want to help the junior get up to speed but if you do, you likely going to get pipped for not delivering more of your own tasks. Years ago, they apparently counted mentoring, interviewing, and similar activities as a bonus point towards performance and now it’s almost a negative. Yes, yes.

I'd originally planned to have it do bar graphs, pie graphs and line graphs but ran out of space on my floppy disk and had to make a copy of the project and do the pie graphs on another floppy. I wrote some rather cheesy input routines to input the data and drew the graphs using the Apple Pascal Turtle Graphics library that came on the floppy disk.

So every time you hit a key, the floppy drive would flash briefly.Only good thing about that year in school, the project probably kept me from going insane.

But they might end up flummoxed when the site is broken due to bad DNS config, load balancer problems, certificate issues, etc.Specialists can be super productive when they are in their lane and things are working on the happy path. But they can end up struggling when troubleshooting failures and problems that occur in systems they ""own"" but fall outside their speciality.I'm happy that I've spent time working on provisioning systems for bare metal servers, fumbled my way through setting up networks and getting BGP working across VPN links between sites, built my own AD domains and a thousand other ""IT"" tasks which most Software Developers are never exposed to. Its been amazingly useful when it comes to troubleshooting failures and being able to identify all the places where problems can be injected into the environment where services run.So ultimately, I think it is most valuable to be a specialist in one or more domains, but with a broad exposure and experience outside of those specialist silos.

nmxiy6g,"One of the big issues right now is the industry is in a downturn. There’s debate if and when things will turn around. There’s a chance by the time you graduate, the market will be better, but there are no guarantees in life. There is a general shift away from remote work. Hybrid is more popular these days, although there are some places going 5 days on-site. It won’t be impossible for you, just hard. There’s value being in-person, especially earlier in your career or time at a new company/team. You don’t need to necessarily love programming, but you need some combination of competence and caring. When I say “caring,” I mean wanting to do a good job rather than half-ass it. You don’t need to work a million hours. There are a lot of really lazy devs out there. And a lot of people want to gatekeep the industry to those “who truly care.” I’m not trying to contradict myself. In latter scenario, caring means people who eat, live, and breathe tech. You can still be quite successful without that. There are some online universities, if you really cannot stand your current state. There are about 3-4 that are regularly recommended, but their names escape me at the moment. Definitely a step above University of Phoenix. You will be getting a real degree. One other thing to consider is some women don’t like tech working environments. Men in tech can be weird for several different reasons. You have the original nerd types, and now there are tech bros. There have been initiatives to increase the number of women in STEM, but YMMV how each company has done. I saw this post in another sub and thought it was interesting.

If you are unsure about how to do something, ask for advice or ""how to do it well"" or ""the best practices"" for such task. When you want to discuss your task with your senior, study your task very well, understand the code you wrote, and **TAKE NOTES**. Don't try to remember everything in your head if you can't. I always brought my notebook during meetings when I had to talk about my tasks and code and referred to it when needed.Good luck",MihaelK,2025-10-30 00:47:20,9,cscareerquestions,t3_1ojln3d,False,

I thought that was hard, but it was actually quite easy compared to working within a properly organized tech company.First 6 months at my current tech job were absolute hell. I could not get anything done on time. All of my PRs would get torn to pieces in review. I caused a handful of significant issues in prod. I spent every single day worrying about getting fired. A few of my more complicated projects brought me to tears.Everyone I work with has like 7+ years of experience. I feel like a fucking worm compared to my teammates. Just like you said, they can do in an hour what I can't do in five. I can't even comprehend how people can work at that speed.Here's where our stories diverge, though:My manager has consistently (like at least once a month) reminded me that I am doing an awesome job. They have reminded me that it's normal for me to be slower than my teammates, it's normal for me to struggle or have knowledge gaps, and it's normal for me to ask for help. My work is valued by the company even if it isn't as impressive as the work being done by industry veteran wizards.>“I don’t even know how to help you.”That's your ""Team Lead""?

And then I was assigned to use their solution, their un-modified solution failed to actually solve the problem I needed it to solve, and I did my best to deliver my part of the project and then resigned in contempt for the leadership of my team. And in my engienering handoff meeting, as I was resigning, after my project had been impacted by this deficit in their design, I mentioned again that it was not fit for the purpose it needed to be used for.

They will probably say that they are trying to contribute valuable implementation details on *how* to solve the problem, so you should be ready to ask if they are sure that their comments are commensurate with the prioritization of problems that we have; because it might be that commissioning a smaller group to solve the problem is a lot more effective than sitting as a group talking about details that are germane only to a subset of people.",NonSequiturDetector,2025-10-29 16:56:40,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1oj96np,False,

nmuot76,"7 YOE here.I am a BE generalist who due to the fluidity of the market also do full stack (BE focused).Personally, life just... more or less led me to be a BE/full stack-ish generalist. It just sort of happened because those teams took me in early career and it just... sort of kept going on like that since then.I am purposely rerouting to full stack side from purely BE as I am noticing more and more job postings want full stack (so doing best to adapt to the job market for future job searches).>what factors helped you choose your pathtbh, I don't know. I think for most of my career, I didn't know much so I just adapted given the work I was given. And I never really gave much of a thought. It's really difficult to know anything early career and all I knew during college was I absolutely wanted to avoid networking, C++, OCaml, machine learning. Looking back now, I feel thinking in absolutes is not good and I should have given those fields a try.I did do data engineering side (more niche) early on but quickly pivoted away because I noticed data side was going to get paid less than general engineering (the trend was dying and the number of job postings were too slim so I escaped while I could early career).>How has this decision impacted your job security, compensation growth, and day-to-day satisfaction?Job Security - Feels nonexistent. I think this is the worry with generalists. I am way too easily replaceable by offshoring as offshore infra matures more and more. I wish I would have specialized and am doing my own sort of specialization in some ways (explained later on).Compensation Growth - Leaves to be desired. If I could redo I would have run immediately to Machine Learning. The pay premium is so much greater. It's noticeably more. Basically about $80\~200k more a year when you are senior/staff. And career growth (promos) seem much faster for more niche fields. For instance for those in security or ML, they can get external Google Senior offer at 5 YOE. A generalist might need 10 YOE in comparison and get paid worse.Day to day satisfaction - I find working with motivated coworkers with a decent manager is what sets the day to day satisfaction. Not the type of work I do.>specializing in a niche vs being a generalist?While my skills are generalist, I am 'specializing' in business domain. That's how I plan on 'buffing' (?) my resume. So while my coding skills are generalist, the domain I am working on is becoming more specialized.I definitely noticed how helpful that was when doing a job search recently.[https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1o1m1hw/2025\_job\_search\_2\_month\_long\_results/](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/1o1m1hw/2025_job_search_2_month_long_results/)Applied 18 companies and 15 gave interviews. All 3 that didn't respond were for generalist roles that were far off from my business domain. And the 1 recruiter who ghosted me after recruiter call was also for a role far outside the business domain I worked on.If anything, I noticed throughout the interview process the jobs that were closely in lined to business domains basically just gave me offers (freebies). It's a huge advantage to have experience in closely related niche fields.I say specialize early on in potential in-demand fields if you can because the ones with high barriers of entry like GPUs, AI inference, etc are extremely difficult to offshore. And basically have no competition once you have sufficient experience (best for job security). And can command huge premiums in the market as you become senior+ (+ promos are easier and quicker).If you cannot specialize like that and you are a generalist, at least specialize on the business domain. Why wouldn't a hiring manager pick someone who is exposed to similar business domains over some random candidate who worked on something completely different? That said do keep in mind generalists are the most replaceable so offshore worries will be a bigger threat over time. :/**I honestly feel generalist just sucks. Most easily replaceable/offshore-able.** **Specialize in what companies need but cannot find. It's all supply demand and promos/compenstions do reflect such as well.** **Have knowledge in many stuff but be deep in 1 topic.**In a bad economy, also keep in mind while generalists can apply everywhere, specialists (in domain or busines knowledge) will be first in line for those jobs. So you do get screwed in job searches as a pure generalist.Keep in mind specialist in some outdated garbage is the worst of all worlds.",Fwellimort,2025-11-03 09:18:55,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1on6sqo,False,

nmvr66b,"Love the question. makes me think more carefully about my path.First off, I have intentionally never hired full stack engineers, so I vote for specializing in front or backend. That's an interesting topic to get into, too.Myself, I've serially specialized in both my roles and what industries/segments I've been focused on. In both cases I've tried to get as deep in the speciality as practical. Roles: backend dev, product manager, project manager, software & systems architect, no-hands-on people manager. Bouncing from one to another hasn't held me back. I honestly couldn't say which I enjoyed more and the world needs all of them. With industries, I specialized in systems (primarily app servers and orch platforms), dev tools, data agg/monetization, and vertical search engines. That might not seem like a huge range, but each of them are pretty specialized and their first choice is to hire people from their own space, so the segments are a factor.I don't think specialization necessarily holds you back from making changes. As a hiring manager, for a mid-/senior dev I want to see people have been in 3-6 companies in at least 2 industries over 4 to 12 years digging as deep into whatever they were doing at the time to be great at it. I want the experience that comes with it. Diversity of experience is very good.Long story short, I vote for doubling-down, but occasionally pivoting.",ProfessionalDirt3154,2025-11-03 14:12:37,0,cscareerquestions,t3_1on6sqo,False,
