We started with accounting data, because it was the cleanest and slowly migrated the data silos into centralized database. If we met any resistance, we told them that if they wanted their data reflected in the monthly report, it had to come from the centralized database. Since the report was highly visible, they had to agree and after some initial growing pains (mostly historical data cleanup and arguments about what to name things), the automation and built in error-checking won people over. I've worked with a lot of organizations since then and most of them don't have the demand or the inter-departmental communication necessary to break down data silos.

n219wr6,"Hey, [r/dataengineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/)! Hope you're having a good day.We are excited to announce Sail 0.3. In this release, Sail preserves compatibility with Spark’s pre-existing interface while replacing its internals with a Rust-native execution engine, delivering significantly improved performance, resource efficiency, and runtime stability.Among other advancements, Sail 0.3 adds support for Spark 4.0 while maintaining compatibility with Spark 3.5 and improves how Sail adapts to version changes in Spark’s behavior across versions. This means you can run Sail with the latest Spark features or keep your current production environment with confidence, knowing it’s built for long-term reliability and evolution alongside Spark.[https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3/](https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3/)# What is Sail?Sail is an open-source computation framework that serves as a drop-in replacement for Apache Spark (SQL and DataFrame API) in both single-host and distributed settings. Built in Rust, Sail runs \~4x faster than Spark while reducing hardware costs by 94%.# What’s New in Sail 0.3* **Compatibility** with Spark 4.0’s new `pyspark-client`, a lightweight Python-only client with no JARs, enabling faster integration and unlocking performance and cost efficiency.* **Changes in the installation command** now require explicitly installing the full PySpark 4.0 library (along with Spark Connect support) or the thin PySpark 4.0 client, offering greater flexibility and control, especially as Spark Connect adoption grows and variants of the client emerge.* **Automatic detection of PySpark version** in the Python environment adjusts Sail’s runtime behavior accordingly to handle internal changes, such as differences in UDF and UDTF serialization between Spark versions, ensuring that a single Sail library remains compatible across both versions.* **Automatic Python unit testing** on every pull request across Spark 3.5 and Spark 4.0 to track feature parity and avoid regressions.* **Faster object store performance,** reducing latency and improving throughput across cloud-native storage.* **New and improved documentation** with updated getting-started guides, architecture diagrams, and compatibility to help you get up and running with Sail and understand its parity with Spark.# Our MissionAt LakeSail, our mission is to unify batch processing, stream processing, and compute-intensive AI workloads, empowering users to handle modern data challenges with unprecedented speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. By integrating diverse workloads into a single framework, we enable the flexibility and scalability required to drive innovation and meet the demands of AI's global evolution.# Join the Slack CommunityThis release features contributions from several first-time contributors! We invite you to [join our community on Slack](https://www.launchpass.com/lakesail-community/free) and engage with the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/lakehq/sail). Whether you're just getting started with Sail, interested in contributing, or already running workloads, this is your space to learn, share knowledge, and help shape the future of distributed computing.

n1rwep2,"Partial / full open source tools are useful but also consider learning one of the major managed platform solutions (e.g. Databricks, Snowflake) as a lot of larger enterprises will opt for these (especially if they're money rich and sofware engineering skill poor). Both of them offer a free account for testing with limitations (Databricks daily limit, Snowflake also limited 30 day trial but you can create a new account later). Databricks notebook / compute environment is very similar to Fabric so that's what I'd recommend.Also pandas isn't really appropriate for any of these environments as it not parallel compute optimised (the whole code ends up running on the driver node). You may end up working with some code some data scientist wrote in pandas but you likely shouldn't be writing it from scratch (although pyspark does have pandas api on spark which is mostly cross compatiable). All of these platforms have a variant of SQL and I've found data teams who migrate from on-prem to cloud tend to prefer using it as they're not as comfortable with python, but you could also familiarise yourself with pyspark which will be relevant for both Databricks and Fabric.For loading data, I would get comfortable with e.g. using spark.read() for either append, overwrite or merge. Beyond reading CSV, look at reading/writing parquet and look at processing e.g. JSON files and handling semi-structured data operations (e.g. exploding on list elements) as you will often need to ingest from APIs with this structure and then flatten it for a reporting requirement.I would also familairise yourself with data platform design patterns, e.g. Databricks medallion architecture.

It would just be extra tooling you'd be learning for no gain, for your use case. They're fine tools for other situations, but it's very likely you can accomplish everything you need already using using just the features of SQL Server.Personally, I'd prefer to get everything to one server which you can do pretty simply with either Replication or Log Shipping (though there's other options too). And for any large tables that you'll be running OLAP against, you could try columnstore indexing to satisfy your query performance needs. Indexed Views, Filtered Indexes, and Partitioning are some other out-of-the-box features that can help you with performance and data management as well.I say this as someone who ran OLTP and OLAP against the same SQL Server databases, that had tables which individually had 10s of billions of rows and multi-terabytes of data, on minimally provisioned hardware (8 GB of Memory and 4 CPUs), and most queries ran in sub-second time.",jshine13371,2025-07-07 12:15:19,2,dataengineering,t3_1lsg7gu,False,

n1qlfvr,"There's a lot of good questions here to unpack. I work in this area, so I can give you an overview.**What is real time? Is near-real time enough? (tldr; question)**This is defined differently for different use cases and there isn't one definition for this. For example, the definition of real-time is different for real-time operating systems (think RTOS) or high-freuquency trading (they literally measure cable lengths to minimize propagation delays) and other use cases. For data engineering, ""real-time"" rarely means milliseconds in my experience, but is very often seconds and even minutes, depending who in the org-chart you talk to. That said, a lot of large-scale compute workloads we see often do end up in the milliseconds. The most common place I see those is in the security space, but their setups don't resemble a typical data engineering environment. Instead of CDC, Kafka, warehouses and ETL jobs, you will see transactional workloads, APIs, and processes directly talking to one another over HTTP.**Complex transformations (2)**It's historically been pretty hard to pull off but that's changing. The foundational work/papers to do this at scale is fairly recent (I'd say, last 2-3 years), so it's not surprising you haven't seen off-the-shelf solutions here that live up to the promises.Fundamentally, to compute in real-time, you need to be able to compute ""incrementally"". That is, update views over your data in real-time by only observing how the input tables ""change"" (inserts/updates/deletes). No batch engine (like the ones you mention, Trino, Spark etc) can achieve this, because they are designed from the ground up to recompute queries from scratch, which gets slower as the data size increases.For an actual incremental engine, I encourage you to give [Feldera](https://github.com/feldera/feldera) a spin (disclaimer: I work there). It let's you define pipelines as tables and deeply nested views in SQL. When the tables ""change"" (get inserts/updates/deletes), the views are updated incrementally. The guarantee is that the amount of work a pipeline does is proportional to the size of the changes, not the size of the overall data. It's main strength is that it can do such incremental evaluation for **arbitrarily complex SQL, including recursion**, not just simple queries (as you seem to have noted about alternatives).What this means is that pipelines do so little work per event, that it routinely hits the millisecond timescales in real-world workloads (users have even reported 4ms latencies to keep views over terabytes of data, with low tens of milliseconds being more common). Of course, it depends on the queries, the arrival rates and what not. But we do see users run some beastly pipelines that update at sub-second speeds over billions of rows (think 10K line Spark SQL code, with 100s of joins, distincts, aggregates, and what not).**Infra bottlenecks and processing delays (1, 3)**You are spot on here, but not due to actual hardware issues (modern hardware is ridiculously fast and if anything, most software and cloud infra sucks at taking advantage of them). NVMe storage and modern CPUs can pack quite the punch.When it comes to building real-time systems **end-to-end** however, you might still end up in the seconds to minutes range, even if the analytics/compute side is instanteous. This is because most data stores and plumbing infra aren't built for high volume real-time ingest (i.e., they cannot handle inserts/updates/deletes to data).For example, if further downstream of Feldera, you want to serve the results off of something like Delta Lake, you have to incur the additional latency from having to run Delta Table merges before you can serve this data. We have (painfully) seen pipelines update complex views in milliseconds only for things like Delta Lake and Kafka to add another minute afterwards. There are of course ways to architect around it, but it does take a lot of custom systems work (see the security industry context I mentioned earlier).**Hype vs reality (5)**There is a tremendous amount of hype and marketing here. Don't believe any vendor (including me :)) -- reality about this space is that it is quite nascent, and whether you can hit the right operating points around scale/latency/throughput does depend on your workload and the laws of computational complexity at play. Throw your worst queries and most challenging use cases at them before you make a decision, rather than believe any hype.",Unique_Emu_6704,2025-07-07 02:01:26,16,dataengineering,t3_1ltg0pt,False,

n202zx2,"First, OP, your post reads like a marketing flyer with all the buzzwords. There are definite good practices for many needs but not a generic one size fits all. There are a list of things I would suggest,1. Stop calling it medallion architecture (it is a pet peeve of mine). The three tier design has been around for 35+ years. It was originally called staging, core and semantic layers. There are very few hard and fast rules around them; just generic guidelines.2. The best datawarehouses don't have any particular purpose (at least not until you hit the semantic layer). This is especially true of the core layer. It should be modeled around the business processes. As such, it only changes as often as the business does. Normally, this is not very often.3. Things happen in the processes between layers. It is not very often that things happen inside a layer.4. Staging is for landing data and, if desired, keeping the historical feed data. You should always have the original feed from the operational system so that you can trace your data back to it. The data warehouse is considered ""correct"" when it balances back to the system of record (SOR). If the SOR isn't right, you don't fix it in the DW, you fix it in the SOR and let the correction flow forward. When you change source data in the DW, you lose your chain of accountability. The Line of Businesses (LOB) or legal will tell you how long they want you to archive that stuff. Remember, they look at it differently than IT.5. The core layer is where data is kept that has been cleaned and adjusted to standard values. Different LOBs may have different abbreviations and meanings for data components. The processes to create and update the core data is where you adjust those to the standards. I tend to make my core layer in 3NF because it shows the proper relationships between the data parts without assigning specific purpose to the data. You make it fit for all purposes. This is where you also clean up things like addresses. (These can be a nightmare. Look at all of the ways Peachtree is used in Atlanta.) You also generalize things like customers, employees, vendors, etc. to generic terms like Party. You don't have to have the entire core flushed out before you use it. Just have the design as far as you can and flush the data out as project come along to fund it.6. The third layer, semantic, is where you put your data products, created from core, that the various LOBs need. When you create something like a star schema, you assign specific purpose to the data. It may or may not fit with other LOBs in the organization. Trying to reuse data products across various LOBs can be a tricky proposition and needs a bit of thought.7. Traditionally, you would only give access for users at the semantic layer. I tend to break this guideline. While still having appropriate security controls, I give users access to any layer they want. Data Scientists tend to like data a early and close to the operational data source as possible. I give them access to staging with the caveat to them the data is still abit of a mess. Regulatory reporting normally can wait a bit for the much cleaner data in the semantic layer. Those are just two examples.8. Don't ignore the other data parts like security, metadata, governance, etc. This is why you want to find an experience data architect to help you.

For uncached ad-hoc queries, set a hard timeout and ask clients to batch.

That’s why Spark (that originally was meant for parallel processing) usually goes along with Hadoop File System (HDFS).With this setup you can simply pick a CSV file, manipulate with Sprk, and then store in another location.Now let's complicate a little bit the situation: for example you can still store records as CSV table but want to enforce a schema, in this case you can spin up a Spark cluster with Hive Metastore (it’s just an external small database to store metadata of your tables). This allows you for partitioning, clustering, grant RBAC, ...In the last 20 years more complicated file types have been enforced in data engineering, like Parquet (think of it as a self describing CSV which has an header with column names and data type) and Iceberg.I don't know if this answer your question but to recap basically you need to combine a query engine with a metadatastore to have a complete database/datawarehouse otherwise you can only transform data from point A to point B.",Busy_Elderberry8650,2025-07-03 20:31:01,1,dataengineering,t3_1lqcxx0,False,

n1ags9c,"> do modern BI systems need an analytics DatabaseTechnically no, in practice yes. The reason is that productive systems like ERP are built for recording transaction data, i.e. a fine-grained log of events and facts. Technically this translates into lots of short-lived requests to the system, e.g. ""store this order"", ""lookup this invoice"" etc. That is, the system load per request is low. This is different for analysis oriented queries, where we typically want to show aggregate results, e.g. ""order volume in the last 3 months, grouped by product / region / customer segment"" or ""show all customers who's order volume over the last 3 months is less than their average over the previous 12 months"".These aggregated queries require a different data model, at least a different set of indexes v.v. the data model for the transaction system, aka operational database. Of course it's technically possibly to run these aggregate queries against the operational database directly, however it will strain its resources and potentially result in bad performance for end users.Another aspect to consider is that the data needed to answer these kind of queries often span multiple systems, e.g. orders are tracked in one system, invoices in another. That is, we have to combine data from different systems, which is notoriously difficult (as in requires dedicated effort) unless there is an infrastructure that supports it.With this in mind, it is easier to build a seperate database that is optimized for aggregate queries, and does not interfere with the operational database.Regarding the argument against storing data multiple times: That's a very common objection and it sounds logical. You don't want arbitrary copies of data stored just about everywhere - that's a valid concern. However, the need to serve analytics demands are equally valid, and following the above line of argument, they require a different technical setup. So there's a trade-off between avoiding data duplication, and the need to have well-performing systems for both operational and analytics needs.They key is to build the analytics database (whatever you call it) by a controlled and managed process, that is the data is not stored arbitrarily, but the process is designed to keep the data up to date, the purpose of the duplication is to serve analytics needs, and there is ownership assigned.",scaledpython,2025-07-04 11:37:57,2,dataengineering,t3_1lrcx96,False,

n11o1ra,"Generally you would upload to a staging table just to get the data into the database, then have the database itself handle upserts/merges.The database has to run the logic for the upsert anyway, so polars is just doing the upload portion. Breaking it into two distinct steps allows the database to first have a copy of the data that it has statistics about, and can do it as a single bulk operation. You also have the option of creating an index on the staging table before the merge, which could help that process.Breaking it up into two steps also means that once the data is uploaded, you don't need to run your local compute process anymore, and you aren't susceptible to the process failing if you have issues with your local processing, the network connection, or the merge. It is generally just more stable, and if it has an error you have a definite point the error occurred, and since the target table merge can be a single transaction, it is easy to rollback anything critical.Having your local data processing engine do a direct upload to a table lets it use whatever optimisations it has for the connection. If it has specific support for your database, it may make use of bulk operations in some way to speed up the process.Or, if you have a separate tool for bulk uploads, you write the data locally in a format suitable for that, push to a staging table with that tool, then merge with a database script or procedure.SQLAlchemy may be able to help with the database SQL script to integrate from the staging table to the target table.",Anxious-Setting-9186,2025-07-03 00:58:46,3,dataengineering,t3_1lpxdy8,False,

Protobuf is backwards/forwards compatible, and it doesn't care about the field name only its integer ID.

You could create a new column that defaults to values from the old one. For example in ClickHouse you could do this: CREATE TABLE example ( old_name String, new_name String DEFAULT old_name ) This effectively creates an alias for the same field (at the cost of duplicated storage), and you can then slowly deprecate the old field at your leisure.

As a contractor, you have to pay the employer component of a number of taxes and other contributions, see below.Unlike full time employees, you are also taking on the significant risk of your contact not getting renewed at the drop of a hat. Contractors are always cut first when projects are completed or budgets get tight. Btw once there, don't let them death-march you to the finish line while only paying 40 hours per week with a promise that ""it gets better when we're done"". They will cut you off without remorse, I've seen it myself. That risk needs to get paid to reimburse you for any gaps between contracts spent looking for a new one.All this to say it is customary for contractors  to charge significantly more per hour than a full time employee, between 50% and 100% more.This recruiter is trying to pull a fast one on you because they sensed your lack of knowledge. Consider yourself informed, and use chat gpt to give you a professional phrase to let them know that you are aware that they are full of shit.

The merge key column is null fir these. Then I merge and update based on merge key = primary key and update the end date to close the old record and on the insert clause I insert everything from the second set.  This includes records with new keys and the latest version of records with existing keys.  So when the merge key is matched then update and when it's null then insert.  You build the rows you want to insert and update in the selects in using clause.  Hope that makes sense.",Gators1992,2025-07-02 18:40:44,5,dataengineering,t3_1lq26dn,False,

Retain the original address string, regex the zipcode out (there's probably one some mad bastard wrote out there) into the zipcode column, take the rest of the string and dump it out into the street address column. You now have three columns: `original_address`, `street_address`, `zip_code`.

n0zozp7,"> Data: Tables with rows containing fields like line_of_business, premium_amount, effective_date, etc. • Goal: Enable a system (LLM + retriever) to answer questions like: “What are the policies with increasing premium trends in commercial lines over the past 3 years?”If you want LLM to answer questions like this, you need to provide detailed (domain-specific and dataset-specific) instructions how LLM can achieve the desired result in the prompt. Even with these instructions and all necessary context, LLM may fail to generate response you expect for questions like this.This may sound a bit weird, but if you have limited number of questions like this, it makes sense to prepare a report (pivot table?) that answers on the question *precisely*. If you want to encourage end users to ask their own questions - which means creation of their own new reports - first of all you need to configure a data model (cube?) that contains all necessary dimensions and measures needed to answer on these questions.Taking into account *realistic* capabilities of modern LLMs, it makes sense to offer end users 2 kinds of prompts:* ""Ask question"" in the context of the concrete data model (facts + dimensions). LLM gets in the context lists of the available dimensions, measures, filters + instructions and maybe even low-cardinality dimension values. Result is a tabular report configuration (pivot table or flat table) with filters, which can answer on user's question.* ""Ask question"" in the context of the concrete report data. LLM gets in the context report's table data (which is reasonably sized and not is too large for LLMs context window), possibly with supporting instructions. This is a kind of assistance with data interpretation, instead of analyzing values in table users can simply ask smth like ""what is the best client by premium"" - and get an answer if this report has calculated premium values by clients.Technically, with tools calling these 2 steps may be combined (LLM can compose a report, then load report's data, and give an answer), however this significantly increases a risk of wrong numbers in LLM response. In BI it is very important to get *right* numbers (not just maybe-yes-maybe-no numbers), so it is better to offer simpler but more reliable LLM-based functions.This is how we implemented LLM-based functions into our BI tool recently, based on feedback from real users.

The ""terminal"" (or terminal emulator/tty/console) is the actual thing that you see on your screen that you can click and type in, and see characters on. Underneath that is the ""shell,"" which is software that knows how to take character sequences and interpret it as commands, and can then run those commands. If you type ""ls"" and hit enter, the terminal is what shows you what you just typed and the results, while the shell is the thing that was able to locate the ""ls"" command and run it. You can interchangeably use any terminal (e.g. iterm, konsole, ptyxis, ghostty, kitty) with any shell (e.g. sh, bash, fish, zsh, nushell).SSH, ""Secure SHell,"" is an encrypted server-client protocol for communicating with a shell on another machine. You still use the same terminal emulator locally, you still type in your commands and see the results. But behind that, instead of calling to a shell that's running on your machine (accessing your files, running your binaries, etc), you're sending all your keystrokes over the network to another box that has an SSH server running (called sshd). Then that SSH server acts sort-of like the terminal on that remote box, passing those keystrokes to the shell, which then runs commands on that machine (with their files, binaries, etc) and gives back the results.When devs say SSHing to another server, they really mean interacting with a shell\*\* on that server, from the comfort of their machine.\* I'm simplifying a bit.

X hobbits begin 'sick'. Each day, any healthy hobbit travels to visit another hobbit. If a healthy hobbit visits a sick hobbit, the healthy hobbit becomes sick. At the end of the day, all sick hobbits are removed. On average, how many hobbits will become sick?

Companies had rooms full of manuals, and you had to look up, or photocopy, or buy your own documentation to know the api, usage etc.Then HTML arrived, actually IBM had another online format, but very similar just before html. At any rate, people who used the online documentation were more productive than those still reliant on paper, the change happened and today no one even considers having a paper copy of documentation (seldom anyway). The old guys were like ""What you can't remember that api?"". They were soon out-produced by the newer guys.Next came stack overflow, and other question / answer assists, and productivity increased for those that used it. Soon, it was required knowledge if you wanted to be competitive. Again, old mentality guys said ""You don't already know that? You have to look it up?"". Again, outdistanced soon.I'm sure you get the pattern. AI is the next documentation tool. This time the ""example"" code it provides is even closer to what you need.

So in Python you expose a web server using something like Flask, which when queried with a web browser serves a file containing HTML depending on the route (path in browser) and method (GET, POST, etc). The advantage here is that you could use a template engine like Jinja2 to serve dynamic content. The old TurboGears framework (yes I'm that old), Flask, or Django are commonly used with python, PHP is another commonly used one using the Laravel framework for example.2. API driven, here you serve endpoints (routes) with a web server and various methods just like with the server side rendering but instead of serving HTML you serve some other machine readable media formats like JSON, JSON-RPC, XML, etc. You then combine the ""backend"" with a frontend website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that calls your backend routes and then utilises that data to change the front end.

This is not a modern recommended practice for several out-of-the-scope-of-this-discussion reasons but it's great for educational purposes. The idea is, you set up your web server to serve any given route by running this program and then sending the output to the client. Using this example, Python itself isn't handing HTTP requests, the web server is, and it's adding additional context that can be accessed through environment variables or even reading STDIN to handle posts, etc. Once you've got that, you can start doing more clever things, like mapping out endpoints and having the browser make asynchronous requests to those end points to dynamically update already-loaded pages.",InVultusSolis,2025-07-07 17:03:39,12,learnprogramming,t3_1ltr5uy,False,

n1gi5yi,"Having read some of the replies after this post, I think the repliers should have attempted to summarize what they think OP tried to say. When I see ""Agree"" or ""Disagree"", but they make similar points, then they have a different understanding of what they thought OP said.OK, so I'll start. I think OP believes learning a bunch of languages just to learn them is not good, at least, not at the start. Instead, pick a language, and begin solving problems, and not just learning how to write ""Hello, World"" in a dozen languages. OP did suggest that learning new languages didn't teach him more than Javascript did, but he admits that maybe some of that was failing to take a deeper dive in any of the languages.I don't think OP is saying every language is the same, but if s/he is saying that, I disagree.As an analogy, this is like saying, what's important about learning a spoken language is what you want to talk about, i.e., the ideas, and not the words you use (which depend on language), and yet, you can be well spoken in English and don't know how to say the same thoughts in another language.Why is it challenging? Natural languages like French or Japanese have a huge vocabulary compared to the syntax of a language. In particular, verb tenses are tricky for most. On top of that is learning the grammar, Is it subject-verb-object? Also, pronouncing words is really hard. Many non-Chinese speakers struggle with the tones in Chinese (assuming they don't also speak a tonal languages). On top of that, there are cultural differences, slang, whether to speak in complete sentences or to drop certain words, etc.Programming languages don't have that complexity. But to say they are all the same is also wrong. For example, if you know Javascript well, but tried to learn Prolog, you'd struggle trying to find equivalent concepts. Prolog is that different from Javascript.Having said that, I generally agree with the basic premise which is learn a language well enough to solve problems. Don't learn a bunch of languages early on, esp. superficially where you can't solve problems in any of them.My minor quibble is the language does matter, at least, to how you think about a solution. Doing OO programming where you create classes and objects differs from doing procedural programming where you don't do that. That also differs from doing functional programming. You need to adjust how you think about programming.

It is something so basic, that I would be wasting my time doing that. Knowing HTML is such a widespread thing, that it is not even anything to boast about.

New programmers often make things harder than they need to be on themselves, because they don't realize all of the tools that the language offers (and they try to write extra utilities themselves, or reach for code from the Internet or third-party packages, when the language already offers a helpful tool built-in).3. Just like how when you're at the gym, you don't do each exercise only once and move on to a new exercise, apply the same approach to coding. Once you get your code working, start over from a completely blank slate, and try to do it again. See if you can look up even a *little* less than you needed to look up last time, or if you run into a little bit fewer bugs than you did last time.

Well there a bunch of space before, a bunch of ""o"" in the middle and then we go to next line so the code become: for each line print_spaces(numbers of spaces) print_stars(numbers of o)Now can you do print\_spaces and print stars ? Well we just need to repeat the same stuff the specified number of time, something like: line = """" repeat for numbers of spaces line = line + "" "" repeat for numbers of o line = line + ""*"" print lineBut to be more concise, we could write as well: line = repeat("" "", number of spaces) + repeat(""o"", number of o) print linewhere repeat would repeat the string the number of time we want. That's not so different than line = "" "".repeat(number of spaces) + ""o"".repeat(number of o)or even: print "" "".repeat(number of spaces) + ""o"".repeat(number of o)Now how many number of stars we have per line ? From the solution it's: Math.floor((i * 2 - 1 - row) / 2)To really get it, we would need to understand what i and row are as well as floor. But you can likely come with you own way to count the spaces.From your pyramid, to me it look like there zero space on the bottom pyramid and 1 the one before, then 2, then 3. So it like the (max line number) - (current line number) - 1 So the whole for me would be for I in range(0, max_line - 1) num_spaces = I + 1 num_o = max_line - I - 1 print ("" "".repeat(num_spaces) + ""o"".repeat(num_o) or for I in range(0, max_line - 1) print ("" "".repeat(I+1) + ""o"".repeat(max_line - I - 1) Anyway, what I try to explain to you that you go step by step, trying to solve a complex problem by dividing it in smaller problems and solve each sub problem one at a time.It the same even for the Math.floor method you would normally have constructed it step by step.And yes maybe repeat was introduced too fast in their example of maybe, the Math.floor was not well introduced.

Because you've put that in quotation marks.Sadly creativity was always or has become almost a meme, because (as the other posts confirm indirectly) it sounds like some kind of superpower for almost anything, from programming and maths (""multiple way to solve a problem"") till songwriting and visual artwork (doesn't even need any argument for those...does it?).But actually creativity is something so abstract that one could write philosophical essays about it (no irony here). And in my experience most jobs, even the more intellectual ones (or maybe especially those) have the cliché that they give you freedom of how-to-do-this-task, no monotony but possibility to be even creative, and so on.My experience is that sure some people are lucky and get their visions and wishes related to their job satisfied and most things are as great as they expected, but that's unfortunately more exception than a rule...I studied chemistry for few years and how did I learn for maths, physics, chemistry modules etc.?

Still you want to achieve it, how you should do that?By doing certain activities, which you have to find out for yourself, what fits for you somehow, the newer and the more they differ from each other, the better. Just try things out you wanted to f.e.. You will gain experience, expand your conciousness (literally & still in a natural way), the more contrasts you can gather and experience, the better. Nothing is true, everything is permitted!And by automatically building new associative nodes & connections in your neural system / ""soul"" through this gathering of new experiences, by natural passive (""background-process""-)learning you will already make one step after the other on the way to more creativity.

n1rvq9h,"> [Code snippet of cool mathy looking formula]> ... I think I couldn't have discovered this answer myself. I don't think I would have written it that way either. But it's rarely (i.e. almost never) important to have the ""perfect mathematical solution"" to a given problem, even assuming one exists.For this particular problem, I would personally look at the pattern first. How many spaces do you need to print at each row, if the pyramid has a height of 4? Do it manually first in a text editor: 3, 2, 1, 0. Now, what if it has a height of 5? Manually in a text editor: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.Now do the same for how many ""o""s you need to print. That one is a little easier. It always starts at 1 and then it always advances by 2, to count out all the odd numbers until the pyramid is done: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ....So in this situation I would say that the ""goold ol' C-style for loop"" is easier to understand in this situation. Luckily JavaScript supports that style of loop: // Pretend that height comes from the user. let height = 4; // Starting out the pyramid with an initial \n so that it looks // nicer inside the JS Console. let pyramid = ""\n""; let ohs = 1; for (let spaces = height-1; spaces >= 0; spaces--, ohs += 2) { pyramid += "" "".repeat(spaces) + ""o"".repeat(ohs) + ""\n""; } console.log(pyramid);Some people won't like that style and will prefer a more ""functional"" or ""mathematically correct"" style. But at the end of the day your job is to solve whatever problem you have, in a way that is easy for you to understand and which is fast enough. The above solution is perhaps less ""elegant"" but it gets the job done and it's usually easier to debug code like that than to debug code which is too much in a functional ""mathematical"" style.",chaotic_thought,2025-07-07 08:15:48,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ltkhbx,False,

n1374vd,"I have the following ""algorithm"" for reading a programming book:Step 1. Read through the book ""leisurely"". This is somewhere in between skimming and reading in detail. In this phase, for example, I would make a mental note of technically heavy parts (e.g. code examples) but would not go through them meticulously or line by line.Step 2. Go through the book a second time and make a listing by chapter of what ""things"" need to be done to really study it. For example, which examples should be tried out. What additional exercises should be done. Questions that I have (which could be answered by writing a program, for example). Other ""what ifs"" that come to mind (e.g. what if I try Y instead of X in this example).After step 2 is done, then basically I have a sort of ""todo list"" of sorts for what I actually need to ""actively do"" to learn that material ""for realsies"".Step 3. Go through the list that I made in step 2 and actually do those things.Suffice it to say that ""Step 3"" is what takes the most time and it requires the most concentration. I've found that I can do either step 1 and step 2 in a variety of environments, for example, even on a bus -- but for step 3 I need to be focused, e.g. in a ""library"" type of environment (people around me are quiet and concentrating).For step 3 (""implementations"") I need to use a good development laptop or workstation to actually work on the problems that I assigned myself (sometimes I will draw stuff on paper as well, e.g. diagrams or organizational notes) or that were assigned from the book author. Step 3 is sometimes ""unfinishable"" for me in practice because I tend to write ""too many"" little experiments to myself, or in the course of doing them I realize that it's no longer worthwhile to do some of them. In practice, when I'm doing step 3 I will make a little ""checklist"" to keep progress:\[ \] (123) foo: Implement foo example from chapter\[ \] (146) bar: Implement bar example from chapter\[ \] (146) \*bar\_rvalref: // Can bar example be redone using rvalue references?\[ \] (146) \*\*cmdline\_calc: // Create a simple command-line calculator (e.g. calc 1 + 2 \* 8 should output 17). Output goes to stdout. Also accept ""\["" and ""\]"" as synonyms for ""("" and "")"" if it is not ambiguous. E.g. x\[5\] is unambiguously an array indexing operation, whereas 7 \* \[1 + 2\] is a grouping operation and equivalent to 7 \* (1 + 2).\[ \] (146) \*\*\*cmdline\_calc: // Modify the calculator so if given the switch --arm, then the calculator also outputs machine code that would perform the same calculation using ARM instructions (output instruction set: ARM v4T without using Thumb instructions). Run the resulting machine code output via QEMU and verify that the result calculated in the emulated machine is identical to the desktop version's output....In my notation I write the page number reference in parens, and I use a ""\*"" mark to mean ""it is a level-1, i.e. fairly easy exercise"", \*\* to mean it is a more involved exercise, and \*\*\* or more to mean it is an ""advanced"" exercise.The stuff after // is my explanations of what I want to do or experiment on; it can be somewhat vague because it is probably based on the example in the book so if I reread that part of the book, then what I wrote should make more sense.These ""checklists"" work fine on paper (in fact I prefer them not to be electronic), but for the actual ""stuff"" that I am doing it is mostly a program and is mostly electronic (i.e. I just create something in a text editor or IDE).

n1u1sv2,"You might want to learn some higher level compiled language like Go first. C is a bit unforgiving, it totally lets you shoot yourself in the foot and C++ lets you do the same, except that your entire leg is gone afterwards.Beware of any mention, that C++ and C# are just supersets of C. That might have been true very very early on, but both have diverged from C quite a bit, some things just work differently.Find a resource, that teaches C with a proper focus on how to write secure code, having to debug undefined Behaviour, memory leaks and segfaults is no fun if you just came from python. Personally I like the book ""Effective C"" by Robert C Seacord. Despite the name, (effective LANGUAGE usually means advanced in a lot of programming books) it is written for beginners, but it is well written, up to date and doesn't make stupid errors where the example code won't even compile (surprisingly common).Then, once you have a grip on the language, implement various algorithms, like the problems on [projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net), reading and processing some files, playing with raylib (since you came from gamedev with godot). The best way to learn C is writing programs in C, but they need to be small self contained things that compile cleanly and pass through valgrind cleanly. But most importantly, you need to understand various concepts of C first, otherwise the compiler will be like a girlfriend you forget to feed.If you have a sound understanding of computer science, you might read the K&R book, but it is written for seasoned programmers that just don't know C, yet. It is from a time when Programmers already went through college and might had a PhD or a Master at minimum, home computers and self-taught coders weren't really a thing yet.

Build 2-3 full stack projects that solve real world problems. Don’t just build your cookie cutter todo app. You should come up with an idea or a problem you’d like to solve in your own life, and then create an app around it. This alone will distinguish you from the masses that have the same generic todo app projects on their portfolios. You will stand out as a legitimate developer if you do this. Also, make sure the portfolio website you put your projects on looks great and professional.2.) Any time you write code - commit it to GitHub. You will want to put your GitHub link in your resume and portfolio website so that employers can go look at your code. Make sure you can explain what your code is doing during an interview.3.) Apply to 10-20 software development jobs a day. Curate your resume and cover letter to each job description (use GPT to speed up the process).4.) Network like hell on LinkedIn. Reach out to anyone and everyone who works at a company you’d like to work at. Ask them for 15 minutes of their time for an “informational interview” and at the end, politely ask them to refer you. Or reach out to recruiters directly. Show them your projects. 5.) If you land an interview - research their company and take a few days to build out a prototype app that is relevant to their company. Showcase it during your interview. This will make you stand out like no one else. It shows that you’re ambitious and will go the extra mile. 6.) Be proactive.

Worse comes to worse you meet some cool new people, best case you start getting tips.\- integrate your projects with the LLM companies APIs. Considering how popular these tools are in tech right now, you'll have a bit of an edge over people making boring boilerplate apps. If you want to be hired, working with these APIs will look good when you're demoing your work and show you're on the cutting edge.\- Don't let doomers discourage you. Tech is a very boom-bust industry. The dot-com bust didn't kill software development, the latest trends won't kill it either. Get good, show your passion and you'll stand out over a sea of apathetic grads who are just in it for the six-figure payday.\- Lastly, most importantly: only become a front-ender if you genuinely love it. Programming and software development are one of the best jobs in the world, but after a post-pandemic big tech hiring boom we're seeing massive layoffs and salaries are shrinking.

n164zfd,Flags are typically single bit values used to indicate something. It's an on or off signal. Sometimes it can be incorporated in a larger data structure such as a sign flag in signed integers.

n16kwbd,"A ""flag"" is just something that can be true or false, on or off, 1 or 0. A boolean is the most basic example of a flag, but there are alternatives. `SDL_Init` uses a technique where each individual bit in a larger block of data is used as a flagThis lets you group a load of related flags together in a compact block of memory. In the `SDL_Init` scenario, each bit (flag) corresponds to a subsystem you want to initialize.`SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO)` passes a collection of bits where everything is off (`0`) except for the one bit that corresponds to the video system, therefore signalling that is the only thing you want to initialize.The main advantage of using bit flags over booleans in scenarios like this is that it gives people using the library a very convenient way to specify a combination of flags they want to enable. You use the bitwise operator `|`. Setting two bits to ""on"" looks like this: SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO | SDL_INIT_AUDIO)There's a guide to bit flags and how they're used in SDL's API design here: https://www.studyplan.dev/intro-to-programming/bitwise-operators",okwg,2025-07-03 19:36:52,10,learnprogramming,t3_1lqwoem,False,

We could leave either flag out of the call, of course:```some_function_that_takes_flags(SAY_HELLO);```Now this function call only says hello.This way of using flags improves code readability compared to having multiple separate booleans as function params. It also enables extending the list of options very easily without having to go fix a thousand different calls to the said function.Hope this explains it.

And they can control anything that can make use of a condition, from a switch to a loop and in some languages, even a computation (eg in C++ you can use the false==0, true == 1 in a computation to zero out a term: its valid to say integer = 3\*x+2\*y + 42\*(x>0) ) to conditionally add either 0 or 42.

n218if7,"Sorry if this is not what you're looking for but here's a brief summary using C as an example because it is kinda the base and most other languages like java and python run by doing something with C.First, computers have CPUs, they are the things doing the instructions your code makes. Code and CPU instructions aren't a one to one mapping, the way a language works is it must be translated to CPU instructions. In the case of C the thing that does this is called a compiler. CPU instructions are whats known as binary code. Assembly language is a CPU specific programming language that takes CPU binary code and puts labels on specific binary strings that mean do this thing. For example ADD. CPUs also have access to registers, which just hold a few bytes of values, for example a 32 bit machine 4 bytes 64 8 bytes, etc. These registers are what the CPU uses to do math with. So ADD register1, register2 would take the sum of these two numbers and put it into register 1. Assembly is a 1:1 mapping with that architectures binary, meaning if you learn to understand it you can write code that tells the CPU exactly what to do. C is an abstraction on assembly, meaning that it let's you write code, the compiler does something, then you get an assembly file. For your use case you don't need to know how this file works, but the general theory is pretty simple, basically it builds a stack, which is just like a pile of variables, and the compiler writes the assembly in a way that instead of variable int x, it's base of the stack + 10 bytes or something. And that is how it knows where x lives. But again you don't need to know this right now. What you need to know is that when you compile C code, you get an executable, a file you can run directly in the command line, or just run like any other windows exe or other executable I forget the mac and linux extensions. You can do this in command line or depending on the code treat the executable like it's own app.Python is a little different. Python itself is a language built in C. Python does not compile into an executable, python is an executable. When you click run, all it does is the command python3 yourfilename.py. python3 is an assembly file that opens the file yourfilename.py, reads what you wrote, and then figures out what to do with the text and updates things accordingly. You CAN compile python, but it's not popular, not efficient and kinda weird.

As a developer, the single biggest proof of competence is the code you write in public - either through your own projects or contributing to the existing code bases. To everyone's surprise, many of tools we use are open source and have their source code publicly available. If they are active projects, then there would be a lot ""issues"" raised on their respective repository. Good projects will often tag these issues accordingly by technology and the level of expertise that is required to solve the particular issue. The easiest one could be as simple as changing a part in documentation. These contributions are incentives as well. You will find programs which encourage these open source contributions. Google Summer of Code (GSoC), Outreach, MLH to name a few. They require you to contribute to their selected organization, and then submit a proposal. If it is accepted - you get a 2-3 months internship with the company along with a generous stipend. You can actually go to GSoC's website, and find past companies- and filter them by a technology.

Maybe you're writing your own method like FindAll.

n1eum30,"In the example, yes the predicate isn't doing much. Aside from re-use, creating a predicate with a descriptive name helps others read and understand the code's intent. If you're reading code and you see a lambda that's x=>x.code == '18962' && x.Department == 45It's not clear what that's doing.

n1evc3g,"To add to what u/dmazzoni said, `Predicate` is just an alias for `Func`, a function that takes an argument `T` and returns a `bool`.You can write it as:```Func isGreaterThanTen = x => x >= 10;```And it will work.Another use for these is if you want to swap in a function depending on some logic.```Func isGreaterThanTen = x => x >= 5;Func isGreaterThanFive = x => x >= 10;Func filter = someCondition ? isGreaterThanTen : isGreaterThanFive;List higherThanTen = numbers.FindAll(filter);foreach (int number in higherThanTen){ Console.WriteLine(number);}```And these come in handy when dealing with methods that do things to a similar set of arguments, and have some sort of controlling input.You can assign class methods to Funcs if the type arguments match. Note that the last type argument of a `Func` is the return type. So `Func` matches a method `SomeOutput MethodName(SomeObject arg)`So instead of multiple ifs or switch statements, you can do something like this:```Dictionary> handlers;void Init(){ handlers.Add(""A"", HandlerA); handlers.Add(""B"", HandlerB);}void Handle(string value){ if(handlers.TryGet(value, out var handler)) { var output = handler(input) } throw new ArgumentOrOfRangeException(nameof(value));}private SomeOutput HandlerA(SomeObject value){ // Do something for for value A...}private SomeOutput HandlerB(SomeObject value){ // Do something for for value B...}```",rupertavery,2025-07-05 03:05:22,1,learnprogramming,t3_1lrzkl0,False,

I have heard ""you're good for a physicist"" so many times, but I actually take it as a compliment. Most physicists don't care and want to make a throw away program. That's fine but if you want to learn how to make software that lasts longer than a single day, you obviously need to do something very different. I never really learned that systematically, I just kinda wanted to write stuff that was useful later, so I just naively tried to structure things more cleanly. I spent lots of time reading tutorials, reddit, other peoples code and whatnot. I did read ""Clean Code"" a year or so ago, and I thought it was ok but much is learned by trial and error, writing lots of bad code, rewriting it slightly better, changing the scope, trashing it again, and so on. Practice, practice, practice. And build nontrivial things, not just toy programs. If programs get big, you MUST apply some structure.

A significant part of our job is process/red-tape. At startups, process/red-tape can be straight up non-existant. You're lucky if you end up at a startup that has some halway decent dev processes in place.But at a large company, process is key. There are very strict best practices in place. There's very strict change management, very strict approvals, very strict boundaries of responsibility, etc, etc, etc. They're simply too large to let devs just cowboy code some stuff into prod that gets introduced to their millions of users right away. They also have internal and external audits to think about, where they're straight up auditing *the process*. If your processes aren't good, you're going to fail an audit, and failing an external audit can have a significant negative impact on the company and its clients.All companies will feel slow compared to startups. Not just big tech. Startups are trying to get their code and product out into the world as fast as humanly possible. It's like Facebook's old mantra (which they've since ditched) ""Move Fast and Break Things"". Who cares if what you released into prod broke something? You'll have a patch up in 10 minutes.Established companies are more focused on keeping things stable, not distrupting their user base, staying in compliance with all the many compliance/regulations/frameworks they need to abide to to make their customers feel warm and fuzzy inside. A short downtime can easily lose 6-7 figures for them, whereas a startup DGAF about downtime. The benefit of releasing code quickly outweights whatever negative would come from prod issues.One thing that will be very valuable for *you* from a career-growth perspective is seeing what heavy-process looks like. Look at what this company is doing, how it differs from the startup world, what the pros/cons are, etc. That gives you multiple perspectives to view any given problem from in the future.

It touches how we roll our lives on the big picture.As humans, our likes change over time, **and this is completely fine.**Oh gosh, if only you knew how cruel it is to realize for the first time you dont like to do that activity anymore that just a couple of years ago you could do with your hands tied. Did you lose yourself somewhere?Answer: no. Actually, you still like to do it, you just dont have that blasting flame anymore, and its ok. You cant lose yourself, because you *are* yourself. But you have to know that yourself is not static, it will change. And so will you. So now, you can bang your head against the wall wondering why you are no longer the person you were 10 years ago, or you can recognize that you may have changed, and if that is the case, welcome this change with open arms. After all, this is still you. Why reject it?But I understand that everything may still feel blurry to you, as it is often the case when we have ourselves facing such big changes. So maybe you're best off waiting before moving. You know the saying, la nuit porte conseil. In your case, you may need many nuits. You already gave a BIG step: acknowledging that you may be changing. Now, give time to time, to see how this will unfold. Maybe it's just a phase. Maybe not, and you need time for your mind to recognize the change, to stick to it, to decide that you you want to live by it from now on, and to be able to justify itself to you, so that when you ask yourself why you changed, it can reassure you that you did it because it felt better that way.In any case, dont rush to find it out. A definitive position will click when you least expect. And if its just a phase, well, I think you know how to go on with your life then.If its not, remember you will feel 'empty' during some time during the transition, and this is a part of the process. Transitioning can take longer than you expect, but profit from every moment. Do things you wouldnt do in other times, and remember something really cool awaits you.

You can learn the basics of many languages quickly, but actual fluency can take years, especially if you want to read and write Mandarin. In terms of professional development and career payoff, the ROI relative to effort is very low. You could learn several new tech stacks well in the time it would take you to learn Mandarin.3. The tech industry works primarily in English. One of my former employers had teams in China and Portugal that I worked closely with and it wasn't uncommon for them to discuss technical problems in English.I speak several languages to a relatively high degree of fluency and, while it's a great hobby for personal growth, the payoff is really poor for career opportunities.

You're not wasting that time, you're getting 6 months of work experience which will be invaluable on your resume.Sure, internships are supposed to be chances for you to learn, and it sounds like they're just throwing you in the deep end and expecting you to learn to swim.

That's what this internship is about, helping you to get a job in the future.Experience like this should be pretty easy to spin as a major positive on your resume and during interviews. ""I was expected to write the entire implementation plan for the frontend build"" is a major accomplishment to talk about. As an intern, you were working independently and delivering work that benefitted the company. You wrote git issues yourself, getting experience in stuff that a lot of early-career full time SWE's don't. You don't need to go into details about the delays in code reviews, instead you can just emphasize that there *were* code reviews (sometimes). Being left to figure things out demonstrates that you have the ability to learn quickly and independently, and apply those learnings in a real work environment. That's a *major* green flag for a future employer.Even if you don't spin anything, the internship is still worth its weight in gold simply because it's professional work experience with a real company.

Don't rely on a calculator to tell you that you need to earn $X. Living in a big city is inherently different than living in the burbs. Those calculators try to project what it would cost for you to buy a 2-3 BR house in the middle of the city, which is obviously millions. But in reality, nobody living in the city is buying a 2-3 BR house. They're buying a 0-1BR condo. It's an inherent difference in lifestyle. Calculators don't take that into account. They're also not great at taking into account neighborhoods. If you want to live frugally, you can absolutely find neighborhoods that are cheaper. If you want to live extravagently, you can absolutely find neighborhoods for that too. Calculators just average out an entire city, as if there aren't 100 neighborhoods within that city each with their own COL and culture.Compute the COL difference on your own. When I moved from the Midwest to the East Coast, I actually looked for apartments that were in an area I wanted to live in.

If you're expected to push through the burn out or get pipped out, you may want to start looking for a job with better wlb and take the pay cut. There's only a special type of person that can go ham literally 100% of the time.But, if you are already in a position where you can decide to put up some boundaries when needed then you NEED to do it asap. For now: Since you are already burned out, you have to stop working at the end of the day AND learn how to turn off your work brain when you do. It is a skill and it takes practice. It's like meditation. When you catch yourself doing a work thought you need to intentionally and consciously think about something else. If that means you go do something else or change your physical location then that's what you do. You need to stop thinking about work in order to recover from work.Once youve already crossed over into being burned out, it may take some time (weeks or months depending on how bad the burnout is) for better boundaries to start making you feel better. But in my experience it does eventually happen. Just remember for the future that you need to be vigilant about the signs that you're working too much.

The best PMs I've worked with were the quiet ones who asked penetrating questions rather than the ones who dominated every room. At Slack, our most successful PM was an ex-engineer who would straight-up say, ""I don't know, let me find out"" in stakeholder meetings. That intellectual honesty built more trust than any amount of confident bullshitting ever could. Your dev background gives you a massive advantage because you actually understand what's possible and what's painful to build, which is surprisingly rare. Own that art/writing gap. It shows you think differently and have a broader perspective on user experience and storytelling, both crucial for PM work. The buzzword thing is spot-on; the best PMs translate complex ideas into simple language that engineers, designers, and executives all understand differently. If you want to level up your PM knowledge systematically, Product Alliance has some of the most comprehensive interview prep and frameworks I've seen. Their modules cover everything from product sense to execution and they're particularly strong on teaching you how to structure your thinking without relying on empty jargon. Don't fake being someone else.

You have just freed up a block of time you can use to do whatever you want instead of walking to the office and sitting in a bus. I usually use it to start my morning slow. I wake up, go take a shower, put on fresh clothes, go prepare a real breakfast, and then eventually get to work. No rush. I am trying to wake up a little easier and actually fit more into this. Like, if I am able to get up earlier than usual on the WFH days, I could probably get the right temperature for a quick run and bike ride before the usual routine.* I have time flexibility. If I wake up early and I don't feel like doing the full morning routine, I just do a minimal one, get to work early, and call it a day early. The only requirement we have for WFH days is that there are two small blocks of time (1-2 hours each) where you **must** be available to answer a call. As long as you are available to answer a call during those two blocks, nobody really cares how you organize your time.* Set boundaries with extreme precision. It's very easy both to overwork yourself and work through your lunch break, and do the opposite - just go do something else and take an extra long break that ends up biting you. I try to use timers and alarms.* If possible, I try to get out of the house right after work. Quick walk, going to some event or gathering with friends, run some errands, etc. I find it's beneficial if you ""simulate"" the same separation rituals you get from an office day, except they are not time completely thrown into the garbage, but time slots for things that are good for you, or tasks that you should make anyway.Extra goated golden bonus tip:* If I want to take a break, instead of just going to get a coffee and use my phone or talk to people a bit as I'd do in the office, I do a quick errands break. Like, I do a part of an house chore I need to make. Load up and unload the dishwasher, clean the kitchen, something like that. This has two benefits: 1) it keeps you active and away from your screen, which is the best way to get a break. 2), when done consistently, it frees up a surprising amount of free time.

n0w6er0,"Following, as this exact same scenario unfolded for me over the last 10 years of my career, as I moved towards team leadership. It seemed like it was worthwhile, as I really wanted to expand my horizons and I feel I'm valuable as a leader. The politics were very difficult, sometimes. The work piled up, as I was expected to be an IC sometimes, help other ICs, run a team, and help run a department. Meanwhile, the pay did not scale with the work, and in fact the job opportunities compared to IC opportunities were not as sustainable. This meant less jobs open, and lower salaries at the top end compared with other senior engineering positions. I feel that you have to find the right situation with a manager who can effectively protect your time and scope, so you aren't doing too much. You also need help, politically, so you're not swimming upstream against people more senior than yourself. Of course, you have to be pretty dedicated to doing a good job, on top of that. It's a lot. I do believe that there are probably thousands of successful engineering managers/leads, but I also believe that many are burned out or are burning out. Maybe if you feel excited, it's worth trying, but if you keep getting burned out, it's time to retreat back to the IC world. I'm honestly still trying to figure out what I'd do next.

n0y05rj,"I definitely felt like this when I stepped into a team lead role a year ago, the project was a mess, and I had to rally the team, get a plan going, and deliver in a couple of months.As I've had more time with the team, I've pushed the ownership of EPIC level tasks as far down as possible. Not everyone on my team has the skills to manage epic level work streams, but everyone is forced to try. Once you can delegate the work streams, the job then becomes about planning what those work streams will be, coordinating the various stakeholders, and inevitably dealing with whatever crisis comes up.When an engineer is under-performing, it's on them to ask for the help they need. With 8 people on the team, that's a lot of individual work to over see, and I imagine it'd be all consuming. Therefore, it's okay to look out for the engineers on your team, make sure they have the work streams they need for a good review, but you need to let them do the work and decide when they need help. I'll never be able to apply my own standards to under-performers, but to some extent doesn't it doesn't matter. If an engineer isn't a net benefit to the project, and I can't help them become one, I just involve management and we deal with it that way. Team lead is not a people management job: it's not command, but the soft power of influence.At least on my team, as a lead I try to focus on three things: planning, communication with other teams, and review of our execution. Most of my focus is on long term planning, and the sprint plans are basically up to the engineers. After all, the team lead is in a unique position of owning the outcome of the team, that all parts fit together and contribute to whatever goal management put you on. From that view, the single most important thing you can do is ensuring the project is going in the right direction.Doing a great job as a team lead, you'll essentially make yourself redundant.

n1tfr4e,"Congrats.Your first week is usually onboarding., depending on company you either talk to your manager to decide how you're first few weeks will look like or you take an onboarding course. It varies by company. But in the end there should be an onboarding of how to build, test, etc.Before any of that, your first day will likely be signing up for benefits (insurances), payroll, etc. This shoudl be the absolute first thing you do so you get your money in the bank and not through a check mailed to you.Get your W-4 completed (takes like 5 minutes tops). Im not a financial adviser in any way but if you get RSUs, i'd suggest having them take a certain amount extra per check to account for the RSUs when you start to get them. I got burned by this the fist time I got RSUs. Because tehy are considered bonus they are taxed differently so I ended up owing a good amount to the IRS my first year. Ideally I try to have them take 100 per check to account for that.Sign up for any 401k accounts too. Your future self will thank you later. Put as much as you think is fair, experts suggest 12-15% a year.As for the job. Your first week is usually onboarding and then you get small tasks and build up confidence in the code. Ask your manager when he expects you to start getting bigger tasks. If he/she says in 3 months, try to get ahead of everything. If they say that the first week they only expect you to run tests and build, try to get that doen within the first few days and then by thursday tell them you are done and if you can at least look at the first task to get an idea of where to start.Ask questions, dont be afraid to reach out to people. it's scary at first but passive devs are the ones that get booted. If you start doing it before your manager has to say it, your manager will thank you. Managers have so much on their plate so they love devs who they dont ahve to say anything to, they just trust the dev will always be ahead of the pack. So if your manager is hoping to get you a task after 3 months, try to be ready at the 2nd month. Better to have him tell you to slow down then having to tell you to hurry up. Edit: also just to add. To emphasive the dont be a passive dev, report what you do. You have to play a game to a certain level. I once had a seniro dev tell me that it is better to do 2 tasks and report it during stand up and create dialogue about it (take ove rthe screen and show results for example, ask questions about being stuck, etc) than it is to do 10 tasks and just make simple 1 comment about progress that doesnt create discussion. Being stuck on the same task that should've taken a few days, but you are just stuck for weeks and dont say anything in stand up is a huge turnoff. Also find a mentor or senior friend you can do work with at a certain point. Someone who will hype you up to the manager and you can work along side with. At a certain point if you can be the guy who gets name-called during stand up, that's a plus. Even in meetings wher eyou are not there.

If you have a PhD in Physics, you don't want to apply for jobs that are going to emphasize things you cannot bring to the table. So you don't want to apply for jobs where they're going to be looking for you to be a shallow generalist or a specialist in something you don't do.This is the trap people fall into - they see 500 jobs that they could technically do and apply to all of them.Instead, you want to focus on applying to the jobs where not only can someone with your background be successful, but really where almost only people with your type of background can be successful. Generally speaking, that is going to be companies working on solving things that aren't fully solved. Some people will call this R&D or research or innovation, but at its core you want to look for things that are not just standard, off-the-shelf solutions.What you want to avoid is generic ""entry level data scientist for Fortune 500 company training ML models"".Now, what can you do to enhance your resume:1. Make sure you cram Python hard. C++, C#, Java are all good too, and there might be some niche industries where other languages are relevant, but if you're blindly going to pick one, it needs to be Python, and you want to be able to show up as a very strong Python coder. 2. Make sure you cram SQL. It's not as critical as it once was, but you still need to make sure you are fairly competent with SQL: select, group by, inner/left/full/right joins, partition by/window functions, nested queries, and CTEs.3. Assuming you're looking into AI/ML: make sure you learn about/brush up on as many of the basics of ML: regression, classification, clustering, A/B testing, NLP. 4. If you want to go for maximum marketability and you have the time/ability to do so: either a) dive into some of the ""under the hood"" LLM stuff, or b) learn how to build LLM-powered applications. There's no easier path to getting a high paying job right now than being able to contribute to LLM stuff. And realistically, it's a new enough field that there should be plenty of room for someone with a Physics PhD to find an area within it where you can get yourself up to speed and be dangerous.",dfphd,2025-07-07 14:48:42,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1lttg8h,False,

Positions such as senoir data science frequently have hiring managers or recruiters who only look for experience in industry in the exact right platforms and tools and dont consider anything in terms of applicable skill.Someone with a PhD isn't normally going to go straight to a Senior role unless their research experience is directly relevant to a specific industry.If I were you, I wouldn't be looking for Senior roles - I would be looking for entry level roles in highly competitive industries. Like, a Senior Data Scientist at some middle tier tech company is probably making less money than an entry level data scientist at a hedge fund, top tier tech company, cutting edge startup with lots of money, etc.So again, don't think ""well, I'm smart enough to be able to do something as well as a more senior data scientist who *doesnt'* have a PhD"", because not only is that not right (experience in industry matters), but also hiring managers won't agree with you.Instead, I would look for jobs where you can say ""typical entry-level data scientist with a BS in CS could not handle this"", and those are the jobs you want to apply for.

n21bf5p,"My situation is a little different from yours, only having done SDET / SET roles for \~10yr, but my general thoughts are:\* Most companies have an ebb and flow cycle where they believe in SWEs doing their own testing, finding that doesn't work, hiring SDET/SET, and then going back to SWE testing. I think we're leaning towards the SWEs doing their own testing part of the cycle at the moment because people are being pushed to wear multiple hats with the job market as it is\* Having QA-related roles on your resume can be very polarizing. Some managers believe that to be a huge plus, especially if you ever go back to SWE, because that indicates that you will test your own code along the way, and take testing into consideration when you plan anything. Others think that a SDET/SET is unable to code as well since they do QA along with other work. It's hard to say. \* One more thing that comes to mind is that most places that have dedicated QA generally operate on inflexible timelines. If you're burning out, having those kind of hard deadlines (which can be hard to meet due to a whole host of reasons) might not be as pleasant as you expect.All that being said, and noting that a lot of that sounds negative, I personally enjoy it. Places that value quality will value the fact that you're bringing in perspective about testing that is often overlooked, especially when you're bringing these discussions to the table early instead of as an afterthought. I have been seeing some roles pop up on LinkedIn and otherwise, so I'd like to believe that as hiring picks up more of those roles will open up as companies flow back to having to build up quality around projects that have had minimal testing..",Spokenlore,2025-07-08 18:58:38,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1luwr1b,False,

Stanford’s Knight Hennessy scholarship for MS in Comptuer Science2. maybe Princeton’s very difficult admissions thesis trackedEveryone else usually do part time masters coz cheap and somewhat flexible.",zninjamonkey,2025-07-04 15:41:46,8,cscareerquestions,t3_1lrlnjq,False,
n1c338u,"What do you want to do in AI/ML? If you want to develop AI/ML algorithms at someplace like OpenAI or Google DeepMind, no, you will likely need a PhD level understanding. If you want to know how to use or implement AI/ML, a masters could be a good fit.All that said, a Masters degree is a terrible way to keep up with the latest developments in any tech field. Creating an academic class is a lot of work. At a minimum, the syllabus is set at the beginning of the semester. In a fast moving field, that is plenty of time to get behind. In reality, courses are written and then used for several years, so you’re probably years away from the cutting edge. Working with it in the field is by far the best way to keep up.It sounds like what you’re actually after is an excuse to leave employment.",Rolex_throwaway,2025-07-04 17:01:59,7,cscareerquestions,t3_1lrlnjq,False,

n1difly,"Everyone is going to tell you something different and biased. Here's some perspective. It comes down to what you want out of it,.the actual program offered by the uni and the industry where you live.If you want to be creating new AI / ML algorithms or pushing the boundary further (effectively research) - most of those jobs exist in US / Europe (if you aren't there) and require PhD level research experience and significant output in research. It's also an intersection of computer science and maths. Most people here are more theoretically maths/stats heavy. Think advanced stochastic theory, measure theory, etc.If you want to be.in the camp of majority of people here / software engineers that want to be implementing, building, or having sufficient conceptual knowledge around AI / ML - then you can get it from any combination of uni, self study, work and practical experience.Most unis offering these programs are masters by coursework. Some might have a small thesis component or project at the end. A masters by coursework is just units/subjects similar to your undergraduate. Most people take them to shift into a new field. A master by research is for those considering dipping their toes in research - effectively ""create new body of knowledge and how to build on others research"". It's more likely for someone to upgrade their masters by research to a PhD. They are two different purposes.For your situation - You could consider a masters coursework and supplement it with practical experience and self study. The industry moves fast and you still won't learn things that people talk about now that trendy like mcp, ai agents, LLM, rag, all those tools people talk about like cursor / Claude etc. These are just implementations / practical applications and they will change quick, some will be adopted and accepted and other dropped.The masters program would be useful if you need a planned study program and if you wanted theoretical foundation that underpin AI (provided the uni program unit) such as statistical learning, machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning Bayesian theory... How hopfield neutral networks work , Monte Carlo etc work. Remember ML / AI is actually intersection of CS and Maths. So when you pick a uni program, make sure it has a balance of CS and Stats. If you really wanted to go deeper, your maths level will need to go deeper.",neuralhatch,2025-07-04 21:36:37,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1lrlnjq,False,

No University can honestly make a curriculum on it without being a fraud.By the time you study it deeeeeeep on Google, watch conferences and other stuff and really practice working with it, you will already have more EXPERIENCE with AI and ML than a Masters could ever get you, you will likely have a few projects, be able to get a job and be free of a student loan.Not that many places care about a Masters degree anymore.

n1ci7hp,"This gets asked like every other day, forget five years ago.ML is definitely ""saturated"", which means you should not pursue it because you think it'll make it easy to get a job, ""future proof"" your career or to make a quick buck (well, you can probably do the latter taking VC money for your ""AI"" company that's really a GPT wrapper). Are new masters graduates who actually like doing ML getting jobs? Absolutely. They do need to be from a ""top"" university, however. (PhD hiring is, as ever, less prestige-obsessed, but it's still pretty bad.)The tricky part for you is your level of experience. The typical ML masters new grad has 0-2 years of experience and should expect to be busted down to entry level. You should expect that, too, just with a faster promotion path.

n12wtv5,"Hey man.. Honestly, you're in a way better position than you think. QA automation and cybersecurity are actually huge advantages when transitioning to dev roles, not setbacks.The QA automation experience gives you testing mindset which most devs lack. You understand how to break code and think about edge cases. That's gold. Plus you've already written automation scripts so you're coding.Cybersecurity is even more valuable now. Every company needs devs who understand security, and with all the data breaches happening, having that background makes you stand out big time. You'll be the dev who actually knows about secure coding practices. At Metana we've had students transition from all kinds of backgrounds. QA, cybersecurity, even completely different fields. The key is showing you can build stuff and solve problems, which you're already doing.My advice would be to take the cybersecurity program but keep building projects on the side. Maybe focus on security-focused applications or tools. That way you're combining both skill sets and will be way more valuable than a regular dev. Also don't stress about being ""behind"". You're creating a unique skill combination that most devs don't have.
