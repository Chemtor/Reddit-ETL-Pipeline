You can take the same code and run it in something super lightweight and then scale it out to a huge cluster. No need to change processing engines.I can see more being built around duckdb for the same purpose.I've seen someone benchmark running daft distributed within a databricks cluster and it being *faster*. That is you start up a Databricks cluster, install daft and ray, and you get better performance than the spark instances you're running alongside. At that point Databricks is just a glorified cluster manager and notebook provider.Spark is just too cumbersome and too awkard to deal with. It isn't suitable for small use-cases, and in very large ones it can be arcane to figure out what is going on. People just can't develop skills with it until they are working at a huge scale, so they get chucked in the deep end with issues.These new tools will let people get experience on their own machine, it will let DS and DA roles grapple with things directly, and let everyone get essentially the same experience when they work at scale.",Anxious-Setting-9186,2025-04-30 08:01:29,94,dataengineering,t3_1kb974e,False,

Its API is also completely unintuitive.Polars looks a lot better but at the end of the day it's still a DataFrame library and has the same problems as any other DataFrame library.Give me a SQL Database any day. You can process arbitrarily large datasets using a standard declarative syntax and not have to worry about running out of memory. DuckDB works well for single user / single node otherwise there is a plethora of other databases available if you need distributed processing or to share amongst multiple users.Spark is overkill for most situations and even for the situations it isn't overkill for you still have to question whether you actually want to deal with it. Its slow and bloated like anything JVM based.

mpvgbop,"Great post and reflections on your first year! Congrats if I must say so. It's genuinely good to see someone mapping out what they've learned with this much clarity, especially the enthusiasm for the core DE work – debugging, building, improving infrastructure. You've definitely hit on some crucial points that many take years to internalize.Things like focusing on pipeline resilience, code quality, and the importance of documentation are spot on. That’s the stuff that separates okay pipelines from robust, maintainable systems. The emphasis on CI/CD, templates, and understanding SQL fundamentals alongside frameworks like Spark/Pandas shows you're building a really well-rounded technical base. Keep that momentum going – the learning curve is steep, but you're clearly navigating it well.Just a couple of thoughts to add from experience:- You're right that physical presence can boost visibility and make ad-hoc collaboration easier, especially in certain environments or client-facing roles. However, it's worth developing the skills to achieve similar communication effectiveness and relationship building remotely. Mastering clear documentation (which you already value!), proactive updates, and strong asynchronous communication is vital, as many teams are distributed or hybrid. The core skill is effective collaboration, whatever the medium - so don't view remote work as inherently having fewer opportunities; it just requires different strengths.- Regarding DRY and OOP, I have no doubt they are good principles. Just remember the other side: sometimes abstracting too early or creating overly complex OOP structures can hurt readability more than duplicated code, especially for simpler tasks. Finding that balance between avoiding repetition and maintaining simplicity/clarity comes with practice. You're right to question when not to use OOP though!- You've got the right idea with watermarks and parameterization for the pipeline self-healing process. Also think about idempotency – ensuring your tasks can run multiple times with the same input and produce the same outcome. It’s key for reliable reruns and recovery. And as you mature your pipelines, layer in dedicated data quality testing on top of unit/integration tests.- Definitely keep that volunteering spirit intact to improve things. Just learn to balance it strategically cuz it's easy to get pulled into fixing everything legacy, so make sure those efforts align with broader team goals and don't consistently derail your primary project responsibilities.- This is more of a personal ick, but I generally don't emphasize too much on documenting the finer details of a codebase, since things change and us devs can spend more time documenting things instead of focusing on what matters to our stakeholders.Overall, your reflections show a great attitude and a solid understanding of what makes a good DE. You're focusing on the right areas – technical depth, process improvement, and collaboration. Keep learning, stay curious, and continue refining that craft. You're well on your way :)",t2rgus,2025-04-30 17:23:01,3,dataengineering,t3_1kbctlt,False,

mpvhytr,"Good for you. Vehemently disagree about the WFH. Honestly, DE is so backend, I would generally rather business users not come to me directly. And my experience with pre commit and linter has largely been negative. Documention is always extremely valuable. Consistent naming conventions and packages is critical. Our consultants did neither and it is a shit show. OOP can be helpful in some regards, but I'm with you that FP is more than sufficient for the bulk of jobs. OOP overcomplicates, makes debugging more difficult and time consuming, and is rather rigid. It's worth it if it is scalable, but if it takes the same level of effort to cram all the SQL and configs into an OOP approach as just coding it from scratch in FP, you might as well use FP. I'm coming up on my 1 year as well. My biggest lessons have been think in terms of frameworks (how can you organize your code, how can you automate or parameterize development, etc.), that you simply can't learn everything and delegation is critical, knowledge of the business data is extremely important, that InfoSec is a PITA, and think through things before implementing anything (nothing is ever as simple as it first seems).",BoringGuy0108,2025-04-30 17:30:49,1,dataengineering,t3_1kbctlt,False,

mpihmdl,"Create_map returns a column definition, not a dataframe. You can define columns without reference to dataframes, so you can make a list of column expressions *before* you work with the dataframes.edit: I shouldn't do this at 2am. ~~Your slice [] of the map column based on a key means spark is creating a column expressions mapping every key:value in mapping, then throwing it all away to pick a single key from the map.~~All of this requires communication between spark and pyspark, which takes time. When you do it 600 times it takes a while.Every time you chain dataframe defining functions pyspark calls out to spark to build a plan. Time spent on the plan increases exponentially as you have more steps as each step takes longer as it builds on the last. 600 dataframe definitions is a lot.Do the `json.loads` once for each mapping, not for each variable for each model. edit: I shouldn't do this at 2am. ~~Don't create a full map column just to select one key out of it, just get the value from the original mappings dict. Don't chain withColumn, generate all the column definitions into a list then do `df.select(""*"",*listofcols)`~~ edit: fixing 2am mistakes...Even though the key you pull from the map is the value in column 'v', you are parsing and defining the same map dtype column multiple times -- 150 times if it is the 10 models and 15 variables looping over the same 4 mappings. Think of the size and complexity of this query as it gets built out, where spark is generating 600 chained 'views' with hundreds of mapping objects, and every mapping gets used so cannot be discarded before processing.In pandas you don't have this because the mapping object is available in the same process directly and doesn't need to be duplicated data per row. It also processes the dataframe in full at each step, so it can discard any previously used map as it goes. Whereas spark can't access your dict directly and has lazy evaluation, so it has to 'remember' every single generation of every map field all at once when it finally runs, and will be duplicating the data into each row in its behind-the-scenes rdd.You want to only parse each model once, and only generate its map once, and reuse that. You also want to make a list of your output columns then use `.select()` on them all at once. To make the reuse explicit you can split it into two selects. df = some_input m = model original_colnames [c for c in df.columns] # parse the mappings once mapping_dicts = [json.loads(mp) for mp in mappings) # generate the mapping cols once mapping_cols = [ F.create_map([F.lit(k_or_v) for kv in mapping_dict.items()]).alias(f""map_{i}"") for i,mapping_dict in enumerate(mapping_dicts) ] # define all variable redirections through the map all together mapped_cols = [ F.col(""map_{i}"")[F.col(f""some_var_{v}"")].alias(f""new_{m}"") # something seems off here for v in variables for i in range(len(mapping_cols)) ] # generate new dataframe new_df = ( # define a dataframe with the mappings in a first step # (so you can easily view this df if you cut the code up) df.select( *original_colnames, *mapping_cols ) # use the defined maps to generate the output columns .select( *original_colnames, *mapped_cols ) ) return dfNote that you don't *have* to do this in two selects if you reuse the actual column objects, but then you can't as easily check the intermediate state with just the mappings available.",azirale,2025-04-28 17:11:34,11,dataengineering,t3_1k9wng3,False,

There's a quote about writing in general - ""Perfection is achieved, not when there is *nothing* more to add, but when there is *nothing left to take away*"". Giving someone 6 page CV isn't going to make them think ""this person is seriously experienced"" it's going to make them roll their eyes a bit.

There may be exceptions - maybe they were planning on also hiring someone junior and may contact you about that position - but that's kind of rare.Similarly for the ""there's no such thing as entry level in data engineering"" - that's someone trying to appear profound, but instead is frankly coming across as an unhelpful dick.If you're lacking experience try for internships, give Google's [Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) a shot, try to do some self-study and personal projects or find some open source project you can contribute to.

mq89jck,"I answered a similar question elsewhere, will recap: I've used most (all?) of them. I think they are in various stages of ""good"", it kind of depends on your use-case.For example, I actually build such a tool, [VerbaGPT.com](http://verbagpt.com/) My tool is focused on *data privacy*. Instead of web-based, users can download my tool to their machine, and then query their CSV, TXT, or SQL (MS-SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL) data. The LLM gets data schema (or parts of it that the user explicitly shares), but doesn't get access to actual data itself. There is also option for offline use with Ollama, but on-device LLMs aren't as good (but rapidly getting better!\*). My tool also provides a way/process to curate lots of context about databases, tables, columns, etc. - that helps with performance on complex or domain-specific uses.In contrast, other tools are easier to get started with since they are web-based. Downside being there is another vendor-in-the-middle that gets access to data. Very few have good support for SQL databases, and those that do are generally text-to-sql, instead of text-to-python. The difference being that with python you can do a lot more, like data modeling, analysis, visualizations etc.The State of Art (SOTA) feeds into what can be done with text-to-sql. With [VerbaGPT.com](http://VerbaGPT.com) my vision is that one day domain experts can ask questions in natural language, and get answers. This has two big assumptions. One is that LLMs are good enough to return accurate responses, every time. This isn't where SOTA is at currently, but getting closer. The second is that LLMs are good enough to understand and disambiguate ""user intent"". We have lots of work to do here. The net result is that I don't like auto-execution of code and getting responses in the chat window. I like ""human-in-the-loop"" approach today and for the near-term future, and that is how I designed VerbaGPT to function.It's a complicated landscape. I like the tool I built (I'm of course biased), even though it is less polished than some others. Other tools I like include DataLabs by DataCamp (though it became a tad glitchy lately, not sure why). Vanna ai is also something to look into. Databricks has done some neat stuff here as well (but can get expensive with lots of data and compute). \*offline processing example: [https://youtu.be/NNiNKOstP5o?si=xp3y1h3dk3JMPLLP](https://youtu.be/NNiNKOstP5o?si=xp3y1h3dk3JMPLLP)",VerbaGPT,2025-05-02 17:14:40,1,dataengineering,t3_1kawk1t,False,

mqk4z85,"In theory and in practice the skill sets overlap quite a bit.MLEs do data pipeline work mostly reluctantly (though not always!), since at least 70% of the work of machine learning in a real world setting is getting the data in a good spot for all of training, serving, and evaluation.At orgs which are more dysfunctional and where management doesn't clamp down on egos and attitudes and predefined notions of role scopes, the MLEs are able to sit around doing little while complaining about the data that they should be helping to engineer. Thus, many do not actually do much data engineering, funny enough, even though they should. Overall work quality does suffer for this, so don't run your data teams like this.At well run orgs the MLEs do data engineering and share ownership of pipelines with data engineers; DEs focus more on ops and moving data to different environments and MLEs focus on transforming data, though there aren't any hard lines, and human to human collaboration is necessary.It is unusual to move from DE to MLE, the reverse is a little more common. MLE is a more competitive title: mostly because it is sexier, more people want in, also pay tends to be higher because people assume it is more skilled (I really don't feel this way; median MLE has just superficial knowledge of a few concepts and a few Python APIs, but that's another topic for another day).

Would be curious actually about how this turns out.What I normally do is instead I will have my “source table” with all data that is partitioned yearly as my “cold” storage. I will then incrementally build another table that is just maybe 1 year or month worth of data partitioned by month or day as my “hot” storage. Yes I am duplicating data but the compute cost to query is significantly less. This is also very easy to do with dbt. Also cost of storage is cheap which is a big selling point of Apache Iceberg in the first place.Edit: And of course anyone who needs more data will accept that increased cost and simple go to the full history table.",teh_zeno,2025-05-04 09:10:14,4,dataengineering,t3_1kedne3,False,

You should then able to make changes to the original model to suit your own needs, and they've got something stable. It does mean you might have two materialisations, and you'll have two dependencies, but it might be worth it.You still might have a bit more going on with the source-replica styled tables. People might want a history of the data in there, for example, so you might still run raw staging copies, then produce 'latest' and 'full history' representations of the data. It generally isn't hard to do both, since the latter gets you the former, so you can make it a standard that every time you ingest a new source you create these representations to provide to anyone that needs it so they can get quick access.Later down the line you'll have to grapple with data governance issues, but in a small org it can be handled more directly.",azirale,2025-05-04 08:20:08,2,dataengineering,t3_1kdfzoi,False,

It doesn’t have to be automated. Ingest enough to have a couple of hour/days worth of data for your need and load that at once into snowflake.Now configure your first DBT project and make sure you are able to connect to snowflake using DBT debug command.Then clean and transform your raw data to something meaningful.Note that before you start the ingestion step you should know what’s the first thing you want to achieve. If you don’t this won’t work. Find something you want to know then find the data source for it, not the other way around. It’s always more fun to do something which have some value for you. Then work on testing you ingesting code and you transformation. Might be boring, but it’s a needed skill.Then focus on automation. Configure your airflow module and orchestrate you ingestion module on a schedule with your DBT transformation from a trigger when the ingestion for a specific partition is done.Then you can start looking into streaming.Configure your infrastructure (Kafka, or red pandas or what ever you want)Then modify your ingestion module so it send events instead of full set of data. For example if you were collecting all weather records from all country well don’t wait for the complete process to be finished, yield events as you consume them to your Kafka stream.Then configure your ingestion engine spark/flink/quix/bytewax and run some transformation on real time data.Then try to configure some threshold will would alert you in real time if xyz happen, if the temperature increase from x in the last hour.Then work on building beautiful dashboards.Then you can try to consolidate all pieces together.This is never a small project, and doing everything at once won’t bring you where you want.

And while PySpark is fine, unless you already feel very comfortable in SQL, I’d suggest devoting more time to it as that is the one language all Data Engineers need to know very well and you can even use it in PySpark. Also you may want to consider DuckDB as it could also just be an easier way to accomplish transforming your data.While NoSQL is definitely useful, it isn’t something I’d suggest anyone just getting started to even consider. Stick with CSV or even better, parquet.Also if you do BI, I’d suggest streamlit as it is Python based and they have free hosting to show off your project.Lastly and I know I’m being nit picky, but Scala isn’t dying, it is just the use cases where you need to use it over Python are only at massive scale.

I can't speak about building out a SaaS but I can tell you that I've been doing pretty well as a freelancer and the non financial reward of doing whatever you want has been the biggest perk of them all.So here how freelancing works: \- Small-Medium business who don't know a freelancer directly will go to Upwork. Yes it might be crowded but it's not as bad as many people say it is. I'm not saying this as Upwork is the best place but 90% of people don't have a strategy and endurance to figure out how the platform works. I actually landed Unilever as a client and did 3 projects with them through the platform as a data analyst.\- Large / corporates hire freelancers through recruiting firms. That's called contracting. Those project usually last 3-18 months and are almost always full-time. They are great to get started as a freelancer as they pay very well but you will depend on just one client.

In case 1 (copy on write) all the parquet files containing the deleted rows are rewritten in a new file to omit those rows, and then the metadata json files are updated to point at the new parquet files. In the second case (merge on read), a special metadata file called a deletion vector is written that identifies which rows in which parquet files to ignore on read. For performance, every so often you do the steps of the first method and produce rewritten compacted parquet files.

Appends of course happen with no data deletion. File organization is abstracted as well. Each table has a directory based on its name (or a location you assign).

mpj31lm,"I've won hackathons before. Best tip is to practice with an existing team, as a team, and do mock hackathons. If you know react, and what packages to download, you can build something in less than 12 hours. First 4 hours might be planning and reading the docs, 4 hours of sleep, 4 hours to clean up and submit. 12 hours of productive coding. We can break down the 12 hours even further if you want, but assume also each team member knows what they are doing and we can do it in parallel. Initialize the git repo, frontend, backend and database on local host with a decided framework. Database can be hosted on the cloud. Frontend is probably react, or vue, with tailwind css or bootstrap as the UI framework or use another one with copy and paste components. Backend can be flask or django, or if you want, ignore backend completely and just connect frontend to the database directly. (don't do this with real production code). (takes around 1-2 hours) Your team of four starts splitting up work. One or two guys start working on frontend with the UI framework. One guy working on util libraries and business logic as well as api and webhooks. Another guy working on the database. You may have a floater or a guy that finished early to do merges and resolving merge conflicts. (3-6 hours)Working in parallel will require constantly preplanning what tasks are important that have a lot of other tasks dependent on it and which tasks have a lot of dependencies itself. (but at this point you should be polishing up) (3-6 hours) Cloud hosting is quick and easy nowadays, should only take 1-2 hours. It might take a while to figure out the dockerfile and which cloud hosting platform will help the most.If you know what you are doing, and use existing open source frameworks and solutions, you can cut down the time spent writing boilerplate code and just focus on connecting API calls and endpoints. ----# Just a few tips 1. Already find your team of four and practice with them before the competition. Treat it like a war game if you want. Go into what if scenarios and try and build real projects together. 2. Look into the hackathons previous winners and losers from previous hackathons. Try and figure out how the judges pick the winners. Do the judges really care about ML technologies? or do they just care about fancy UI? Some judges care about how many microservices you used and/or how big your techstack us. Do a lot of preplanning to figure out what the judges like. 3. As the competition gets near, usually company names start appearing, judges names start appearing, as well as the challenge names. Do a lot of research on the companies and judges. If you wanna score points from a company, look into what API libraries they might want you to use. If you want to score points with a judges, and they are industry or professor, do a challenge that they can relate to. 4. Never rebuild the wheel. Use other people's code. Use open source frameworks and code from github.No hackathon winner will ever build their entire stack. The use frameworks and existing solutions. The only thing they will build themselves are the connections between the frontend and the backend as well as the business logic. 5. Add as much techstack and bloat as you can. Host it on a bunch of microservices, use OAuth, host it on the cloud. Add infinite horizontal scaling. Judges for some reason like that, even if it does nothing for your app. 6. The app doesn't even have to work. It only needs to seem like it works. --- Winning hackathons is a specific skill, and only some of it is transferable to actual industry. Over representing your app to judges probably isn't something you will do in industry, and hard coding stuff is probably something you won't do.

Lots a little fun facts you can repeat to sound smart at parties too which I appreciate from any book.... like how a committee inventing machines to calculate the necessary settings to aim anti-aircraft kinda just offhandedly invented the term ""digital"", humble beginnings for a word that defines the modern day.

My worry is that you don't know anywhere near what a developer job would encompass and it wouldn't be nowhere near as fun as personal projects. What I would possible do in your case is to extend and improve your current work by automation with code, and not just no-code tools, but actual coding as well.

In modern ISAs, you typically see cmp and jump instructions bundled in the same one, this would be executed faster than two instructions, but the jump offset addressing is usually smaller.How fast are those instructions? Well that would depend on the architecture, but I assume they are done in a cycle easily.Of course, if you don't need the IF, your program would obviously be faster, because you reduced the need for an extra instruction.But in reality, it shouldn't make it that much slower (remember one instruction only), but since IF is used to cover side cases, it'll obviously make your program bigger, how big you may ask? Depends on what the compiler optimizes the if to, it could be a branch with a link, it could be a skip, etc...If you're strictly testing loop scenarios, just think to yourself ""every time I run this loop, I am doing an additional instruction"" so if the loop is 8 instructions long, and one of them is the IF instruction, then yeah, it would make it somewhat slower.

Not overly comprehensive and could be great paired alongside Frontend Mentor for projects.\-Frontend Mentor is great for practice projects.\-The Odin Project is probably the most comprehensive resource for frontend online but its not for everyone. There is tons of reading and it takes much, much longer to complete than other souces. However, its up to date and really enforces the fundamentals. Might be best to choose another resource if your focus is backend though since this goes deeper into frontend than you'd probably need to know.\-FreeCodeCamp launched a new curriculum recently. I haven't tried it but it looks pretty good.Backend:\-Boot.dev is a newer resource that teaches backend fundamentals in a ""gameified"" learning experience where you earn XP from completing problems. Probably one of (if not the) best resource for learning general backend skills, my only gripe is their focus on Go. Go isn't as in demand as some other backend langauges, but they are launching a Typescript path soon for those who don't want to learn Go.\-Hyperskill is a lesser known resource where you get lots of hands-on practice. I used this website to learn Java and I can't recommend it enough. The projects are great and after every lesson you are given plenty of practice problems. The only downside is that its a little unclear when you should start on projects and some of the practice problems pull from content you haven't learned yet but other than that its a great platform that has integration with Jetbrains IDEs.\-The Odin Project also covers Node.js if you're interested in that. They also have a Ruby on Rails path but I wouldn't recommend it.\-Since you mentioned C#, I've heard good things about [https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/) although I haven't tried it myslef. Also Microsoft recently launched a full stack developer course on Coursera using C# for backend.Whether you want to learn frontend or backend first is really up to you, just make sure you apply your skills once you learn them with practice projects. The platforms I listed here are all really good about making you practice the skills you've learned. That's why I didn't recommend Udemy courses, because while there are some instructors that do a good job teaching, projects usually involve you just watching them code and copying what they do. I could see using Udemy for frontend paired with Frontend Mentor though, Colt Steele and Jonas Schmedtmann are probably your best bet for that. Also, I would avoid the full stack developer bootcamps on Udemy, since they are often just surface-level knowledge. Lastly, if you ever plan on getting a CS degree I would go with WGU.

Your best bet falls in Webdev and maybe cyber. Cyber you can get in to on your own by doing online courses and certifications but this is less programming and more just security information. Python is generally recommended for beginners. I would look at JS especially the fancy frameworks like next and react and some new one that came out that probably came out as I am typing this.

All those common things you do regularly. Use only C++, no cheating and using c-string tools or the string to cstring conversion.From there, I would master the vector class.

Just forget them for now. You can circle back later, but code without using any at all for a while. Iterators are OK to use. macros. Don't use them unless strictly necessary, like a debug tool to spew a line number. As with pointers, just don't go there for a while, get used to coding without them, and circle back later once the C is a bit of a distant memory and less of a habit.As you move forward, I would alternate a day to study c++ differences with a chapter or two on the deep topics. For example (literally!), the c++ for loop has a new twist, you can iterate over a container with loops that look like for(type &t : container) and t will advance through the elements of container, becoming each one in turn. If referenced, its the real value, if not, its a copy, and that is a big deal for performance and behaviors both, to get that & or not absolutely correct.

The problem is, I don’t know which one to choose, as I don't know much about them.""You start with the foundations that they all have in common. For example, regardless of whether you are doing full-stack web development in JavaScript, Machine Learning development in Python, DevOps scrips in bash, PowerShell, or Python, or red team cybersecurity penetration testing scripts in Python, you have to know how to code. First, you need to learn programming fundamentals like variables, integers, Strings, booleans, conditions, operators, loops, functions, etc. Then after that, you need to learn Object Oriented Programming (OOP) like classes, class inheritance (subclasses), interfaces, methods vs. functions, etc. At some point you should probably also take a class called ""discrete math"" that covers the math of logic (and, or, not, true, false, etc.). This class (in the University of Michigan course list): https://eecs203.github.io/eecs203.org/ Also, for most of those specialties, a Computer Networking class is also useful (note that this is a 400 level class, so students usually take it in their 4th year of undergraduate university studies): https://github.com/mosharaf/eecs489> ""Everyone says, 'Pick what interests you,' but that’s the thing—I like all of it, and it’s kinda confusing.""You don't have to pick a specialty in Computer Science right away. Look at the list at https://roadmap.sh/ and know you can be in university for years before deciding on a specialty. Sometimes you don't even make a conscious decision, life circumstances and availability end up deciding for you. Like I know one guy who graduated with a Computer Science degree but couldn't get a coding job but did land an on-premise server I.T. job, and then he ended up going that route and eventually managing/supervising a huge number of on-premise servers. Circumstances ended up choosing for him.> ""How can I try out these different fields for a small amount of time and figure out what I actually enjoy the most?""Maybe check out various subreddits, follow them, and eventually send professionals in those subreddits chat requests to ask them about their profession. To help me find subreddits, I start with a Reddit search and then use The Map of Reddit (Google ""Map of Reddit"", it's a website to help you find related or interconnected subreddits). For example, for Machine Learning there is r/MachineLearning and r/LearnMachineLearning , maybe r/DataScience . For experienced developers there is r/ExperiencedDevs . For backend developers there is r/backend . There is also r/fullstack , r/WebDev , and r/frontend .

Start with the foundations that multiple different professions in the tech industry have in common.

That being said, learning by doing is the best way to remember what you learned and to get a sense of how to apply it.

If not TDD just as an assist to get your debugger to hit while you're sorting out the quirks. If your shipping an SDK or package especially unit tests are important.I have a personal preference to dislike unit style tests for applications. My experience with them is that you end up with a lot of test cases, that's a lot of code to maintain. Most if it is repeated and exercising the same part of a function dozens of times. I often find unit tests that aren't testing anything at all, but rather validating assumptions of the language or platform, which is completely inappropriate and a waste of time. I've read plenty of great unit tests too, I've just grown exhausted pruning and curating them.What people don't often account for is that tests aren't just expensive to write, but they can be expensive to maintain too. Because of this, I prefer a smaller curated set of tests that cover larger scenarios than a 'code unit'. Not integration tests, but something that exercises the actual intent of the application as thoroughly as possible while not requiring real dependencies to be set up. Then I use a comprehensive monitoring solution to detect when edge cases occur in our production environment.Everything is a trade off.

I’d take a moment and get a stretch goal laid out of a project that incorporates these tools step at a time. Example: create a list with an “exit” or key search term. Then optimize your solution for a bigger data set. Lastly use a popular search algorithm (binary search for example) to implement for your solution. Did it decrease your run time? Can you do it in less lines of code? Optimization is one of the key tasks all scientists have to learn as they’re testing in the field. Don’t treat computer programming any different.

Unless your goal is to research new algorithms, then those are indeed all of the steps - and yet there's an enormous amount of nuance and complexity hidden there.1. Bring in the data - this part is easy if someone else has already done the hard work of collecting the data, but in many real-world scenarios the data hasn't been collected yet, so this might involve building apps, sites, custom tools, scrapers, whatever is necessary to collect the data for your particular application.2. Clean and prepare - this can be quite subtle and nuanced. If you accidentally bring in any features that are biased or correlated with the class you're trying to predict, your model will overfit and you might not realize it until months later when it fails to work in production.3. Call the class of algorithm and fit - this seems easy when all of your data fits in RAM, but once you start trying to train on hundreds of terabytes worth of data, this is no longer simple. Also, when you have to wait days to train instead of minutes or hours, it becomes far more important to figure out how to validate your approach on smaller subsets first before trying to train on everything.4. Predict - in most real-world scenarios you're not just calling predict once, you're trying to take that model and embed it into an app so that it can do real-time predictions.

mqgxrd3,"Hey exact same boat here, untreated ADHD, graduated in December from WGU and work full-time as a mobile diesel technician with an ever changing schedule. I hit it extremely hard with the job search and have only had two interviews first one for full-time junior dev, I bombed. Second one, was an internship at the same company, position got pulled because the current state of our economy. That really killed my motivation.After that I pretty much didn’t touch my laptop until about the middle of March, where there was the first local in person hackathon in my city. I signed up and started to get excited about programming again…and then extremely nervous, because up to that point I realized I got through the degree because the “thought process” & “project requirements” were given to me pretty much on a silver platter. With a mediocre grasp on the fundamentals and no real problem solving experience I didn’t want to look incompetent in front of people that were likely much younger and realistically more experienced than me. So, I went to roadmap.sh and started from the beginning with JavaScript. I got reacquainted with the basics and nuances and went to the event, I was in a group of 4, one took building out the frontend, ironically another guy was currently enrolled with WGU as well and he took the backend, the other was our pitch person and that left me as a floater to just help wherever I could. This was the absolute best position for me! the frontend was next.js/tailwind, backend was spring boot with a Postgres db. I remembered enough about the backend and how everything “worked” that I was able to help there anytime our backend guy got stuck or needed a break and was able to pickup right where he left off, having used typescript at WGU and refreshing my js knowledge I was able to figure out enough of next and tailwind to be helpful there too. This helped in a few ways. Building a fullstack app with stuff I hadn’t used and people I don’t even know in 48hrs showed me 1.) I knew more than I gave myself credit for and 2.) I’m capable and genuinely have a love for programming. We lost but since then I have been steadily keeping detailed notes on project ideas that pop in my head at any given time, so I can work through how to actually get started building them and make it a point to spend the downtimes at work to study, listen and consume tech related things and then when I get home in the evenings even if it’s something as simple as writing a function that does something trivial or solving a problem on codewars, I try and code at least something everyday to make it habit. So far I’ve been able to stay pretty consistent with that. Now that WGU has MSCS programs I’m planning to enroll for that to give me a tangible goal and something to work towards since I doubt the job market is going to turn around anytime soon and I want to gain additional skills in a structured way.I know most of the advice floating around is to network, grind leetcode, move cities, etc, but for some of us that isn’t a possibility at the moment and I say find some way for you that makes you excited to get home and build that project or learn that tech stack or concept and keep getting better a little at a time until you finally get the opportunity to make the career change!",AnteaterAvailable571,2025-05-04 01:57:17,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ke6ces,False,

Two weeks ago I got two offers and and accepted one as a Software Engineer without any professional experience. Here's the route I took:2 year technical college. This got me exposure to more programming concepts, experience working on a small team, and a small portfolio of a wide range of applications to pad out my resume without costing a fortune. The applications I ended up with werent fancy, but I put more work into them than I needed to and really tried to experiment where it was allowed.After graduating I started working on personal projects in my free time. I set up a homelab server to learn more about networking and security, and made some small applications that made my life easier both at home and at work. A few of my software solutions got adopted by my company for widespread use. I had fun doing these, but more importantly I was able to replace a lot of the academic work on my resume with these, and it gave me talking points when doing interviews.I'm not sure if I've just been lucky or not, but I haven't had to do any leetcode in any of my interviews. They have been way more interested in talking about the solutions I made, and the impact they've had. I spent a lot more time practicing talking points, terminology, and having a professional conversation because I'm bad at interviews. In the end I believe this helped set me apart, and I highly recommend spending some time explaining parts of your projects to someone (or even just to an AI).When you do start applying places, spend some time customizing each application for the job You'd be surprised how many people don't. Also, it helps to format any examples you give in STAR format. Some say it's outdated, but it helps keep things consice while effectively conveying impact.The market sucks, but some things don't change.

Try to find some pieces that'd work for several job advert types that seem common enough and that really interest you.That way you're projects are hyper-relevant and will help you stand out.Re: when to start applying, I'd say start as soon as you have those projects, start applying for junior roles when you 2-3 good portfolio pieces Re: Leetcode, I'd avoid (or at least not take more than casual approach to it) because (a) small companies or startups don't care about it (b) it's becoming less popular in bigger companies (Snapchat recently reported their stopping using it in interviews week)It's really not a good representation of coding, at least in my experience, in my 10 years, I've had to look at algorithms a handful of times.

mq4cc77,"I thought I knew the answer, but apparently I was rather off.  Here is Claude's responseI'll explain how physical memory is partitioned into blocks for contiguous memory allocation in operating systems.In contiguous memory allocation, physical memory is divided into fixed-size blocks or variable-size partitions that can be allocated to processes. Here's how it works:Physical memory is organized into addressable units (typically bytes), and the operating system manages this space by dividing it into partitions or blocks. When processes request memory, the OS allocates these blocks based on specific strategies.There are several approaches to partitioning memory:1. Fixed partitioning: Memory is divided into fixed-size blocks (like your example of 10 MB chunks). Each partition can hold exactly one process, even if the process doesn't need all the allocated space, which can lead to internal fragmentation.2. Variable partitioning: Memory is allocated exactly as requested by processes, resulting in variable-sized partitions. This reduces internal fragmentation but can lead to external fragmentation as processes terminate and free memory becomes scattered.For allocation, the operating system maintains data structures (typically tables) that track:- Which blocks are allocated or free- The size of each block- The process using each allocated blockWhen a process requests memory, the OS uses allocation algorithms such as:- First-fit: Allocate the first available block that's large enough- Best-fit: Allocate the smallest available block that's large enough- Worst-fit: Allocate the largest available blockThe actual implementation involves memory management units (MMUs) that translate logical addresses (used by processes) to physical addresses. These hardware components, along with operating system tables, handle the mapping between a process's address space and physical memory blocks.Modern systems use more sophisticated approaches like paging and segmentation rather than contiguous allocation, as they address many of the fragmentation issues.",mikeyj777,2025-05-02 01:08:17,-10,learnprogramming,t3_1kcor54,False,

mq7gz1x,"If you want to know ""how Docker works"", that can really be broken down into two separate questions:1. What Linux kernel features do you use, and how do you use them, to get the behaviors that we call ""containerization""?2. How is the Docker software organized and architected to use those features?I think question 1 is the more relevant one for what you're asking. [Part 8 of this presentation](https://container.training/intro-selfpaced.yml.html) (the ""Deep dive into container internals"" section) is the best self-contained overview that I know of. For more details, a good starting point would be to read all of the Linux kernel documentation and manpages about cgroups, namespaces, chroot, etc.The short version is: the Unix permission system has always provided some basic ability to ""isolate"" processes from each other, e.g. a process belonging to UID can't kill another process with a different UID. This is just enforced by the kernel doing permission checks on the appropriate syscalls. A more interesting example is the `chroot` syscall, which tells the kernel to change the ""apparent"" root directory for a process, so that it can't see or modify any files outside that root. Containerization is just ""chroot on steroids"" by telling the kernel to isolate process groups in various ways.Beyond that, the ""sharing"" of the kernel works in pretty much the same way that it does without containerization. When a process asks for memory, or the scheduler decides which process to run in a given time slice, the kernel makes the same kind of decision it always does -- except that it keeps track of some extra accounting information to enforce fairness and resource limits between ""containers"".Question 2 is a bit less technically interesting, but still somewhat important because it's useful to know where to look for the relevant source code if you really want to dig into the implementation. For instance, when you run a ""Docker container"", Docker is delegating the work to containerd, and containerd is invoking runc to actually start the container. So runc is where the actual relevant syscalls are made. You can see an overview of *what* runc is doing [here](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/blob/main/libcontainer/SPEC.md), and you can find more details of how it interacts with the rest of the system by reading the [OCI Runtime Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/v1.2.1/spec.md).",teraflop,2025-05-02 14:59:42,3,learnprogramming,t3_1kd20cs,False,

As opposed to giving them answers, or even lecturing / dumping similar solutions on them.If the change is as easy as you say, it should be super easy to sit with this dev for an hour and arrive at the solution together.

mpqfe9q,"I never went to a school as good as Berkeley and I'm not saying this is necessarily your problem since I don't know the full context, but from what I can tell -- there are some signs of my early mistakes so I'll elaborate in case it helps you out.Looking back at my early start -- the one trap that I fell into was having the ""smart kid"" syndrome. I would always compare other people's lows to my highs and was always surprised at the end result. That being, they ended up much further than I did at the end no matter how well they did e.g. GPA/knowledgeable they were about coding etc.In hindsight, my mentality contributed to two major detriments in my first job search:1 -- I unknowingly built a moat around myself and classmates who could've been a resource, ended up becoming competition or inaccessible instead. In your story, it sounds like you have plenty of classmates who got into F500 or FAANG, yet it sounds like you never reached out for help or built enough connections to avoid applying 400/600 times per cycle. Assuming you carry the same mindset of reducing a company to traits like “in the middle of nowhere,"" you might fall into the same trap of I did in evaluating everyone in a new environment as beneath you and not building the correct connections, or at least practicing, to get to where you want to go.One of my early jobs was in a small private company that I've never heard anyone mention in this sub in a random state in the South. From my time there, I knew a few data scientists and engineers who ended up going to great companies 2-3 years after their tenure to places such as LinkedIn, Meta, Paramount, etc. Had I went in with the same energy as I did in college, I would've never made friends and been able to reach out to them for help when it came to career advice or referrals. Instead of coming in with the expectation of getting something out of every interaction, I just became the person people want to work with -- be there for when they need help or talk about the project or life in general. All the ""small talk"" that you think is a waste of time makes you personable and they'll remember you when time comes.2 -- That mentality carries over into how you present yourself as a person and affects you in ways you probably didn't notice before. For me, it caused mismatched expectations and actually set me back from learning to my fullest potential. I always told myself that I should've gotten a better offer or shouldn't have struggled for as long as I did due to my capabilities; my worldview was shattered over and over again, once someone I deemed ""dumber"" got a more coveted position or had breezed through their job search. And this mentality doesn't really stop, there's always someone luckier or someone better than you in some way, that got an opportunity that you wanted and it looms in the back of your mind on every task that you do. I don't have much advice here aside from realization; getting hit with reality and coming to terms with having weaknesses in certain areas or unlucky in others actually helped me become open to learning a ton and that honest acceptance of my capabilities and circumstance got me more opportunities and help from others than I had gotten previously.Inadvertently this also helped in interviews and building connections, at least at the entry level as no interviewer or coworker wants to work with a new grad/mid-level with a pompous or fake persona even if they do mostly know their stuff. At the end of the day, we all want is someone human to work with and one of the most human traits you can exhibit in an interview is that you make mistakes, can learn and are competent/graceful enough to pivot with a team to come to a solution.",terrany,2025-04-29 21:38:22,49,cscareerquestions,t3_1kaya3g,False,

mpqevhk,"I'm at Amazon.There are a few qualifying questions I'd ask before giving a definitive answer:* What org?* Where is your team based? This is a biggie, because it's not uncommon for Amazon to hire people in one location and then tell them to move in 60-90 days or lose their job.* What's the ops load like?* What is the make-up of their team? How many L4's has your manager promoted? Are there opportunities for growth up to L6?* Where is your office? Is it Seattle or Bellevue? What's the rent situation like, and is Seattle somewhere you want to live for years? Transfers are tricky at Amazon since 2022, so you'd be waiting a while for L5 before you can transfer - and even then you'll be up against hundreds of others.* Do you want to join in what is essentially a new grad role, or would you prefer to wait and join as a new L5 in a few years? Amazon has started downlevelling people lately, and it really fucks with URA as you have some L4's with years of experience making newer engineers look bad (and eventually up for the chop). The ""hire to fire"" culture is also still there in some teams.Most importantly, if you choose to join Amazon you should have a contingency plan in place in case you end up in Focus/Pivot. Speak to your current boss and see what their boomerang policy is. If you can bounce back in a year, great! If two, even better! There's little to lose.At face value, I would say that joining as an ""experienced"" L4 isn't a great idea, unless you're going to drastically improve your income by joining Amazon. Even then, layoffs are still occurring, and PIP is always looming, so you might not even see that salary. If despite all the warnings you're still sold, absolutely go for it.

To be honest it was 3 years of alot of high expectations, micromanaging, a silent agreement to always be available and being compared to what teammates were doing even if you were technically meeting expectations of the position. Expect meetings on mettings on meetings and any cool design or Pr you put out, expect people to hold it back because they want to discuss why you used a for loop over a while loop. It will either make you or break you. Looking back, i dont regret being there as i got it out of my system and it showed me the grass isnt always greener. For the money i dont really regret it as i used that money to do bigger things. My mental healthy didnt deteriorate but it also didnt improve with the added stress. I lost my job in january and even though i hated being jobless i didnt miss it at all and i was able to get a new job within 3 months. If you think you can manage a few years of stressful work, little WLB, and the expectation you will always be available then i say go for it.

mpr2j64,"Do you know what team? This matters a lot. I'm assuming, since you're being hired at SDE I with < 1 YOE, that you'll get assigned to a random team like all New Grads do. Technically, you still qualify as a ""New Grad"".Whether this is the case or not, hear me out, you should take the Amazon offer, but keep your F500 job for the first month while you figure out if Amazon is the right place for you.Here's why:1. It is actually difficult to switch teams at Amazon. You will have to do a full loop and they may ask you for meaningful code reviews that you've authored. If you haven't been on the team for long OR if it's too ops heavy OR if there's just not enough scope, then HMs may not be interested in you.2. You might be a hire to fire. If you're put on focus, then you can't switch teams.3. Your manager/team/org might suck. If your manager isn't keen on your growth, then you won't get the scope to grow to the next level. You may also face issues if your team isn't balanced levels wise (e.g., no L6s or 0-2 L5s -> overworked L4s). EnderMB's comment is golden, esp ""What is the make-up of their team? How many L4's has your manager promoted? Are there opportunities for growth up to L6?""4. You might hate the work your team is doing (esp if you're randomly placed). You could be a frontend wiz, but get placed on a team working on compilers. Or your team might be a KTLO team where all you're doing is ops and bug fixes (zero feature work).Take PTO or a leave of absence from your F500 job, scope out Amazon, and then make your decision. Best Case: you're a great fit for your role at Amazon and you're happy. Worst Case: you have to leave Amazon and go back to your fully remote job.FWIW: I worked at Amazon as a new grad SDE I and fell into a team of no L6s, only 1 L5, and rest L4s. I had to put in over \~70 hrs per week to keep up with expectations. I burned out in 1 year and quit without having anything lined up. Luckily, the market was fire back then so I was able to take a few months off and get a job elsewhere.Amazon on your resume will open a lot of doors, but tread carefully.",rimscode,2025-04-29 23:44:45,7,cscareerquestions,t3_1kaxnw8,False,

mq81l4l,"This depends on a few things \* The kind of job search you're doing (fishing around for new offers with low information vs already knowing exactly what you want)\* The quality of the recruiter\* The job market that you're inMost of the time I would say no; in general I think it's best to have an idea of where you want to be and give that range for where you want to be. Ex. if you make $80,000 and want to make $100,000 tell them you want to make $100,000 to $160,000 (arbitrary ceiling chosen but give yourself a nice range) rather than you make $80,000. I don't think it's unreasonable to give SOME number, if your number is TOO low then it's possible you should have bolstered your position by understanding the market better (to be fair, sometimes difficult to do).However third-party recruiters don't just have the incentive to match you to multiple companies, they have the incentive to match you ASAP. That means if they're going to companies, they may be getting the cheapest offer just to line you up with a few offers and have you choose (if you are presented with 3 offers ranging from $85k to $95k it may also give the impression that is all companies in your area are willing to pay and cause you to commit early). This isn't always the case, but if you get a lazy recruiter, this is more likely.If you give them a target, they will more likely hunt against that target, in which case you're aligning their goals (getting you matched) with your goal (getting you matched at your target) which I think saves everyone some time in the long run (companies for whom you are out of their league won't bother, companies who are willing to pay more may be more inclined to be more competitive).Hope that provides some clarity.EDIT: I also generally don't like advice to never give a number, I think that's just lazy on the part of the candidate and can be wasteful of the time of the recruiter if they're following leads you would already know are not worth your time.

Example: exam is proctored online and must be done within 24 hours. Why not have teams of students where one goes first and feeds the questions to everyone else? This is obviously not a concern in a synchronous exam. I know for my online masters program, there’s a huge de-emphasis on testing, and I suspect it’s because it’s impossible to police. Instead, it’s a lot of research papers and deep dives, which can obviously be useful, but can also be a constant exercise in simply going back through course material to find the relevant topic and answering.

Then, tell HR what you need, with the right documentation, and let them decide. They don't really need to know the details of your condition, just that you are asking for certain things that are medically required. You might a little screwed right now, but if you lose a finger (or more), you'll be dealing with that consequence for the rest of your career.You're already on your way out of the company: that's what it means when your manager is forced to PIP you, it's a pretext for planned turnover, and it's very likely that no matter what you do, the manager will be forced to make another decision they might not agree with, since this is already going on at the company. I'd weight that pretty heavily in planning on what to do next.Also, you gave a small tell that your performance probably isn't as good as is expected or you might be misreading the situation: ""This was shocking, since one of those leads had publicly praised my work before, even in front of my current manager"".

Let the company deal with it.Your lead may not be incompetent, just cutting corners too much and is more focused on fast delivery rather than long term solutions.

Their hiring process prioritizes hackers over doing things properly.From your post it is evident you are very frustrated with the problems the team is facing, you even have ideas how to fix it, but you do not have competencies to make decisions.

mqiax4g,"I agree with the sentiment of most people that respond that it's an opportunity rather than a problem. The most important thing is that you get buy in from the right people that things need to change and they can be changed at least somewhat into the direction you propose:* Analayze the issues you're currently having* Find out what is the root cause of them* Figure out how you would fix them all, without rewriting* Then take the ones that have the highest impact for the least risk / effortOften you need to refactor in a few steps, where you first start separating all of the concerns into their own smaller and more testable ""containers"" while documenting and perhaps even adding test coverage, but don't change the actual code yet.In the job I did in the past year, I turned around a mobile app completely with this approach. Two examples:* The screens would load stuff like Account data every time they interacted with it * I built an Identity package that would authenticate and then fetch all of the user data, so it would always be available and up-to-date everywhere * I've added shims to all older code, that would simply return the right data from Identity rather than re-fetching, so I had a single source of truth without doing a full re-write * Then we ran an experiment to see if there were any issues * That was successful and we started to remove the old code * All new features are much easier to build already as they are now oblivious to the tech debt elsewhere* Navigation was a mess, wrongly structured and highly incidental code to make things work * Did an investigation of how ideal (SwiftUI-only) navigation would work * Then we would try to see how that would apply to our existing UIKit based navigation * We drew an API that would support both the current as well as the ideal future navigation stack * All navigation moved into this not very optimal yet but well-abstracted navigator * Now we started to swap around the wrongly architected parts in navigation without touching any of th screens, since it's well abstracted * In a few months we'll probably switch to SwiftUI based navigation, without impacting the app muchYou should always figure out what is the issue, how do you solve it, and what steps should you plan so you have a controllable level of risk at every step.Try to have a well structured plan and propose that to the people that overrule your lead, instead of relying on ad-hoc interventions.

It's not like your existing code is being depended on anyways.> For example, they install software dependencies during runtime.
