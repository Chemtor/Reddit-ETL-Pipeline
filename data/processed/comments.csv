However, the investments from the dbtLabs folks will almost certainly slow down or stop. Which means dbt may be staleware in a few years.2. **Necessity is the mother of invention.** The acquisition alone is reason to inspire others to build higher-level abstractions that don't inherit dbt's innate weaknesses. *(Does anyone really think dbt+Jinja was the ideal solution?)* The next generation of transformation solutions should accomplish more with less code, and with semantic metadata baked in.I've built three dbt clones in my career, two of which were *before* dbt itself launched, and one of which was successfully [patented](https://patents.google.com/patent/US10846284B1/en) during my time at Amazon AWS. I am eternally thankful to dbt because it was the first CI/CD-friendly transformation tool to reach critical market share. The dbt team proved to the world that ""transformations as code"" is viable and that data pipelines are not incompatible with SDLC best practices.The future has been changed for the better because dbt exists, but dbt is neither the only solution nor the best solution for the problems data engineers face today and tomorrow.There will be more and better solutions on the horizon. :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:",burnfearless,2025-10-14 00:55:55,17,dataengineering,t3_1o5q0ll,False,

Photon, catalyst, etc. won’t do it for you. There is an enormous amount of electricity and money burning out there in unoptimized Spark jobs, where a traditionals RDBMS SQL shop was convinced they can unlock 20% performance by just migrating to Databricks, whereas with a little investment they could achive 10x+ faster and more efficient jobs.

You'll learn by shipping stuff.1b - Yes learn DBT1c - Don't think about it just ship.2a - Get a solid, easy to expand ETL/ELT service going. Adding more data to your DW should be *easy*. When non-data people come to you with ""oh I wanted to see X data that's not on the DW"", you should be like ""oh I'll get it there for you"" and within a few bizdays it's there. Have an ELT/ETL layer that's simple and easy to expand, and this sort of interaction will happen.2b - You should be chilling in your spare time, you'll learn all you need by working on building the stuff that's just beyond what you can comfortably deliver right now. Progressive overload. Don't settle, but don't try to reach for the moon right away. Build yourself a ladder first.2c - Just build stuff, and when the subject come up you say you're learning data engineering on the fly, out of necessity.If you're doing any sort of data-related study in your spare time, I recommend the more theoretical, foundational stuff.

njr2uou,"You have an incredible opportunity ahead of you.1. if you have devops make friends RIGHT AWAY. If you don't consider how you want to manage Infrastructure in this new world you get to great my advice would be look at a reference architecture for a lake house on AWS. Ask your company to send you to re:Invent in December take hands onlabs for building data lakes (avoid any sales sessions just do hands on labs) you will come out with a better idea of what to do. Also take a BASIC terraform course. It will make everything better. It will be confusing at first but ChatGPT/Claude will get you most of the way there. AWS + Python gives you A LOT of options. IMO DBT is kinda shitty. SQL ETL's are ass, because you cannot really unit test these things effectively. Focus more on python (it will get you 90% of what you need for most use cases) look at serverless event driven architectures, less work less thinking long term but you need to monitor that shit and make sure the SPICE FLOWS! Postgres is fine. Your use cases determine your data persistence. If you don't have a lot of data don't over complicate shit use and RDBMS + Python, geter done.2. look back at 1. I personally don't think much of DEs that focused on DBT or Databricks they usually don't know much....sorry to say that but it's the truth. I want coders. I want people who understand distributed systems. I don't care if people know Redshift of Snowflake as long as they understand what those systems are...MPPs. That's abstracted from most DEs. It means Sr folks have to learn ya some shit about an MPP like redshift and snowflake both great infra but they cost and abstract aspects of what's going on under the hood. They are not a golden hammer. Look at the use cases. Postgres on aurora can bang out A LOT of DE use cases. Don't buy a destroyer class ship to manage bass fishing :Db. pyspark is a good thing to pick up. Understand when you want a python script v a pyspark script to run a job. Understand shit like Airflow and how you split compute from your orchestration layer. Airflow is not an ETL it's orchestration. ELT work and computer is done on other infra like an AWS lambda. As you go further focus on microservices, apis, event driven architectures stuff like that. c. AWS tools are legit DE tools you just gotta look at the right shit. Get a cursory understanding these AWS servies (timebox yourself to a few hours total here) EventBridge, Kinesis, Manage Ariflow, managed kafka, lambdas, glue, redshift. aurora(postgresql). Athena. You can solve pretty much all problems with these with out really managing much infra. I can count on one hand the number of times my serverless systems have died in production....AWS went down each time :D.....that was a long one DM me I am an old hand.

When making code changes, run the sample source data through your pipeline and verify that the output table still matches the contents of your csv of expected results.

nk2gmz0,"1. In the modern data world partitioning should be approached with the following mindset: read patterns (increasing read performance by partition pruning), data distribution i.e. your partitioning should make sense in terms of how you organize the data in files AND partitions (avoiding small files and data skew, but also creating enough optimal sized files so you can parallelize reading), and considering your deployment/compute sizing so you can actually take advantage of the things you can do in parallel and scale accordingly (again has to do with how you organize your data in files). Although partitioning is a tool you can also use to “group” and “label” your data, like you mentioned, - e.g. being able to reprocess a subset of your data based on a label (processing time) - I would discourage you from using it like this. You have other tools for this purpose that will not hurt performance in the long run. Use partitioning as intended: a tool to distribute your data to ensure performant reads and scalability.2. If you don’t need an immutable bronze data use a lakehouse format straight away like Iceberg and do updates/merge. Optimize for copy-on-write or merge-on-read based on the volume of your late or dupe data. Do proper table maintenance for healthy filesizes and valuable snapshots. (This equals to SCD type 1 btw)If you need the raw data, you can do CDC in an extra column or in a side table. Just like in a regular DWH. You trade downstream performance for history granularity. (This is SCD type 2+)Note: Iceberg/Delta/Hudi are gold because they bring SQL and data warehousing back to big data.3. Look at 1.For idempotency you can also implement watermarking or something with the snapshoting/tagging/branching features of your lakehouse format. This “metadata” can carry the same information that you want to implement with the “processing time” partitioning. These are all small things that can help you, but ultimately idempotency and deterministic behavior should be achieved on the data pipeline level with whatever tools you have.

And in my experience, most of the time when the business says it only wants the most recent version - they actually end up wanting different versions to answer questions like ""the customer is saying their numbers are different from ours - what could cause that? a different dimension value? can we see the one from march 31st?""Idempotency & deterministic behavior at scale isn't necessarily a big issue, but it may mean that features like auto-compacting without traceability are a challenge.",kenfar,2025-10-18 01:20:01,1,dataengineering,t3_1o9gfu5,False,

For dedup, stream into a silver table with a deterministic key: row\_number over (business\_key) order by event\_time desc, source\_version/offset desc, ingestion\_ts desc; keep a record\_hash to drop exact dupes fast.

From your BI tool's perspective this'll be as if there are denormalized tables, but when the tool queries these tables the view will be executed. * This works if your data is small, but it gets harder to maintain, debug, and scale for larger datasets.* The more maintainable alternative here is to build a ""data pipeline"": * The pipeline would get the raw data from the production systems, as well as any other external systems you need data from. * Builds data models using SQL and Python and persists them into the database. * Your BI tools then connects to the modeled tables instead. * This allows the queries to be more efficient and faster, since the data is pre-calculated. * This also makes analyzing this data easier in BI usecases. * The added benefit of this is that if you want to use a different BI tool tomorrow, or if you need to use this data in some other way than a BI tool, such as jupyter notebooks and python scripts, then the data is also usable for that.There are a bazillion different tools that allow you to build data pipelines.

Inmon gives you more flexibility to add data products down the line and has a much better likelihood for them to be aligned with each other.

It is one of the main reasons that file based looks so attractive (but is actually data on beer goggles).Let me share a way that has dealt with this issue. First, and most important, how are you using the data? This is the key question and will be the reason for your upstream choices. This should be used to guide all your choices. See which final format fits your SLA and performance needs best. See how I am moving to objective and not subjective reasons?The final form has to also consider flexibility, expandability and scalability.

I just setup my own stack using Azure's base resources(basic storage accounts, containerized and function apps, Azure SQL, data factory for orchestration) that were less likely to be discontinued every few years and then let the business choose what BI solution they wanted to move to.It ended up cutting our costs to like 1/4th of what I had projected it to be at if we would have migrated to Fabric. At the time, there was no migration plan for users of older Synapse to Fabric and it was going to be a re-implementation for us anyways.While I wish Microsoft the best with Fabric, if it's anything like the product model they had for Synapse, it will be dead in like 5 years too. Synapse utilized many of Azure's base resources all linked together, but their development was forked and specialized to Synapse - so they're not 1:1 migrations. To further add problems to this, based on feature requests we made and escalated support tickets to engineering, the development of those forks were done by a small overseas team that basically had no bandwidth but bug fixes.

Because sometimes you want a loop that iterates using a counter variable, and writing a FOR-loop makes it so much easier to write and read than using only IFs and GOTOs.Okay, so why do some languages also use while-loops in addition to for-loops? Because sometimes the logic you want to implement is clearer as a for-loop with a counter and/or current element, and sometimes the logic is clearer as a loop that continues *while* a condition remains true.Some programming languages allow the use of an *until*\-loop, a loop that keeps running *until* a condition is met. An until-loop is functionally equivalent to a while-not-loop, so why is there a need for an until-loop?Well, it's not that there's a specific *need* for it, it's that sometimes the logic is clearer when you realize that a body of code needs to be repeated over and over *until* a specific condition is met -- or that the body needs to repeatedly execute with the goal of causing that condition to be true.",SpaceAviator1999,2025-10-16 04:27:46,3,learnprogramming,t3_1o7ueik,False,

nj4vr6c,"**TL;DR: Good code is code that delivers the desired functionality and is as easy to maintain as possible.****Why our profession is culty on this question**One thing you need to understand about our profession is that most practices have the following pattern:* Some smart people devise an approach that fit their needs and allowed them to produce some exceptional value.* Some non- or less technical people saw the money and started either selling this approach as ""the right way to do things"" for money or telling their engineers to start doing it because they think it will make more money.* The purpose behind the practice is lost, but people nevertheless dogmatically follow the practice since it's ""the right way to do things"" and some smart people said to do it.You can see this with agile, OOP, functional programming, every framework you've ever used, etc.**What you actually need to do**Writing quality, maintainable code is about minimizing complexity, and there are multiple kinds of complexity.* Computer efficiency - How efficiently your machine can execute your code.* Local complexity - How easy it is to understand a file you're looking at on the screen.* System complexity - How easy it is to understand how all your files interact with one another across your entire application.Generally speaking you need to sacrifice one or two of these in order to achieve the other. Rarely can you get all three at once.Object-oriented programming and functional programming are approaches for managing system complexity. With OOP, you're defining components as ""objects"" with specific functionalities so that you have a system-wide vocabulary for what things do. Furthermore, by making things modular, you limit how much you have to fit in your head at any one time in order to change the system.With functional programming, you're trying to isolate state to as few places as possible and keep all your functions throughout your system simple and deterministic, so when you're writing a function you have a finite number of ways that function can behave and it's simple to create, write, and test.I have met very few engineers who understand why OOP and FP are desirable. They just follow them dogmatically because they were taught them in college and don't know how to do things another way. Furthermore, they often do them wrong. They think simply using functions is FP or just defining boilerplate objects is OOP without actually writing coherent modules to reduce system complexity.If you'd like a more robust discussion on this, my favorite book on the topic is ""A Philosophy of Software Design"" by John Ousterhout.

Consequently money was flowing in an unnaturally free and cheap way across the economy since.Since then, interest rates have gone up, money has become tighter and more scarce, and the ""party"" is coming to an end so to speak.When money is tighter, consumers spend less, businesses hire less, people invest less, people are more risk averse, etc. The economy as a whole starts to slow down.So startups that were once being flooded with money by investors throwing everything they could at anything resembling ""tech"" suddenly see their investments dry up. Mid-sized businesses can't get loans. Companies aren't willing to spend as much money on advertisements, so sites like google, instagram, Facebook, etc. see their revenue go down. Consumers buy less products on Amazon.So everyone stops hiring, and then they start doing layoffs, which means people have even less money to spend on stuff, and the cycle continues to plummet downward into a recession.And that is what we're going through now.Are there some jobs being made obsolete by AI?

Someone can design a class and give it a very simple public interface. They can then trust that junior engineers can safely call the public interface and it will work correctly.Similarly, it can enable someone to extend an existing well-written class and customize its behavior while ensuring the core functionality still works.Without OOP, it'd be much easier for lots of people all working on the same project to do something wrong or break something.Sometimes the goal is to enforce rules for yourself!

nj6g1ar,">Why is OOP such a crazy thing to try to define in your own words, with it making sense?Because it's a very nebulous term that over the course of its history has been used to mean different things by different people. Like, people are still arguing over what this term means to this day, and they refuse to agree on a concrete definition.Typically though, OOP is, unsurprisingly centered around the idea of ""objects""; encapsulated bundles of data, and methods that can interact with a given instance of said data. Under an OOP framework, a program is simply various interactions between different component objects.In a Tamagotchi, you have a 'pet', that gets fed 'food' that you buy from the 'store', and keep in your 'inventory' until needed. The 'pet' can have different 'states' that effect its behaviour - states like ""hungry"", ""happy"" or ""dead"". All of these are displayed to the user of the game by a 'game window', and specific information can be managed by a 'settings manager'. You get the gist.Many people argue that OOP has proverbial 'pillars'; ""encapsulation"" (keeping related fields and methods bundled together in classes), ""inheritance"" (objects can inherit behaviour of other objects), and ""polymorphism"" (use an interface, dummy), but that's another question, and whether some of them matter enough is again, in contention.",DTux5249,2025-10-12 22:28:17,26,learnprogramming,t3_1o52b64,False,

An object ""dog"" based on ""pet"" would add on siblings (list), photo (BLOB), and maybe functions bark(), dotrick() and so on. But you can also create object ""cat"" based on ""pet"", add color notes, color pattern, photo (BLOB), siblings (list), preferred toy, etc.What are some things only cat would do?

I have to prefix what I think it is with “it’s just my opinion man” as opposed to saying this is the agreed on definition:I believe that OOP boils down to the idea that solutions to problems can be modeled as “objects” which are a collection of methods and data those methods manipulate.Going a step further - encapsulation in this specific form means that users of the objects only need to understand its interface (that is the methods it exposes) should not need to understand the underlying object. An example of this would be creating an instance of a class called HTTPServer and using it will cause it to start an http server without exposing you to the underlying sockets or network protocols to make it work - you don’t need to know all of the variables used by HTTPServer.,Antsolog,2025-10-13 02:17:30,3,learnprogramming,t3_1o52b64,False,

For Backend developent, you can basically choose what you want. C# and Java are better than C++ (in this specific case), many people also like Python or JS, Ruby, Go, PHP or rust. I could proably list 10 more languages if I took the time. I for one wrote backends in Python, JS, C# and rust and personally, the only language I didn't like out of those 4, was JavaScript. And, a last short point: Look at your local job market. Where I live (when I looked last), C# and Python were more popular than Java for Backend Dev specifically for example, but Java is also used for Android Dev and some Desktop UIs.

I'd avoid any book with the word ""cookbook"" in the title for the same reason.What you want when you're learning a big topic is a big, comprehensive source that was built to teach that larger topic from soup to nuts, so you take a well-planned path through all the material you need and get a single, coherent perspective.

njv8t84,"You could look at the assembly and see what the compiler is doing. In practice, the compiler will enter `main` and move the stack pointer some offset; this space behind the stack pointer will go back to the end of the stack frame - the stack frame contains the information of where to go when `main` returns. This is the space allocated for the local variables. For you, that'd be about 4 bytes on a typical dev machine. So when `value_giver` returns, the memory for the return value is already allocated, and the compiler will generate machine instructions to write it into this stack space.If you're curious, you could pick up a book on writing compilers, and function call conventions, virtual registers, register allocation via graph coloring, caching and swapping, virtual address spaces, and all sorts of fun theory put into practice.Typically compilers will generate machine code that all the local variables are allocated all at once, so this code: void fn() { int x; // Stuff... int y; // Stuff...The stack memory will look like: [fn frame][x][y][stack pointer]So even though `y` comes into scope later in the function code, all locals were allocated at once; it's just less work to do it this way, and the memory for `y` is inaccessible until the machine code that uses it comes into scope. Compilers don't have to do it this way, and the C standard says effectively nothing about machine code generation. C is a high level language that targets an abstract machine. The compiler projects that abstraction to the actual machine.As far as C is concerned, `a = 25` because that's the code you wrote. How it's realized depends on the compiler and the target architecture that is going to execute those instructions.To blow your mind - Charles Babbage designed the Analytical Engine - a purely mechanical clockwork digital computer. He never did get the funding to build it; some private investor spent millions of dollars and commissioned his earlier Difference Engine to be built, and it was completed and put on display in a London Museum for 2 years, before being brought into his private collection. All the Difference Engine does is compute logarithms.But the Analytical Engine was digitized and simulated - and it fucking worked. Earlier analysis of the design has shown IT IS Turing Complete, and it was indeed designed to be a general purpose computer. So being Turing Complete means it is exactly equivalent to your computer you're using right now - just mechanical and slower. This means YOU CAN write a C compiler for the Analytical Engine and compile this program for it, and it would run.

njxik0i,"Generally, the value is returned by the function and since a function call has ended, all the values that were put on the stack by the function (i.e. the stack frame with local variables, parameters and other data) can be deleted except for the return value. The return value is then on the stack and can be copied. In reality this is optimised, but in a very simple stack based system you just return the execution to where the function was called and then the assignment copies the value on the stack. The return type defines the width (how many bits/bytes) are on the stack. After that the next function call will write to the stack, overwriting that value.The stack, CPU registers, and pointers that control program execution and function calls make it all work. There's a pointer that tells the CPU which instruction to execute next. That's the ""Instruction Pointer"" (IP). It can ""jump"" to where a function and and then ""jump"" back when the function returns. The pointers can just be on the stack because stacking those addresses makes it easy. Since it uses a stack\*, it must know where on the stack the function has to work with local variables. The ""Stack Pointer"" (SP) simply points to the top of the stack (new stack frames go on ""top"" (usually a higher address). \* You could compile C code for a computer that doesn't use a stack but then the compiler would just generate code that creates a stack at runtime using the memory.

That way, you can implement each bit one by one. Once your sections are working individually, start combining them through API calls. Graph things out if you need visual guides. Visualisations can help. Create UML diagrams, design your database tables, draw connections between your components to plan how they will communicate between each other, read documentation and forums like Stack Overflow, etc.Yes, this will take trial and error.

It took me the introductory course (with an extra course I took, because I was struggling) and a practical course with a group project in my 2. semester. After that course, I felt like I can built stuff that's really helpful for me. And that's what I did. Been programming for 13 years now. It's definitely not about being smart. Programming is really one of the easier concepts in a CS curriculum. And Python is especially easy. I was taught Java at first (which I'm glad about). But I think you also need to either be wired to think like a programmer or you need to learn it. You will learn to think more analytically and you will learn how to solve problems. Or you will find out that that kind of thinking is just not for you.My advice is: Just stick with it. If you can find any joy or interest in programming, then stick with it. It will click some day. If the whole experience is just a drag to you, even after trying for months, that might mean that it's not for you. Also: Don't do it for the money. If you don't enjoy it, you'll be miserable.BTW: I barely passed my introductory programming course. But once I finished the practical course in the second semester, I was an A-B student when I came to practical programming courses. They were always interesting and I always got some sort of satisfaction out of it learning new things and solving problems. Most of the time, I was the one pulling the group. So, don't worry if it's hard at first. Because it is. It might click some day, but it takes a lot of practice! You have to sit down and write code. A LOT! Don't skip any homework.

That way, you won't feel discouraged for doing extra research or taking longer than others to figure things out...or you could just ignore that and stress out 24/7 :smirking_face:With that said, a lot of programmers are obsessed with the idea that learning it must be really difficult; if you can't do x thing in y way, then ""you're not cut out for it.""I find *that* ridiculous, just like I find the method to teach you for loops a little odd. Don't be afraid to take a few steps back and look up introductory courses to x concept and asking for a lot of guidance if you're stuck on something. If you wind up going further down this path, remember this - building usable programs is really important, even if they're very basic to start.My curriculum failed to even suggest that. We've never even built a basic calculator like you are now. This led to my growth in programming being at a near plateau for 2 years. I learned theory, syntax, and basic concepts but never actually trained the most important aspect of a programmer - solving problems. A programmer is a problem-solver who uses tools (languages, functions, etc) to solve them. That's why many people emphasize solving the problem with writing out diagrams, pictures, words, etc, then turning that into psuedocode you can easily follow. Here's a simple way breaking the problem down would look like:- If I receive 2 numbers, let's say 6 and 2, what would the end result be? 12? - How would I get from my base numbers to get to 12 while only adding? Adding by 2, 6 times?- How do I make my program loop by 6 times?- How do I make sure I correctly add 2 each time in that loop? - How do I see if my end result is 12?- How do I replace my numbers 6 and 2 with variables? - Would I get the same result assigning 6 and 2 to those variables before the loop?- How do I get user input to achieve the same result?So on and so forth. Maybe add some psuedocode to give a basic idea of how it would flow in code. Building a bigger program would follow a similar process. Whenever you break down a problem but get stuck on breaking it down further for x, y, z reasons, that might be a good indicator of searching up a little more about x, y, and z.Hope that helps!

nj9e95e,"It depends on where in the world you are, because the job markets and expected qualifications differ greatly. A country suffices. From a central EU and USA perspective: A degree is not 100% necessary, but makes the entire process of finding and keeping (good) jobs a lot easier. If you want to go this route, taking all general STEM classes you can get before will help. A computer science degree will generally give you good basics, but you will be expected to ""self learn"" programming along the way. You will probably get taught the basics for programming as well, but everything beyond that is incidental. Programming is to computer science as masonry to an architect. This is the slowest route, but you will be the most well rounded, and able to go into basically any field (inside of IT) you want to specialize in. A software engineering degree locks you out of very few things: Theoretical CS research is the only thing that comes to mind, but I am sure there is a little more. It mostly has the same basics as a general computer science degree, but you specialize in how software works, is made and programming a lot more. Theoretical CS and other possible specializations, like Bio/medicine and programming, physics or IT-security will be ignored more. If you know that you want to be a programmer, this is always solid. In some countries you also have vocational training as a programmer, you can treat this like a Software Engineering degree, but shorter and with less prestige. Then you can go the self taught route. Here it's even more about a good portfolio, to prove oyu are able to work, and good networking. You need connections to get anywhere, because you need to give people a reason to even consider you an option. Normally the degree does that for you (to an extend, networking is also important if you have one) Certificates are motly completely useless in my experience. This will vary greatly throughout different regions and specific fields, but when we did technical evaluations of new candidates, we just ignored any certificates. The only thing we looked at was education and prior experience, like a portfolio or earlier jobs they've had. I know now, that in some countries they hold quite a bit more value, and that's why it's important to say where (approximately) you will be looking for work, once your education is done.

njy799i,"> I heard of something called Static Site Generation, the concept of which I haven't been able to fully understand yet. Could this be the solution to what I'm trying to do?It could be sufficient for your purposes, but more of an alternative to using React. Likely the technique you're looking for is what we call templating. It's also what SSGs use.I'm not personally familiar with react so I can't give an exact answer for your situation, but one common type of templating is [jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), where you can have a template like `hello {{name}}` (which you should be familiar with from basic string interpolation), and logic like `{% for name in names %}hello {{name}}{% endfor %}`.Static site generators essentially use templates to produce static HTML that you can serve to people through stuff like github pager, a simple Apache webserver, etc. Usually it involves some setup in terms of theming and what you want headers, footers, etc to be, and then you can do stuff like add blog posts written in Markdown with minimal effort.You can find static site generators in pretty much any language. Some commonly used ones include* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (Ruby)* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (Go)* [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) (Rust, but more special-purpose)Some of the ones I've used include* [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) (node.js)* [hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) (Haskell)You can find [a list of SSGs on jamstack](https://jamstack.org/generators/). There's 370 of them currently, some general-purpose, some special-purpose. Given that you seem to have some experience with node.js you could have a look at 11ty to see if it seems to cover your needs.",syklemil,2025-10-17 10:39:55,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o8upxz,False,

In my case it was building an encyclopedia - based on the entry title in the url, it would grab information about that entry from the backend database and populate the template's title, description, etc, with that information.Anyway, I don't know enough about React to say exactly how you would do it, but it might be worth looking into seeing if the router you're using has any kind of dynamic routing as an option and go from there.",0bn0x10s1337sp34k,2025-10-17 17:27:16,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o8upxz,False,

Store event data in a DB/CMS with fields like title, date, backgroundColor, theme, and a blocks array (e.g., hero, speakers, schedule). Your EventPage maps blocks to components, so “unique flair” is just data. For SEO, compute meta tags from the fetched event. Prefetch the event on card hover or intersection to keep it snappy.If you want SSG, Next.js works well: pages/events/\[slug\] with getStaticPaths to build popular events, and revalidate to keep them fresh. You still drive layout from metadata, so special cases don’t break the system.For backends, I’ve used Hasura for instant GraphQL on Postgres and Supabase for auth/storage; when I needed REST from an existing SQL DB without writing controllers, DreamFactory auto-generated endpoints and docs.Bottom line: build a single data-driven EventPage under a dynamic route and let metadata handle variations.",Embarrassed-Lion735,2025-10-17 22:37:59,2,learnprogramming,t1_nk07opb,False,

njkqvzh,"First, think about who will use the app and where. If it's just you on one computer, the easiest way is Python with Flask. Flask lets you make a simple website to view and edit data, and SQLite can store everything in a single file. You will need a backup plan for the database, but it's simple and doesn't require a server.If multiple people need access at the same time, you will need a server and a proper database. Node.js lets you run JavaScript on the server to handle multiple users. A NoSQL database like MongoDB is easier than SQL for beginners because you don't have to plan tables and relationships in advance. You can just add new fields as you go (Useful if they later need to add random stuff they forgot to mention). An online database just means the database lives on a server everyone can access, but it requires hosting, security, and backups. There are generous free tiers but it adds complexity.For now, start small with Flask and SQLite on your own computer as a demo. Focus on the key features, tracking animals, medications, and volunteer logs. Once it works, you can think about scaling it with Node.js and MongoDB if more people need access or using something like Pymongo to keep using your Flask app instead of redoing it in Node.js.What you are building is a basic CRUD app with a form to add new animals and a table to view them. It's simple enough that an AI could probably build it for you. If you want to learn, use AI as a tutor or guide so you don't get lost. Keep it simple.

njvjnly,"Write an HTTP server.HTTP is a text based protocol, and you can get away with just implementing GET and POST - and you don't even need the whole thing - you can just ignore authentication, for example. You generate an HTTP response IN TEXT. It's all text. That's the point of this exercise.Seriously, don't overthink it - it's not hard. You're not writing a complete web server, you just need to read text from a stream, figure out what message type you got, and service it.You can write main in terms of `std::cin` and `std::cout`. What makes standard IO so special is that you can use the `netcat` command to open a listening socket on port 8080, and launch an instance of your program - `netcat` will establish the TCP stream for you, and redirect all IO to your program's standard IO. So here you're coding against `std::cin` and `std::cout`, and in reality, it's coming from a TCP socket over a pipe across the network.Now you can just hit the localhost loopback device with a web browser on port 8080, and your program just reads `std::cin` to process the GET request, and you write back a payload with the most barebones HTML that says ""Hello World!"" in it. Or maybe some JSON, or XML, since both those are transport protocols - you can just write it raw, you don't need a template engine that processes JSON or anything like that.But you could... If you get ambitious...You can also use `telnet` or `curl` to interact with your little server and see a more raw view, or the developer tools built into the browser - whatever those do...As for your code, OOP is message passing to objects, so you can implement a couple message types: class GET {}; class POST {}; using request = std::variant; std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, request &);The stream operator will start to parse out the HTTP request, determine the request type, and then create the corresponding variant type. This makes this stream operator here a factory method. Once you get as far as knowing the message type, you could defer to the message type instance to populate itself from the stream: class GET { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, GET &); }; class POST { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, POST &); };You'll probably want a response message: class response { friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &, const response &); };To make an object, you make it streamable: class http_server: public std::streambuf {};If you want to parse text, you overload a couple things: class http_server: public std::streambuf { int_type underflow() override, overflow(int_type) override; };And you can plug that into a stream: http_server svr; std::iostream ios{&svr};You can make a number of these, for being different kinds of processors and handlers and stages that all perform steps. Messages move content, objects do work. This is OOP in C++. This is why Bjarne invented C++, because he wanted more control over message passing, and he wanted greater type safety than either Smalltalk or C. Streams are the interface - and frankly you can bypass the stream implementations almost completely if you're messaging internally in your application - you don't have to serialize to text all the damn time. There's a lot you can do with OOP if you think in terms of objects and messages.I demonstrate these principles in past posts of mine, I spend most of my Reddit time answering C++ questions on Reddit, so look up a couple of my past examples.But if you can implement objects and message passing as OOP intended, I think you'll show your professor something he's almost certainly never seen in his life. MOST people can't even tell you what OOP IS, because they've never seen it themselves, before. Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism? These principles are NOT OOP, they just come OUT of OOP. These principles exist in other paradigms, too. You've got polymorphism in everything from imperative programming to functional programming, for example. Most C++ code is C with Classes because people don't know what they're doing - garbage in, garbage out. I've spoken to other developers who understand OOP, but in 30 years I've never actually met one in real life, never worked with one. I've worked with a Windows 95/DirectX/COM co-author, I've worked with the former maintainer of the Intel Fortran compiler (and that's a big fucking deal, since it's used on all the worlds supercomputers), and I've shown them this stuff, how Bjarne writes code, and they've never seen anything like it before.",mredding,2025-10-16 22:40:33,3,learnprogramming,t3_1o8hxas,False,

This is a static table of function pointers - each abstract class and derived class has it's own table. Your instance points to its table.So then, if you have a `B` instance, but through type erasure you only have an `A` pointer, then calling a method will undergo a lookup so the correct implementation is called.Maybe.The vtable only contains entries for `virtual` methods. In your example, the only entry in the vtable of both `A` and `B` will be for `print`. You didn't make `~A` virtual, so when you `delete a`, the compiler doesn't know `a` is pointing to a `B`. The compiler only knows the non-virtual interface presented to it through the `A` type.---If you google OOP in C, you can find tutorials for building objects in C, including modeling inheritance, and polymorphism. The object code generated by this exercise typically matches the C++ equivalent exactly. The first C++ compiler - CFront, was originally a transpiler to C.So why not just use C? Because the two languages have different type systems. C++ grants you much more type safety - and type safety is more than just catching errors; compilers are theorem provers, and they use type information in order to optimize more aggressively.

If you know that you will never extend the class or you know that it will never be destroyed via a base class pointer, then maybe not.

nk6hzvt,"If you’re looking to get back into programming and want something practical that you can tinker with, leaning on languages like Java and C# (.NET) is a solid choice. Both are mature, widely supported, and have a lot of libraries that can make building things like a hotel PMS or a roster scheduler much more manageable. Java will give you platform independence, so you could run your programs on Windows, Linux, or Mac without much hassle, while C# and .NET are extremely well-integrated into Windows environments and offer rapid development with a lot of built-in UI frameworks. For your particular projects, SQL is going to be almost unavoidable if you want to store reservations, employee details, or scheduling data efficiently. Learning to combine either Java or C# with a relational database like MariaDB would cover most of what you need, and it’s exactly how most professional systems handle persistent data.For the hotel PMS, even if you already use Opera Cloud, building your own simplified version can be a great learning experience. You’ll get hands-on insight into the data structures and workflows behind reservations, room management, and billing, which will inform your understanding of what a full-scale system does behind the scenes. For the roster builder, the challenge lies more in logic and rules enforcement—handling days off, labor law restrictions, and employee availability can be complex, and practicing this in code will improve your problem-solving skills more than anything else. You could start simple, storing employee information and preferences in a database, then gradually implement more advanced scheduling algorithms as you learn.Here me out though: some of the most efficient POS systems ever made weren’t built on top of an operating system at all—they were written in assembly language. By coding directly to the hardware, developers could squeeze out incredible speed and reliability, especially in environments where every millisecond counts, like retail or hospitality checkout systems. Modern frameworks make development faster and easier, but looking at those old systems is a good reminder that understanding what’s happening at the low level can make you a much stronger programmer, even if you never touch assembly yourself. It’s all about learning how things work under the hood, and how your high-level code translates into actual performance. This also saves a ton of money on client end systems as the hardware doesn't need to support a full operating system since you've built it to be application specific. You wouldn't use a pc for what you can do with a 5 buck Arduino.If you're willing to learn a new language though, I'd recommend c++ as you can compile it for any operating system.",bringrainfire,2025-10-18 18:24:43,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oa2us3,False,

njplpzm,"Yes, it is overwhelming. C++ is more complex for multiple reasons:* It's relatively old as far as programming languages go, it dates back to the 1990s. It predates all modern build tools and package managers.* One of the primary reasons people pick C++ is to build platform-specific code. Not the only reason! But it means that a standard cross-platform solution for writing C++ just doesn't make a lot of sense for many people is because the whole reason C++ is being used is to build code that's tightly tied to a particular operating system a lot of the time.* There are multiple widely used C++ compilers: GCC/G++, LLVM/Clang++, and MSVC are all extremely widely used and relevant. They're quite compatible but not perfectly compatible. Some important projects can't be compiled with all of them. They don't support the same set of platforms.* Due to the lack of strong cross-platform IDEs, many C++ projects support command-line builds as their primary solution. IDEs can still be used, but they're not primary.As far as advice: first, I'm assuming that you want to learn C++ as a pure language and that none of the stuff you want to learn is platform-specific. In other words, I'm assuming that your goal is NOT to, e.g. write a Windows GUI application. If so, then you need to specify what types of platform-specific code you want to write, because the advice might be different.So if you just want to learn C++ as a pure language, you've got a lot of options. Which one you prefer is really a matter of personal preference.If you use Windows as your primary system now and you want to keep doing that, Microsoft's Visual Studio (e.g. Community edition) is an excellent choice. It's full-featured and ""batteries included"". Not the same as VS Code, which is a totally different product.Another good option on Windows is to install WSL2 and use a fully open-source toolchain: use your text editor of choice, install gcc, cmake, and a bunch of command-line tools used on Linux.Of course, if you're interested in Linux, that's a great choice too. I don't think it really matters which distro you pick. On Linux, every developer tool you could possibly imagine can be installed with one or two clicks or a single command. You can go from a fresh install to a working developer environment in literally minutes, compared to hours on Windows.The downside of Linux is that you might be much less familiar with the GUI, and it might not support all of the games, apps, and hardware that Windows does.If you have a Mac, macOS is fantastic - it gives you nearly all of the developer tools you'll find on Linux, plus all of the other sorts of apps you need for everything else in your life like on Windows (and unlike Linux). As a foundation you can use gcc or clang, plus cmake, and then optionally use various code editors combined with command-line for building and running. Yet another option is Xcode, Apple's IDE. While Xcode is primarily used for Apple's languages and to build apps for Apple platforms, it does have C++ support.One option is VS Code, which works on all of those platforms. However, I wouldn't recommend it as a good starting point for C++. VS Code is NOT a ""batteries included"" solution, it's a blank slate and you have to install plug-ins and configure everything to support any language you want. Some languages are easy. C++ is not, if you're new to it. You basically need to already have a compiler and build system installed and working, AND you need to understand how to configure and troubleshoot it, to get it working with VS Code.Hope that helps.",dmazzoni,2025-10-15 23:50:09,1,learnprogramming,t3_1o7qmjt,False,

You still need a compiler, linker, debugger, build system, and standard libraries, AND you'd have to configure them...So in VS, you'd use the wizard to configure a new, blank Win32 Console Application.

A 90 minute take home, a virtual technical, and a virtual behavioral. Only their final rounds are in-person.That said, I definitely expected this. Just like companies work arrangements are mostly going back to how they were pre-covid with hybrid being the most common, followed by 100% onsite, followed by remote being the most rare. Interviews are the same way. In-person worked. Not only is it a way to prevent cheating, but it's significantly easier to read body language, and to get a better vibe of a person (in *both* directions, this benefits the candidate to judge the interviewers) when you're in-person.It's also not that expensive for the company. The final round can be expensive-ish to fly people in, like Google's doing here. But pre-covid something that was common before the final rounds was to have candidates early in the process drive out to a proctored test site to do their ""interview"" there. There's thousands upon thousands of test centers *globally*, you just drive out ot one near you. I've done it before, it was pretty easy. Local proctored testing is very cheap.I think this was inevitable. The rise of AI just sped things along a bit.And to those who haven't done in-person interviews before, it's ***way*** easier to whiteboard out a problem in pseudocode and another person in the room, versus doing it in a real IDE via typing where all your syntax needs to be right with people staring at you on camera.",SouredRamen,2025-10-15 19:25:39,64,cscareerquestions,t3_1o7k7n6,False,

The good thing is your degree is still super relevant to today’s needs.I think you should get your resume in front of as many people as possible. Find companies in your area where you’d actually like to work and reach out to people in the departments you’re interested in.

Like you I thought finding a job wouldn't be hard, after all I had 4 years of experience at that point and jobs were handed out like candy in '98 when I graduated. I took 3 months off just like you, even spent a good chunk of my severance like an idiot.I spend the next 9 months looking for a job, I was out of work over a year. I ran out of cash, and I was 30-40k in debt on maxed out credit cards. I was borrowing money from friends to make the bills work and out of unemployment checks.My old company (the one that laid me off) called me up, they had an ugly project and were looking for current/ex-employees who had reputations for putting in the hours/work. Wanted to hire me as a contractor, I negotiated an hourly rate, and hopped a plane to chicago, worked remote there for over 9 months, nights/weekends... 80+ hour weeks. That hourly contract rate paid off all my debt, paid back my friends, got me a new car and a nest egg.That contract paid me more in 6-9 month of work then they'd have paid me if they'd just kept me employed during the year I was laid off plus the 6-9 months. It was silly. They hired me back full time to save money.About 8 months later I landed a job in my dream industry and happily walked away from them.Point of my story? It's rough. Being laid off sucks. We can all make mistakes. You may have to do things you don't like to recover. But you can and will recover given enough time. Hang in there. Do what you have to do to make ends meet.Edit: I should add since then I've ""lost my job"" to layoffs several more times in the proceeding years.

You're also basically on the weeds immediately of figuring out things like cross-functional communication and collaboration, prioritization of value generation vs maintainability based on expected impact and necessity, autonomy and ownership etc...Hence, why its the ""senior junior"" situation. You speed run learning some senior skills while potentially missing out on some of the more mid-level things like adhering to team styling, some knowledge gaps that come from needing to ship and not having the time or team for learning more about developing in a mature project, learning about choosing when to apply design patterns etc...Those things tend to come about from a bit slower of a pace where engineers can be deeper on engineering rather than making sure market fit has been established, runway is secured, and good enough is more important than scaling and maintaining due to the rapid nature of changing demands.But, as I said, that isn't for everyone which is okay. It also qualifies you much more towards startups/early/growth since the dynamics and environment, as well as associated skills and knowledge, aren't the same as more matured process and product.

Owners want to maximize their own profit, so it is in the owner's best interest to pay the worker as little as possible, and to work the worker as long as possible. This is made worse by the fact that profit under capitalism actually tends to fall over time, since capitalism is quite good at making things more efficient it tends to overproduce things in the long run, devaluing the products it produces, meaning often the only way to squeeze out more profit is by squeezing the workers.The workers in IT fields are well paid (still much less than the actual value they provide to the company), but work long hours, frequently more than full time, in order to meet arbitrary deadlines and push profits to an extreme. This work is highly mentally taxing contributing to burnout. Additionally globalization, outsourcing, and complacency due to high salaries makes demands for better working environments difficult.edit: To make things worse, since the 2010s tech companies have been relying on an extremely loan heavy monetary strategy due to low interest rates which actually requires profits to grow exponentially in order to pay their loans back, but this strategy is beginning to falter due to problems like ""running out of people on the planet to sell to"", and ""2% higher interest rates to combat hyper inflation caused by tech company speculative circle jerking"", and ""loans coming due"".

njsjzax,"I've spent most of my career in front-end leaning rolls. I began my career as a full stack developer, but I was always more passionate about the user experience. Around the time front end frameworks started to become a thing, the company I was working at began asking people to choose between front end and backend, and I went front end. In my experience, there are a lot of roles out there where most of the work is on the front end, but knowing enough about the backend to add a simple endpoint is valuable. If you want to move from front end to backend, those roles can make a good gateway.I find that there are a lot of interesting technical challenges to be found on the front end, and that if you focus on solving those, there are lot of great opportunities for more senior front end roles. But, you have to be very intentional about focusing on problems of performance and architecture. If you get caught up in building forms or even focusing on interesting UX components, your job stays very small. But, it doesn't seem like that sort of work is ever fully going away.It's worth noting that the top architectural roles at companies tend to be held by people with strong backend experience. If you want to design full systems, you are unlikely to get there until you also get some solid backend experience under your belt.I went from a full stack role with a front end focus into management. I've managed a mix of full stack engineers with a front end focus and pure front end engineers. Being more front end focused does limit my options for management roles a bit because there are some companies that want highly technical managers with lots of experience across their stack.

I'd say from the beginning. CompE grew out of EE as a specialization in the 90s. Every CompE job will hire EE especially if you dump electives in CompE, but not the reverse. None of the EE work I did would interview a CompE. EE degree broadness is its strength. Power plant work? Power always needs EE/ME/ChemE.*But really, the reason EE is better is because of insane CompE overcrowding*. Same problem with CS. [Sort here](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/college-labor-market#--:explore:outcomes-by-major) by unemployment. Factoring in difficulty, CompE probably is the worst degree of all. Where I went, expected time to graduate is 4.0 years for CS, 4.4 for EE and 4.6 for CompE.***I can give specifics. I went to Virginia Tech when CompE enrollment was 3x smaller than EE and the job market looked equally good for both. Not anymore. [Check out](https://web.archive.org/web/20240813115247/https://ece.vt.edu/undergrad/enrollment.html) our degree and enrollment stats.

CompE job market is competitive as hell and the squeeze is worse if you aren't attending Tier 1.***I'm not saying everyone abandon CompE. If you have to-have to work in hardware then get the specialized hardware degree. Or if you can't handle or hate the ludicrous EE math, very little of which you will likely use IRL.

Now SWE ""talent"" comes in to play and most companies are not hiring big tech company level SWEs since they cannot compete with total compensation.I've worked on safety critical medical devices at private non-tech companies in non-tech cities, think dialysis machines, for my 15+ year career. These companies have mature processes as they have been around for 30+ years. The devices we created were safe and had FDA approval, but the codebase was real spaghetti in many areas.Most of the time it came down to SWEs just working within the existing code base. They don't really care about pushing for refactors unless it was absolutely necessary. SWEs were not intentionally sabotaging the project. They did the best they could with the skills they had. Management doesn't complain about code quality so there is no issue from these SWEs perspective.The SWEs at the majority of companies are not grinding DS&A or design patterns trying to get in to top tech companies. They can code up features that do what they need to do and that's about it. These companies are not trying to compete with big tech companies as they cannot come close to matching total compensation.They try to sell themselves to SWEs in different ways, but it just attracts SWEs that: (off the top of my head)* don't know the value of their talent* meet the companies bar, but would not be talented enough to get in to big tech companies for big pay* late in their career where they are financially secure to coast in a jobSo this is a long way of saying, yes it's pretty common in the industry to have production ready code that is poorly designed. I would even wager that is the expectation and not the expectation when you look at the industry at large and not a small slice like only big tech companies. I'd bet even if you went to look at some codebase at google there would be SWEs that say this is poorly designed we need to refactor.

I could've just quickly box-checked the task and closed the ticket but instead I dug about to understand the whole CICD pipeline and why the dependency even existed. I concluded it was way too complicated for what it did because it relied upon a convoluted ECS implementation to serve the frontend for no discernible reason (SPA , no server side rendering, never will need it given it's internal tooling with no need for major performance focus). I implemented a much simpler / cheaper way of hosting it as static content in S3 and ran it in parallel in dev as proof of concept.I spoke with our engineering manager who agreed it was a preferable approach and now we're integrating it to reduce architectural / build complexity.My point being, don't just take tickets to solve the immediate problem. See if you can solve the upstream problem too. My initial ticket was some version bump needed of a dependency for security reasons but the underlying problem was that we were managing unnecessarily complex infrastructure to serve up a basic SPA frontend.

This confidence comes from several sources depending on your environment and your team/org structure:1. Knowing who knows what.

nk6rsk7,"I wrote some Foxbase code on SCO Xenix for a dog track company in 1989 lol. I'd wonder if that was me but my naming conventions didn't include film stars. There was a compiled DBase III (Which Foxbase was based on) language called Clipper. My first job included some Clipper development in a MSDOS environment. In that same position I found that OS/2 and a third party multitasking DOS (which I think was built by the same guys who did Dr Dos) called DRM Dos were able to run the Clipper applications. The closest thing my company had to a ""Server"" application was a restaurant reservation application that I developed that ran on multiple terminals hanging off a 386 running Drm Dos.The oldest thing I've run across since then was a Motif application that a Satellite company was maintaining (*Edit:* This was in 2015). The oldest comments were from the mid 90's and some of the functions still used K&R function declaration syntax. I'd actually experimented with Motif while I was working at my first job, so I had bit of an advantage there.Their code actually generated three executables and shared a header file which declared 400+ global variables -- ALL the variables used in the application, pretty much. There were multiple places where global variables were mirrored -- another variable was created that duplicated the intent of an earlier variable. I was unable to determine if this was because they forgot the other variable existed or they weren't sure they could change the variable safely because some other function might need it set to a specific value at some later point. Probably a bit of both. This meant that you'd have to find the variable that was shared between the various functions of the code you were working on right now and insure that you were changing the right mirrored variable. You'd also have to hope that those changes wouldn't break some other functionality of the application. And yes, that was every bit as bad as it sounds.I went in with a philosophy of never adding another global variable to the code unless it resulted in the removal of at least two others. They were unwilling to do anything major with the code and everyone in that building got laid off a bit later, before I had a chance to really get it under control. Hopefully that entire code base was simply deleted after that. That abomination should not have been allowed to continue past that point.I'd say I'd seen worse code over the years, but only a couple of other cases I can think of where I'd actually define the code as ""an abomination."" All the code that I would describe as ""an abomination"" was developed by developers who clearly didn't know what they were doing in the least, because ""Global variables bad"" was something they were already teaching in college in the early and mid 80's. I wasn't in college in the early 80's, but I had books from that time.",FlyingRhenquest,2025-10-18 19:17:15,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1o9pywz,False,

It honestly sounds like the main thing holding you back is your own preoccupation with making a mistake, but I think you could make that argument about any job, and everyone has to start somewhere.Something that helped me worry less was understanding blast radius for the changes I was making.

njcy029,"I started out as a FE dev and became a BE dev. Now I don't even want to touch anything FE, although I'm technically full-stack I'd only write BE on my resume. Backend code is always much cleaner, simpler, and easier to debug - but it requires knowledge of certain things you don't often think about as a FE dev.Here are my 2-cents of everything you need to know to be a GOOD BE dev.First of all, you need a general understanding of the internet itself. How it works, and why it is the way it is. You need to know what HTTP requests are and how they work. A BE dev is not a network engineer, but you still want to know what ports are, what UDP and TCP is. All BE development establishes connections to someone or something (most often databases, but depending on the product it could be establishing connections peer to peer or in any other way)After that, you need to understand that backend code is not like FE code. The same design and architectural patterns don't make sense. It helps to think of BE code as a series of completely isolated scripts that a computer will be processing. It doesn't run on a client, it's not available to a client, users have no idea what that code is and they will never see it or directly interact with it. In the simplest context, think of a simple user registration form. The frontend has some inputs it captures, and then it sends it to the backend for processing. The backend then does all of the work to make that registration actually happen with those inputs - which is most often inserting rows to the database.You need to understand and be able to work with databases, you need to be able to read and write SQL. I can't think of any BE position where the code is not interacting with a database. In many instances, that's ALL the code is doing - interacting with a database.You need to understand and be able to manage remote servers and web servers. Familiarity with unix.Security is a concern in BE development for sure, but generally common sense will go a long way and people often think some kind of over-engineering is required to have something secure. Have a properly secured server, with correctly set-up file permissions, whitelists, and firewalls. Don't set anything public that shouldn't be public. Don't store files or sensitive data in weird places. Don't store sensitive data like passwords in plain text. Don't install random packages and libraries that you're not 100% confident in and have a genuine use-case for. Don't work out of a system or computer that's potentially compromised. All validation must be properly handled in the backend, what the FE does is irrelevant in terms of security. Don't have any method someone could exploit to fire off code or SQL on your system. Use services like Cloudflare to help with spam reduction and bot detection. Keep all software/packages regularly updated (including the OS the server is on), and finally keep logs of everything including errors, accesses, requests, etc. Regardless of the scale of a product or application, if all of the above are met, the product will be completely secure from a BE perspective.Overall, I'd say there is a lot more power with backend development than there is with FE. There are more job opportunities for it, and there are just more things you can do in general. The code you write is not just something to be used exclusively for a client's UI - it can be used for quite literally anything, from the world's most complex sorting and filtering algorithms to data analytics to machine learning to whatever else. Lastly, I'd say the beauty of backend code is once it's written, it's made to last forever as long as the computer running it is still on. It's not subject to the change of forever-changing things like clients, npm packages, and designs. In other words, if someone wrote the backend script for a user registration form in 1990, it would be just as valid code as one made today.",dskfjhdfsalks,2025-10-13 23:24:09,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1o5iuhd,False,

I joke to my coworkers that we’re all just data plumbers.Have you done system design interviews?

nj2wxo0,"What you've described are all basic fundamental things that frontend developers are expected to do. If you want to specialize in the creative side of things you'll need to work on developing more advanced technical skills such as graphics/shader programming, webGPU/webGL, Three.js, and etc. to distinguish yourself. I believe the general industry title for such roles is ""creative developer"" - basically a developer with a focus on the areas I mentioned alongside all the existing requirements of a frontend developer. Demand for this skill set is infrequent - most projects that involve this kind of work are usually advertising/marketing related and are typically contracted to web design agencies or freelancers in the field. On rare occasions larger companies may selectively recruit a few of these roles but career-wise I don't think it's very viable long term unless you have the right connections and can distinguish yourself with a strong portfolio.I personally think working as a regular frontend developer is a much more preferable position to be in in terms of career progression and compensation.

nk2m5ad,"Base salary?

nk0vb6a,"I see the ""AI is going to take over the field bro"" everywhere so I'll focus on that. Most of the people saying that won't see this anyway, but I hope it helps you.There's so many arguments that prove that AI won't take over the field any time soon.I have tried to use AI to do my job and it's not very helpful at all. Not even much better than using google, an nowhere near help from a junior dev. No coders are losing their jobs because of AI, any layoffs or reduction in offers is because of the economic cycle (the inflation we had a while ago, that is now reduced. every time there's extra money printing from central banks that is later reduced, the economy gets bad). The ""junior devs have less jobs because of AI"" is just literal journalists saying that or youtubers etc, I don't even know.But that's not why, because, after all, it is improving. If we don't take into account any information on what the software dev job is like, or on how AI works, then (without that info) it seems plausible that it would take over the field in a few years. However, from knowing both how AI works and what being a software dev is like, in order to take over the job it' have to be something completely different. Like some science fiction level of super AI that can do anything people can do. And knowing a bit about how AI works (not much, but much more than people saying those things), that's not going to happen soon, I don't think they can do that with a transformer neural network, no matter how powerful computers get or how much they improve on it.Not because ""someone needs to supervise the AI"" or because ""managers are bad at explaining what they want"", but because, in order to code for an application, you need to have a lot of ideas in your mind, understand a goal, and the way everything you're doing on different modules of code and different technologies contributes to it. Even junior devs. Aka you need real reasoning. Idk if you noticed but chatGPT will never tell you what is it that fundamentally matters from what you asked and should be separated from the noise, offer an actually new way to look at things, or point out something important you're missing. Because that's exactly what it can't do, as it takes going beyond just finding words to say that suit the input, and actually having thoughts behind the words. It doesn't ""hallucinate"", it lies because it doesn't even know what it means that something is true or false, and just says the truth more often because it's repeated more on its training data. And I think an AI that could do that is science fiction at this point.The shortage of software devs (high prices in the market reflect a shortage / low offer for the demand) despite the ""learn to code"" trend is not due to any license requirements, it's a natural shortage, and is because coding can't be learned by repetition like most skills. Meanwhile, demand keeps increasing. And if the ""AI will take over bro"" dissuades people from learning, it will become a bigger shortage.I'd say go for it. Can't go wrong. AI will not take over it, not many people can do it, demand keeps increasing, and it's a very comfy job with remote work. The ""day in the life"" videos are unironically true in my experience, although some take it too far, but overall that's daily life in this job. But first see if you like coding, because that's like the main skill even if you want to do cybersecurity / machine learning. If you try to code and find that it doesn't make sense to you or you can't really learn it (many people are like that), or find it hard and don't enjoy it, I'd say don't study that.",Ok_Bed1260,2025-10-17 19:27:47,0,cscareerquestions,t3_1o99x4i,False,
