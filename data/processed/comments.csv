If you’re constantly moving things from multiple platforms onto the same platform that would make sense. Or if you’re doing proof of concepts across other platforms it could make sense. But typically you pick a platform (AWS + Snowflake or GCP + BigQuery, etc) and stick to it.Data vendors with unique formats:- outside of a few industries like specific things are standardized for interoperability(healthcare, logistics, banking), it’s pretty common for each vendor even for the same “flavor” of data to do it their own unique way.- Ex. I work largely with POS (point of sale) data and literally every POS provider implements things differently and we have to standardize how order discounts, line item discounts, taxes, refunds and partial refunds are handled per system. They also come in all different formats - JSON via API, CSV via S3, TXT via SFTP and we have to have a pipeline per vendor.Tribal knowledge:- Yup, pretty common. Most teams suck at documentation. We have started hiring dedicated business analysts into our DE team so that they can document sources for our teams of analysts.- 4 years into a role I still find out some new random fact about how data is handled in our company. Same for a coworker that’s been here 15 yearsAs-hoc ingestion:- Fortunately we have a roadmap of priority sources to ingest. But if a big enough client or a VP in the business starts getting loud about needing something then ultimately their new source gets prioritized.

mrv97w8,"I was a software engineer for nearly 15 years. Worked in mobile, desktop, web development. I write network and security automation stuff for fun. My final role as a software engineer was a team lead in an insurance company. We had legacy C# desktop stuff, legacy web stuff (ASP.NET/PHP/ColdFusion), and more modern web stuff for the time (ASP.NET + Angular). I still used to write a lot of data engineering-like tasks in this job - financial services, so tons of integrating with SFTP servers and writing/ingesting XML everywhere. Heavy SQL Server stuff underpinned all of this, which is how I ended up in data. My track in data was BI developer -> data engineer in wealth mgmt (Python/BigQuery/dbt) -> data consultant (Azure/Databricks/Synapse) -> tech lead in retail (Python/BigQuery/dbt) -> senior engineer in security for retail org (Python/BigQuery/dbt for analytics, Splunk for SIEM + security automation). I am a very code-heavy data engineer. Everything I do is in code except for dashboards, which I wish I could change. Regardless - and I get downvoted into oblivion here a lot for saying this - I don't view data engineering as anything close to software engineering. The needs, requirements, and use cases are all entirely different. Your average software engineer will fail even the most basic data modelling task these days. Most don't know SQL or even touch a database directly. Your average data engineer will struggle with anything beyond a basic CRUD app. They are different specialties and the code for data pipelines is simpler by many orders of magnitude. I have watched this time and time again with data engineers thinking they can just switch between the two. I even think if I tried to go back to my old ways in the C# ecosystem I would have a really hard time (forgetting that I'm about 10 years older now...) Any pivot is possible, but keep in mind it will take a long time. It took me something like five years to fully move to data engineering after a complete reskill, and that was still with my prior SQL history.

Doing this same sort of thing in other languages is much harder and almost immediately devolves into an explosion of complexity that can quickly become very hard to maintain and understand. Other languages are all fine and good when all your data is super well behaved and you have control of it at every layer. Python really is the goat for handling flaky weird sorts of stuff coming from systems outside of your control. This is why Python has largely won this particular race. Real world data doesn’t always have nice structure to code up as some nice fixed schema and you still need to be able to handle it.That said certainly there is a move within Python to use pydantic as the core serialization and deserialization system that builds basically better data class objects. Then your actual business logic Python code can simply check that it receives an object of the type it expects irrespective of internal complexity of those objects and their construction.,TheRealStepBot,2025-05-13 18:17:18,1,dataengineering,t3_1klpzaf,False,

But for old projects being migrated it's a very time-consuming transition.A score-based linter (like pylint) instead simply gives you a score. And it's up to you, and your automation to determine what the minimum score needs to be to merge into prod.

Basically, the worse your code was the more you had to improve it. The PR was appended with linter failure info, and the developer had a lot of flexibility - the decisions were made at the PR level, not the file level, so the developer could have a nasty file that was hard to fix and so decided to make improvements to other files instead.

For example, last year, there was a good 3 months where data streaming from GA4 just straight up lost 30%+ of your data. They'll still take your money though. I work in mobile gaming, unfortunately going full Google stack is the pragmatic choice. They take 30%+ of your revenue on the store, admob takes an indisclosed % of ad inventory and for marketing ads your also having to trust their pricing algorithms - oh and pay for search ads, which is a straight up mafia style extortion :P Add to that the tooling, we are going Google in the order of millions- 10s millions a year. For that wonderful cost, you get broken products and some incredibly sub-par support - as a company they are so segmented that none of their business facing staff actually know anything with any practical depth. The only way they could be worse was if they were ironsource or Apple.AWS on the other hand are a dream.I'm starting to think the migration to cloud was a mistake. The idea 20 odd years ago was less code to manage and simple environments to deploy, with more reliable backend. Most cloud suites are a bloated mess, with skill and time requirements slowly creeping up to just having a dedicated backend team. Also, the nature of being a black box with slow response to business issue, they are becoming unreliable at scale.Granted, when it all works my life is a dream.

It's a big commitment for someone to move jobs regardless of skill level. However I completely agree that coding platforms can dehumanise the process and be over emphasised/ jumping through hoops.What I've done hiring for my teams is set up a 60 min call, mentioning in advance we'll be talking through some SQL queries for the first half.During the call I'll have a google doc with ever increasing questions that I'd ask to solve via SQL and ask them to roughly write it down. The difficulty depends on level- for juniors you'd start with simple DML- select, where, group by, then having, then progress on to DDL. The point of it being a google doc is that as others have noted, syntax does not matter, but you can see live the thought process and talk over.For seniors I'd start at a higher level, and if mentioned on resume add some python/ language specific questions.It's great to figure out where more junior people are at and what development may be needed, and most seniors breeze through and it sets them up well/ opens up discussion for the rest of the interview where I ask general probing questions about previous roles & projects.However I've also interviewed a ridiculous number of tech leads with 10+ year 'experience' that couldn't understand when to use a group by or explain what it does, even with forewarning.",Abshad,2025-05-11 06:15:29,5,dataengineering,t3_1kjfl2n,False,

mr60l73,"I was a DE in RL during 2024 and left in Jan this year, so just giving my 2 cents here.Obviously, if you don't currently have a job, the answer is yes, especially in the current market. Not much to talk about there, so I'm going to assume that you do have a job that you are hesitant on leaving because of stability concerns in RL.IMO, there are three main factors for you to consider about stability. The first is the stability in the role itself. This depends almost entirely on what org the role is hiring for. Roles supporting, say, the RL games catalog/shop might not be as stable as roles supporting login or service stability. Even the most recent round of layoffs within RL only affected those within Oculus Studios (at least, as far as we know).The second is the overall trend of RL. Lots of people online seem to have a negative view on RL's trajectory since it's been a massive money-sink for Meta, but I personally would be surprised to see real mass layoffs across RL anytime soon.The third is the stability of Meta as a whole. From what I can tell, people within Meta feel very insecure about their jobs, especially after the Feb layoffs this year. I got to witness both the Nov 2022 and this years layoffs, and from what I can tell, moral is at an all-time low right now, even compared to Nov 2022, which was almost 3x as big a layoff. Several of my coworkers across multiple teams were already on the verge of burnout before Feb, but now, people are worried about this year's layoffs happening every year. Even though everyone that I worked with at Meta seemed like genuinely good people, many voiced concerns about others stealing their work, overtaking their scope, and whatever else they need to do to get great yearly rating, because apparently even just a good yearly rating isn't good enough to secure your position, and every year, the bar raises. Given the current market and that people's livelihoods are at stake, it's definitely a reasonable concern.Without more context about your current situation, like your current TC, financial responsibilities, or personal and/or professional priorities, I can't confidently give any solid pointers, but despite all of the doom I just posted, if given the opportunity, I would advise most people in most situations to take the job. Meta rewards you very handsomely for the shit they put you through and are not afraid to promote you in just 1-2 years if you can perform. I've heard of senior engineers breaking 7 figures because of stock bonuses and the stock's performance in the market. That kind of compensation is usually reserved for staff+, and if you can achieve even just half of that for one year, the amount you earn can be life-changing. Also, as others have mentioned, having Meta on your resume is incredibly valuable.If I were you, I'd definitely at least try to get an offer. In the meantime, you can weigh the different factors in your life that you care about. You won't even have to actually make a decision until you get an offer, and even if you decide to not accept the offer, you can at least try to leverage that offer at your current job for a raise.Good luck!",YUGETBPLUS,2025-05-08 00:54:20,27,dataengineering,t3_1kh8yub,False,

Parenting takes far more out of your body than you think it does. I also think that if a Healthcare company is looking to use just Fabric, it means they have a very antiquated data estate and are being blue pilled by a vendor. What does that mean in my eyes? It probably means things will move slow and the data quality is awful. But, that isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It means the business is going to be very reliant on you as an individual to add value whereas your current employer knows exactly what they need out of your role more than you as a person. That equates to higher ownership and getting more business forward with your soft skills. If the two are the only option, as an expected parent, I would leave for the Healthcare job. However, I would be very frank with your current employer that you want to work there long term and if the role opens up for FTE, you will come back. Keep your doors open.

It was difficult and a lot of the things that come out of the box in Databricks or Snowflake took time and energy to get right. I assume it is similar in Fabric, but I also think they have fixed some of the shortcomings (although added others from what I understand). I will say this, after we got everything set up it worked well and operated like most modern data stacks. We transformed all of our data using dbt-core and landed our data using data load tool (dlt) on our data lake using git self-hosted runners kicked off using synapse pipelines, data was not huge and all of the complexity was in the dbt project. We rarely were ""in"" synapse after everything started to run smoothly. I would never pick Synapse or Fabric if I was going to make the decision for a new environment. However, if it is a greenfield project and you can help architect the solution and add solid governance/naming conventions I would say it is beneficial experience. You can transfer those skills to any other platform. If it is already up and running without any ability to help build the solution I might be worried about being pigeonholed into Fabric.

mrjvrb2,"Adding this to echo some other answers with my experience: I worked for a healthcare company a few years ago. They also tended to go with every new Microsoft product and had 0 idea of how to implement it. The non-technical directors/vp's/c-suite people would generally get sold on a product, then everyone else would follow suit or risk future promotions at best or being fired at worst. IMHO it created an environment where the politics of a given tech stack started to outweigh it's technical importance. There were tons of inter-departmental clashes between those who adopted new tech and those who held on to legacy tooling/processes. I felt the only people who stayed at that job were either ruthless ladder climbers or coasters who valued job stability over anything else. Definitely a ""our department vs. theirs"" mindset. There were exceptions but that was the general rule.You'll find that at any job, but in healthcare (I've worked in a variety of sectors) I found this to be the most prominent and the fact that the full time role is healthcare and they use Fabric makes me think you'll run into the same things.

mr3e5ik,"Sorry for a big fat ""it depends"" answer. I think decisions like this exist on a spectrum, for the sake of your question.If the ML prediction outputs are something that is very ""closely"" tied to the document records, then re-funneling things through the raw layer so that it all flows downstream, could make a lot of sense. A trivial example, would be like a ""word count""... I don't really see anything wrong with adding a ""word count"" column alongside the original raw data, especially if downstream datasets will also benefit from it.If the prediction outputs are something that is totally separate from the original records, and/or if you plan to expand your ML platform to cover more models and different kinds of predictions, then it probably makes more sense to aim for an independent architecture, use things like MLFlow for tracking/registering instead of the existing DWH governance. But there's no absolute right or wrong here, it all depends on what direction the team is going in, what kinds of skills or resources are available, etc. There's no point pursuing a ""pure"" ML architecture that is too big for you, if you are a single solo MLE and can't support it well.

My team is doing with both ML and LLM outputs following same pattern.The reporting layer for model ready inputs is also a good idea (and something my team is doing). To add the ML/LLM outputs to reporting layer, you just need a separate object in your reporting layer for the final consumption. Our ML/LLM versioning is handled outside of the warehouse (through an app we built) and ingested into the warehouse. We have a generic section of our warehouse dedicated to modeling the ML/LLM workflow that includes entities like document (text/data evaluated), the prompt (type 2 generated from app data that version controls the prompts) and the ML/LLM outputs of each version of the prompt that was used against the given 'document'. All data flows through this generic model and then flows to the various reporting layers that need it. This also provides standard building blocks for document chunking/RAG which we have built on top of this. Not sure on exactly what you mean by pushing the derived data breaks the idea of it being raw data? The point is that is raw data, totally new. Take away the ML/LLM model used to create that data, you can't regenerate that data using SQL with the data you already had in your warehouse.

mr7rzsm,"No problem with the it depends as long as it’s as well explained as yours. Thank you for the insight!Predictions right now are for example article topics. The outputs are mostly used for reporting right now and even in the case of a recommender system, ML outputs would just be stored on a feature store and repurposed for the system or other models. A first question would be, what do you mean with an ML output being closely tied to the record and how do you measure it? In a sense, all ML predictions based on articles used for reporting a related to the article itself, but how that requires funneling them again to the raw layer I don’t get yet. Another question would be tracking lineage, output versioning and handling re-edited articles. The team uses dbt for ETL and lineage tracking, I don’t know if this would influence what integration to use. Moreover, if we were to track prediction versions, this could be handled in a feature store. But the real challenge is handling re-edited articles that must be repredicted and what integration would facilitate triggering repredictions and updates into our DWH.So far the options have been funneling to raw layer or an independent architecture sourcing from the analytics core, processing predictions in an independents architecture, and the piping predictions back into the later reporting layer. Only draw back is looking the dbt-integrated lineaging creating a kinda black box effect. But then again, this could be tracked from the ML side.

mr5fc4v,"Yep, this one.The ML prediction/classification aren't part of the data flow or modelling inside the dwh. It is a downstream system that generates new data that needs to be ingested.The days going to ML might change in some incompatible way, so this allows the ML output layer to account for that, rather than breaking things at the integration point. If the data from the ML changes then that forces to raw, and it goes through a usual process of standing a schema change or a new source.Another way to think of it is that a dwh processes *never* goes backwards through the layers. That makes it extraordinarily difficult to pick where to put the ML inputs and outputs as the most sensible place to integrate the data into other models could be anywhere, or in multiple places, or it might move.

Your suggestion is that ML models would be based on the aggregated data in later layers, be processed in an independents architecture outside the DWH, and then piped into the DWH as an additional source of raw data. Correct?Since predictions of this type would be tied to a uuid (here an article id), I’m guessing it wouldn’t matter if the ML predictions table have the schema of the aggregated tables (i.e. not a product wise schema, where each product comes in as a separate source), because the predictions table could be rejoined by uuid in the aggregated tables or even earlier, while still passing through the whole generic model.

mr74j3o,"You'll want to study topics like distributed systems, data warehousing, ETL processes, and big data technologies. Common questions might involve designing a data pipeline for a specific use case, like a real-time analytics system or a recommendation engine. Interviewers often ask you to walk through your thought process, discussing trade-offs and explaining your choices.To prepare, I'd recommend studying popular architectures like Lambda and Kappa, familiarizing yourself with cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure), and understanding concepts like data partitioning, replication, and consistency. Practice drawing system diagrams and explaining your design decisions. Real-world experience is invaluable, so reflect on your past projects and be ready to discuss challenges you've faced and how you've solved them.

mrz7rma,Research inmon a bit. You don't need to normalize to the 3th form however build a relational model is a good step. Basically I model based on the business entities. Some further steps you need to take into account: - are you sure all 1-n relations will remain as such are do you want to make your model flexibel? - do you want to load seperate sources independent from each other? Depending on answers you might need to look at something like data vault to steal some ideas as an inbetween layer,dehaema,2025-05-12 20:48:52,4,dataengineering,t3_1kkx037,False,
mrzvbpd,"Why do people do that? Me, I did it many times, I always preferred Inmon style - more normalized at the DW level, star (or some other) at the data mart level. The main reason I did it is because I find the (not fully, but more) normalized model easier to integrate and represent all aspects of the business in a way that's not as biased or limited like stars are.Stars are great for building a specific perspective, but they do that at the expense of other perspectives. So, I think, if you model your unified DW level as stars, you are necessarily basing it towards specific topics, and it will do poorly when the demands for other perspectives come.Having said that (and it served me well for many projects), I must say:- proper 3NF modeling is hard. Really understanding how the business is represented in data takes quite some effort, and you'll often find that many questions don't have proper answers, because the business may never have realized some of its inconsistencies. You will not solve them all, so accepted that your model will hot really ever be perfect;- No physical model is truly normalized, there are always some denirmalizations that are too good to pass - some redundant field, some prr-calculated fields, etc. Don't get too dogmatic about it, a bit of denormalization is good. If it helps, build a logical model and a physical one, and have the denormalizations on the physical only;- Taking this effort only makes sense if your final result is a good representation of the business it captures. If you're doing a company with many divisions that have little in common, you may find yourself trying to abstract very different concepts into some artificial entity that no one understands. For instance, in retail you have warehouses and storesBoth are theoretically locations that have stocks of products, but is there real value in abstracting both to a ""deposit"" and dealing with this entity no one understands and all the weirdness of not having stores in a retail data model? Maybe, but make sure that, when you make such abstractions, you know why, what you're gaining by them, and still consider having the actual business entities, even if as views. Business people should understand a data model with a bit of explanation on notation and little more - if they can't, you can't work with them to validate the business.- Make sure it's maintainable. If you're going to create a normalized layer in your data solution, you'll need a team that's comfortable with that. Otherwise, you'll become the bottleneck and the effort will eventually be abandoned, with someone who doesn't understand it saying it was some technocratic bad decision. Not worth the effort.If you still want to do a normalized layer after all that, congratulations and good luck.

mrwncjc,"You should read about Git itself, what it's purpose is, and how it works fundamentally. Git is the actual tool here, it's an industry standard version control methodology. Github is just one of many tools that harness the power of Git. You can practice using Git directly on your own machine without using any other tool (and without even using code) if you want. You can just use a text file and practice committing and merging changes to the text via git.The basics are, essentially: You have a code base. You want to make one or many changes to that code base, but you want to keep the current state intact so you dont lose your functionality. You create a branch, which is an exact copy of that same code base. You make your changes to the branch. You test the branch. If it's a failure, it doesn't matter because the ""main"" branch hasn't been modified yet. When you get it to work properly, you merge your branch into the main branch. Now your main branch reflects the changes you've made. Repeat. It gets a little more complicated when you've got many people working on many branches at a time, which is when the pull requests and reviews come into play. That stuff exists so that someone who is familiar with the code base can be a second set of eyes, check your work, make sure there aren't conflicts with other people's work, etc. The whole construct exists so there is an easy way to do parallel development work on the same code base without actually changing the working code before the changes have been tested and reviewed.",omfghi2u,2025-05-12 13:01:58,212,learnprogramming,t3_1kkrb3i,False,

mrwqqjz,"I think when trying to learn it often ends up sounding more confusing than it actually is as a concept. Obviously there are layers and layers of complexity but at first I would try to understand at its core what it is. Imagine there’s a massive library of handwritten books and your team need to make various amendments to different ones. Someone has written a list of requirements for you. Your team divides up the tasks. Your first task is to remove any mentions of parrots from “My Life as a Hamster (1974)” - don’t ask why. Better not to ask too many questions in this team. To do that, you check out the single book (My life as a hamster) from the library and tell everyone else you’re doing it for transparency. You do your stuff. Now you could just go and pop the book back on the shelf as you’ve finished but what if you’ve made a mistake? Instead you put it in a little box for “review” and your other team mates can have a look and check they’re happy with your work. Once they are, it goes back in to the library. Yours is now the correct version for that book. Of course you don’t want to shut down the entire library while you do your job which is why this strategy of checking one book out, making changes, getting it reviewed and putting it back in works well. Everyone can be doing different tasks at the same time. The library itself remains central and “pure” - hopefully with your robust review box, no mistakes are getting in. The library is a single point of truth - everything in there has been approved and checked and is correct. Any mistakes are picked up in review. Now instead of a library, as a developer, what you’re working on is digital. It means that people are working on all different books (files). Sometimes people might even be working on the same book but doing a different task. While you’re doing your hamster task, someone else is updating page numbers in all rodent books including your hamster one. Sometimes this can cause a bit of confusion if you make changes to the same page but luckily Git gives you a nice simple (ish) way to fix these and decide which changes to keep when there’s such a conflict.Most importantly, to reiterate, despite all these complicated changes all happening at once, the library itself is pure and “correct” - because people cannot make changes and put the book back. They need check out books, make changes, then put it into the review box (make a pull request) and others in the team must approve it before it goes back in (gets merged in) to the library. It may help, moving away from the library analogy, to imagine the alternative. Imagine word documents named version1, version2 etc. imagine everyone trying to change it at once. Everyone saves their own local copy. But someone else has changed the same bit you were going to. Whose bit goes in? Soon nobody has any idea which version is the right one. People are no longer copying the original. - they are copying version 17. But oh wait, while you were doing something, version 18 became available and now all those changes aren’t in yours.",Schwicke,2025-05-12 13:22:14,23,learnprogramming,t3_1kkrb3i,False,

mr2m2ac,"Amidst all these optimistic comments, I’m going to shatter some dreams. It is only my opinion but here we go.Employers won’t except you to know everything, but they’ll expect you to know the basics very well. The tech industry is built on tons of abstraction. In our ‘modern times’, new, complex, shiny technologies are abstracted away to a point where using them is very easy. This makes it more and more common for underlying concepts to go overlooked.An example is the frontend web development world today. We constantly see new shiny web frameworks that make the development precess so much easier, and alongside them, the big frameworks trying to catch up. And as a result we see teenagers ‘vibe coding’ SaaS apps with minimal understanding.This is a slippery slide that makes you feel productive and confident in your programming abilities. Makes you think you can definitely land a job already.In reality, most employers don’t need people who can use new tools. They need engineers who can solve difficult problems. To become an engineer you need to have a very deep understanding of the fundamentals before going into the advanced stuff. Frankly, the fundamentals are not even about one’s ability to code or use different technologies, but rather theory that you learn by reading and practicing with pen and paper.In my opinion, the best way to land a job is by mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (that means reading books and studying them, not solving random LeetCode problems), Networking, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems and Unix, Databases and RDBMSs, OOP, and the cherries on top - a low level language (C or C++ - understanding explicit memory management and having the need to implement everything on your own is very good for practice), and a high level language (Java, C#, Go, Python, JavaScript, etc - pick your poison).Of course ’mastering’ these concepts is subjective. There is no right answer as to at which stage of that exactly, one will be able to land a job.

I will share withou you what situation I found myself in to better illustrate this.I am building a dashboard that will show some data like system usage, uptime monitoring and some other things. I have a Raspberry Pi with a display set up for this and it will live on my desk so I can quickly reference it if needed.I needed to get the usage data from my PC to the Raspberry Pi and the solution I found was quite simpler than I initially expected: I made a Windows client that just sends data to an API and I configured a webserver on the Pi.I still needed some data from the Windows client to see if any relevant events occur, like loosing connection, getting an error or anything that should happen at runtime I would like to be notified about, maybe a few simple configurations. So I decided to make the application run headless, but having a tray icon. This helped me have a few settings in the tray menu, simple toggles, on and off. For the messages that communicate my client application’s state I chose to use notifications. So like this I have settings and feedback from the application without any actual UI.Of course it is more of a particular case creating a dedicated web server, but I eanted to ilustrate to you that there are some (maybe non-conventional) solutions, other than doing the interface in Python. I have also thought about implementing some logic on the webserver so it could send some data as a response that would trogger some change in the client’s behavios behavior. That would basically move the configuration from the tray menu to the thouchscreen display of the Pi. There are solutions, just think of what is best for your use-case!As for my reasoning, I think Python is more of a backend oriented language.

Problem solving skills above all else. Languages are the easy part, especially these days where like 70% of the main languages follow the same syntax and if you're able to use one, you'll get used to another one in a few days (OOP related). Besides that, most jobs not only ask for a language, but a specific set of technologies such as Docker + Kubernetes + GCP + Java + Spring Boot + PostgreSQL. Learning development isn't learning a language, it's learning to solve problems. How you solve those and which tools you use is another topic and most of the time you can choose between multiple tools to solve the same task. Another - in my opinion - important aspect is that you need to be able to explain complex tech heavy topics as simple as possible without using the word ""code"" once. Many companies work in agile environment with different products, roles and departments and you'll have a lot of meetings where you have to explain what you did in simple terms so that every PO understands it.

This is often why you saw a new programmer on a project rewrite the code. They couldn't understand the existing code. What these programmers didn't realize is they were writing code others couldn't follow, for the same reason. We know what we meant to do in our own code. There's a lot of code out there with little documentation, so it can be a pain to figure out what the code does unless it's very clean code.Unless you write horrible code, you're always going to prefer your code over others. Maybe if you wrote spaghetti code and someone is writing super clean code, you'd prefer reading, but I'd say that's uncommon.It's a necessary task.Oh yes, sometimes working with other people's code leads a person into rewriting vast parts because they didn't like how that person coded it up. Depending on the situation, that could be considered a waste of time.I had to work on legacy code where there were Java methods 2000 lines long, where the Java class was 20,000 lines long. *One class!*. It was a bunch of copy/paste and spaghetti code. But it would have been insane to rewrite it. First of all, it was hard to tell what the program was *supposed* to do. Second, it was so large that it would have taken a long time and been challenging to test.Indeed, we often asked our customers (non-programmers) to test manually (use the web applications). They wouldn't have time to do a good test (often hastily done and incomplete) because, guess what, they had other work to do.So, we had to live with not changing the code, or changing it in minimal ways.

You want everything right now and without effort. You probably spent more time searching for an effortless solution than just doing simple exercises.## How do you use FPThe answer is simple: if you want to ""edit something"", you create a copie with the new values you want.Imaging doubling the elements in a list. In procedural programming, like C, you would do: ```Cfor(int i = 0; i < myarray.size(); ++i) { myarray[i] = 2 * myarray[i]}```here you are modifying the content of `myarray` in place.If you use a comprehension, then you create a copy of the list```pythondoubledarray = [2 * x for x in myarray]```## Why FP ?FP isn't as popular as procedural/OOP, which is a shame IMO.FP has a lot of benefits, for example, the non-mutability helps the compilers to optimize, you also remove the need for synchronization primitives.But that's all there is to it. FP is also less prone to poorly written code.In procedural, people (not just juniors sadly..) wll just start to code without further thinking and will put `if` here, a `loop` there, now they get the data from the database, .. it becomes a mess hard to follow. This is because they declare ""how"" to do the changes: ""take this value here, change it, reassign it, ..)(Of course, there are coding guidelines like ""short-circuiting"" or ""input-data-output"" flow, but people don't know/respecr them all the time.)Instead of telling the computer ""how"" to do it, just tell it what you want: ""double the values in the list"".I always make the junior do a bit of FP when they start, this helps them take good habits",divad1196,2025-05-11 06:50:33,3,learnprogramming,t3_1kjdboe,False,

mrphv0n,"I see you have problems understanding the lack of mutability, let me try to help. First, conceptually.Since there's no mutability, if you have a state in your app, you need to explicitly pass it around. In the most basic way your functions would have a type like this doSomethingWithState:: BoardState -> (BoardState, a)This means, I took the old state of the app, then I generated a new state with the modifications I want, and a value related to whatever this function did. If all your functions have a type like that (accepting a state and retrieving one state with modifications) then all what you have to do to ""update"" a state, is to propagate to the functions the new state. If you think about it imperatively, you may get the sensation that they are wasting a lot of memory cloning the state. The truth is that a compiler would try to optimize this to mutate in place. What? Think about it, the compiler may see (in this imperative pseudo python code) def something(state): (newState, value1)= doSomething1(state) (newNewState, value2) = doSomething2(newState) return newNewStateAs long as value1 doesnt refer to something inside newState, the compiler can see that you used the `newState` only to pass as argument and is never refer again. So it can generate code that performs updates on newState to generate newState2. The compiler may choose to do this optimization or not. That's what it means that is declarative. You stated your desire to transmit the state of the app, the compiler chooses if it would remain inmutable, or not. You stated what the final effect is and the compiler filled the details. One example where mutability is nice: If you are parsing a string s, you want to try to parse something and restore the state if it fails, without immutability you need to explicitly clone the state before trying and restore it manually it after. With immutability you only need to use the old state that is still available. About nested loops, you use recursive function, you need to capture all the variables you are regularly mutating in your imperative loop. You put all of them in a state and that's what you pass around in your recursive calls, a state modified by your recursive function. def loop(state): (s2,a) = something(state) print(a) return loop(s2) def main(): state = makeInitialState() (endState,a)=loop(state) return aA more concrete example: def sumToNImperative(n): acc =0 for j in range(n): acc+=j return acc def sumToNPure(n): return sumToNPureAux(n,0) def sumToNPureAux(n,acc): if n>0: return sumToNPureAux(n-1, acc+1) else: return acc The nice thing is that with TCO the pure version can be compiled to the equivalent for loop. Again, the optimization can or cannot happen. That depends on the compiler chooses.",omega1612,2025-05-11 05:54:29,1,learnprogramming,t3_1kjdboe,False,

But have fun, break problems down to their core, figure out how to solve them and what knowledge you need to get them done.

Do i need frontend?""If your real goal is to work in AI, then picking up Django or diving into backend/frontend development might not be the right first move unless you're doing it just to get a job quickly. Let's try to untangle one of the most common knots. Stack accumulation is not directly related to CS learning process. So learning Django doesn't teach you software engineering, and ""learning backend"" doesn't automatically make you good at building systems or understanding how AI works. It just makes you... someone who knows Django.Stack accumulation is something needed AFTER you formed yourself, understood what you need and you're asking yourself ""what are the best, most common, tools we can use toward this?""Or if you want to become job ready on a specific path, pretty fast.But If you're serious about AI, you'd get way more value starting from the actual foundations: data, computation, algorithms, programming principles. Learn how software works, not just how to wire things together. Then, when you build something related to AI, you’ll know how and why it works. And how to improve it.TLDR, before picking stacks, pick a direction that teaches you how to think like a builder, not just how to glue tools together.

You have HTML and CSS locked in, JavaScript is definitely the next step.Here is a full-stack course that will teach you full-stack development from day one: [https://fullstackopen.com/en/about](https://fullstackopen.com/en/about) .

I give it the plan and just have it fill in some of the details.But even then, I have to check it very carefully. It quite often gets something wrong, especially the longer the code gets. Like, it might have two functions that both look right if you look at them separately, but if you look at the program overall you realize that one is interpreting a certain parameter exactly the opposite as the other one is.* How do you *stay intentional* while working with AI tools?I often add things to my prompt like: don't give me all of the code, just discuss the approaches. Or: before coding this, think of lots of clarifying questions and keep asking me them until you're confident that the spec is unambiguous.I like to help get the AI started, I define the class names, method names, and variable names as a starting point. It's really good at taking my lead and following a similar pattern. That way things are written the way I want, and mistakes jump out more than if it's not my style.* Do you treat AI output as a first draft, or as something to deeply understand and improve?Again, if I don't fully understand it, I don't trust it.

mrdgxwk,"I think most people here know at this point that AI can't do the whole job for us. It's excellent at code completion, i.e. guessing what you probably are going to write next. Anything beyond that and you have to be very skeptical with what it's giving you. It will confidently tell you exactly how to fix a problem, even if the solution isn't remotely correct. It's also an excellent rubber duck and sanity checker. Ask it small simple questions about syntax or common paradigms to refresh yourself. Always keep in mind it can be wrong, even on simple things, even when it sounds very confident, and think critically about its responses, don't trust it blindly. The thing about ""coding"" is that it's the easiest part of the job that is software development. AI can and often will write functional and efficient code for common problems, but your job as a developer is to figure out how solutions to common problems can come together to be a useful application/tool/interface. So use it to help speed you up on things you want to write, when you already know what you need to write, but don't rely on it to just magically know that right way to wire up a class to do something specific in a way that works with your application. One tip: I'm a big fan of asking AI to review the ""intent"" of my code. I'll ask it to examine a section of code and give me its impression of what it believes the developer who wrote the code was intending for it to do, and how they likely intended to use it. I do this to fact check myself, and make sure I didn't just spend a half hour writing nonsense that doesn't do anything remotely close to what I thought I wanted it to do. Again, always keep in mind it can be wrong, but use its response to figure out if an external viewer might see your code differently than how you do. It should be noted, comments and variable names can heavily skew the output sometimes. It's often not worth the effort, but I have occasionally deliberately obfuscated my code before asking it to review it, to make sure its impression isn't being colored by the hints in the naming or comments. The flip side of that is that sometimes you can ask it to identify when naming or comments are confusing in light of what the code is actually doing.",Enerbane,2025-05-09 05:30:43,5,learnprogramming,t3_1ki64b7,False,

mr3d3ru,"Whenever someone says ""possible"", they usually mean ""likely"". For example, someone could ask ""Is it possible to play in the NBA?"". The answer is ""Yes, it's possible, because people play in the NBA"", but it is nearly impossible for almost everyone.The odds that you can become a front-end developer are far greater than being in the NBA, which means it's hard to guess whether you can or can't. That's the risk you take. You have to be willing to spend time to get good regardless of whether you make it or not. There are hundreds of thousands of people that want to play in the NBA, and they try really hard. Fortunately, many can play at a much lower level (for fun, at a high school, in college, etc) and so they can gain some satisfaction in doing that even if they can't earn millions of dollars. They want to believe they can make it, which is why they try. You have to delude yourself that you can, until enough evidence presents itself that you can't (or you lose interest).A potential problem with your dream is why you haven't started it. If you are second-guessing yourself (""Should I do it or shouldn't I do it? What are the odds I will succeed?""), then you can run into trouble. Either you have to convince yourself that you are good enough to do it, or you have to say you're going to give it all you've got and not worry whether you're good enough or not because those kinds of worries just stop you from making progress.And really, that's the danger. Once you have doubts, and they start to impact whether you'll learn enough, that can stop you. If you had other goals like ""I want to write a small program to play checkers or a simpler game"" then those goals are more achievable right now.I would consider picking a smaller, reachable goal right no, such as, I'm going to spend 3 months taking some online programming course, and see how I feel.

It's easy to read it when you know all the context and all the considerations that are part of it, but you will eventually forget it. What happens then?* Is it easy to understand *why* something a code does something? For example, you do an if check for a specific value. Is the *reason* why we do this value clear? If it's not clear, then a comment should explain it.* Is the code efficient? No need to over-optimize, but we can at least not repeat things that don't need to be repeated. For example, if you need to fetch something that doesn't change during your flow, fetch it once and use it for all relevant operations, rather than fetching it over and over. Same can be said for complex calculations.* Is the code going to external APIs too often? Most APIs are rate limited, and you don't want to overdo it in order to prevent being blocked. Even if a single flow works, what happens if the flow is invoked a few times by multiple users? Some APIs also charge you for each API use, so you want to keep costs down.* Is the context of a flow clear? For example, say a user updates their details and clicks ""Save"". Is it easy to know what user triggered this flow, when, and how? How do you know you're not accidentally saving over the wrong user's data?* Logs and tests: this is for the real world rather for academic tests, but good to keep in mind. Are there useful logs placed in strategic locations in the code to make it easy to follow along a log trail if something goes wrong?

Technically I started with BASIC but I would say that Java was the first language I learned to code in at a professional level.If you have a particularly good reason, like somebody being able to support you, like you have described, then there is no real reason not to start there.That said, in isolation, I would say no. The language designers at Oracle have done a reasonable job of bringing the language up to modern expectations but there is a lot of history there and backwards compatibility to maintain and I think that has resulted in some less than optimal things.The Java platform (distinct from the language) is great, there is a huge ecosystem, lots of libraries and the JVM has some of the most clever engineering that you'll find anywhere. It's a nice platform, but if a person I knew was starting today, and wanted to learn Java platform development I would probably suggest Kotlin over Java. You can still use all of those tools and libraries and run on the JVM but I think it is a nicer way to express yourself and has some really useful features.Independent of even the JVM, i'd probably say that Python is perhaps the best absolute beginner choice. At the risk of upsetting some Python people, I think Python is the closest modern, widely used language to the BASIC that I started with. Obviously people use it for insanely complex stuff (ML in particular) but the syntax is pretty simple and the much maligned, 'meaningful whitespace' feature is actually not bad when it comes to instructing people on writing readable code. The people who complain about Python's indentation semantics are typically indenting their non-Python code in the same way, or their IDE is doing it for them.

mrs9dyx,"The general route is this: You need to know about 3 languages in this current reality, this will apply for the rest of your career:A. 1 language to take advantage of the hardware: C/C++/Rust/Go (If you're hardcore then choose Forth or Factor).B. 1 language to take advantage of pre-written libraries and eco-system: Python/Java/JavascriptC. 1 language for higher level Meta-programming: Common Lisp/Clojure/Scheme (Don't worry about Meta-programming too much as a beginner, it doesnt make sense until you are somewhat used to programming)The internet is runned on Javascript and Typescript, so you basically can't really ignore them. Python dominates the market at the moment despite slow af, just because it's simple enough and there are many libraries. My suggestion is to look at Clojure/Clojurescript, as they would give the most benefits for someone without any experience right now. The reason being Clojure is a Lisp that runs on the JVM. This way, you have the best of many worlds in one, you would have all the libraries of the Java ecosystem helping you. You then can use Clojure, which is a Lisp and is excellent for functional and meta programming, and Clojurescript compiled down to Javascript so you'll be able to leverage the webs too. (Without the need to master Javascript or Typescript, besides Clojure is much more flexible and powerful than both Javascript and Typescript)Another perk is that Clojure compiled down to Java also, so if you want to target the mobile phone too, it'll be a nice perk. Clojure's flexibility, capability and expressiveness will amaze you and ruin your taste for clunky languages.",Frenchslumber,2025-05-11 18:02:04,5,learnprogramming,t3_1kk6vz3,False,

mrwfjg7,"The general direction I’d suggest, especially if you’re in 12th grade and thinking long-term about building a startup, is to build a strong foundation across three types of programming tools, each opens up a different way of thinking and building: # A. A systems-level language (C, C++, or Rust)These aren’t beginner-friendly, but even a little exposure helps you understand how computers *really* work, memory, runtime, compilation. Rust is a good modern choice, safe, powerful, and increasingly relevant.# B. A general-purpose language with a rich ecosystemThis is where you’ll probably spend the most time. **Python** is a great choice here, simple syntax, huge ecosystem, and good for scripting, data, and automation. Alternatively, **JavaScript/TypeScript** is indispensable if you want to build anything for the web. # C. A language that stretches your thinkingIf you’re feeling curious, try a functional language like **Clojure**, **Scheme**, or **Haskell** later on. They’ll stretch your brain in all the right ways, especially around immutability and design. # On the tech startup sideIf you're dreaming of launching a product, the key thing is to **learn by building**. Tutorials are fine, but try to solve your own problems. Build a notes app. Build a tiny CMS. Build a budget tracker for your classmates.You’ll learn programming, but also:* What users care about (hint: not your code), * How to debug weird production issues, * What ""simple"" really means when you’re maintaining something alone. And along the way, don’t ignore the command line, basic Git, and Linux tooling. Those aren't trendy, but they’ll save you countless hours.When I started working on what eventually became my own startup, the early tech choices weren’t dictated by popularity or benchmarks; they were guided by how fast I could test ideas and how well I understood the tools I was using.

mry9sc3,"Start out with basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. These are going to form the fundamental understanding you need to move forward. Don't focus on frameworks like React for now. You should be able to create small, functional webpages that do different things, kinda like the Coding Train challenges on YouTube. It's also worth keeping in mind browser compatibility with stuff like this. When you feel comfortable with how to lay out a webpage, use Javascript on the back end using Node. This will let you run Javascript code on your computer separate from what you do in a webpage. A common use is a server that handles your databases or other heavy computation in the back end, then sending this data back to the front end using a library like Express to make APIs and then the Fetch API in the browser. You should also familiarise yourself with databases and SQL as a language for querying your databases. SQLite is a small, lightweight database you can use as you learn. A good capstone project here is a CRUD app. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete, which are all things you do with a database. You'll have an HTML/CSS front end, imagine for an online store the user can log into, and a database on the backend full of products, their prices, etc. The user using the store will click things, add to basket, whatever. That then interacts with an Express API on the back end that fetches or updates the data in the database. If you can do that, you'll understand quite a lot. Then go back to the front end and look at different frameworks like React, Angular or Vue. They are ways of organising your HTML and Javascript to make development way easier and more organised. New frameworks pop up everywhere all the time, so knowing how to compare and contrast them is valuable. Or just learn the one that's going to get you a job. Other areas of programming, like systems stuff, will use different languages that have their strengths and weaknesses. If you've gotten this far you should already have the skills to do this yourself and learn new languages quickly and form your own opinions.

So, in general, in real-world software, multithreading should be your last choice, not your first. There are other choices. To give you an overview of some other choices, read this (from the Kotlin programming language): https://kotlinlang.org/docs/async-programming.html Anyway, while we're talking about other choices, the Go programming language offers Goroutines. I think the Kotlin programming language also offers some sort of Coroutine type functionality. The Scala programming language offers The Actor Model in the form of Akka (you can search for ""Scala Akka"" or ""actor programming model"" for more information). Akka can also be used with recent versions of the Java programming language even though it was written in Scala (both Java and Scala run on the JVM). Microsoft and C# ported Akka over to their platform with Akka.NET . The Erlang programming language has its own implementation of the actor model which I assume is sort of similar to Akka. Also, a lot of programming languages (like Kotlin, Scala, and Haskell) offer some sort of parallel immutable data structures with built-in automatic multithreading. Oh, and in a lot of cases programming languages use async callbacks/promises, like JavaScript. C# has its own async keyword and await keyword for that purpose. The Scala programming language has its own implementation of Futures, which facilitates multithreading and asynchronous programming and is sort of like JavaScript callbacks/promises. Kotlin has a suspend keyword and libraries for working with that sort of asynchronous stuff.But yeah, in real world software, low-level multithreading should be your last resort, not your first.",Anonymous_Coder_1234,2025-05-11 06:16:18,3,learnprogramming,t3_1kjtyc1,False,

This is different in Rust, where suddenly changing to a multithreaded implementation will simply result in the compiler refusing to build the code until you fix everything, and this is also one of the reasons why I wonder why people are still choosing to start new projects in C++ these days.Regarding your specific problem, if you decide to listen to my advice and reimplement everything from scratch, I recommend looking up the Entity Component System architecture, which would greatly benefit your project, minimize potential threading problems (or completely eliminate them in the case of Rust), and maximize both CPU cache efficiency and thread parallelization.

mrbw5rs,"Nice website. I had a quick look and noticed a couple of things you can improve.I see you're loading the page via Javascript. There's a lag while the data is being fetched and then the page updates. During that lag, there's nothing to indicate that anything's happening.The low-grade way to fix this is to put a spinner or loading bar on page while you wait for the content to be fetched. The much better way of doing this is to render the page on the server. Modern frameworks allow you to do both without much difficulty, especially if you're using Node or Deno to serve your website, and you can also progressively load content over XHR now.I noticed that when I resized the window from a mobile width back to desktop width, the layout was odd. This implies that you're building the page with JS rather than relying on CSS media queries to lay the page out at different screen widths. Ah, `determineLayout` confirms it! You can do a lot more with CSS than you might realise.I see your firebase keys are in your JS config. I guess that means I can use your database at your expense? These should be on the server. At the very least, stick them inside a JWT.Your JS is nice and clean. The way you're populating the DOM is satisfactory for a site this small, but even here, you should be able to reuse components. For example, you have lots of functions that build back buttons (""back to categories"", back to foobar"", etc). Try and make a single function for that. See if there are other opportunities for code reuse.Also think about using the CSS `:hover`pseudo-selector to make it clear to the user what elements are interactive.

mr8phru,"I’m a software development manager, and I’ve had to give that kind of feedback before. The reality is, every task comes with drivers and constraints. If the business wants something done, it’s because it provides value—but that value only matters if the costs (like time and effort) don’t outweigh the benefits.If your manager brought this up, I hope they were direct about it. There should be no mystery here. Understanding the ""why"" behind the feedback is important: it's often about balancing quality with efficiency.Here’s how you can tackle it:1. **Improve your estimating skills.** Be realistic about how long tasks will take, and speak up if the deadline is too tight.2. **Include contingency in your estimates.** Plans rarely go perfectly—account for interruptions, unexpected challenges, and even just bad days.3. **Prioritize effectively.** Focus on the essentials first—what absolutely needs to get done. That way, if setbacks happen, you can adjust without missing the core requirements.4. **Apply the 80/20 rule.** Recognize that 20% of the work usually delivers 80% of the value. Tackle that first, and you’ll find the rest often falls into place more easily.Finally, self-assess and seek guidance. Understand your manager’s expectations, find a mentor for candid feedback, and always keep sharpening your skills—not just new ones, but fundamentals too.The goal isn’t just to avoid criticism; it’s to become more effective and confident in your work.**Addendum:** Before I get waves of criticism—yes, I did use AI to help generate this response.

mrfz2zh,"By the way, there are several types of executables, for each OS.You either have ""executables"" that are only meant to ever be invoked by an interpreter, that is, you first have to execute the interpreter before executing a bytecode program, like Python.Or you have real executables that are meant to be loaded natively by the OS, that are programs that follow the native rules, and also have the .text section (the actual code) in compiled machine code.Native executables follow executable and linking formats for their own operating systems. Linux uses .elf, MacOS uses Mach-O, Windows uses PE ( I might be referencing old info here ).An executable and linkable format usually contains 3 possible forms:1. An end executable, which is an object file that has been linked, and it holds several things, like .code section, .data section, can also hold dynamic data if it links against a dynamic lib.2. An archive or static library, which is an agglomerate of object files, that are solely meant to be used as files to be linked against during compile time.3. A dynamic library, which is an object file, with a special format, that allows it to be placed on some part of the memory, and allows any program to link against it during load time.How does the overall loading process occur? Well it's actually quite expensive and full of things. It contains things like creating a new process for the executable, then mapping the correct memory for that executable, placing MMU restrictions, linking against a dynamic library if the executable requires it, and many other things. I've never actually worked directly with loaders, so can't tell you for sure, but I am 100% sure it's doing all of these things, and probably even more.",mnelemos,2025-05-09 16:31:10,2,learnprogramming,t3_1kim97p,False,

ms26vtm,"Recently I freelanced for a UI-focused company, and I picked up some interesting practices from how they structure their frontend work. They use Tailwind for styling and Next.js for everything else. Here’s a breakdown of their approach:**Start with a clear theme**They rely on design tokens to keep things simple and consistent across the UI. It helps centralize color, spacing, and typography decisions early on.**Component architecture: two clear categories**- Templates:These are dumb components. They just display what’s passed in via props. No state, no logic. In Next.js, these are implemented as server components.- Traditional components:These do the heavy lifting: handle state, run computations, etc. They render templates and manage the layout. - **Avoid prop drilling by leaning into composition**Most components accept a children prop. That, combined with smart layout components, makes it easy to nest and compose without passing props down five layers.**Type safety everywhere**They use TypeScript, and schemas are defined using Zod.Types are derived from the Zod schemas, so you get strong typing and runtime validation in one go.**Always validate backend data**First thing they do with any data from the backend: run it through Zod. If it doesn’t match the schema, it gets rejected. This protects the app from unexpected API changes or malformed data.**Some of my own preferences that I mix in:**- For complex state, I like using a reducer.

mr9telq,"You said above $150k. The recruiter pushed you to $180k. There are only two things I can think of going on here.1. The recruiter is a real piece of shit and is putting their thumb on the scale by pushing you to $180k so that they can tell the hiring manager you are expensive, making the candidate that the *recruiter* favors more likely to get the job.2. The recruiter is looking out for your best interest and doing you a favor - even if you don't get an offer. Sometimes the recruiter knows that salary will not be a factor in the final hiring decision. When I've hired, whenever there were high quality interviews, salary was the last thing I or anyone in the process cared about. Getting the call right on picking a high performer was all that mattered. Salary was only a factor when all of the candidates were meh and you didn't think getting a high performer was a likely outcome.The reason for the dynamic in point 2 is simple. If you are a manager and hire a high performer, it makes what you deliver look good to your boss. In this scenario the boss will almost never care if the high performer's salary is high for the organization's salary bands or the salary is above market. It's the opposite. They will worry about retention if the salary is low. If you hire a mediocre performer, the boss will have questions.

The market is tough right now and you're going to have to suck it up and basically throw everything you have at this if you truly want it. Each thing your do here increases your chances of success: Before interviewing- leetcode hard, follow neetcode roadmap to fill in theoretical gaps in knowledge, once you have an interview focus on problems given from that company leading up to interview- time every leetcode problem to 40 minutes. Don't look up the answer until you finish the timer. Every single time you fail to solve a problem, work aggressively to ameliorate your weaknesses. - come up with a methodical problem solving process. Don't just change things and run them praying it works, get good at thinking about what you're going to do to your program and similating the output before even typing. Get good at running your own test cases against your code in your head rather than relying on printf debugging- get as many swe interviewers you can to give you mock interviews and giving you mock interviews- fill any gaps in your text stack that you may have (frontend should be angular, react, nextjs and typescript, backend should be Java , spring boot, postgres, mongo, redis)- brush up on AWS knowledge of core services including networking, security and databases, - build example projects that actually work and document them very well on your GitHub and publish live links to your portfolio site and GitHub. This is a good chance to combine both stack knowledge gaps and AWS knowledge gaps all in one shot- create a portfolio siteSomewhere in the middle of the above after some leetcode and projects are under your belt:- dont be as stringent about pay- expand the set of rules you're searching for (i.e. SWE, SDE, SDET, full stack, backend, frontend, SRE, ops, devops, etc...)- be willing to relocate- get as many swe interviewers reading your resume as you can- ensure your indeed, LinkedIn and resume are fully beefed up and peer-reviewed- don't just cold apply. That's completely useless. Cold message recruiters, hiring managers, team members, random recruiters / hiring managers on LinkedIn, connect with family members, old colleagues, old peers, anyone and everyone. Don't seem too desperate, don't ask strangers for referrals. - always smile, be punctual, dress appropriately, take your time, make the interviewers feel comfortable like it's a conversation and not an interview, show no ego whatsoever, appear extremely eager to learn, admit when you don't know something rather than guess and embarrass yourself, have a list of thought provoking and insightful questions to dazzle interviewers, and AGGRESSIVELY ask for feedback and FERVENTLY correct all of your mistakes every single interview, after enough interviews there will be no more mistakes left. Most importantly...- keep your head up, realize that if you keep trusting in the process you will come out ahead.

You shouldn’t be asking if your experience gets you $X, but rather if your resume (and interview skills) can get you into a FAANG-level company. Given the job market, this means you need something that makes you stand out on paper and in person. Also, I would recommend not doing a PhD unless you’re really, really passionate.

This means you need to be competitive in your lab/department to retain funding if anything gets impacted.Also, maybe it’s an anecdotal experience, but all the professors I’ve talked to said it’s a slight red flag to do a PhD at the same undergraduate school since you want to diversify your research and education.",s118827,2025-05-11 19:29:57,36,cscareerquestions,t3_1kk87tz,False,

mr2oq2k,"I've worked at 3 Fortune 100 companies - so, large companies.The only job postings that I think would qualify are when someone posts a job that is intended for an internal hire. That is when a team has decided to create a job to make a career move for an employee (maybe a promotion, maybe a diagonal move), and in order to create that new role - even if they intend to hire internally - they need to (by law) post the job publicly and have that posting up for at least some amount of time before hiring.EDIT: u/ImSuperHelpful is correct - it's not by law, but it seems to be a very popular policy at a lot of companies to prevent nepotism/encourage diversity. It's been the case at every large company I have worked at. I also wonder if it helps to prevent potential lawsuits for discrimination.The idea of having posts out there that the company does not intend to hire for generally doesn't fly at most companies because the entire process of creating a job posting starts with actually getting a real job approved first.It's also why recruiters can't just create a job posting to look busy - again, it would be the hiring manager (i..e, the person who owns the team where the new employee would work) that would need to get the job itself approved by his leadership before HR and recruiters get involved.Now, I don't doubt that there are some companies that do that - I think that might be true for super mega large companies like Meta, Microsoft - and that is to have a generic job posting meant to attract candidates for a large swath of jobs, but without necessarily having a job opening right this moment. But I think that's a minority of companies that do that.I think as someone else said, the other source of issues might be 3rd party recruiters posting fake jobs to farm resumes - but those should be easy to spot because they wouldn't actually tie to a real company's job posting.I think the reality is that a lot of this job postings are real - there's just so many applicants (including internal ones), that it probably feels like they're fake.",dfphd,2025-05-07 14:49:12,15,cscareerquestions,t3_1kgxzpn,False,

Without a degree, and without experience, practically no company in America will hire you for a CS related job.

Why would a company do the effort to evaluate you, when they can spend that effort interviewing people with a CS degree. Maybe in the future, something like this and bootcamps will be viable again. But I don't see that happening anytime soon. If you want to work in this field, you need a degree at the bare minimum. Something like WGU would at least get you past the automated resume checker.

People do get lucky, and I mean lucky, and get jobs without degrees, but it’s few and far between currently. To note, I am only talking about post 2022 to present. Before 2022, the need for junior level developers was a lot higher, but with outsourcing and AI, junior level tasks no longer need an associate to complete. Not to mention during Covid, overhiring was ramped and some companies are still trimming the fat with layoffs.As a graduate you are expected to have atleast one internship under your belt, with a year of experience, and a deep understanding of CS. CsMajors who lack a portfolio or skills will not make it through technical interviews but will beat out ATS filtering because of the degree. I would say also, the notion the average CS major can’t code is relatively false on average, an average CS graduate is relatively capable, but there is roughly bottom 20% who are completely lost. Now keep in mind there are fewer jobs in SWE then their used to be, and more CS graduates both in Bachelors and Masters programs then ever before. Most good companies will receive 100s of applicants and have only 2 jobs available. From a business perspective, why not filter by degrees and get an academically strong candidate with experience and a portfolio. To beat this out you will likely need a strong open source portfolio, with live production level applications and very good networking, I can not emphasize this enough, without a degree you will need to be well networked. It’s possible but it is an uphill battle often as you don’t have the resources of college students or a piece of paper saying you know what you know.

You don’t need to pick a major right away, and you should explore that especially in the first year or so.2. I would say, you should ask yourself what is something YOU would want to build, and try to find resources online that tell you how to build it. It doesn’t have to be anything crazy, maybe a small tip calculator project or something. If it’s something you can figure out, and you find that you enjoy doing it, then there’s a good chance that you’ll enjoy a career in CS and could potentially figure it out in time. If you find that it’s too confusing to do even a small simple project or that you absolutely hated doing it, then this is probably not the career for you. Most engineers would tell you, the reason they enjoy CS is that feeling you get when you spent hours trying to figure out how to do that one thing and FINALLY figure it out. There is no better feeling. The reason I got into programming was because I liked making mods for games.3. Explore IT a bit too, look into networking, security, hardware, etc. I’m not in IT, so I can’t give you as much advice on it.

New grads were easily breaking in, experienced devs were job hopping for insane salary increases... it was chaos.I ask because this is a very different conversation if most of your applying happened in 2020 (bad market from covid), and 2023-2025 (bad market thanks to 2021-2022), versus if you were trying in the golden era.If you were trying in the golden era with a CS degere and weren't getting interviews... something's very wrong. I have some complaints about your resume (that might be more relevant in todays market), but none that would warrant 0 responses in the golden era, it's not *that* bad. One thing I would definitely do is remove your Civil Engineering degree. Generally you only want to list *relevant* skills/qualifications on your resume. While getting that degree is an impressive feat, it's not relevant if you want to be a SWE. I'd give the same advice about your sales experience, you can keep that there, but you should be leaning into the soft-skills side of it to tie it back to something employers value in a SWE. Exceeding sales targets is not relevant to being a SWE. But I bet you picked up some really strong communication skills from that role, talk about *that.* Try reading through your whole resume with that in mind: ""What am I trying to communicate to the reader here? Is this relevant to SWE?"".What kinds of roles were you applying to? Were you just applying to roles grossly outside your qualifications? What kinds of companies? Large F500 companies are much more likely to hire new grads than small companies for example., if your search was focused on small companies in your local town that could be a problem.

mrd79vl,"If by ""big tech"", you're also thinking of FANG, I can speak to that as I was in a similar situation in my career. I've made the transition from startups and mid-sized, low-billions-valuation companies to FANG. It wasn't hard for me to get interviews, as this was many years ago when FANG recruiters would reach out on LinkedIn and such. It was harder to get offers (there's more luck involved than anyone tells you), but I managed to do it by Leetcoding and really trying to understand the algorithms and patterns instead of memorizing solutions. There has been Leetcode escalation since my time there, but I don't have enough interview experience these days to tell you how much.I think if you're just in it for the TC and/or life experience to be at a FANG/Fortune 5 company first hand, then definitely at least try it so you don't feel like you missed something. I'm glad I did just so I knew what it was like.I would recommend against it if you are expecting to seriously level up your dev game. If you're already a highly productive dev at your company and you deliver things faster than your peers and understand all of the tradeoffs of your tech, then you probably won't learn as much as you might think. You'll probably just learn how to use their old, custom tools that solve the same problems you've already solved at your startup but with more popular, open-source tools. Some of what you hear about crazy WLB is because at one point (and maybe still, I don't know) FANG was hiring a ton of new grads who didn't know anything and then were dropped in the deep end. I wasn't at FANG very long, but I still saw many interns and new grad hires cycle through my team and it seemed like a lot of what they didn't like were just things they didn't know because they had no other work experience.I can't say it was the right move career wise because I'm personally of the belief that FANG doesn't have the reputation it once had and could be off-putting to some in this hyper-polarized society we live in now. Many of my teammates at a local company would actively trash FANG and viewed people who worked there as being active and willing participants in hurting society (not joking). At the very least, I suspect saying you worked at FANG today will be kind of like hearing another dev tell you about how they worked at Yahoo in the '90s.

mrrwgzp,Assets tell about green flags when looking on joining a startup 0. Most startups die because they self destruct. It has nothing to do with competition or getting blown out of the water. It happens because someone made a bad decision or couldn’t sell to client. There is no crystal ball these are just table stakes for things that make me want to join a firm. YMMV 1. Team has done it before and have some experience - this is gonna be the biggest one for me as a white beard. If these are noobs who have never done this before and they don’t have their stuff together I usually say no thanks. 2. Funding. Is know ln and shared - if there is any outside funding I want to make sure there is ramp and they are open with it. If the total $ isn’t shared and I have no idea how much people are making then no thanks. 3. Competition - having someone you can directly compete against is a good thing because it means you aren’t going to be pivoting daily. 4. Clients - this is the biggest thing for me. If I’m building something that my clients want and have hired us and recommended us to their friends I’m all over this.

Base pay was an extra 30k but with bonuses and RSUS it was closer to an exrtr 70k for the next few years.
