mn9kq3j,"Completely depends on the goals of the data platform, SLAs for those goals, skillset of the users/developers, and how you plan to serve. Those generally dictate what would be best. Objectively speaking, a DL/DLH offers the most flexibility and range of technologies. Many services, cloud providers, and other stacks will work natively with open formats in a DL/DLH. So you can always leverage or pivot different technologies. And it’s a lot more forgiving in an architecture choice. You can mix and match lots of different stacks on the same data if desired. When talking with customers and users, this is typically the place we start for the above reasons. DWH on RDBMS or similar technologies are usually proprietary formats. Like SQL, Oracle, Snowflake, etc. Assuming you are not leveraging newer features to store in open formats. That isn’t meant to discourage or trash DWH it’s just you need to understand the goals of the platform, requirements, and how users consume and develop to see what would be best. For example, the above about DL/DLH are objectively better at transformation engines and scalability. However, if your users eat and breathe TSQL, and refuse to learn anything else. Then Spark or DL/DLH might not be a solution that would be right for that team or platform.

Similar to a degenerate dimension like a source system unique key - does it go on the fact or a separate dim? Well, if it’s a unique value per fact row (ie: it’s 1:1 with fact) then it should go on the fact, not in a dim.

Is there a solid business justification for increasing the cost and complexity?Additionally, once you set the expectation for real time, even if end users don’t need it, it is very hard to walk back from that since they then think they need it.I say all of this as a cautionary tale because I’ve seen Data Engineering teams get into hot water over “cause sTrEaMiNg” because costs increase and it takes longer to deliver features stakeholders have requested.",teh_zeno,2025-04-16 20:09:27,18,dataengineering,t3_1k0t6ua,False,

That can be handled by periodically doing a compaction on the files. A compaction can be run at the same time as blind inserts -- they don't conflict with each other.But this is all fine on a scale up to writing every second or so. If you're *constantly* making tiny writes and inserts then you're crossing more into streaming territory. If you can receive your data through a stream (or queue) then you can buffer up writes for a while then bulk write them to iceberg. AWS Data Firehose and Azure Event Hubs can do some of this for you automatically - each has a capability to automatically write all streamed data out to data files every time a buffer threshold is reached (up to ~15 minutes / ~300MB, whichever is first). If you don't need ultra-low latency queries, then these can work, and generally if you're working off of some open table format your queries have a certain minimum latency anyway.---The post you read may be talking about something like [Databricks autoloader](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ingestion/cloud-object-storage/auto-loader/). If anything else automatically does this for you it will have to be part of the execution & orchestration engine that you're working on. It *needs* some kind of eventing system and metadata-storing db to track everything. Iceberg is just a table format spec, not an ingestion engine of its own.Whatever it is it will basically be catching blob triggers and writing their data into a managed low latency db, then periodically grabbing any unprocessed files and batch loading them. It isn't super difficult to roll your own, but there's a few components and you'll have to reason things out yourself around managing the state for un/processed file metadata.",azirale,2025-04-13 02:59:24,11,dataengineering,t3_1jxun0q,False,

mn1j8zr,"I could definitely see it help with enabling semantic search and being data backend for MCP servers.But I still think a critical important problem still stands; raw event streams typically lack semantic meaning and contextual intent.

No more migrations, no manual backfills, no fragile one-off scripts, no emergency data recovery jobs, no writing painful ETL pipelines just to restructure your data — you simply reshape your models and press replay.

We worked with a Faroese company information platform that pushed all their raw events into Flowcore — and even though the events were pretty basic (like CRUD changes and updates), we were able to layer meaning on top during replay to build dedicated AI-optimized models. The result was that they now have an AI chat interface where users can ask super abstract questions, like *“Which municipality had the most new companies in 2024?”* or *“Tell me about this specific person and all the companies they’re involved in”* — and it just works.

Not too many moving parts and no core dependency on Kafka. We could easily operationalize in our small infra team. 5. Community support on Slack is amazing. Some issues we reported were fixed immediately in the next release (our previous paid solution did not provide such support after paying a lot of money). 6.

There are more controls in the cloud for access control and security than I have seen in anyone's data center and I have seen many Fortune 100 companies data centers.

The bandwidth between on-premises and cloud is never enough. Consider bouncing a 1TB table at one location against a 1TB table at a different location. Even with tricks like predicate pushdown and column reduction, you will still end up moving quite a bit of data to compare/join the tables. That has to happen over a WAN instead of an internal bus.

mn6gt4o,Dataverse is essentially azure SQL for noobs. The knowledge barrier for entry is much lower for a neophyte. You can do essentially everything without coding or minimal coding whereas azure SQL you'll be building a database with code by code.Beyond that you're going to have to get familiar with azure portal and azure tools versus dynamics/dataverse etc. azure portal is in general much more complex than the latter.Azure SQL will shine when you have more experience and are in need of more throughput. An example being dataverse handles queries through fetch xml which is rather slow and clunky versus a traditional SQL query you can execute in azure. Relationships between tables is also annoying and superficial in dataverse.If you are new dataverse is a good POC platform until you outgrow it.,lysis_,2025-04-15 03:48:44,5,dataengineering,t3_1jzi6u4,False,

mn3t969,"Some hard-won advice on this topic: 1. Have a good working relationship with your manager. Build trust. This will ensure they _actually hear you_ when you ask to take on opportunities to push yourself. Pushing yourself without this trust can cause your manager to view you as self-sabotaging (causing delays, ""biting off more than they can chew""), which makes everything harder. 2. Identify the developers on your team (or close to your team, this includes DevOps, architects, and even senior QA) who actually care about the quality of their work. Like someone else in this thread said, many people work in software simply because of the pay. Sometimes the ""this is just a job"" people are very talented engineers, but it's not as likely. When you find the people who really care, pair with them on your work, go to them with questions, etc. 3. Don't waste time, but ask questions when you can. In particular, if someone more experienced than you has work you can look at (e.g. in a pull request), and their implementation doesn't line up with how you would have approached the problem, ask them (politely/when it's convenient) to help you understand why they chose their approach vs your ""obvious"" approach. A major strength of more senior engineers is their ability to perceive/understand complicating factors, with nuance (see the last sentence in #4). A word of warning here... don't ask endless follow-up questions/don't get really in the weeds on every little thing. You run the risk of being seen as overly pedantic, nitpicking, or wasting time (for the pull request example, keep in mind that often the PR is only a final ""does this make sense to everyone?"" check before merging new code. So a developer might not appreciate having long conversations on every PR. For this reason, having a conversation or DMing them is often better than leaving a vague question as a PR comment). 4. Get involved in the design process as _early_ as possible. If you have the opportunity to sit-in on a meeting with an architect/dev lead while they design a new feature/project/service, _do it_. You won't be able to contribute (probably), and that is fine. But especially if these people are the ones you identified in #2, watching them work through a complex problem from the beginning will be a great learning experience. A big part of having engineering expertise is knowing what's important vs what is not important to the actual business requirement(s) (especially as it relates to the existing constraints of your application), not just knowing the ins and outs of your language/framework. 5. Talk to your coworkers about the work and build up your reputation as someone who cares. When you discover cool language features or software development practices, bring them up with people (""I found this cool HN article the other day talking about , do we use that here?""). Then, when other devs are working on something new, they'll think ""I bet /u/Spiritual_Donkey_521 would love to hear about this.""

mmwvpnr,"This is a great question.The short answer is that they do easy tricks, like replacing a multiplication by 0. They don't do many for complex tricks because analyzing the number to see if the trick applies would take longer than just computing the answer.So how fast can a modern processor ""grind everything out"" for something like an integer multiplication?The important thing to understand is that it's hard-coded in circuitry. It doesn't have to execute a bunch of steps to multiply, one at a time - the circuits are right there in the chip and they parallelize as much as possible.That said, multiplication is not instantaneous. On a modern processor you can expect it to take 3 - 5 clock cycles, whereas something like addition can be done in 1 clock cycle.So, it is worth checking for some really easy tricks like multiplying by 1 or 0. Maybe multiplying by 2 even. Those checks are simple enough that the processor can detect them when decoding the instruction and shift it to another instruction, and that's exactly what's done.But, there are a lot of ""tricks"" that humans use to save time that wouldn't make sense for computer processors, because they can just ""grind out"" the answer faster than checking it.In general when you write code in a language like C or Python, the compiler/interpreter does some easy optimizations, and then your processor does some easy optimizations. Neither of them are likely to do tricky optimizations - they're usually just not worth the cost.There are specialized mathematical programming environments, like Mathematica, where using number theory and other advanced tricks are possible.",dmazzoni,2025-04-13 15:55:37,8,learnprogramming,t3_1jya33j,False,

mmwuwza,"Truthfully at it's most basic they are not doing ""math"" they are just changing electrical state.Someone figured out what logic needed to be applied to produce the sum of two binary numbers. So if you add 01 and 01 you get 10, if you add 10 and 01 you get 11. So you can look at this as a truth table. For the first bit if you have:0 + 0 = 0 1 + 0 = 1 0 + 1 = 1 1 + 1 = 0 (with a carry)Electrically this is a xor circuit. If they are both 0 or 1 the first bit of the sum is 0, if the are different values then the first bit of the sum is 1. Now for the second bit of the sum you have the logic:If there is no carry from the first bit, xor the second bits. If there is a carry then you now have the truth table:0 + 0 = 1 0 + 1 = 0 (with a carry) 1 + 0 = 0 (with a carry) 1 + 1 = 1 (with a carry)Remember that there is carry you have an additional 1 coming it. This truth table is a xor and a not. Now you can add in the logic for the 3rd bit and so on.You might want to read: [https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb\_7.html](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb_7.html) which appears to give a good description of a binary adder.As for shifting instead of multiplications all I can answer is probably not. This is because it would increase the time to do most of the multiplications, because now you have a first step of checking if only 1 bit is set on one of the numbers then do a shift, otherwise continue with the multiplication. That check is only going to help rarely, and the check does take time.Now with a computer the compiler might notice that you are always multiplying a number by a constant like 16 and insert a shift instruction into the output rather than doing a multiplication. But that means you are always multiplying some number not known at compile time by a constant that is a power of 2. Most compilers will actually do all the math it can during compile time so if you have it calculate x \* (1 + 3) / 2 then the compiler might look at that say oh, you want really want to just multiple by 2, oh that is a power of 16, you just want to shift by one, rather than making the computer always add 1 + 3 multiple that by the input value then divide by 2.",pixel293,2025-04-13 15:51:29,8,learnprogramming,t3_1jya33j,False,

So when trying to sort by distance developers will just skip the square root and find the smallest dX\^2+dY\^2+dZ\^2.Other than that: compilers will do all kinds to tricks to reduce complexity, which is done with optimisation loops.e.g. constant folding.

mmq9vt5,"Have you ever completed a course by yourself? The reason I ask is because there's a reason people go to university and major in computer science. This content isn't easy. Keep in mind, in the US, it takes 4 years to graduate with a CS degree.To be fair, in the US, you have to take a bunch of other courses. Maybe 1/4 of your courses are CS courses, and the rest are some related courses (say, in math and sciences) plus more general education (humanities such as history and English).Even so, there's a linearity to the CS curriculum where certain courses are taken before others. Much of which courses you focus on will depend on your goals. In any case, if you want to master this, you could go back to school. Yes, unrealistic, but as pointed out earlier, it's tough for CS majors to complete this curriculum with decent grades. They have the added benefit of time, friends, teaching assistants, professors, and perhaps even free tutoring (or paid tutoring). CS majors are often under time pressure to learn this material so some feel, even after a semester, that they missed stuff along the way.OK, now to address your question, this is my opinion on what to take.1. Discrete Math * This is a precursor to data structures and algorithms. I would say it's not fully required. Discrete math, in my opinion, should be a course where you learn how to do mathematical proofs. Specifically, direct proofs, proof by contradiction, and the various induction proofs (weak, strong, structural). It should also cover formal logic, in particular, propositional and predicate calculus. The rest of discrete math is a bunch of topics where you can apply your knowledge of proofs. Many self-taught learners tend to skip this and head into DSA, and that can work too.1. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) * If you were to take a real courses in DSA, especially algorithms, then you'd do work on solving recurrence relations. This is the math behind big O notation. Otherwise, you could skip that, and just know certain algorithms O(n) or O(lg n) or whatever. It would help to work out book problems, but I think implementing the various data structures and algorithms is educational. For example, I don't use pointers for work (at least, not to build linked data structures).1. Computer Architecture * I taught this a number of times. My current belief is the goal of a computer architecture course is to show you can build a CPU that can run a simple assembly language out of a clock, a flip-flop (a one-bit register), and logic gates. I had envisioned the class building this in software, but never got around to doing that. Personally, I think CS majors learn that the computer isn't completely magic (yes, it does do a lot) and realize, yes, 0's and 1's can make a program do something.Beyond that, I think you can read about the rest (e.g., computer networking and operating systems). I've taken OS before, so building something (again, super simple) is interesting, but you realize that real OSes are extremely complex, but at its core, it's something you can understand if you strip it to its bare essentials.The question, should you choose to study this, is how much time you can devote to this, and how deeply do you want to study it given a lack of resources. If you can find some online courses offered through a reputable university (you wouldn't get credit, but you could follow the content), then that can help structure your learning.At this point, you need to pick an initial starting point, which is probably data structures and algorithms as that's the most pertinent and comes up in job interviews.",CodeTinkerer,2025-04-12 13:26:54,11,learnprogramming,t3_1jxera8,False,

What language, and libraries do you have to or want to use? Systems development? What tools do you want to build and what hardware will you be supporting? One reason people get hung up on where to start is they don't know what road they are on or even where they want to go. Answering these question will narrow things down considerably. Once you know what road you're on, pick a destination that interests you, something that you would enjoy building and may even use yourself when you're done. If you want to get even more spicy then build something for someone else to their specs. Once you've determined your environment and what you're building then start small and keep building. Most big projects are a series of smaller projects that are fit together to form a whole. List what you need in the order that you will need it. For example, a website to provide a public bulletin board would need:1 ) A landing page that explains the purpose of the website2 ) A login page that consists of a page to create a login, a page to actually login once a login is created and a page to recover a forgotten password. 3 ) An admin page that allows a user create, modify and cancel their postings4 ) A postings page that shows the postings from the various users.That's a simple example, and far from complete, but you get the idea.

mmq3g8j,"When you call a function, you are asking for something. Return is how the function gives you what you ask for.Take some code like:```function timesTwo(int i) int { return i * 2;}```This is a function, which means it can be called from other places. It has an `int` *argument*, `i`; this means that, whenever someone wants to call this function, they will have to supply some int to be used in place of `i`. The final `int` after the right parenthesis denotes the *return type*. In other words, whenever you call this function, you are *asking for an int*. So, in all, the function represents a sort of contract: I give you an int, and you give me an int back.Here's how you might use this function:```int x = 5;int y = timesTwo(x);```What's going on here? You have an `int`, `x`. Then you initialize another `int`, `y`, and assign it to *the result of the function call*. As we said, calling timesTwo means supplying an int, and then receiving one in return. Here we are supplying `x` - that is, `5`.`timesTwo` receives `5` and uses it in place of `i` in the function body, so we can read the return statement as `return 5 * 2` which evaluates to `return 10`.Now, timesTwo promised its caller that it would give it back an int, and that is exactly what `return` does - it gives `10` back as the result of the call and gives control back to the caller, which assigns the returned value to `y`.Essentially, the return type of a function allows you to use a call to that function *as* a value of the return type in most places in your code, because the return type is essentially a promise that the function will give you a value to use there. `Return` is how functions actually make good on that promise.",Technologenesis,2025-04-12 12:45:07,177,learnprogramming,t3_1jxg1zu,False,

You usually don't use classes in Python, but you will need to structure the classes. Think of the Service Class as the class that defines the functions you use in the Application Class. The Application Class is supposed to be the one that is run and will provide the UI and functions that are built on the Service Class. 2. Learn How to Use UML Diagrams. UML Diagrams will be very useful in the long run as they tell you all the functions you need to program with. Here's an example structure: \------------------------------------------------ | Class Name | \------------------------------------------------ | Variables in the Constructor | \------------------------------------------------ | Functions in the Class | \------------------------------------------------3. Think of the Language as Python, but instead of tabs, you use curly braces {}. You also must not forget to add the include for the scanner. The scanner is like the iostream C++ library. It provides functions used to take in input. Make sure to reference the scanner by using Scanner scannerName = new Scanner(System.in); So those are my tips.

Per the definition of big-O, that would mean that there exists some positive integers M and c₀ where c^(k+1) ≤ Mc^k for all c ≥ c₀.We can simplify this inequality by dividing both sides by c^k to give us c ≤ M. (Note that we don't have to worry about accidentally dividing by zero, since we can safely assume all variables are positive, per the definition of Big-O and our constraint on c₀).But, this inequality c ≤ M results in a contradiction: c can grow forever, so clearly cannot remain less then our constant M. Therefore, c^(k+1) ∊ O(cᵏ) cannot be true, which in turn means that O(c^(k+1)) cannot be a subset of O(cᵏ).

mn3yibn,"Big-O notation defines the **asymptotic upper bound** for the running time of an algorithm/function. Let us first look at the second case ie **O(c\*(k + 1)) Vs O(c\*k)**. Here, **O(c\*(k+1)) = O(c\*k + c)**. Here, **c\*k > c ie c\*k** will be **asymptotically bigger** than **c ,** because c,k are variables and nonetheless will be positive, and since in Big-O, we care about the dominant term, therefore it will be **equal** to **O(c\*k**). An example can be c = 10 and k = 10. c\*k = 10\*10 = 100. c \* (k+1) = 10 \* 11 = 110, which is asymptotically equal. However, for the other case ie **O(c\^k) Vs O(c \^(k+1))** ; here **O(c\^(k+1)) = O(c \* c \^ k)**. However , c is a variable and **not** a constant. Therefore, **c\^(k+1)** is **not** asymptotically same as **c\^k**. Therefore, **O(c\^k)** and **O(c \^(k+1))** are **not equal.** An example can be c = 10 and k = 4 . c\^k = 10\^4 and c\^(k+1) = 10\^5 ; a **10 times** increase in the running time**.** This is my interpretation , I could be wrong as well. Please correct if my approach is wrong. (Also, note that though c,k are input variables, when we use them in Big O , it is expected that they are large positive values, because we care about the asymptotic growth as the input size gets large. So all inputs are expected to grow larger and larger. For people who are not familiar with the word 'asymptotic', in general it means that how fast the running time will grow when input size increases. Take two functions : n\^2 and n , where n is the input. For some duration, n\^2 and n will run in parallel, but as n increases, n\^2 will grow rapidly compared to n , then we say that n\^2 is asympototically larger than n. )",Glass-Captain4335,2025-04-14 19:07:17,5,learnprogramming,t3_1jz1oep,False,

mmy5t6k,"Well, this takes a rudimentary understanding of generative AI, especially image generation. Unless you have a reasonably powerful Nvidia GPU it can be a bit challenging but I can sum it up for you. Get comfy ui and watch a few quick tutorials about it. Then learn about something called ""IP adapter"". Basically, it allows you to take an image and upload it to comfy UI to create images based on the likeness of the uploaded image.The models you use are open free to download from within the comfy UI GUI. Most people use stable diffusion, but if you have a really powerful GPUs like 4090/3090 you can use Flux. Or, if you're looking for something specific (stylistic artistic styles) you can check out civitai.com (huggingface for image generation). You can find a wide variety of LoRAs (sort of like really fine tuned mini models) for exactly what you're looking for. After typing this out, I would probably avoid going too deep down this rabbit hole if you only have 15 days. As for the video generation, I don't have a lot of experience with video generation models, but diffusion generative AI (video generation) is very similar to image generation as far as I know. So, I imagine there are models that exist that can operate with IP adapter etc. However, image generation is very computationally expensive and video generation just takes it to another level. If you don't have access to powerful GPUs, look into some of the virtual machine services. They are fairly cheap, maybe a couple dollars per hour or find a way to use a free Google Collab for compute. Then, just spool up python and create a gradio web UI for the user to do all of this connected through API. It sounds like a lot, and it kind of is, but you could definitely pull it off in 15 days.This is a weird way to do a hackathon, IMO. Mostly because they're giving you what they want the result to be.

So if user data is leaked I still can't use it.If the client hashes the password then I would be able to login with a leaked hash so hashing is pointless.With regards to your own staff, you should segregate access so that people can see only the data they need to do their job.

It's absolutely easy to modify data sent by a client. If an attacker gets access to a database with the hashed passwords, they could just make a dummy client just directly send each hashed password and get access to every single account. If the hashing is done server-side and an attacker gets access to the database, the hashed passwords are useless since they don't know people's original passwords which will be put through the hash. If you really really are worried you can hash both client side and server side using two completely separate cryptographically secure hashing systems. However this doesn't add very much security - if a hacker compromises an individual's password they can still run the hash, or if they compromise the hash they can just send it directly as a dummy client. The only thing you're protecting is a potential client trust (e.g. what if they're storing the passwords in plaintext?). However regulations state that you can't store or print the passwords anywhere and any trustworthy company does not do this, just receiving the password as regular text, hashing to store/check, and immediately forgetting the text.",Spare-Plum,2025-04-13 08:49:10,9,learnprogramming,t3_1jy2cla,False,
mmyu9f7,"Thank you all for clarifying this for me! I'm hashing server side then, as many of you pointed out it's safer. Few things, though: \- The system I have in place in my schematics has three parts: Clients, Private Nodes (Personal servers), and a Supernode (Global server). \- Each server has a global identifier (to report to supernode and truly identify each user) and a local identifier to keep each user's identity hidden. Only time an admin gets to access serverside data is when a user is banned/suspended (because in this enviroment it means you either put the server's security at risk or repeatedly violated TOS/Server TOS) and the data is needed for the administrators (namely the owner of the server, for other purposes there is a separate security role called moderators, whom get lots less info for the exact reasons some of you pointed out) to debug what exactly did you break. My best guess was to save the password as the hash to prevent the server from knowing the exact password. \- I'm not in the US, so my laws aren't the same, but this was a big oversight in my part and I'd like to apologize for it. Still, all shared info in that regard has been useful, so for that I thank you all.For one final question, though: If the server does not know the password, how do I actually check password veracity?

Role Based Access Control is your friend here. Passwords could also be stored in a separate database with very restricted access. \- access to sensitive data - this highly depends on what kind of data we're talking about and where you are operating since local laws and regulations apply.

mmveo0w,"Server-side hashed passwords aren't going to reveal any information as long as the password isn't stored. For ""who can see data they don't need to"", it's largely industry based and based on legal restrictions on who can see what data. Though it's ideal that developers only get access to the information they need to test and debug their code, this isn't always necessary. Adding a bunch of restrictions will make it harder for the developers for a slight amount of added trust.For HIPAA compliance developers may see patient records and information to debug stuff and work on code and features, but the data that they see cannot contain personally identifiable information like name/email address/phone number/home address. Since there are also people working on the login portion and might need to see this information, there's a separation or ""iron curtain"" in place where the people who work with systems that handle personally identifiable information cannot have access to medical records or information. Other industries just make you ""promise really really hard"" under the consequence of huge lawsuits and financial repercussions. Like if you're working at a bank you might get information that Apple is executing an order to sell $1 billion of USD over the course of 3 days, or even non-public information about acquisitions and mergers. Not everyone has access to this information at the bank however, just the people working on the computer systems or on the deals. A person could potentially abuse this and frontrun their own trades or hand the information off to a relative. However IMO the stakes are too high to do this in nearly every case, and everyone that has access to this non-public information has a restriction on buying individual stocks, commodities contracts, or large amounts of any currency without explicit approval from compliance.I don't know about the realm of modern laws for social media, but I do know at one point in time there was a creepy Facebook employee that was using their position and access to data stalk a user. Since then Facebook has added additional restrictions on the amount of information granted to developers, and getting more information about someone specific had to be run through a compliance team to ensure it was for debugging/programming reasons.The one place where this material non-public information restriction does not exist, unfortunately, is for the US congress. They are given zero restrictions on stocks or products they can purchase or sell, and a huge ass 45 day window to report trades. It's concerning especially considering the amount of non-public information they deal with. Like if a congressperson knows that there is a huge deal in the works for a car manufacturer, they may buy the stock with no restriction, and only have to report the trade way after the deal has gone through and the stock has made significant gains.",Spare-Plum,2025-04-13 09:49:40,2,learnprogramming,t1_mmvcb8i,False,

At the same time, it would be ridiculous to punish an intern for inexperience. Please, take the high expectations you feel as a sign of respect for you, rather than a blowtorch on your feet. You’re a member of a team.Yeah, the work is hard and gnarly. Companies don’t get successful without accumulating a lot of lumpy and complex experience. In our trade, that messy experience gets crammed into our code bases. Academic approaches often make simplifying assumptions. Sometime, ask your professors about software they have to actually USE, not just dream up: grade reporting, grant applying, etc. When the heat is on, put on your anthropologist’s hat and observe how the org’s customs and taboos affect your workplace.

What would you need to do in order to receive a full-time offer?IMO it's somewhat unprofessional/odd that you were not given that feedback: part of the job of a manager is to make sure every employee knows if they're meeting expectations/remove uncertainty about where they stand. But that's by-the-by -- I think the important thing here is to get direct info + directly ask for the feedback you're looking for.> I’ve been doing a programming internship at a big, globally known company for a year nowThe length of your internship is pretty unusual. Maybe this is a regional thing, but at least in my corner of the world (US west coast), most internships last ~3-4 months, typically during the student's summer break.In any case, I do think it's reasonable for you to be feeling burnt out. I don't think it's reasonable to expect you to juggle both schooling and work for this amount of time.> When I landed this internship, I had zero technical knowledge and was just starting my degree.I'm a little surprised by this, tbh -- somebody with zero technical background doesn't have the ability to contribute in a meaningful way in a programming role. It's an odd pick for an intern; usually you want somebody with partial experience so the intern mentor doesn't need to spend time covering the basics.Did the company know this when they hired you + ask you to go through some training program? Or was this more of a hybrid internship, where you applied some of your other skills in in addition to programming? What were their expectations?TBH my first instinct here was that the company did not set you up for success by hiring you at such an early stage in your career.> I made mistakes, of course,but no one really explained what I was doing wrong or how I could do better. Any internship program worth its salt should assign you a dedicated mentor. Do you have one? If not, can you ask your manager (or whoever is managing the internship program) to assign you one?> over time, I’ve started to feel like I’m being excluded. Nothing direct or obvious, but there are signs. I try to contribute, show interest, ask questions… but everything I do seems to go unnoticed. [...snip...] Despite being an intern, it often feels like we’re expected to deliver at the level of someone with years of experience.It's hard to tell what's happening here without more specifics.For example, maybe what's happening is that you rose to the occasion and people are treating as you as having roughly the same skill as a junior engineer -- and maybe they're leaving you alone since you seem to be doing fine and are not realizing you're actually struggling to keep up? Or alternatively, maybe they're disengaging because they need to focus on their own work now, or are burnt out themselves with teaching and mentoring? It's a bit hard to say.> Lately, I’ve been thinking that maybe I should try working at a smaller company—somewhere with a slower pace, less pressure, and where I might actually be able to learn and breathe.Usually an internship has a concrete end date; I'd try sticking it out until then. If yours does not, then I'm not quite sure what's going on tbh.Other things to try:- Quit to focus on your schoolwork. Find another internship next summer.- Add your current internship to your resume; use it to help you find an internship at a different but similarly well-regarded company.- Ask if you can transfer to a different team. Maybe the working culture will be different there?- Tell your manager that you're struggling to balance school and work and seeing if they can help adjust your workload.

mnlx6a0,"Oh dear, that's a rabbit hole, actually that's rabbit holes all the way down. Where do we start and where do we end.Let's start near the top, and cover the upper level bit.When you fire up your web browser, you basically get a blank canvas.You type in the Domain Name of the website and hit go/enter.That domain name is then looked up using a name resolution system called DNS (rabbit hole one) to get it to resolve to an address. This is very similar to you looking up your friend Bob in the contacts list on your phone, since names are easier than numbers.The browser then sends a request to the server(s) residing at the address it got to download your web page. (Another rabbit hole here). This is done using the HTTP protocol (more rabbit hole), the web page is then likely to be created using HTML as the markup language (more rabbit holes). The HTML might inform the browser it needs additional bits which require additional requests to the server or even other servers. These include things like stylesheets (CSS) to make things look pretty, code (JavaScript), pictures (PNG, GIF, JPEG, etc), videos (MPEG4, etc), sound/music (MP3, WAV, etc), and others.After the first HTML page is downloaded the browser will start to render the page and all the content and the code may start to be executed. The code might do nothing until you interact with the page, or it might send a request to a server for some dynamic data, which would be another HTTP request to some server somewhere.Each HTTP request might involve a different server which we don't have the address for yet, so that would be another set of DNS requests to look up those addresses.That's the near top level of how a website works with your web browser. Your next question might be how all these abbreviations, protocols, and the like work and how they all work together and for that we have a variety of central standards that specify how these work so everyone that needs to can implement their own. The majority of these are what are called RFCs (requests for comment) managed by the IETF (internet engineering task force) and we also have the w3c (world wide web consortium) and a few other organizations/groups made up of industry specialists like IANA (they're more involved in the DNS side).We have a generic model for a lot of this called the OSI model, and that allows us to navigate the rabbit holes and find the occasional breathable pocket.Hope that helps, Wikipedia has a lot of the extra information you might want to learn about, but beware of the rabbit holes (they're everywhere).",dariusbiggs,2025-04-17 16:22:45,3,learnprogramming,t3_1k1bjaf,False,

That NIC uses some black magic to establish itself as a given IP on your local network, let's assign it as 192.168.1.20.Any traffic on your network will be able to talk to your network card using that address, and if your computer talks to anything else on your network then the recipient will see it got a package from that address.One such device on your network is a router, which is also connected to your ISP's network.When your computer tries to make a request to something not on your local network, say.... 8.8.8.8, then it asks the router if it knows how to get to 8.8.8.8. The router then asks the ISP, the ISP knows and then tells the router which tells the computer, the computer then sends the packet to the router to give to the ISP to give to 8.8.8.8.A similar process works for resolving domain names to server IPs.So when you go to google.com, your browser asks your network card to ask your router to ask your ISP if that's possible. It is, and a request is sent to whatever address that google.com resolves to, ""Give me your home page.""Google's server receives that request and after some processing sends back an HTML file, and probably a css and a JavaScript file. So an HTML file comes from Google to your ISP to your router to your network card to your browser, and a web page renders. Then your browser also executed the JavaScript that got sent and applies the css, not necessarily in that order. The JavaScript can then phone home by asking the browser to ask the card to ask the router to ask the ISP to give a message to Google, and so the cycle continues.TL;DR: By the time you get a webpage, a connection to the server has already been made at least once. The browser handles most of the details of connecting.

This way, it is closer to the function header, so everyone can see what kind of data is expected when looking at the header. Also, it reduces code complexity because. You will generally need less (nested) if conditions. In this case, the if-clauses are greatly simplified because you don't need to check for the lower bound.Secondly, you don't need else-if clauses. The return statement kind of has an implicit 'else'-effect. Everything after a return statement is unreachable code, so the program will only reach the next statement if it did not go through the return statement.Thirdly, this kind of code can probably expressed as a loop or even a one liner, because the if statements are very repetitive.

Then you can divide out the 256 possible values by 8 - |knob|, so when ""knob"" is 0 then it's divided evenly with 32, when ""knob"" is +-7 you only have one bucket for all 256 values.I'd call this value float increment = (256.0 / (8.0 - abs(knob))), and then we can round appropriately (nice for if the increment isn't a whole number so it will get distributed out a bit.)Label each branch (bucket) 0 through 7. You start filling buckets when knob - bucket <= 0 (positive knob delays the start, negative knob does not affect the beginning) You stop filling buckets when 7 + knob - bucket >= 0 is false (negative knob cuts off the end, positive knob does not affect it)In total you would want to increment each time and round to the nearest int, and only fill buckets when knob - bucket = 0",Spare-Plum,2025-04-17 06:34:46,1,learnprogramming,t3_1jzcyi8,False,

mn5g9mm,"As you go from 0% to 25% the chances become distributed at the lowest values, where 'return 0' still has the highest likelihood, and when you reach 50%, everything has an equal chance. As you go past the halfway point, the 'return 7' becomes the most likely until you reach 100% at which 'return 7' happens 100% of the time. I almost think of it like holding a cylinder full of liquid on its side and tilting it to one side or the other. If the cylinder is flat, the liquid is evenly distributed, if it's tilted slightly it begins accumulating on one side, more with a greater angle. My thinking was that it was an 8 bit value being compared to give a finer granularity in determining the greater than or less than values.In practical application it's for a self-generating musical sequencer, like an algorithmic player piano, to determine the length of a musical step (analogous to how long a piano key is held down). If you turn the knob all the way to the left, the musical notes generated by the sequencer will only be one musical step long. If it's all the way to the right, it will only generate 8-step-long notes. If it's a quarter of the way, it will produce mostly one step notes, with some two step notes, less three step notes, even less four step notes, etc. Hope that makes sense!",myweirdotheraccount,2025-04-14 23:57:36,2,learnprogramming,t1_mn5dorb,True,

The upper bins will firstly increase in volume but then also decrease until every bin except the last one has zero volume.Edit: You don't need `pow(10, p)` you always need to add a factor of 30 (the highest border): `pow(10, p) * 30`.

mmvkvp7,"I really admire that you're diving into HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Python at 54—your passion and diverse background are definite strengths. That said, I want to be as candid as possible:Freelancing in programming typically comes after years of experience in the industry. While there's no formal barrier to entry beyond setting up a profile on a freelancing platform, this low threshold means you're competing against a vast pool of skilled coders—many with years of experience, advanced degrees, and robust portfolios filled with positive client reviews. Back in the mid-2010s, there was a surplus of tech needs, and companies were more willing to take on individuals with bootcamp training or certifications in lieu of real experience because the talent pool was scarce. In today's market, the situation has reversed—tech is high-paying and attractive, leading to a surplus of highly experienced, often laid-off programmers. Most companies have their pick of talent, whether hiring full-time employees or freelancers, so they have little incentive to take a chance on entry-level coders or invest time and money into training someone without a proven track record. It's not impossible by any means, but it will take several people willing to ""give you a chance."" Until you build up those client experience reviews, finding freelance gigs will be especially challenging. It's the classic chicken-and-egg scenario: you need a job to gain experience, but you need experience to get the job.The alternative—landing an entry-level programmer role remotely—is almost completely out of the picture. Remote positions nowadays are typically reserved for those who already have a strong background because the market for remote roles is fiercely competitive. The COVID era, where remote work was the norm, is rapidly fading; everyone wants to work from home, but few get to. In many parts of the world, especially in regions like the U.S. (at least where I'm writing), remote experienced freelance or full-time programmers are still a thing—but entry-level remote roles are virtually non-existent. Even on-site roles face fierce competition. I'm not sure how things shake out in places like Albania or wider Europe, but the trend is similar: only highly experienced folks, often bolstered by a flood of laid-off talent, get those remote opportunities.On top of that, generative AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are changing the game. These tools can handle many of the routine tasks that junior developers used to do—completing boilerplate code and similar work much faster than a human. As a result, the real value in programming today isn't just about writing code; it's about leveraging it to solve complex, real-world problems. The true edge lies in depth and creativity, where your ability to draw on years of industry-specific experience can help you harness generative AI efficiently—something AI by itself can't do. This shift leaves even less room for entry-level programmers, as companies lean on the efficiency of AI and the expertise of veterans.My advice? Keep learning the basics and enjoy the process, but once you have a solid foundation, jump into advanced tools like Google Gemini Canvas. This isn't just about using fancy new software—it's a reality check that shows how far generative AI has come and how it can outperform entry-level folks on routine tasks. It also reminds you that real value comes from using code to solve meaningful problems, something that only someone with experience and creative problem-solving skills can do. In other words, don't just aim to be a freelance coder; consider positioning yourself as a consultant who can merge your decades of industry expertise with your growing tech skills to solve niche, real-world challenges.Bottom line: You haven't missed the boat yet, but today's boat is more like a high-speed ferry crammed with highly experienced, AI-enhanced pros. Your journey will be challenging, but by being realistic and strategic—focusing on niche projects, learning the basics, and quickly adopting advanced AI tools—you can carve out your own path in this highly competitive, ever-changing market.Good luck, and keep enjoying the learning process!",mintplantdaddy,2025-04-13 10:54:15,7,learnprogramming,t3_1jy3gap,False,

Don’t optimize unnecessarily. If a function doesn’t need to be fast, a simple, slow solution is fine. Each file in your project should be able to be read and understood by itself. Ideally no files should exceed 2000 lines and a competent developer should be able to read and understand the file within 1 hour. After reading the file they should understand what functionality the file provides, what libraries and other files the file depends on, how often the file’s functions are expected to be called (once an hour vs 1000 times a second), and be confident that the file doesn’t have bugs. Your code should be able to be read from top to bottom. A reader ideally should not have to jump around a file, or jump between multiple files for things to make sense. Use functions to eliminate/reduce similar code blocks. Inline most single use functions. Use single line functions sparingly. Reduce the amount of useless information that the reader has to see. Example: if a class’s field is the same 99% of the time, use a default value for the field in the __init__ function. If you pass that field in every time, you’ll waste space and you’ll make the more important set fields less visible. Use white space to separate code blocks. Too much white space can be a bad thing.

When I build a few silly apps like a custom flashlight, calculator, Todo lists, meal planner etc. I decided I want to make games.So I picked up C# (guess what, it was really similar), I was watching Brackeys and I learned a lot about Unity3D, I learned to 3D model my assets in Blender, texture stuff etc. I made a few games (tower defense, endless runner and then I even published one game on App Store where you had to draw symbols on screen in order to destroy stuff that was falling from the sky)Then I decided that I would like to build a web app so my friends and family can use it. So I picked up JavaScript, then React. Made a few projects and web apps. (I already had 1 year old kid at this moment)At that point I told myself. Man you're kinda good at this thing and you really like it, let's make a living out of it. So I started to apply.And here I'm, working as a fullstack from home for an awesome company with awesome people and a boss.

This method works because you are attempting to reproduce the coding style of another. You are learning how his code works. Just keep attempting to reproduce the web page. When you can reproduce the webpage without viewing the code contained inside, you have successfully accomplished your mission. Keep up the good work. Learning JavaScript/Webpages in this manner is effective. I would recommend spending 1/2 of your time working YouTube tutorials, the rest of the time, reproducing another person's web page.",Vegetable-Passion357,2025-04-15 17:26:06,3,learnprogramming,t3_1jz6w2e,False,

Our university library had the licenses for digital copies and enough physical books in case you really do want to read on paper.It's up to your personal taste if you want to buy it. These textbooks are quite expensive because of the publishers policies.As for the book itself, I see it as a decent reference textbook. It's rigorous and shows you the mathematical details. However, it's also super dense and kind of dry. You do need to have good math skills to go through it. I used it for example less for sorting but more for trees.Algorithms by Sedgewick for example I found much more approachable and modern but I felt like it was also much less detailed on the math part. So I learned by a combination of both books and lecture slides. Goodrich and Tamassia's book in Java is also ok, although I really did not do much with that book.Proper DSA courses do require you to have a solid grasp of math notation and foundational math knowledge, so it really isn't an easy course per se.",theusualguy512,2025-04-14 16:00:45,4,learnprogramming,t3_1jz26s0,False,

Which I think is a mistake, because it is the simple things that are hardest to understand - once you get them though, it is fairly easy to understand the many different complex algorithms that the book goes through.Honestly, I'd suggest something like Grokking Algorithms to read to understand the basic principles, and then use Wikipedia articles for each algorithm that you have to study - often they quote CLRS, but add additional explanations or pseudocode.Check if your library has the book, and read some of the chapters in the syllabus - if you like their style of writing, by all means buy the book, if not, see if you can do without.",peterlinddk,2025-04-15 10:39:10,2,learnprogramming,t3_1jz26s0,False,

I had nothing to lose so you can do that sometimes. 2nd interview - COO is involved.. Very open honest discussion, great discussion. Dude knew I achieved what I wanted in EHS, looking for an opportunity into business side (non-ehs), was bored, etc. He tells me I am overqualified and that I am better than Safety. While some may have gotten offended, I did not because I agree lol. Nothing against my EHS brothers/sisters.. I just have always been bored and found it not challenging enough (I am director level currently). He was just spot on with everything and we were just starting to converse.. At this point, my interviews are not your typical ""give me a time you had to use decision making in a high-stress situation"" but more conversational, management style, personality assessing, etc. At least in my experience the last 2 job changes. I get rejected, but while being rejected for role I interviewed for, they tell me there is another opportunity that they would love to discuss with me if still interested. I checked their website to see what jobs were listed, and it was only a handful and none of them would match any I would fill. I believe the COO I connected with is throwing me a lifeline for a career change. They know how much I currently make and that I would not take less (3 small kids, wife to support), but he must have seen or heard something that caused him to throw me a potential bone and transition into a new career.

You could be in any career, in any field, in any position and still get laid off. This is just the way of the world.With your YoE, you should be getting messages from recruiters on LinkedIn and other platforms that can easily land you interviews. Try premium for a month, spruce up your LinkedIn and add all the common skills you see across the job descriptions you are interested in. Even if you don’t have the skills, read up on docs and just get a basic understanding so that you can speak to it during interviews. Add those skills to your LinkedIn and Resume, I guarantee your profile starts getting hits from recruiters. Talk to the ones who supply Job Descriptions you’d actually consider taking.

I found a position after about a month and a half with 7 YoE (NYC area) which is really the same as 5 in the grand scheme of things.I’m sick of hearing people cry that CS careers are over.

FAANG is what made the market what it is because they over hired and over paid for people and set unrealistic expectations for what SWE careers should actually look like. They set a standard for unrealistic hiring practices that is not reflective of actual work we do on a daily basis. We’re grinding LC for months just to do a job where we do basic system design and basic logic. It’s absolutely ridiculous.Also, FAANG looks good on resumes, sure, but so does experience in any real job where you can back up that experience with technical knowledge. If someone is gonna hire you just because your resume says FAANG, then they’re an idiot and you probably shouldn’t work for them anyway.Lower your salary expectations a bit, you have to realize that you’re in competition with a ton of other people who were laid off and are all expecting to make more money than what they were making than when they were laid off.

Here is how you can frame it: ""I have been pushing myself hard and accepting everything that's been thrown my way, and I've been trying to do things as quickly as possible. I think I need to stop doing that, and instead be honest about how much time and availability I have, otherwise I'm risking getting burned out.""I have literally been told by my managers (as in, multiple have said this independently over time) that it's okay to go slower, and in fact, sometimes it's preferable. The only thing it's not okay to do is not communicate.So for example, if you get a Slack ping that's like ""hey, I'm seeing error X in app Y, can you please take a look?"", instead of saying ""I'm on it!"" and then frantically trying to chase down error X, say, ""sure thing, I can look in [a little bit/30 minutes/this afternoon/tomorrow/when I'm back from lunch]"".

As long as you are aware of what's going on, learning when your input is needed and when to let others speak is a valuable skill. (Personally, I still struggle with it.) People will notice if you are obviously disengaged, ignorant about what's being discussed, or making them repeat themselves. They won't think to themselves after a meeting, ""Boy, YonghaeCho sure was quiet,"" and if they do, it's only for a fleeting moment - and if you spoke once or twice because *you needed to*, they won't think that at all.Overall: It's not just okay to slow down, it's good to slow down.

These have a little more staying power and tend to have the opportunity to become other kinds of software engineering roles - devs, devops, release eng, etc. - when the business outgrows the need for dedicated QA.Two, jobs that are basically QA and mostly manual testing, but for companies that know they need to step up their testing game and need a stopgap while they either scale up their automated CI/CD efforts or offshore manual efforts. You can tell by the way I've described it that I don't think these roles have a bright future, but you might get to hang on for a while at a company that's struggling through that process.Observability, monitoring, and deployment tools have come a long way in reducing risk in software delivery since I started my career. Issues can be seen early and fixed quickly. Unit tests are fast and cover a lot of ground. There's still some use for end to end testing, but I see a drastically reduced need to have a specialized function for it that introduces additional process and the overhead of handing work off to different people along the way.",NearbyRock,2025-04-17 05:35:27,3,cscareerquestions,t3_1k10smd,False,

mnsj8cd,"Never take Glassdoor reviews as truth. The one and only thing you should use them for is to help you formulate questions to ask during the reverse interview process, and so you know what you keep an eye out for. Then based on the reverse interview you need to form *your own* opinion on if the company sounds like it has any of those negative traits you read about.The obvious reason why you shouldn't take those reviews as truth is they're often by disgruntled employees, or employees pressured into leaving good reviews by HR while they're working there. Neither end of that spectrum is reliable. Rarely does a content employee just think unprompted to themselves ""You know what would be fun? Let's go write a fair, unbiased review about my very average employer!""But beyond that, companies change over time. A review that was accurate even last month, might not be accurate today. All it takes is a single change in management, and a team's culture can shift literally overnight. So just because someone said they worked long hours, doesn't mean people are still working long hours. The reverse is also true, just because someone said the WLB is great, doesn't mean it's still great.Teams within companies also vary drastically. Even at small companies. I worked for a startup once that had \~30 engineers, spread across a few teams. The team I worked on was super laid back, modern stack, essentially no red tape so we moved very quickly, etc. Even pre-pandemic, we'd only come into the office once or twice a week, and nobody was watching us so sometimes we'd just WFH all 5 days and it wasn't a big deal because we got results. But another team was the polar opposite of us. Their stack was older, they had a *ton* of red tape, they moved very slowly, produced very little, and they were straight up told by the CTO that they need to be in the office strictly 3 days a week because they needed to get their shit together.So if you read a bad review about Team A, it doesn't mean Team B will share those traits. You need to talk to *your* hiring manager about *your* future-team to figure out what that team is like.The startup I mentioned earlier had a fair amount of negative reviews on Glassdoor talking about nepotism, and it being a boys club, and that if you're not buddy buddy with the CEO you'll never have any career growth. When I interviewed with my hiring manager and the CTO I didn't get those vibes at all. The culture seemed amazing, which is why I decided to ignore those reviews and join them. Lo and behold, the culture was great. I was absolutely *not* buddy buddy with the CEO, or anyone for that matter, and my career skyrocketed at that place. I've gotten the biggest raises I've ever seen there. It was a great place to work. The person complaining about nepotism probably just sucked at their job and got fired, and decided it'd be an easier pill to swallow to blame nepotism instead of themselves. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯",SouredRamen,2025-04-18 17:29:57,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1k2a7a2,False,

mmt7iti,"Could this just be you getting bored of your current job?If you've been doing similar stuff for 3 years straight, it's totally normal to start getting bored. And being bored at work could easily make you feel kinda burned out, or lethargic, or like the spark is gone.I resonate with this a lot, because 3 years is about the point where I start getting bored on a team. The easiest way to cure this is to have a candid conversation with your manager, and see if they can either find you some different work, or transfer you onto a different team.Doing that usually reignites the spark for me. The longest I've lasted at one company is a little over 5 years, and the main reason I lasted that long was I switched teams after 3 years. Switching teams gave me a ton of new stuff to learn, it was in an entirely different tech stack, I had to learn all the business knowledge from scratch. It's fun, everything's new again. It's shoving you back into the ""honeymoon stage"".My new grad company was actually great with this. They *encouraged* internal moves at the 2 year mark for all employees. For me specifically it just sorta happened naturally, I worked on 3 different teams across 3.5 years. The only reason I left them was because I wanted to live on the east coast, otherwise I could've stayed there for life. And some of my friends have, I think there's 5 or so people from my new grad cohort that are still at that company, 12 years later.So that's what I'd recommend. See if you can transfer internally, or get a completely new type of work. If you can't, start looking for a new job .See if that fixes things for you. If it doesn't, then maybe you're right, this industry just isn't a good fit for you... but the fact you found your job rewarding *at first* makes me think you're just bored rather than being burnt out of the entire industry.",SouredRamen,2025-04-12 23:10:49,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1jxr1iu,False,

As always with the US, the social services are lacking compared to Europe, though if you get a high paying job with great benefits, that difference is mostly mitigated2. Education in the Boston area is excellent, rivaling the Nordic countries3. Public transit is acceptable but easily the worst out of the 3 cities you’re considering, bike infrastructure kind of sucks, but the city itself is supremely walkable4. Boston is not a late night city, restaurants and bars often close quite early compared to other similar cities5. Most of the neighborhoods in Boston feel meaningfully distinct from one another, it’s something I love about the city but you should definitely shop around for a neighborhood you like before deciding where to live6. Food is good, not great for a city of its size - beer scene is arguably the best in the country though7. Quick access to New York via Amtrak is awesome8. As you noted, Boston is probably the safest major American city and rivals many European cities9. No shade, and I’m obviously biased, but I really prefer New Englanders to other Americans and Northern Europeans. I feel New Englanders are the perfect mix of being pretty friendly and kind without being obnoxious or fake about it10. Speaking of which, New England itself is awesome. Great vacation or long weekend opportunities all over the place for all seasons11. Boston is easily the coldest and hottest/most humid of the cities you’re considering, but it also gets the most sunlight. I prefer Boston winters to Berlin winters even though Berlin doesn’t get as cold12. The rental and buying market in Boston sucks, but I’m not sure it’s better in the other cities you’re considering13.

mnt1zac,"They shouldhabe salary bands—if they’re smart.As for the amount, it depends. Some companies apply a flat percentage for promotions; companies I’ve worked at, for example, used a flat 10%.Other companies have set salary ranges and will use comp ratios to determine the increase. They also consider your current compensation. Generally, managers and the comp/HR team aim to bring employees close to a 1.0 comp ratio. For high performers, they may go higher. However, some managers or comp/HR folks might think that bringing someone straight to a 1.0 is too large of a bump, so they might offer a lower comp ratio instead. They may also feel a candidate needs ramp-up time or isn’t fully qualified, which can also justify a lower comp ratio—though there’s usually a floor, such as 0.9.Comp ratio, short for comparative ratio, is a measure used in compensation management to compare an employee’s current salary to the midpoint of a given salary range for their position. It’s calculated by dividing the employee’s salary by the midpoint of the range and is usually expressed as a percentage. A comp ratio of 100% means the employee is paid exactly at the market or target rate. Below 100% may indicate they’re underpaid relative to the range, while above 100% suggests they’re paid more than the midpoint—possibly due to experience, tenure, or performance.

mne66ao,"A few pointers： 1. You probably have done some sort of system design in game coding. Knowing how parts of a system work together is something you’ve already done, you just have to abstract that to other types of systems. 2. What type of system design question you’ll be asked will vary greatly on the scale of the company, the seniority of role, and the type of roll. You should not expect load balancing questions if you’re doing a front end engineering system design interview. If you’re doing backend at an established company, they probably won’t be asking about load balancing (because they’ve already solved that), but will probably ask about problems you’ll be expected to solve. 3. Unless you’re doing system design or architecture or tooling, they probably will just want to know that you can think in terms of systems. The specific database or asynchronous job or whatever other part won’t matter so long as you know how they interact or at a higher level what pieces are interacting. They care most that you’re able to grasp the whole system rather than that you remember the names of specific tools to build the system (unless they specifically list technology they use, then you should totally know about those technologies at a conversational level).4. ChatGPT is a great tool to prep for interviews. You can prompt it to create a series of questions for you for the seniority level and type of roll and company and interview type (systems design) you’re interviewing for. If you have the job description/company, that can help it be more specific.

An MBA by itself is very unlikely to secure you a job as a product manager. Experience in the markets the business is targeting (healthcare, additive manufacturing, law, etc), the model by which the business operates (SaaS, PaaS, b2b, b2c, etc), and domain expertise over the product/market (peripherals, infrastructure, HRIS/ERP/EHR/etc), is king.> I was considering MBA but then I came across LinkedIn profiles of people who shifted to Prod roles of different companies without an MBA.Those people probably have heaps of experience in one or all of the areas I described above.To be clear, ""I worked for a SaaS vendor"" does not automatically mean you understand the full lifecycle of sales, support, adoption, and development of a SaaS product. Cranking out Jira issues is not the same as sitting in contract negotiations with a big client, producing estimates/SOWs, planning/executing a multi-month/year implementation across multiple functional groups (sales, support/training, development, etc), planning a launch to expand/capture a market segment, dealing with a pissed off customer because milestones are slipping, etc.My experience prior to moving into product management in my current org was in b2b sales/contracting of IaaS and managed services as an owner/operator. That's roughly the same model and domain I work in currently. I had practically no prior experience in my org's specific market segment but picked that knowledge up over ~2 years as a software engineer and ~3 as an engineering manager at my current org.Product management as a functional role should be pretty consistent among your F-100s and FAANGs.
