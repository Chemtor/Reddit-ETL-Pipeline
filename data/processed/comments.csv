You can also use the Databricks free edition to practice; and perhaps sign up for the databricks academy whilst you are at it.Also, it is best that you also learn how to set up a linux virtual machine (to run your cluster), bash, get familiar with the linux terminal commands, and master SQL.

Learning PySpark is also useful, especially for Spark transformations and when using the Databricks platform.

A migration with no validation, a lack of business user validation, and/or a rushed timeline. Projects without validation are almost always dead on arrival. The exception being an incredibly straight forward system (with low customization) that you’ve handled multiple times. I can tell within the first three months if it’s going to flop based on business users lack of engagement and/or validation. You could do everything right as far as schema to schema and wind up with the destination enterprise software handling the end result poorly due to rules represented outside the schema (or api) definitions. Even something as simple as moving files is often overlooked in data migrations between systems, which can range from super straight forward PDFs to custom templates you need to rebuild by passing data into. File type compatibility issues, number of files per record and representation of those files on the front-end, file size limits, etc. The fact you’re doing migrations straight into production without validation rounds (using production data) raises a :triangular_flag:for a potential long term headache.

This experience was a catalyst for my professional growth.In that role, **PySpark** was our main framework. We used it to build scalable ETL/ELT pipelines capable of processing massive datasets efficiently. For orchestration, we relied on **Apache Airflow**, which was a game-changer for automating and monitoring our data workflows.To manage our code and documentation, we used **GitHub** and **GitLab**. This ensured that our development process was organized, collaborative, and easy to track. For data analysis and validation, I used **Hue** to run queries and visualize data directly on our Hadoop cluster. And for database administration, **DBeaver** was my go-to tool for managing both **MySQL** and **Oracle** environments.This exposure to a modern, integrated tech stack was invaluable. It not only deepened my technical skills but also prepared me for the demands of the current job market.# > Is It a Bad Career Choice to Stay?Yes, in terms of professional growth, it absolutely is.

Use your current low-stress environment to your advantage.

nak0dvu,">Do you have any tips on how a junior can gain confidence and build experience faster in this role?You can't build confidence or experience faster than you can build it. We all learn at our own pace. Some learn faster, some learn slower.That being said, confidence comes when you can accept your circumstances and just live with it. Make a mistake? Be fine with it. Do a great job? Feel proud, but don't let it get to your head. People being shitty to you when you're trying to improve? Ignore them and keep your head down. This is all part of learning and improving.Second advice - if you want to be concretely better at stuff, only use LLMs when you want to save time doing things you already know how to do. If you use LLMs to completely generate the output you are looking for, you will end up with huge gaps in your knowledge. People hate the idea of spending time learning things, lean on LLMs to do everything for them, and in a few years wonder rage on Reddit about how they can't get a job because they get rejected for trying to use an LLM during an interview.",MikeDoesEverything,2025-08-25 09:30:44,19,dataengineering,t3_1mzlfgw,False,

It encourages knowledge gaps and creates a weird time dysphoria. Your work starts getting done pretty quickly, and you know that you don't quite know the material yet. But there's no time to study because you've submitted work and now there is more work on your plate. Then, you try to do something yourself without the llm and find out that there is no way you can possibly learn the material and submit your work before the work is due. OP Will have created an unachievable time frame for submitting work. However!! I think that you're downvotes are a little bit unfair. I absolutely believe that OP can learn a lot from LLMs. There is however, a responsible and ethical way to go about it. In order not to create a weird time dysphoria and knowledge gaps OP still needs to be the one producing the work. LLMs make a great research and reference tool for anyone looking to learn a new skill or improve upon the skill they already have. The trick is to ask better questions. Stop worrying so much about how to get your task done and instead ask why it should be done a certain way. Get deeper with the strategy of approach. Write the code yourself, and ask it for a critical review based on your goals. "" What have I missed?"", "" am I using best practices?"", "" what does it mean to have traceability?""These are all questions that an LLM can help clarify and fill the knowledge Gap.

na91qth,"Obviously, great work if you did that alone without much DE experience beforehand. I guess a few points to consider:1. How will the pipeline behave if the UI changes on the website you are pulling the data from, or if the website is down or behaving slowly? In my own experience, Selenium is quite limited to basic actions like “wait for page to load” or “wait until the export button appears.” I would assume you, as a BI Analyst, would probably know when the UI change happens since you are closer to the business user. But still, you don’t (at least you have not mentioned it) have any sort of monitoring or alerting and are just relying on everything working smoothly. So I would advise thinking about adding logging and alerts for those cases.2. Again, this kind of follows the second point, but it would probably make sense to add some retry logic when pulling the data if the website is slow on that particular day.3. Raw data is usually pretty fucking bad, and it’s the task of a Data Engineer to make the business see only pretty fucking good data. What I mean by that is: do you have any validation in place to prevent bad data from getting into your Power BI models? You mentioned you are pulling customer data profiles and geolocations, and this kind of data is soooo easy to get messed up - it’s insane. For example, postal codes being bad, or missing pieces of an address, like the street being available but not the city, etc. So I would think about adding some sort of validation for your data, if it’s not already part of the transformations you are doing.4. You are pulling the Excel files, applying and saving them, and then reading them and saving as parquet. Why? Literally, no offense, but why? You have two versions of the same file in different file formats stored. I would probably store the raw Excel files somewhere for archival purposes so that if you need to check the raw data, you don’t need to re-download them. But I would store transformed files directly in parquet to avoid unnecessary reads/writes.5. Create/replace tables is a simple, working strategy, which is cool, but really inefficient for big tables since you have to reload everything. I would suggest checking out `MERGE` or `INSERT...ON CONFLICT` statements for incremental updates so that if a row is unchanged from the previous table version, you don’t need to reload it. Also, I assume your SQL commands look like: `CREATE TABLE t1 AS SELECT * FROM 'file1.parquet';` Which is normal, but I would advise wrapping it in transaction logic. What does this mean? Imagine your tables fail in the middle, and you have 10 tables. Now you are stuck with 5 updated and 5 old tables - sucks, right? To ensure that your group of loading operations is atomic (meaning they either all succeed or all fail together), you must manually wrap them in a transaction block. That way, you know for sure that either all of them were updated, or all of them are in their previous state, but the data is still consistent between them.Again, what you did is really solid, especially for your first time, but maybe my wall of text will help you a bit. I am also open to any comments since I suck at DE and maybe messed up somewhere. Be very proud of what you designed.",Fiarmis,2025-08-23 14:19:02,7,dataengineering,t3_1mxzqt1,False,

Treat S3 as the ""immutable log"", partition by table then ingest date and hour using the Debezium event time ts\_ms, and write Parquet with reasonable file sizes so Redshift can scan fast.In Redshift, instead of the sink, optionally, you can create an external table over staging for cheap ELT, then build a deduped view or table by using row\_number over partition by primary key ordered by ts and the Debezium op so you keep the latest non delete.If you need a current table for BI, schedule a merge from that deduped view into a skinny current table with sort key on the primary key and updated\_at. This avoids constant vacuum churn from doing small upserts, and you still get perf. If you need point in time queries, keep the bronze and build a silver that is deduped by key and day.Do you need only latest or point in time? Do deletes happen a lot or rare? How big are the hot tables and what is the 95p change rate?If you opt for the ""zero-ETL"" approach, for organization, keep your data in S3 partitioned like `s3://your-bucket/db_name/table_name/dt=YYYY/MM/DD/hr=HH/`. That layout plays nice with Redshift Spectrum and makes pruning way more effective when you're querying or loading batches. Helps a ton with downstream compaction and dedup too, since you can scope it to a smaller time window instead of scanning everything.Dedup pattern is primary key plus Debezium ts\_ms or source commit lsn, with a tie breaker on op where create beats update beats delete.

na40liw,"I’d treat it like a slow crawl with state. Do one pass to get the roster of IDs, store that set, then on each poll diff the set to find new and missing IDs.Here are a few things that worked for me in the past on similar issues: For updates, fetch in batches but avoid refetching everything every time. Keep a raw bronze table of the exact JSON per employee keyed by employee_id plus poll_time and a content_hash. If the hash changed since last poll, mark it changed and upsert into your modeled tables. If an ID disappears from the roster for a few consecutive polls, tombstone it. Add last_fetched_at and last_changed_at in your modeled table, and keep headers like ETag or Last Modified if the API gives them.Start with a tiny script using requests plus a small state store in Postgres (or just a json file), and land raw to object storage or DuckDB. Polling is still fine here, but tier it by heuristics. Recently created or recently changed IDs get polled more often, long lived records get sampled less. Backfill can be a manual trigger, then switch to a low frequency poll.

Easiest setup, no need to find duplicates or changed values. Daily rewrite of all employee data shouldn't be too bad. If there are limitations or API is really slow then you can fetch only new employees data daily and all data weekly, for example. You can used ID to figure which employees you already have.Slowest API I'm currently fetching data returns 5000 rows with one query and it takes little less than minute.

namtxld,"Most teams doing incremental batch off timestamps hit the exact pain you're describing of having missed updates, out-of-order writes, and subtle bugs when ""updated\_at"" isn't reliable (which happens often). Log-based CDC solves that but yeah, the tooling is mostly built for full-on streaming pipelines, not lightweight batch.There's a couple open-source options like `mysqlbinlog` or libraries like `go-mysql` and `maxwell`, but they’re super low-level. You end up writing a lot of glue code just to get something usable. Some folks hack together scripts that tail binlogs, write them to disk, and then batch-load into analytics systems, but that’s pretty fragile long-term.Are you pushing this into a warehouse? How often do you need fresh data? And how complex are your schemas (lots of deletes/updates or mostly inserts)?For what it’s worth, I work at Estuary, and we actually do log-based CDC (including MySQL binlogs) but abstract all the hard parts away.

Keeping all that infra running just to read binlogs in a small team setting didn’t feel worth it.One project I recently came across that sits right in this middle ground is OLake. Instead of going full streaming, it can just read from MySQL/Postgres logs in a more batch or micro batch oriented way - like you schedule a sync job with Airflow or cron or they even have temporal integrated in their UI offering, and it picks up exactly what changed. No ""updated\_at"" hacks, no Kafka clusters.Couple of things I liked about it:* It talks to the binlogs directly, so correctness is better than column-based filtering.* You can still run it in “batch or micro-batch” mode, so you don’t have to keep another service always-on.* It writes data straight to open formats like Iceberg or simple parquets in object store, so downstream analytics feels natural.It’s open source and lightweight (basically a Docker container you can run anywhere), so might be worth a peek if you’re looking for that sweet spot between *timestamp columns* and *full streaming infra*.Repo here if you want to poke around → [https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake)",urban-pro,2025-08-26 07:59:34,3,dataengineering,t3_1mzzeoq,False,

I'm probably not following what this subreddit would consider to be best practices, but here's what I did:* Built out a Python ETL platform that allows me to generate pipelines using JSON config files. The pipelines ingest Excel files directly from our local network, transform and clean the data, and pop it into an on-prem SQL Server database. My platform is modular and extensible, so I tend to add/update functionality as needed.* I use dev/test/prod environments in the DB but haven't done bronze/silver/gold layers. Monitoring is manual right now (log files!) but I plan to migrate to Prefect and/or implement some Power BI dashboards that consume my logs.* I avoid manually-managed documentation wherever possible, because that will be the first thing to go out of date. Instead, I'm using JSON schemas and GitHub Actions to automatically generate documentation for my config files on push, and docstrings + pdoc + GitHub Actions to do the same for my codebase. Only manually-maintained documentation is the top-level README for the repo.* Power BI is a star for me. Getting the on-prem gateway running was painful, but I've established dev/test/prod environments where I control access. Users can access the dashboards via Teams or, in some cases, export the semantic models to Excel for further analysis. I'm also using PBIB files so I can manage dev in GitHub.In terms of general approach, I would start slow and be responsive. Full-stack data analysis means you're also your own PM, so be sure to communicate well and be able to justify your choices to stakeholders. Figure out your P0 items that are crucial for what you're building and then go build it. As you work on this, you'll naturally identify new concerns and priorities and be able to respond to those.

And it's heavily focused on the parts you can copy/paste from articles or stackoverflow (basic email regex, basic dockerfile, basic fastapi setup), not the parts for which an actual data engineer is needed (considerations for filetypes, data structures, algorithms, partitioning, larger-than-memory processing, multi-node processing, data lineage, access control, data quality for a team of at least 10 to 20 contributors, etc).If you're humble, open-minded, you connect with the team, and you learn from them: all good. As long as you have enough understanding of the fundamentals (intuitive understanding, not leetcode), we can teach you the rest.If, instead, you feel bad about being considered a Junior at first, you feel a constant need to talk about having been Lead Solution Eng. in the past, and it's distracting you from learning the job -> won't last.Pay/salary would be Junior while you grow to Medior. If you have more experience than I would have guessed, or you learn faster, I could see someone get that raise within 3 months. If you have a normal trajectory instead, it would usually happen after 3+ years.----tl;dr: Seems like a lot of info, it boils down to:- Is going from Lead Solution Engineer to Data Engineering your genuine passion/interest?

na8sz29,"You are going about it in a weird way. Go back to your management and convince them to apply the concept of an analytics window. I have worked on this problem multiple times already, most notably with logistics. It’s the same concept with deliveries in that open orders on the last few days of the month will only be closed many days after. My advice is that you get the highest possible time that the order is closed, use that as your window, and only calculate by then. This is similar to intra-day calcs where hourly measures have maybe a window of a few minutes, a variance expectation, and an end-of-day resolution via batch job. As an example: if closing an order takes 4 days maximum like in your case, then calculate your close rate on the morning of the 5th. Basically, you’ve given all open orders from the previous month the appropriate waiting time to close. This way, you can properly report on them already.What of the still open orders by then? Consider them unresolved. This is an analytical tradeoff your management should accept on a monthly basis. If they find this problematic, then do multiple checkpoints: an initial view a day after the month (highest number of open orders), a view after the initial window, i.e. T+5, and a view maybe 2 weeks after. At that point, you should be able to have extreme confidence in your data. Variance should be very low, except in extreme outlier circumstances.If revenue is being tracked using this order system, well… you’re doing it wrong. Or rather your company is doing it wrong. They should be doing that off of your invoice system, not your analytical data. It can be a placeholder, sure, but nothing says money earned as well as money that actually arrived in the bank etc. The best you SHOULD tell your stakeholders is that this is estimated revenue from orders and that it is not indicative of actual money coming in. That is for the finance department to resolve, not yours. You’re a data engineer. And unless your name is Harry, you’re most probably not a wizard either.Overall, your approach can be solved by educating your stakeholder/client/management and reaching a compromise with them.

Good data engineering benefits from a perspective that plants trees you'll probably not enjoy the shade of. Comment your code with intent, explain the reason why you are doing what you are doing in that moment in documentation and note when you are doing the same thing multiple times. When you first start it is often easy to build something that works initially but is ultimately not going to scale or isn't maintainable. Learning from those times helps you think about the bigger picture and understand the true scope of a given ask. Example: the company is recording things in Excel files and they want you to make some of the data available in a consolidated dashboard. You could just grab the specific data/fields from the files and write them to a database then point a dashboard to it. That would fulfill the request but then in 6 months they realize they want other data from those old Excel files and you need to reprocess them again to get the rest of the data. Whereas if at the start you consider the durability of the files and potential future needs vs. Cost of storage you may have taken everything from those files. Then when the ask for more of the data eventually comes you can provide the data in a fraction of the time and you've ensured that everything is backed up in case some accidentally deletes a source file.",Mrbrightside770,2025-08-22 20:50:45,1,dataengineering,t3_1mxhdi4,False,

Large Language Models use randomness in their response generation anyway, so there's a good chance this will give you some results in the case of a minor error. Just make sure you clear the LLM's cache if necessary so that it doesn't always give you the same result for a given input. More advanced approach would be to include the error message and the previous iteration of the pyspark code along with the repeated request. Yest more advanced approach would be to store error logs to disk and use those to generate some sort of repair prompt to be used in case of errors.Most important thing is to remember that if you've been doing any of these for more than five or six iterations and it still isn't working for you, that you're wasting time and should just write the code yourself.",ambidextrousalpaca,2025-08-25 05:18:54,1,dataengineering,t3_1mxxx07,False,

If you have access to python and pandas, use it. Doing this entirely in VBA macros would be challenging. If your team has access to their own database server, that might be an option as well. The question will be where that script will live and run on a daily basis. The other challenge you are facing sounds like understanding how to join your data sources to get the desired output, and it sounds like even the final output structure might not be fully defined yet. You need to know exactly what level of detail your final output should be and work backwards on how to get there. My understanding as you described it, you need a current view of commercial customers based on the previous business day, at the customer level, their CCID (commercial customer ID), some data related to that at the company/business level, delivered daily to a brand new Excel file which will live in a shared folder where another team can access it. Where it's not clear, is what level of data you are looking for. If it's at the company/business level, you mentioned you only need one id per company, then what is unique about customers that you need? Dates? Their commercial status? If at customer level, should it be customer, account level? I see two levels you are looking at that you need to resolve, commercial customer (id), and individuals associated with that id. Look for maybe a relationship code in the source that has individuals, there may be a single individual with a primary relationship you can filter on, without knowing more, it would be difficult for anyone to help you with your join issues.

nafg16d,"But what do you want to understand?Kafka Connect is open source, that means you can dig through its code and see how it works. Basically, each connector has a set of identical tasks, each one of which is a virtual thread in JVM. The tasks are distributed through all Kafka connect nodes, so each node has approximately the same number of running threads. Source connector tasks each have Kafka producer inside, while sink connector tasks have consumers. If you understand how simple producers and consumers work, you should easily understand why distributing Kafka Connect is much easier than Kafka itself, since most of the work is done by Kafka itself (storing consumer group offsets for example). The state of Kafka Connect is stored in special topics. Debugging should be the same as with any other JVM application. It's usually possible to run connector or task locally outside of running Connect cluster, and it's even easier so with SMT.

Some of us are working on legacy systems that are so vast and full of engineering debt that we could never hope to make more than small changes at a time, lest we cripple an entire business model in some catastrophic way. And sometimes the expectations of the work environment dramatically shift leaving programmers with much more to do. Environment has everything to do with it. Programmers who are first in line at a start-up building brand new products from scratch are going to go blazing fast, while those working in enterprises with bureaucracy and existing customers will need to move much more purposefully. Finally, you have to consider that different programmers will target different career velocity.With that out of the way I also have an answer to the specific question about productivity.**Become a master of your debugging tools**Knowing how to use breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, logging services and query languages for interpreting your logs is critical. If you're operating live services you probably also want to start picking up the ability to analyze and understand crash dumps and memory dumps. The difference in velocity between a developer who can do these things, and one who can't is immense.**Find the true requirements**Don't trust your managers, PM's, or customers to be able to convey what needs to be done. Communication is the hardest part of the whole job and it's everyone's responsibility to be engaged and active in the conversation. That means you are speaking up, asking questions, understanding the why and how. When appropriate, suggest alternate solutions that make more sense than what comes out of the requirements machine. You'll save yourself a huge headache and a lot of time over massaging semi-correct requirements to be a functional product.**Code isn't always the answer**To a hammer every problem is a nail, and to a programmer every solution is code. But what makes a really great developer is getting out of the IDE every once in a while and getting a birds-eye view on the whole operation. There are mountains of tools available to us that aren't code for solving problems. It's all programming at the end of the day, just with different primitives. But if you can meet a business requirement with a $20 off the shelf solution that already exists... define a process that eliminates your requirement at no cost, or hook up some existing set of systems in such a way that you solve what would otherwise have been a large problem with little to no code that's a big win.Remember, every line of code you write needs to be tested. Kept up to date with changing requirements and compliance demands. Maintained for the lifetime of the product. Code is expensive.**Cut out the distractions**Yeah, I know, you work better while listening to youtube and passively grinding your firemaking cape isn't really that much of an attention suck. You're still getting work done. But... how about just doing those things later because regardless about how you *feel* about your distractions impact, they are slowing you down. Humans aren't particularly good at multi-tasking. And while you might be moving forward, you won't know what things you wouldn't have missed without the distraction. I listen to music without lyrics while I code, that's my personal compromise. Over the long term of many years examining myself it's evident that I'll be less productive with anything more engaging than that in front of me.**Collaborate**I wish I saw more of this. Especially in a world where many of us are working remotely, or in isolated cubical/office spaces. All of the things I've described above are easier to do when you don't do them alone. Get a teammate who's on the same page as you in terms of increasing velocity by taking your work seriously and then do it together. Sit side by side and engage in coding 'sprints' where you push for continuous progress for 20 minute periods at a time. Then rest, then repeat. Have pair programming blocks, where you work together on the same problem for an hour.

Ya, what surprised me was just how desperate a company was back then, and well into the early 2010's for anyone with programming/admin/networking/tech-support capabilities. Essentially, if you showed any prowess in those 4 areas what-so-ever (and especially if you had cursory basic knowledge of all 4 of them) then wow! Suddenly you became a kind of semi-hero in the work space? A kind of defacto tech support and programmer (even if that wasn't your main job!). ------------------------------The need was so great that... At that point, there's was pretty much nothing you could ever do to get fired! Like ya... I was younger at that time, and foolish, so even though I didn't control my emotions at some point and even yelled back at the senior founding partner of our firm, I still didn't get fired! I kid you not: I even got caught late at night in a rather compromising position with a certain colleague, in which her and I were inappropriately hitting it off... and then... well... hit it off one late night, when wouldn't you know it: that same senior partner came into the office unusually to check something. And kinda freaked, then backed out, and never spoke about it to me! (Ya, if that was today, I would have been long fired multiple times!)------------------------------Anyways... So, I actually got hired by a pretty well known international law firm as a technical writer, since I had done two entirely separate university degrees: one physics, and one English Literature. Ya, I know: that's a strange and weird combo, but those are my 2 loves in life! Despite the fact that unfortunately I'm not all that good in either of them, lol! But the law firm dealt in many aspects related to the sciences and engineering, ranging from patents to immigration of highly talented people, etc... So they needed someone who could read scientific papers, and be semi-decent at writing. (As you can see from the length of this comment, I'm a pretty crazy writer: always constantly writing. Just not anything all that good! But still always writing, and I can type at about 90 to 100 words per minute.) ------------------------------Finally to get to the point, not only did I do technical writing... But if anyone had a problem with their computer in the office, my phone line would light up and ring (if the main tech-guy/admin wasn't there yet in the morning, or was already busy). And then people would approach me to help them automate some tasks. So believe it or not, I would actually use C++ (taping into Win32) combined with a program called ""Autohotkey"" to do scripting and automation! Like who uses C++ of all things, to do quick scripting and automation tasks!? Well apparently that would be me! ------------------------------But ya, I got the job after I graduated with my second degree, and boy was I surprised by me being thrust into that role, and just rapidly utilizing anything I knew to get the job done, even if it wasn't anything close to 100% the correct language or solution model for the problem. Just as long as it worked, mostly glitch free, then nobody gave a flying F what programming language or tool I used to get the job done. And because of that, they never-ever-ever wanted to fire me, even though they had to scold me several times. ------------------------------Fast forward to today, and ya... Times have really changed, mostly for the worse in this field unfortunately.

n9qptu6,"I've been on the other side: interviewing candidates for entry level back-end focused dev positions. Here's my thoughts. Active Github profile (daily commits) - not important. ""Daily commits"" is especially not important, some days you just aren't going to have code worth committing. The important part is _having worked on a project of nontrivial complexity_. You had a problem and you tried to solve it... how did you approach the problem, and why did you choose the solution you did? Talking about the candidate's prior work is very valuable as the person trying to understand if the candidate in front of me might be a good fit. Well-structured and documented programs (Modular & uses Swagger) - maybe of interest, but just having used tools like OpenAPI (which is the name of the spec for what was called ""swagger"" btw) or readthedocs or redoc doesn't actually tell me anything. Remember, I'm trying to figure out your approach to solving engineering problems. Does slapping swagger-ui into a maven project mean you're any more informed about how or why to use such a tool? Not necessarily. Now, if what you developed had an external API with users that needed to know about/test your endpoints, that's something worth asking about. This could dovetail into asking about other tools like Postman. ""Well structured"" is too vague of advice and honestly I'd be wary of anyone preaching this to a new developer. Trying to perfectly architect your work in progress ToDo app is not a good use of time. Get your hands dirty. Learning from mistakes and iterating is the name of the game. Waxing philosophic about how you wanted your first app to scale to thousands of users might be relevant if you're interviewing at Netflix, but anywhere else it's probably just signalling that you didn't really understand when it's appropriate to use the tools at hand, or worse, that you might be the kind of junior dev who needlessly introduces more compexity. Projects - yes, very important. Your plan is simple but if you follow through you will be fine. The only thing that stands out to me is that you don't have concrete examples for your projects. You should pick problem(s) that sounds interesting to you and then just work on them. You will inevitably run into topics that you know nothing about (how do I hook up my server to my database? how do I expose this API endpoint? how do I secure my endpoint behind basic AuthN? if my project is depending on other services, how do I rate limit my service so that I don't get angry emails/IP blocked from those services? is there some way I can process this data more efficiently?). If you are able to work on any actively maintained open source project, you can get some ""real"" dev experience before getting your first job.Here are some of the kinds of basic questions I have in my interview template: * What do you do in your current position (if any)? * What side projects have you worked on? Which languages do you use or which are you learning?* How familiar are you with ? (e.g. Spring, React, etc)* Have you used git or other source control tools? Have you submitted (or reviewed and approved) a pull request before?* Do you know what a unit test is? What do you think is the point of tests?* Walk me through your side project (if any).

Want to see if something you wrote works? The first time you execute it should be with unit tests. View the tests as a developer tool to give you an easy way to execute the code you are working on.As the complexity grows, manually testing all the scenarios will become infeasible and a waste of your time. Tests will safeguard you from accidentally breaking something, and tell you exactly what is broken when you do.As for test driven development I think that is a bit extreme. I rarely write tests first, usually only when I have a bug I want to make sure the test exposes so I know the test exposes it and the fix actually fixes the issue. But once I have enough code written to start executing it, I execute it with unit tests until I’m reasonably confident it works as intended.

na1xmu0,"You're falling into the same trap most beginners do that can last forever if you arent careful. It's good to copy once or twice and follow along tutorials to get a baseline, youve got that part down, but you aren't proving you've learned how to build shit by doing that. You need to reframe how you go about this and treat it like learning an actual spoken language. You learn some nouns and verbs (keywords in programming), then you learn some concepts and combine those with your vocabulary (grammar), but you will never be able to speak with just that (speaking = programming).You can pass a Japanese test and technically ""know"" Japanese this way, but you'll never be able to express your own thoughts to a native. In the same way you can't program your own apps. If you want to progress beyond the beginners at your stage and speed up your learning, paradoxically you need to slow down. Pause the ""studying"" and ""learning"" you're doing for now and do the same thing youd do for learning a spoken language. Take what you know and form your own sentences and evaluate where you get lost and what you need to learn more of. Speaking a language = coding a project. Coding is NOT and will not ever be the most difficult part about being a programmer. Coding is hard for beginners and anyone that tells you that coding is the hard part likely does not understand what programming actually is. Build something, and when you finish build something else. Occasionally rebuild something youve already built, maybe add some new tricks youve learned to speed the process up or add features you were unable to the first time.And ""i can't build anything yet"" is not an acceptable answer. Day one of a spoken language course you learn how to say ""hello"", day one of a coding course you learn how to say ""Hello World"". Thats a project in the same way that a simple sentence in Japanese is. It's not impressive, but it is by definition a project. Now add complexity to your app. Can you print ""something besides Hello World? Can you make it print that new phrase 10 times? Can you print out what a user types? Can you make that phrase print 10 times? Can you take in more than one string of user input? If you know how to do those things, you should be able to bang your head against a wall and build a calculator. A little more complicated than ""Hello World"" and takes quite a bit more work, but building it is a lot more feasible than you think. Coding isnt hard. But it takes practice.

na39jb2,"I would say if you copy paste it’s bad. This may be a controversial opinion, but I believe that it can actually help to copy if you retype what you see. Knowledge acquisition doesn’t always require understanding before exposure, often repetitive exposure to things that don’t make sense is the foundation of knowledge. It’s how we all learned to speak. Our brains are actually designed to work this way.So if you are retyping programming basics like loops, syntax, the use of built in methods, turning an array into a map, the elements of a form that go together, and the js methods that move the info from the front end to the back end, the shape of classes and functions, event listeners and their methods, etc… I think that stuff is okay to copy as long as you type it out line by line. It’s hard to tell while you’re doing it, but you are learning things just by transposing them from the screen through your keyboard. You will inevitably miss a symbol or a letter and you’ll have to scan through and figure out what went wrong. This will help you gain deeper understanding. Eventually you see the patterns. Seemingly disconnected confusing things start to become connected and organized. At its heart programming is us training ourselves to be conscious of subconscious steps. Like we never have to think of every individual step of putting on a t-shirt. We just know how to do it. I believe when we program our brain begins to subconsciously understand what is happening which is why (after it clicks) sometimes coding can feel like magic, and why we have to reread and relearn code we wrote two weeks ago. If you find yourself copying something that looks familiar too often I would say take some time and focus on the use of that thing by itself.

It doesn't make much sense to memorise a bunch of things about a language that you then abandon, just to repeat that with the next one, and so on...As for C++, what are you planning on doing with it and why can't you do it in C to cement your existing knowledge? If you wanted to learn C++ you could have learned the modern flavour without C first, though it won't do you any harm and there's plenty of transfer between the two (as much as some don't like to admit it).In summary, forget your rule, slow down, choose what you learn in a targeted manner, and commit to using it for a while to test your understanding and make it stick.",HashDefTrueFalse,2025-08-26 11:43:09,6,learnprogramming,t3_1n0ir70,False,

naqvypi,"I'm sorry about the negative comments you've received. People can be incredibly selfish sometimes. I've also been learning C and intend to learn C++ after. C has a variety of uses, one of which is that a few of the textbooks I'm interested in working through use C. Another important reason for learning C is that it forces a programmer to think more ""lower level"" than other programming languages, and learning how a program interacts with an operating system to use hardware is a useful thing for programmers to learn. Not essential, I believe, but useful. I intend to learn C++ after, because I like that C++ is object oriented, and I'm also interested in competitive programming.As far as you 80/20 rule, I think the way you described it sounds fishy. Just like there is no royal road to geometry, there is no royal road to learning a computer programming language. With that being said, I've heard people claim something along the lines of 80 percent of the total work done by a system is done by 20 percent of that system. But the validity and applicability of a particular philosophy is not the point of this post. I think a good, small(ish) collection of problems for either C or C++ can be found in the first chapter of Kernighan and Ritchie's book The C Programming Language. The first chapter is a whirlwind tour of C, and there are about 25 exercises in it that covers enough of the language that the authors claim, and I'm paraphrasing, to get a programmer up and running in C.

najprge,"Don’t aim at perfection. Aim at what other people thinks is readable and comprehensible. You will find out with time that different teams have different styles. Any large enough codebase is very arcane at first. At a job, you have team mates that can help you make sense of it. You know you understand the code when you start to see what could be changed.That being said, there are actual practices that can be part of the team style that will result in messy and unreadable spaghetti given enough time. The thing where you said ”we just override stuff in CSS” rings some alarms in my head, but it all depends on how and why things are overridden. Are you overriding stuff because they were defined inside a library code? Could be good, you don’t want to modify anything inside the node_modules folder, and you being weirded out by it is just inexperience. Are you constantly overriding whatever the previous css was and now you have 5 classes that aren’t used anywhere? Really bad, your whole css packbcould be a giant mess.About the JS being hard to trace and split every where… it’s also really hard to infer if you are right or wrong here without looking at the codebase you are criticising. Keep in mind you haven’t sent it all yet, and sometimes, once you see the logic and decisions that are behind a certain way they organized their files, what looks messy to you now becomes manageable. Large code bases will take time to grasp even with a team that can guide you thru it.With the tutorials…. Are you really looking for ”how to make an endpoint” or are you still looking for ”how to create the thing in my head exactly”? Here’s the deal: authentication: that’s an endpoint. ORMs: do you understand what and ORM is? You can build endpoints without databases, but for a project that DOES something useful, it rarely makes sense to do so. And with databases come a lot of boilerplate that you have to code every time but really would rather not…I understand the desire to study things separately, but a lottor tutorials mash things together because they make sense together. Keep in mind that in the simplest form, an endpoint is just an ”URL” that sends you back something specific. You can make just send ”hello” back, or some hard coded object and not setup a whole database and ORM for it. That however, teaches you about endpoints, but not exactly why you’d want to use an endpoint for. Now if I slap authentication into it…. I’m teaching you not only ”using endpoints for authentication is common”, but also how to do it in an ok way, and that you probably dont want anyone accessing a database without authentication. There’s a chance here the tutorials you are watching aren’t great. A 2minutes tutorial really barely has time to show some very specific example, let alone explain the reasons for anything. I can recommend blue collar coder tutorials. He will explain why he’s doing this thing this way, so later you can decide for yourself if his approach works for your project or not.The deeper you go and the more knowledgeable you are, the less tutorials will help you.

No, do I learn one? Where do I get the words? Do I input them? Do I use any cloud solution?This never ending circle of questions, or you could just write a function that takes a word of language L and a word of language K then it returns true if it's correct. Internally it finds the L word in list L and checks if K word matches the word at the same index in list K. This is your core mechanic AND database. You can go even lower and make sure you can match strings at all.GUI? Once you start considering libraries and frameworks... thats a whole can of worms on it's own...print to terminal first.

It can be used for embedded/micro-controllers as well, it just isn't very popular in that regard yet.Admittedly, I started learning Rust and built a few projects in it.

naksnb1,"You get to think briefly that everything should be *rewritten* in it, and that you have the ability to do that. Then reality smacks you over the head... (I joke, I like Rust overall).Once you get into writing things the Rust way (TM?) you get to worry less (but not forget about completely) memory bugs that can cause crashes or be exploited. The benefits are many and varied. Rust also has a nice type system if you're into that, and nice language-level support for tagged/discriminated unions, and matching. If you're into function style/idioms, you'll feel at home, but if you're used to OOP there's plenty to recognise too, e.g. struct/impl/traits. I've often said my ideal general purpose HLL would be a cross between C and Rust (yes, I know about Zig and Odin), because I like both but find Rust annoying to write (especially when code involves lots of explicit lifetime annotation) and visually quite information-dense (IMO).I much prefer C, me/my teams rarely have most of the issues that the Rust compiler guards against, but nobody who likes Rust believes you when you say that :) I like to configure debug and release builds from the get go, and use the sanitisers (address etc.) in debug always. I have a big list of flags I use for compilation config built up over the years. LSPs and a parser (e.g. treesitter) catch some typos (e.g. . instead of -> or missing a \*/& etc.) too.Rust has no bearing on your Azure cert AFAIK, and to be honest it hasn't seen massive uptake commercially (yet?). I know lots of businesses (previous employers or places friends work) that are still using C and/or C++ with no interest even in committing to writing new software in Rust, let alone rewriting anything existing, anecdotally. I say this to say that the Rust job market isn't what it is for other languages (e.g. your C#, Java, others like JS and Python) which are seeing lots of use in recent years.There are also better languages if you want to learn how to manage memory freely, as Rust enforces it's particular model.TLDR; Learn Rust because you want to. Don't if you don't. You aren't disadvantaging yourself by not learning it, and it's fairly easily picked up if need be once you've been programming a while.

In the former days, this was an actual ROM, now it is usually some form of erasable programmable memory, like an EEPROM.The BIOS then has all the code to carry out the POST (Power On Self Test), plus libraries/functionality to talk with the various hardware components, and the code to then start, in case of a PC, the Operating System, of which the boot-loader is stored in a certain place on the hard drive (SSD, nVme, etc) of the computer.In case of the modern UEFI BIOS, this system is usually also stored on the computer's hard drive, but also exists in a storage on the main board so that when you change the hard drive, the computer can still boot.A good start to understand how everything of this plays together is to look into Microcontrollers, like the 8031/8051, Atmel (Arduino) as they are basically the same as a PC minus the operating system.",aqua_regis,2025-08-21 12:50:41,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mw9lc2,False,

Silly little projects lead to exponential gains as you learn from each other. Do code reviews of each others Labs. Maybe Dave knows something Bob doesn't, so Dave can let Bob know of this and now Bob knows this and he can pass that knowledge onto others. This way you learn of branching, merging, rebasing and the rest to keep your branches up to date with others.You can make friends with your teachers, because guess what? They were just like you. You never know what kind of insight they can give you.Always ask questions. Something doesn't make sense?

When you're doing it make sure you write everything like you're writing it for someone else and tag any really easy things with good first issue. These will often get picked up by others. Then you'll get a chance to see the basics of what maintainers are looking for in other people's code, and you'll get experience with light collaboration with others. After doing this for a while you'll feel way more confident in how to contribute.

Yes, I googled this* Google `how to load gif from file java`* Draw a gif that I found somewhere* Draw it 10x across and 5x down* Do I actually need an image or can I just draw circles? No! Circles is loser talk!* Stole animated gifs from another implementation of this program* Created 2D array, filled it with gifs. Displayed them* Break for lunch* Google `how to catch mouse clicks`* Click away happily for a few minutes* Use some advanced math (uh, division and modulo) to convert a point on the screen to an element of the 2D array* Change the code to say ""You clicked square x, y, which contains a blue blob""* Use my advanced CS degree to do find all the blobs of the same color connected to this blob (flood fill)* etcI can go on for a lot longer, but I hope I've made the point.

This way you're not hitting that ""how do I make a grid"" wall because the grid already exists.The AI thing is tricky. I actually built Writingmate partly because I saw people struggling with this exact issue. Instead of asking AI ""how do I make a grid"", try asking it to explain existing grid code line by line. Make it your tutor, not your coder.Also - and this might sound weird - try coding the same simple thing multiple times. Like, build a basic calculator 5 times over 5 days. By the 3rd time you'll start remembering the patterns, by the 5th it'll feel natural.One month is actually plenty of time if you focus.

Express and advanced JS concepts are honestly brutal for beginners, so don't feel bad about struggling with that stuff.For frontend, you're actually in a pretty good spot. Most companies will have designers who create mockups/wireframes for you to implement. You won't usually be designing from scratch unless you're at a tiny startup where everyone wears 10 hats. Your job would be taking those designs and turning them into actual working code.The fact that you've got CSS, HTML and most of JS down is solid. Frontend is way more forgiving when you're learning because you can actually see what you're building instead of staring at terminal outputs all day.At Metana we see students make this exact transition all the time. Backend concepts like databases, server architecture, APIs etc can be overwhelming at first but frontend lets you build confidence with visual feedback. Plus the job market for frontend is pretty decent right now.My advice would be to pick one path and stick with it for now instead of jumping around. If styling feels more natural than wrestling with Express, go frontend. You can always learn backend later once you're comfortable with one side of things.

For example, I didn't really ""get"" the quadratic equation until a teacher did a proof of it, so I could see how to get there from what I already knew.The other big way to connect new concepts to existing understanding is through analogy, but different people have different existing knowledge to connect to. For example, most math students wouldn't be helped if you said ""domain is the set of all valid arguments for a pure function, and range is the set of all valid return values"". In your case, though, that may be a useful analogy. So for the function: int.ToString(), the domain is all integers from - 2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, and the range is the set of all strings that match the regex ""\-?\d{1,10}""",beingsubmitted,2025-08-25 09:45:58,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mz75nx,False,

I've had similar experiences with courses where the instructor seems to contradict themselves, and it definitely slows things down.From my own experience, I'd suggest a couple of resources that are great for getting a solid foundation in PHP:The official PHP Manual (PHP.net): It can be a bit dry, but it's the absolute source of truth. Whenever I was stuck on what a function did or the right way to write something, I'd go there. It's less a tutorial and more of a reference, but it's essential.freeCodeCamp: They have a full, comprehensive PHP course on YouTube that is completely free. It's well-structured and a fantastic alternative to a confusing paid course.As for how long it takes, everyone's different. My biggest piece of advice, based on my own journey, is don't get lost in a forest of theory and code at the start.Just learn the absolute basics—variables, loops, etc.—and then immediately start doing. Try to build something super simple. A huge help for me was using an AI assistant. You can literally tell it, ""Explain this to me like I'm a child,"" and it will break down complex concepts into really simple terms. Use it to guide you as you build your first small project.Once you have some hands-on experience and things start to click, then go back and learn the deeper theory.

Reason being - each language has it's idiosyncracies/hidden gotchas/pitfalls. Most (if not all) of these are usually spelt out in the docs. In fact, several questions people ask on reddit/stackoverflow have their answers lying partially or wholly in the docs.That being said, there are caveats to how much of the docs one needs to read. I've added some context around this further below.>is it necessary to read ALL OF the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?No. It's recommended, but not necessary to read ALL of the documentation. My personal opinion is that you should only read the docs for things you're explicitly working with (though it's always good to go above and beyond).>I ask because documentation often contains a lot of specifications and information that can be overwhelming. I have been advised to read the ""reference manuals"" first, but even that is difficult.I feel you. Docs can be overwhelming especially if you're just starting out / are not familiar with the language. Here's how I do it (may or may not work for you) - I tend to generally only give docs a very surface level read/ avoid them until I'm fairly well versed with the language. Then - once I start doing more complex stuff - I tend to simply use my IDE to read docs for specific things I'm working with.E.g. in Java, if I'm using a class from the core library, I can hit F12 in my IDE to go to the class's source code and read the doc comments directly within that class.I find that this compartmentalizes the doc information to only the specific pieces of info I need for my work.

n9oup1b,"So first a question... If you want to change the rims and tires of your car, do you need to know about the piston compression first? Nope.While you certainly can, it may not be the best way to approach it.Ive been learning since jan, ive been using udemy courses, yt vids, projects and docs. Nowhere could i find a methodology to go through the documentation to find something and honestly its kinda confusing especially with poorly written docs.What i have found to help is to start high level and zoom into specifics as you get a better idea of what to do. Heres a recent example from my side while building a crud app. I want to create and view a blog article so what do i do? Assuming the html forms and express server is already set up. Ok so i need to be able to firstly log the inputs, what does it look like, how do i do that, and if its not in a useable state, how do i transform it. Ok then i need to be able to access the json file and also somehow save to the json file. Ok then lastly to view the article i need to again access the json and somehow display the info somewhere in my html( or in my case ejs template). Again what would happen if the data is not in a useable state? This breaks down all the steps which you can then go looking for your methods. So as an example (im using node and express for the backend) i want to access the json file. So you can google that and read around or go straight to the docs (if you know roughly which module) and then look for various ways to read a json file. And then when you find, ok so in the fs module i have a few methods to choose from, .read().readFile().createReadStream(), so among these methods which one is applicable to my situation. Now you're reading the docs, looking at specifics, comparing methods with a specific goal in mind. You can even test each one to see if it works or not. I have found this to work for me... And yes its very time intensive as compared to just getting the code from AI in 30sec.

The problem you need to solve is _text processing and XML handling_, but what you're asking about is _fully understanding Python_. These are two different things.Python as a language lets you be productive with only a small understanding of the language itself (that's how I got started with it; I've actually forgotten how or when I started writing Python, at some point I realised that's what I was writing my scripts in, rather than Perl or Bash).In programming, as elsewhere, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. The stuff you write with only a minimal understanding of Python will look awkward to someone more experienced, including yourself some few months from now.Generally what you want is:1. a _good enough_ understanding of the language semantics itself. ""Good enough"" is poorly defined, and varies by language: * A language like Rust will require more investment in learning up front, but deliver very few gotchas down the line * A language like Javascript or PHP will require very little investment in learning up front, but deliver more gotchas down the line * Python is kinda more middle-of-the-road. * For this bit you kinda just gotta read a book, preferably a good one so you don't fall asleep, and do some exercises to get a feel for it.1. A decent understanding of engineering in the language, as in, how do you write long-term maintainable code? * This includes which libraries and external tools you're expected to use. * For Python you kinda have to check /r/Python and other resources, but currently Astral tools like `uv` and `ruff` are good to have in your toolkit, and a typechecker like Microsoft's `pyright` until Astral's `ty` gets to 1.0. * Static analysis, both typechecking and linters, will help you catch weaknesses in your understanding of what you're doing.1. A decent ability to discover relevant information in documentation, especially reading API docs. * Generally searching is better than trying to memorize everything.

Consider “gathering requirements” this in itself is some documentation you want to create before you start developing. You probably also want to pin down any quality attributes and relevant SLO/SLAs, and a workable architecture or design for your software. Basically you start by producing a pile of documentation that you reference throughout your development, and while developing you may produce documentation about certain methods or functions, or a quirk of a third party system you interact with, and so on, which will help the future developers (likely you) maintain the project. You’ll also want “user facing documentation” that the people who use the software you produce can use to help them get the most out of it or answer questions for them when they stumble across a workflow quirk.Further I consider the value of a SWE to not just be code output, but “knowledge output”, so alongside development or while making architectural decisions or soliciting requirements, or after getting user feedback, they should also be learning things about the domain and ideally producing some documentation that can help the whole team understand the why and how behind certain domain-specific things. Code is almost inherently technical debt, and knowledge is the only thing that lets you pay it down.It sounds like a lot, but all of it can usually fit in an agile sprint or whatever. And to some extent it depends on what level of developer you are, Jr. dev will likely not be getting customer requirements, setting quality attributes and SLOs, nor drafting architecture.

na5h0zw,"The first few chapters of ""Designing data intensive Applications"" covers this nicely.BUT, those have become buzzwords that mean nothing at this point, all job descriptions have them, all CVs have them, all project descriptions have them.No, being on the cloud does not automatically make software scalable, neither resilient. A service must be designed with the intent to be runnable in multiple instances for it to be considered horizontally scalable, not all applications meet these criteria, and once they meet them, other services they depend on (e.g. databases, queues, weird disk based sharing) must also be able to meet demand, or else the service will just bottleneck outside of its control.Resilience can be broken down into three categories, what happens when the service breaks, what happens when the services around it break, and what happens when the service is used incorrectly - all three must be covered for it to be resilient, and cloud helps with none of these.What you probably have in mind is *availability,* which yes, load balancing a service which supports it in the cloud, whether automatically or manually, does to an extent solve availability (*to an extent is doing a lot of heavy lifting here).* This is what happens when *one or more* instances of your service are no longer available.Security is not only authorization and authentication, but also what information I can receive from your system while being a legitimate user, whether I can abuse timing, delays, your concurrency model, false requests, rollbacks and a thousand other things.However, most job postings don't really mean all this, it's just a fun thing to write these days.",disposepriority,2025-08-22 22:16:02,4,learnprogramming,t3_1mxivfe,False,
na7oy84,"Great answer from u/disposepriority !For my two pence, I'd like to add that, as much as the internet is only as fast as the slowest connection between you and the other end, the same can be said for ""resilient, scalable and secure"" software... if the fundamental processing units (the deployed code) are flaky and buggy, you are going to find stuff dying, then AWS for example will trigger an EB/EC2/Docker restart depending on what deployment route you set up, that will be blue/green usually so least disruptive but still, until the new box is switched live, users are left running the faulty one!So, from the bottom up it helps if good development practices regarding tests, integrations tests, staging servers to test prior to production release etc, these are all factors in a ""reliable"" system.As for **scalable**, depends on your needs: horizontal scaling is easy enough with AWS to trigger more boxes up under heavy loads, but again the onus is on you to make sure you can handle sessions properly, JWT based authentication usually makes that a no brainer but if you are using database sessions then that adds an extra step I guess but all normal stuff these days, plenty of best practices guides out there and from AWS; they have documentation on everything but it can be hard to find / hard to digest at times.**Vertical** scaling with AWS is easier if you use something like Terraform, we have a guy does that for us. Usually vertical scaling isn't an issue for us, we use Django and Celery and they run on separate instances to reduce load on the main API server, for that we use RabbitMQ in the mix. I can't remember the last we needed to tweak a box specification. We run everything via ECR/ECS, the AWS Docker solution.**Performant**: Well to some extent this goes back to initial software design, choosing the most efficient algorithms, libraries and your own data structures. For example, me being an big fan of Lisp, Haskell etc I tend to use \`deque\` instead of the stock Python list as it handles certain types of insertions faster than the List (possible premature by me?), then you can hand it back as a list() if you want later.[https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)and I have added this: [https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity)**Secure**: We use at rest encryption for our RDS instances, plus certain data models have custom load and save to perform encryption prior to sending fields to the database for double protection, using the SECRET\_KEY value.Also, we use asymmetric encryption on the JWT token, using the AWS Parameter Store to manage all keys, our environment configurations, TaskDefinitions etc are all setup to reference the keys so that they are available to Django at runtime through a simple AWS API call, and some are pushed into the running environment as we use \`decouple.config()\` quite a lot as well.So, that's what we do!",bravopapa99,2025-08-23 07:52:11,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mxivfe,False,
na7v3qf,"> The advantage of a cloud platform is that you don't have to worry about how to implement horizontal scaling (which would provide resiliency and scalability), right?I wish. The platform can do it, no stress, but whether the app can handle it is up to the app. If you slap an old stateful app into kubernetes and make more replicas of it, you're pretty likely to get bad behaviour, as in erroneous responses or crashes.We had high availability designs for apps before cloud providers, they were just a bit more of a PITA to get the other replicas for.One guide to getting there is the [12-factor app](https://12factor.net/). The guide might look a bit weird to those of us who think those are just normal apps, and work with gitops and distroless containers on a daily basis.> And would using the cloud platform's built-in authentication and authorization services be enough to ensure security?Yeah, nah. You can still leak your credentials and do lots of stupid shit. Vibe coders do it all the time. You need to have some idea of what authn and authz means, _why_ you do it, and which bits of information can go where. If you think the cloud services provide all the security you need and then push sensitive information out to any client, you've fucked up.Security is also something of an eternal cat-and-mouse game. Like some algorithms need to pretend to be slow just to limit their vulnerability to timing attacks. Security is an entire rabbit hole of its own.> I also see job postings that want experience designing ""performant"" software. Aren't you always trying to make code as efficient as possible? What is performant software and how would software not be performant?Software is non-performant for a whole host of reasons, and getting it to be performant isn't just one thing. One thing is bad [big-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), but people also do stuff like bad structuring of network calls, and to some extent choosing the wrong language (program design usually matters a lot more than language choice).",syklemil,2025-08-23 08:54:43,2,learnprogramming,t3_1mxivfe,False,

na6e7fn,"I'm going to disagree with the other two posters a *bit*, and post my own definition. Firstly, you absolutely, 100% should learn classes. They are used everywhere in every facet of programming, *including* Frontend Dev. Modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, Lit, etc. use them, so they're absolutely necessary to have at least a basic grasp of.I'd also disagree that the ""description of an object is called a CLASS"". This is like...90% accurate, but there's a small bit of distinction that I think is important.# Classes and ObjectsFirstly, let's define what the word ""object"" means. I like to think of an object in programming as a *noun*; it's a ""thing"". It has can have some **adjectives** that describe it (it's ""old"" or ""blue"") and it can have some **verbs** that it can do (it can ""drive"" or ""honk""). It's also got a name usually that describes it (so we can refer to that ""thing""), and often times we can say that it's a particular **kind** of thing. Now, instead of using the words ""adjective"", ""verb"", and ""kind"", let's replace those with more programmy words: - `property`: properties are the adjectives. They describe something about the object. Some of those properties can be changed (I may get taller or shorter as I age); other properties cannot change (I will always have been born in my hometown; that cannot change). Generally speaking, properties don't ""do"" anything; they're just descriptors. Each property has a ""key"" (what it is) and a value. For example, our car has a property with key ""color"" and value ""blue"". - `method`: Methods are the verbs, and they usually have a pair of parentheses somewhere in their name. I can `program()`. I can `write(message)` (write a message). I cannot `fly()` (that's not one of my methods!). - `class`: The class of an object is, roughly speaking, its _type_. I am a human (my class is Human). The `old`, `blue` thing that can `drive()` is an object of type `Car`. All objects of a particular type are defined as having certain methods and properties. Classes can also be thought of as ""templates"" for objects. I want an object that fits the template ""car"" (i.e., does things a car can do), so I'll use the Car class.Here's an example of a class in JavaScript:```class Car { constructor(color, age){ //roughly speaking here, `this` refers to the object we're talking about. this.color = color; this.age = age; } drive() { alert('vroooom!'); }}```And to use this class, I'd do something like this:```const myCar = new Car('blue', 'old');console.log(myCar.color);//'blue'```So why would I disagree that the description of an object is a class? Well, in describing that old blue car, I'd... well I'd describe it exactly that. An old, blue car. _However_, the adjectives ""old"" and ""blue"" are _not part of the class_! Instead, they're values (see above). Instead, a class describes a _template_ for an object, not that actual, specific object. Every person alive has an `age` property and a `placeOfBirth` property, but mine is almost certainly different from, say, yours. # WhyClasses allow us to organize our data in a paradigm of programming known as Object Oriented Programming (OOP). It's not the _only_ paradigm, but it's a pretty popular one. Classes: - Allow us to define a particular behavior _once_ and then reuse that behavior - Can be ""extended"". For example, I might have a `Pet` class with properties like `hungerLevel` or methods like `makeSound()`, and then I might ""extend"" that class with something like a `Dog` class (with a `bark()` method), or a `Fish` class (with a `splash()` method). Again, this allows us to define certain, common behaviors only once!The first point is particular important. Imagine if every time a person signed up for FaceBook, a team of programmers had to write functions to deal with that person's account. Oh, /u/Maleficent_Speech289 signed up? We'll need to write a `login()` and `getPictures()` and `postMessage()` method for them! Instead, with classes, you can just say: ```const someUser = new User('Maleficent_Speech289');someUser.getPictures(); //this behavior is already defined, so we can just use it!```# TL;DR:You absolutely, 100% need to know classes as a programmer. It doesn't matter if you're new, senior, or somewhere in between; you'll need to know them at some point, and it's never too early to start learning them. Anyone that hires you will expect you to have clean, structured code, and while there are other programming paradigms, OOP is one of the most popular to the point that it's kinda a ""default"".",HealyUnit,2025-08-23 01:37:19,8,learnprogramming,t3_1mxf2kp,False,

na6yn1g,"In JS, a class, aka object, is not really an object, it is ***a prototype *** This difference was emphasized in many older books but has been forgotten since around 2012. The last book I know of that adheres to this differentiation though the author did not explain the difference at all was the book Javascript the Good Parts by Douglas Crawford. You should think of a prototype as a ***generalized object/class***, it is a ***meta-class*** so to speak. This was something discussed in a very old book called The Art of the Metaobject Protocol by Gregor Kiczales. A typical object is very easy to understand as others have no doubt explained to you already. It is basically a list of data and a list of methods that operates on those data and those data only. You can create a new type of object from an existing object by inheriting all of its data and methods + nee ones you specified. You should think in your mind as a circle engulfed by a bigger circle where the smaller circle is the old and the big circle now containing the smaller circle is the new. This is pretty much all you can do with objects if JS were really an object-oriented language like Java -- I wrote some stuff bashing Java the other day, people interested should search for the keyword Scratch in my comment history. I basically argued why Scratch is better than Java, but that's just a click-bait title. With prototype, the relationship between the old and the new is not a circle in a circle but two circles connected by a line. Yep, that's it. We are done.To truly appreciate the difference, you have to ask what happens during the ***construction of a new new-object***. In the circle-in-circle model, you simply get another circle-in-circle. However in JS, creating another circle-line-circle new-object can be done in ***two ways***, hence all the weird constructors in JS. When you use the keyword 'class' you are creating a brand new circle-line-circle. This is the standard method since ECMA6. However there is an older method using the keyword 'new"". With 'new', you do not get another circle-line-circle, you get a new circle attached to the existing circle-line-circle, and the relationship is a triangle. The you have circle-line-Circle-line-circle where Circle represents the old-object and the two 'circle's are the created new-objects. Why does this matter? This means both child (new-objects) share the same parent. And either one can ***modify the parent's data or add new methods to the parent*** and that information will be propagated to the other child. This is an important feature because it means you can modify the parent ***at run time.*** You can use this for all sorts of purposes. It would take too long to explain all the things you can do with this, just consult the book I mentioned or use your imagination. I do want to mention something that is not in the book and I do not believe it is implemented anywhere. In JS at least you can do it pretty easily. Imagine now you go to the new 'class' constructor and you use that to create another circle-line-Circle-line-cicrle, now you have two families of the same objects, but they can follow different ***dynamic*** paths during program run time to become something else entirely. One obvious application would be for games where you have different creatures from different families but as they evolve, they can split off from the main tree. But, it can even go back through its ancestor tree and start ***rewriting history.***Anyway, this is long enough.e: JS was originally derived from Scheme and the book was written for LISP based language which is the root of Scheme. The creator of JS wanted to create a Scheme language to be used as the scripting language for the then best browser Netscape. However, Java had just taken off and was seen as the future of the programming world. So the investors of Netscape insisted on a ***java-like*** language thinking it would make JS compatible with Java in the future. Obviously you should never let non-tech people make tech decisions. So the JS creator took the matter into his own hand and created a ***java-look-alike***. It looks like Java but it has nothing to do with Java, it is way better because it runs on Scheme under the hood. Yes, that's all it is. He took a Scheme engine and created a cosmetic layer over it. This was how he created JS in 3 days. And God took 7 days to create the Universe. Not too shabby.",kcl97,2025-08-23 03:57:09,1,learnprogramming,t3_1mxf2kp,False,

That provider will almost certainly have its own rules about how sensitive data can be handled. For instance, I think credit card processors typically forbid you from logging credit card numbers in plaintext, and from storing CVV values in any way whatsoever.Also consider whether your system falls within the scope of laws like the EU's GDPR or California's CCPA. These rules don't necessarily forbid you from logging sensitive personal data, but *if* you do log it, then you'd better have a process for scrubbing your logs in case somebody asks for their personal data to be deleted.

As for your question, I think the data you're talking about is valuable to keep for troubleshooting purposes but I don't think logs are an appropriate place to store it.

I believe you need to know how a program runs before you start coding. Also, I believe beginners don't know how to pick an appropriate size project, and that if they start projects right away, they fail to learn the basics, in particular, control flow. That is, imagine you're a debugger (a program that lets you go step by step through a program). Could you do that without using a computer, that is, if I gave you a simple program, can you determine what it does?**Alternate approach**Many others find the standard method I've described boring and therefore hard to motivate themselves. So, they do the following* Pick a project* Google a lot to find enough relevant information to code it* Learn enough about coding while doing the projectWhat they like about this approach is they are building something which is something they *enjoy*. Does everyone enjoy this? No, they don't. But for those that do, this kind of thing is super rewarding.However, there are problems with this approach. The first is it works for only a small number of people. They're able to find answers to what they're looking for. They are able to learn enough about programming to accomplish the task.To me, this is the equivalent of going to a foreign country and trying to pick up the language on the fly. You read a few common phrases, and trust the people know enough English and can decipher your accent enough that you get by. Some find that approach better than an academic approach where you learn how to conjugate verbs and learn grammatical structure.When someone opts to do projects, they want to find something interesting and cool, but even the most boring programs you can think of (Hangman, Tic-tac-toe) are quite difficult for most beginners, and they want to write 3D first person shooters or have some AI or do some image or video processing.

On the other hand, M4 Macs are already on ARMv9, which is pretty similar to ARMv8 as far as unprivileged code is concerned but significantly different for privileged code as many system registers were added, changed, and removed since ARMv8, plus the M4 in particular also has 512-bit Scalable Matrix Extension support, so depending on what you want to do, that may or may not be appealing to you.General purpose AArch32 and AArch64 HTML documentation:* [ARMv6M, ARMv7, and ARMv8 assembly reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0801/latest/);* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 instruction set architecture](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/latest/)* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 system registers](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0601/latest/)Documentation specific to the SoCs used by the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 and their derivatives:* [Cortex A72 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100095/latest/)* [Cortex A76 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100798/latest/);* [ Generic Interrupt Controller core reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0471/latest/);* [Generic Interrupt Controller v2 specific reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0048/latest/);* [PrimeCell 0111 UART](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0183/latest/);* [BCM2711 datasheet (Pi 4)](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/bcm2711/bcm2711-peripherals.pdf).Other resources:* [Bare-metal section of the Raspberry Pi forums (I help there sometimes under the same name as my reddit account)](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewforum.php?f=72&sid=de4c2c97b2b1372281ef64d6aed3dc5f);* [Tutorial that got my feet wet on AArch64 (I already had experience with AArch32 from decades ago)](https://www.rpi4os.com/);* [Rust HDMI audio driver that I made for the Pi 4 and 5](https://github.com/CodexTextor/rpi-hdmi) (will not work on the BCM2712 D0 stepping SoC used on models of the Pi 5 introduced after I wrote that code because the physical addresses of the hardware are different).Note that there's no public official documentation for the BCM2712 SoCs of the Raspberry Pi 5, so all my code targeting that platform is based on my own reverse-engineering research effort that included reading the official Linux driver code from Broadcom, messing around with hardware registers on Linux to figure out how they work with a proper driver, and deriving knowledge from my experience with and available documentation for the BCM2711 SoC of the Pi 4, since there was very little community work done on this front when I got my first Pi 5.

You can find plenty information on how Steve did it on the internet.When I learnt 8051 Assembly in my degree program we initially also learnt to hand-translate the Mnemonics into machine code and vice versa. Can highly recommend to learn that with simpler CPUs, like the 6502, the Zilog Z-80, or the 8051/8031/8080 series Microcontrollers.Assembly is just a 1:1 translation of machine code and therefore is closest to hardware.",aqua_regis,2025-08-21 09:36:55,5,learnprogramming,t3_1mw5n7i,False,

natal5c,"Depends what you're building and what components it has. Obviously there's the module system (e.g. cjs or esm modules) but that's just the start. You can do anything from parameterising module imports to full dependency injection/inversion of control. Even use a more functional style for some parts possibly.For the typical back end written in Express I would expect an attempt at a good dir/file structure for API versioning, middleware, and endpoints, and perhaps some distinction between the controller/service/data access layers (e.g. something resembling N tier). Controller can handle any transformations, maybe light /generic validation, service layer is where the business logic lives, data access handles (de)serialisation to and from data stores, parameterises prepared statements, handles database connection(s) etc. You can make use of require/import, the (sub)router system, whatever. The specifics don't matter too much as long as it's clear IMO.Config somewhere central and top-level, not spread throughout the code.Sometimes it's nice to organise models/mappers and routes according to the entities they're related to.No mixing of view and logic layers if possible.You don't mention whether JS or TS, but for loose coupling the answer is usually some sort of interface usage.

natywrr,"The main thing I'm usually interested in seeing is how someone organizes their code into functions, at least during a normal interview since 1 hour can fly by quickly. I.e. does the person make good choices on a minimal/necessary set of parameters, functions that are not too massive nor too small/numerous, functions that are focused on one major task (e.g. don't mutate external state + return a value, generally speaking).Take-homes can raise the bar there since you have more time - you can expand beyond just basic functional abstraction and establish more of an ""architecture"" with clear subsystems.There are two things going on I think with bigger-picture abstractions. One is about the choices you make in organizing your code when it's apt to do so, and the other is signaling that you speak the language of professional software development, if that makes sense.I would ignore ""clean architecture"", personally. It's overwrought and a distraction IME. There's certainly a balance to strike here, but just because ""long functions"" is a problem doesn't mean having thousands of 2-line functions is the answer.Separation of concerns is good - that's a broader principle, in how you divide your code into subsystems or layers. Definitely good to show this.Parts of SOLID are really good, across many languages. S & D tend to be the most important. I follows from good design choices. O is good, but can follow from D, when it's more about composition being the vehicle for extensibility. L, and also O when it involves inheritance, is certainly good to not violate, but it's somewhat avoidable if you just avoid overuse of inheritance in the first place, at least for most application development.If I had to guess, if you were writing node.js server code, maybe you were doing too much within routes. A few possibilities:* direct database or network calls in business logic.* direct coupling to Express or other framework specifics throughout too much of the code.* mixed concerns in single functions or classes.* lacking certain good abstractions for the problem at hand.* splitting into files, but not actually separating responsibilities as well as you could have.* lacking clear boundaries or interfaces between layers or modules.* hard-coded dependencies instead of constructor injection.* reaching too deeply across modules (see law of demeter)* poor/improper use of middleware.",SoSpongyAndBruised,2025-08-26 20:49:23,1,learnprogramming,t3_1n0qst6,False,

You could feel that every single crypto asset is bullshit, but even then I’m not sure you could deny that selling services to people who want to use and trade those assets isn’t a real business. I think Pokémon card investing is bullshit, but if someone built a website to facilitate buying and selling of cards and took in real revenue, I’d still call that a real business. And all of those trading venues and lending venues need developers, often to build rather complex products that can’t have much downtime.An area that’s bigger than ever are stablecoins - crypto assets pegged to (generally) the US dollar. The companies that offer these digital assets hold things like US treasuries to back them, so the company can earn revenue off of the interest while also ensuring that each digital dollar can be redeemed for a US dollar. As far as crypto things go, these are probably the most useful. People in countries with volatile currencies and poor banking systems can now receive, hold, send, and earn interest on US dollars with just a phone and an internet connection. They can send them anywhere in the world and be paid from anywhere in the world.

Why in the world would I read through logs, find the error, google that error, and spend time figuring out what's wrong and how to fix it?

na5zono,"I'm in the exact same boat right now. Got laid off in June. I worked for a very small startup as a backend engineer for about 5 years, and I was their first hire. It was also my first developer job as well. A lot of what I learned was self-taught since I had very little experience with APIs, databases, and frameworks initially. I was able to learn a lot, but one harsh reality I've realized is that there is a lot of stuff that I did that doesn't fit in with current industry standards and best practices. I've only gotten about 5 interviews over the last few months, and I've been struggling with the technical interviews as well. It's been eye-opening for me to see my shortcomings. I've also questioned whether I'm still good enough to remain in this industry. For now, all I've been doing has been trying to better myself for what my role actually requires. I've been doing courses, studying up on terminology, and I've even been studying my resume to make sure I can fully explain anything I did that's on it.Every rejection is demoralizing, but for the interviews that I do get, I take it as a learning experience since it highlights another thing I need to work on.",Flare200,2025-08-23 00:06:26,33,cscareerquestions,t3_1mxm916,False,

It's like I have more to learn and less time to do it because I have a job and a partner. I've failed around 4 interview loops this year either going late into it or just bombing early. I think my strategy is probs to do a little bit of study over a longer period of time and try again. I don't think I have the time/energy to do the 1 month grind I did in uni lol.

The truth is: nobody is fully “ready.”A couple things that helped me:\- Mix practice with mock interviews (Reddit, Discord, friends). It builds confidence faster than just grinding alone.\- Dont ignore behavioral - a lot of rejections happen here, even for strong coders. Write down answers to the top 20-30 common ones (“tell me about yourself,” conflicts, mistakes, etc.).\- For tech rounds, you don’t need to master everything. \~100 leetcode mediums will carry you through most screens. If you feel shaky, you can also lean on [https://techscreen.app/](https://techscreen.app/) or interviewcoderOn the mental side: it’s fine to take breaks.

na8vc3l,"I definitely resonate.I was 3 YOE and was laid off for 7 months. I finally got another swe job, but it took over 23+ different positions that led to at least technical rounds. The broadness of the prep really messed with me too.I think I still would of been boned if I had to start over but know what I learned from this layoff.I know what you mean, I thought I was out of the industry too. Out of the 23 attempts I only got 2 offers, and one was laughably bad compared to what I used to have. For me specifically, even though every company was vastly different - I eventually kind of caught on there is overlap to an extent. Try to identify that, and leave the rest up to chance.The reality is you have to get 90-100% on the ""exams"" and your competition has to screw up at our YOE ( tie breakers will usually go to most YOE or whoever stood out more). I had more than one job give me feedback that I actually did really good during the interviews, but my competition would have triple my experience and have a similar performance. I lost twice for a 6 round top 2 finalist.. right before I started my job I nailed round 3/4 for a 130k remote job then ghosted. It's just unfair lol. The job I got my final competition was 20 yoe, 8 yoe, 15 yoe. I won at 3 yoe because I was the only one who solved the coding challenge, answered every question correct, AND they liked me / personality fit went well. It took 23 times to set up that scenario. That day was crazy. I had FIVE onsites in a week for 4 companies. I had TWO onsites the day I finally won one stupid job. Funny part is it was the one I thought I did bad on because their API challenge was absolutely stupid. They were like YOU HAVE 7 MINUTES TO MAKE A GET REQUEST API ON THIS CODEBASE HERES A LAPTOP.I was like ??. I survived being nearly interrogated by 3 men answering every question and had to completely switch gears. I've failed so many interviews due to stress and pressure. This particular time I think I was jaded that I had so many onsites in a week and had to go drive to my 2nd one literally right after this I took a breath and started. I talked out loud my thoughts, reiterating the REST pattern of controller implementation repostiory layers. I copied a different GET request in that file and started asking questions about the method and made the params or wrote comments what I wanted to do. I updated the same in the interface/model. I went into the repository layer and just copied how they're connecting to the DB and started making it. I ran out of time and couldn't make it run. Left going screw this place.Turns out I did the best and got further than the others... But the catch was it's a government job so it took 3 MONTHS to get a start date due to a lot of background checks.For me personally, I wasn't getting leetcode that often towards the end. I did lose at least 3 positions because of failing the leetcode, but most of them didn't have it. I lost 2 positions to system design. What I did get almost consistently was this ""tech trivia"" interviews in my market. Asking very specific concepts or language questions and building off off it. I used free tier LLM's to give me 20-30 questions and go in depth prompting and trying to understand all the concepts. I would use the mic feature to simulate interview questions 1 by 1 and get feedback. I found that greatly helped me pass that round even if it wasn't perfect.Turns out some companies were getting questions from the same bank as me, and I would occasionally get some verbatim things I studied. Like what is async and go into detail. What is a Singleton. How would you debug an expensive SQL query. I also found by simulating those questions I had a higher chance of coming up with at least a passable sounding answer.I still suck at it - but to work on the little debugging / API / leetcode easiest / fill in the methods.. I went and did leetcode easy problems and put a timer for 10 minutes. My goal was to talk out loud and explain everything, and make a solution, test, run. In those simulations I could still feel pressure even then. Being at 8-9 minutes and I missed an edgecase and scrambling to fix it. I think that was the right path to work on the pressure part. If you're struggling specifically with crud api's I'd use LLM's to help you make a simple crud in your stack and study it. You could time urself to make a stupid crud or analyze a piece of code it generated / something open source ( I didn't end up doing this)So in return, I basically was like my odds of passing are lower if I get Leetcode med or hard, system design, or something I haven't seen before. It's just too vast. You do want to work on it all but if I were to go again, id try to perfect a ""section"" of the interview during downtime, and cram like hell for whatever the current interview is gonna be.It still sucks, I don't know the answer. I still can't believe I went thru all that. My actual job a month in isn't easy but it's kinda laughable how much lower expectations are vs the interview I had there. I'm getting a month to build a GET request, make test cases, consume it on the front end. Not 7 minutes... LolI think if I had 6 more months to study I'd be closer to a top candidate but realistically I just need more resume experience for right now.",Super-Blackberry19,2025-08-23 13:41:53,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1mxm916,False,

At the time, I was absolutely against this because new hires, particularly jrs, are basically a time suck and I felt like I'd be putting in basically a lot of work for pretty much no return and I already was burnt out and didn't have a whole lot of time. The intern ended up starting and he absolutely exceeded all expectations. I felt like I could give him a task and with only a little guidance, he would figure it out on his own get it done and was really quick to pick up on things. I also didn't have to explain things to him multiple times. He would complete things quickly and with the enthusiasm of someone still fresh in the field.Despite me never wanting an intern in the first place I ended up pushing to hire him after the internship ended and after he finished out his last semester in school. He is now with us full time and whenever raise time comes around, I'm asking my boss what if anything I can do to help him get a promotion/raise- the answer is usually nothing, but I want to keep him because he has proven himself to be super valuable to the team and I know that earlier on in your career is when you can make moves to other companies for the biggest jumps in your career. I guess to me what made the difference was that, he learned/improved quickly and was fairly independent. I didn't have to spell out each and every little step like I would to a chatgpt prompt.

n9wpudx,">Quiet quitting / giving 50% on my day job isn’t an option, management is tracking quite literally ever 30 mins of my day.What would happen if you changed the 100% of your day to mean a regular, 8 hour, 9-5 work day?You're not changing it to 50%, you're not quiet quitting. You're establishing professional boundaries and making it clear that your working hours are 9-5, M-F. You'll be working 100% of your working hours.I don't know how cutthrough the consulting scene is, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but that's the advice I normally give to people suffering burnout. People always think in extremes. ""Put up with being miserable working 12 hour days"" vs ""Quit without anything lined up"".In reality there's usually a less extreme option: ""Enforce your professional boundaries, and work 8 hour days, regardless of what's going on around you with the project and management"". And immediately start job searching with all that extra time.The thing about that approach is even if that ruffles feathers, they usually don't fire you right away. They'll heckle you about your performance, they might PIP you, they'll desperately start looking for your replacement, maybe the client will drop you... but all that often takes months. Firing you outright is a much larger impact to the project than letting you work ""normal"" 8 hour days until they hire and train your replacement. It'd be a stupid management decision to react prematurely.So in that time before they fire you... you're job searching *and* collecting a paycheck instead of draining your savings. And the best part of that approach is if they do end up firing you before you line something else up, you're *exactly* where you were about to put yourself voluntarily: Unemployed.That said, at the end of the day quitting without something lined up isn't the end of the world. It's a calculated risk and an expense. If you decide that's worth it, go for it. If even after reducing your workday to 8 hours you're still feeling miserable, then that's likely not going to help, so quitting ASAP may be the best option for you.I'm surprised you lasted 3+ years of 12+ hour days... I would've be gone in month 1. WLB is my #1 priority. I'm a 9-5 employee.

From the company’s perspective, a billable hour is a billable hour, but overtime hours are expensive, so it’d be perfectly reasonable to work with your leadership chain to cut overtime and hire more people instead. If relying on overtime is widespread, you can probably even rally support from coworkers by getting everyone to complain to leadership simultaneously.The time tracking thing doesn’t need to involve micromanaging. All they care about is for time to be plausably accounted for, you don’t need to annotate every tiny minute.

What is complexity of accessing a hashmap, what is an interface, what is REST, what is ACID, what is an index and when do you use it, would you choose monolithic or microservices architecture for a startup?2nd round - live coding: TDD approach, language of my choice, editor of my choice, testing framework of my choice, AI disabled. Create a very simple bank account and a way to do a transaction between 2 accounts. Then make it work in a multithreaded environment.3rd round - still live coding but very pseudo-code stuff. Write very simple load balancer (no network stuff, just simple code no real integration), make it random, make it round Robin. Then few stuff about SQL, what is pessimistic locking, what is optimistic locking and how does it work, write SQL for it, show me how to use it. What is a transaction, a dead lock, etc..4th round - system design.. model a system that solves this simple X real problem found in our domain. Just a chat basically.1st round quickly filters out people who don't have basic knowledge2nd round verifies skills in OOP, TDD, multithreading (locks, dead lock, race conditions).3rd round again verifies skills in OOP (bit redundant tbh), but then goes into the DB and verifies that you actually know what is going on under the framework4th round verifies that you know more high-level architecture stuff.. message queues, redundancy, gateway/api/reverse-proxy, sharding... and that you can think bigger than just a few classes.I think these 4 rounds could be compressed in just 3 and be just as effective.

In addition to talking about what was involved in coding the dashboard, you should talk about things like: why your company wanted this dashboard built, how you worked with the design team to build your dashboard to their design spec, how you wrote unit/functional/e2e tests and UATed your dashboard prior to deploy, how you used feature flagging and log monitoring to ensure a successful deploy, and what business goals were accomplished after you successfully deployed your dashboard.

A union's goal (besides putting money in the union bosses' pockets) is to help EMPLOYEES, especially senior employees, obtain better pay and more favorable work assignments. They do nothing to help people who are out of work, and even trades, which are supposed to be in high demand in general, have unions which intentionally limit new-comers to the field so that established members' skills will be in higher demand.

But they can be used as protection by the company to demonstrate that there were performance issues with the employee.

In case the terminated employee decides to pursue legal action against the company.By placing someone on a PIP they create a paper trail (no matter how flimsy it is) that the person wasn't performing their job well. I suspect it's also to cause doubt in the employee's mind about the likelyhood of prevailing in court. By having a formalized process where they told you, that you weren't performing maybe that can convince you to just accept it and quietly go away.As for your second question there's only a few paths. One, do whatever they ask to get off the PIP if possible. Though to be honest it sounds like you wouldn't be happy in your current role (QA Automation/ not dev and poorly maintained code base). Two, resign. Three collect pay checks while looking for the next job until they fire you. Option three will yield unemployment.Each one has tradeoffs.

For all practical purposes, Spanner is highly available, highly consistent (basically instant so the 'eventual' part is just theory for practical purposes), and infinite scale.""So ya... now, CAP theorem states that in a real world, we have to choose Availability or Consistency as first priority.

Big banks hold records of swipes, withdrawals, deposits, etc globally. Those dumb Youtube videos during covid by these juniors trying to gain views about high writes == nosql (kind of true but whatever)? sql databases can when writes are properly batched in theory go over a million insert per second though in reality, let's say 10k insert per second. 10k insert per second is 10\^5 \* 10\^5 sec a day = 10\^10 inserts a day aka 10 billion rows a day.Schemaless? Unless you are dealing with e-commerce, fraud, machine learning, etc., you can shove in your metadata to JSONB on postgresql.ACID vs BASE? DynamoDB supports ACID as well. You can have sql databases have BASE like properties. Especially mysql in which you can change engine.Biggest differences are really nosql databases tend to be LSM tree oriented while sql databases tend to be B tree oriented. But DynamoDB on its sort key is B tree oriented as well.Sharding? SQL can have auto sharding. Though it is true in practice (this part I agree since I have not used auto sharding in my jobs) you do have to worry about sharding on SQL. But like what? A few days a year or two for the team once everythings set up?

If you need help then that means you grew so much that it's a successful problem to have.Most people are working at mature firms. A properly run mature firm should have had infra team do all the tooling so product side engineering can just ship.System Design Interview is just another theatre like Leetcode Interview. Don't overthink. Companies need some way to separate levels and filter candidates at the onsite.You think most engineers in tech ever built Amazon e-commerce site ground up? Nope. Maybe a few handful in the country? But you get that interview. Where do you think many interviewers get the question and answer from? Whatever they saw/memorized with their own experiences added on the Internet/workplace.If you actually do quick 'back of the envelope' calculation to many system design interviews, you will realize ""I can do this with 1 server"" (you should STILL have replica because servers always crash). You will realize vertical scaling means very different from a decade ago and today.You know when I was a kid growing up, 256mb USB was insane. Now we got portable SSDs that are in the terrabytes.

System Design interview prep alone can take months. Similar idea with Leetcode and so forth. And realistically years because you do this in sprints over your career as you level up.Basically say your job only involves taking sums (adding basic items). If you test the candidate all sorts of ideas like taking sum/division/multiplication/difference of real numbers (negative numbers, decimals, integers, irrational numbers, etc), imaginary numbers, symbols, etc. then you can feel somewhat assured the person can probably add basic numbers reliably. Is that correlation perfect? Nope. But I would find it hard pressed to find someone who can do a complex operation involving multiple paranthesis, imaginary number, negative number, multiplication, addition all nested together to struggle with basic additions consistently.

For instance, you can use dynamodb for banking related stuff which need ACID transactions. That was not something people thought a decade ago and so forth.Or given time constraints or familiarity or complexity or cost or whatever, you would prefer Y. You generally want to keep the system as simple as possible in the real world.>seeing how well they communicate and react to feedback.That is what system design interview is testing by level.Junior = Has very little general idea.

Reacts well to feedback and sounds like someone who can grow and you would want to work withSenior = Able to design properly. Experienced and starts to know the details. And the pros and cons. Accepts life has multiple options. Leads the interview and comes with good working design that the person can defend.Staff = More details than Senior. Has enough experience to even mention details that aren't on books (this is a lie again). Able to have the simplest design and depending on a certain nonfunctional requirement, comes up with a nontraditional simple idea that works.Principal = At this point you are basically god of the interview. You also consider costs as well. Can't make a single mistake. It's an extreme bar and one could argue is really luck based. There's a reason engineers at tech firms make 7 figures from here.The whole idea is as you gain more 'experience' in the real world, the way you 'talk' changes. So it really is about communication.In practice? It's a whole show of bull like Leetcode. Why? Because in an actual job unless one works in pre-seed A or seed A startup (not even then), the day to day job is going to be nothing like the system design interview. It's going to be like what you said. It's just another round to fake.Plus, if you talked about using DynamoDB for payment transactions half a decade ago, then depending on interviewer, you would have been rejected anyways.

The other option is doing what Netflix often does and putting high preference towards those who were referred by internal professionals. That just opens up to nepotism at that point.Do we want to go back to ""how many manholes in New York"" and so forth which btw have all been solved (significantly easier to memorize. Do-able in days), completely irrelevant to the job, etc?Explicit IQ tests are illegal and so this interview format is the closest to check someone's puzzle matching abilities. And no one can know who is a better hire over another without seeing the individual at the actual job (on payroll) for at least over half a year.Outside many LC Hards (which is just bullshit and only there for filtering because of supply/demand), most LC Easy and Medium are things I would expect a competent junior could do with prep. The ""prep"" is known to everyone (as fair as possible) and scalable (an individual does not need to study per role per company). From there given there's finite time, I can also get someone's thought process and communication. And most importantly, pattern matching skills (which is honestly some of the most important skills on the actual job). Let alone LC at its fundamentals tests on the very basic concepts I would expect every CS grad should know like classes, hashmap, set, bfs/dfs, stack/queue. On an ideal interview even if the candidate cannot think of the solution, the candidate should be able to work with the interviewer to the solution (indirectly shows how adaptable the candidate is to the actual workers there).Fortunately, very very few firms give actual LC ""Hards"" directly w/o help. And those that do give the well known handful of LC Hards that can be studied for. If you are applying to Uber and Uber pays a massive paycheck, then of course you should expect artificially high standards because everyone's applying but there's only a few positions available. Most firms to this day especially nontech give LC Easy or Easy Medium. Something as simple as checking if a string is a palindrome or if the paranthesis are valid.Some companies do take home assignments on top as a byproduct. But the problem with take home is individuals have to code in a language they are not comfortable with and spend many hours (because other candidates will put in many hours regardless of what the expectation claims). But the reject from the hiring side is decided in seconds or minutes at most. It's extremely unfair from the candidate side. So ya... It's process of rational elimination.

I mean, I can tell you if a site is well designed - so can my mother. I dont think its difficult for AI to grasp this concept and produce designs for you. Almost all sites have at the very least the same layout; search bar at the top, nav bar top right/left and so on. Beyond this and the small design changes between different sites, I cant see design needing to be done in the way it is now. My team at work no longer needs the amount of designers we have - we got AI to design us a new view based on our existing views and it looked great.The only exception to this (as always there are exceptions) will be exceptional designers in my option. Those designers who come up with new, unique almost game changing designs followed by many. AI wont be able to do this as easily, because AI needs a basis to train on. For example, in the late 2010's we got the gradient design you see on Stripe, with the scrolling animations as you scroll down. I think this design was game changing within the game of design, and so many sites followed this (I dont even know if Stripe were first tbh).I feel like if youre that good, original and can constantly change/push the bar, you'll be fine.

na2w92a,"First thing I’d suggest is to pause the scattershot learning for a moment. It’s easy to feel like you need to chase every cert or language, but that often leads to burnout without real progress. Instead, reflect on what you enjoyed most from your tech role. Was it the problem solving side of coding, or the precision and detail that comes with testing? If testing was your comfort zone, roles in QA automation or SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) could be a natural pivot. These roles often let you leverage your coding skills while staying close to quality focused work.If you’re craving something new, IT certifications can definitely open doors but you’ll want to be strategic. For example, if you go the cloud route, AWS Solutions Architect Associate or Azure Fundamentals → Administrator can get you noticed quickly. If you lean toward cybersecurity, CompTIA Security+ is a great starting point and pairs well with your testing mindset. The key is to pick one lane, commit, and build a portfolio around it. Whether that’s small projects on GitHub, automation scripts, or even freelance gigs on platforms like Upwork. Freelancing can also be a good bridge though it won’t always be glamorous, but it’s real world experience that helps fill the gap on your resume.If you can structure the next 6–12 months around one clear goal say, “transition into cloud roles” or “move into automation testing” you’ll find it much easier to cut through the fog. And if you’d like more step by step advice, practical roadmaps, and career tips, [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) shares a lot of that.
