The main analyst freaked out, suddenly quit, formed his own company, and poached the entire staff of his original team leaving only the “manager” for that team. The guy pretended everything was fine for 2 weeks and told nobody that he was soloing all this work. During that two weeks, he fucked up some report for management that made the corporate metrics look absolutely dogshit which triggered an analytics all hands meeting to figure out what was happening.

It says that everything in the table should be about the *whole* key, not just a piece of it.* **Rule:** Be in 1NF and have no partial dependencies. This means that all the information in a row must depend on the entire primary key.* **Example:** Imagine a table for pizza orders. The key is the `Customer` and the `Pizza Type`.**Messy (Not 2NF):** | Customer | Pizza Type | Customer's Favorite Topping | | :------- | :--------- | :-------------------------- | | Sam | Pepperoni | Olives | | Mia | Cheese | Pineapple | | Sam | Veggie | Olives |The problem here is that the ""Favorite Topping"" is only about the `Customer`, not what kind of pizza they ordered that day.

We'll throw in their first movie appearance for good measure.**Messy (Not 3NF):** | Character | Movie | Movie's Director | | :---------------- | :------------------ | :--------------- | | Buzz Lightyear | Toy Story | John Lasseter | | Woody | Toy Story | John Lasseter | | Elsa | Frozen | Chris Buck |Here, the ""Movie's Director"" is really about the `Movie`, not the `Character`.

nfp8ag4,"Let's assume you have a table that holds patient encounters with doctors. There's a lot of data you have about the patient, the doctor and whatever happens during the encounter. E.g. you have the patient name, age, gender, etc. The doctor's age, name, gender, specialty, license number, job title, etc. You could store all this data in one table, but it's not very efficient and it may end up causing issues later. Imagine what that table looks like, every time person A sees a doctor, you're writing to the database all the data about Person A, their name, their age, their gender etc. so if person A has 100 encounters, you're storing their gender 100 times. Same with the doctor. Every time the doctor sees a patient, if you store all the data about the doctor, you're storing their name every time. In addition to being very inefficient from a space perspective, it's harder to modify data later. Let's assume the doctor changes their name. Now you have to go back and update the doctor's name at every instance it was recorded in the database. Instead if you normalize the data, you have one record in a patient table to represent a patient, and one record in a doctor table to represent the doctor. Then you just give each record an ID and ""point"" to those records when you want to reference them from somewhere else in the database.

For 2NF, consider what would happen if you don't 'select distinct' (and how performance is worse if you do). For 3NF, consider how it would be difficult to understand the relationship between the PK and the transitive dependency. If you looked at the data of a table with a transitive dependency (TD), you wouldn't necessarily be able to understand how the TD column relates to the rest of the columns.

If you kept that information in one table you'd have to update every single order that customer entered. Now imagine you stored user data in other tables. You'd have to change multiple rows of multiple tables. What if another dev made a take that stored user data like that that you didn't know about?

nf32dfm,"Edit - I can’t believe I missed this. in the near future we are going to see an enormous change with AI writing code. It’s possible that the offshore resources will be entirely replaced with AI coding. It’s also possible that companies will demand generalized data professionals (kimball, analytical engineering, master data management, etc) and then those generalized people will just instruct AI to build solutions in the technology of the year. If this starts to become the trend, then you’ll no longer need to keep up with mastering what language or platform is the yearly favorite and focus more on implementing value - how to ensure AI assisted code generation is working successfully at your company. This would be a very interesting and disruptive time to be a data professional! (If it happens)——————————-One of the things I’m keeping my eye on is whether companies start switching develops each time management attends a conference and decides to change their stack. To be clear - I’m not seeing it now - but here’s the scenario I’m looking out for. 1) outsource DE to India. 2) hire X dev’s with current stack3) management changes mind on stack4) replace current India team with new India team who know new stack5) repeat yearly, each time manager attends conferenceThis catches my attention because of 1) the current trend of tools changing quickly, 2) the enormous availability of cheap labor offshore. Keep in mind, if managers want to do this, they will have no issue finding offshore bodies to fill roles.So - as an onshore senior/lead Im happy I’m deep into a business domain (subject matter expert) and would be needed for more then my coding skills. If you are worried about this scenario you might start by asking how you can fit into this paradigm. If a company won’t hire you because you are not a 10 year expert on an acronym that was invented 2 months ago - then can you fit into a leadership/guidance position to enable “hot swappable” developers? I point back to the other comment in this thread - do you know Kimball? Do you know business processes, business data, and how to mature raw data into actionable insights which can reduce cost and increase revenue? If the answer is yes, you will likely be ok.

You can definitely learn to code in those but reviewing, refactoring, and optimizing takes a lot of on the job experience to do well.

That way you can keep things Pythonic while still scaling to millions of files.* For cloud vs local: prototype on your laptop with Dask, then move the same workflow to the cloud when you hit limits. Tools like coiled make that spin-up pretty painless if you don’t want to manage the infra yourself. Worth noting coiled has other non-Dask APIs that might work well for scaling out arbitrary Python code (like their batch jobs api)So I’d say: if your pipeline is mostly parsing Python → Parquet, Dask can be lighter-weight than Spark.

nfyipp7,"I've been designing DW solutions for 30 years. Up until recently, surrogate keys were always defined as int or bigint and to generate them you used a sequential number generator or similar. This meant a couple things. You almost always had to process your dimension before facts (because the dimension table contained the mapping of the business keys to the dw surrogate key assigned). When processing fact tables, for every fk, you would need to lookup the associated surrogate key in the corresponding dimension table. In the old days when we were all using OLTP based database systems like Oracle and SQL Server (on-prem because that is all we had), using integer based surrogates added in performance at query time). Later Dan L came up with Data Vault methodolgy. That is a very different way of modelling with one of the often listed benefits of being able to process in parallel entities that would be come dimensions from those that were facts. To do this, he used hashing (of some sort) so that you didn't necessarily have to process data in a certain order (apologies if I have some of this wrong....I only worked on 1 DV project 14 years ago). The other thing which occurred was columnar database solutions, the cloud and elastic and ultra scalable dbms solutions like Snowflake (and before that Terradata and Netezza). These systems reduce/eliminate the need to worry about defining surrogate keys as integers and using a hash methodology works fine so hence, you now see many practitioners use a fixed length deterministic hash column as the surrogate.BTW: one of the lesser known reasons for using a surrogate (based on a sequential number generator) was that you build in some isolation from the source system. While not common, systems of record have been known to change the key of a source record (probably seldom happens now) so using a surrogate key meant that it was possible to only need to change the relationship of the dimensional business key to the existing surrogate (no need to update the FK in all related fact tables where it occurred. By using a hash, that won't work anymore since the source key fields which might change, will result in a different hash. But since these new systems are so much faster, probably not a big deal (I don't recall ever running into that situation but I recall Ralph Kimball mentioning this in one of his books...I think)apologies for rambling on.",GreyHairedDWGuy,2025-09-24 15:01:52,5,dataengineering,t3_1np45xe,False,

There are a few advantages:* Independent processing: You can generate foreign key without needing to do a lookup. So you could create fact records without needing to join to already loaded dimensions, or satellite and link records without joining to hubs. This allows parallel processing that isn't dependent on load order (warning: it can also lead to including a foreign key that doesn't actually exist)* Prevent having to do multi-column joins. For example when you have to do a diff or merge for incremental load, you can join on the hash key. * Records from the same source data will have the same key in all environments.

nfyonvl,"Op here. Summarizing based on what I read here and other sources. Please add or correct. Advantages of using hash function to generate a surrogate key over creating surrogate key from sequence 1. During table load into distributed system, generating sequence could become a bottleneck where as if we use hash function based on business keys, they could be loaded independently parallel much faster. 2. Anonymization: Hashing protects sensitive data by creating a oneway, non reversible key. By using hash keys, you ensure that the vast majority of your data warehouse users—who are simply analyzing metrics—can't even see the sensitive data because it's not present in the tables they access. Usually dimensional tables hold sensitive info like ssn, credit card etc. 3. Efficiency while doing data lookups and data integration. Use of hash keyed surrogates avoid the need for what they call pre-join. Using a sequential key requires a lookup against the dimension table to find the correct key for a given business key. But if we are using hashed surrogates, we can derive this directly from the business keys and avoid pre-join. I think what they mean is an application querying with business keys does not need to go to the dimension tables first to find the sequence number foreign key and then use that to fetch fact table details. Instead, the application querying can directly generate a hash from the business keys that the user entered and query the fact table directly. 4. If data is sourced from different source systems, the hashed key approach ensures the same key will be generated for say the same customer whereas if we use sequence, that will end up creating multiple records for the same customer causing data integrity issues.",tinkerjreddit,2025-09-24 15:30:39,1,dataengineering,t3_1np45xe,True,

I see plenty of code based ETL orchastration (Dagster, Airflow etc) but less GUI options unless I'm missing something key. The issue I have there is that for bigger places, code based works fine, they can have dedicated DE teams but smaller businesses and onw man band operations definitely get a benefit from simpler to use GUI based tools. I know at one point this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for.One thing I'd suggest is trying to avoid a fixed requirement on docker containers or having a sprawl of dozens of individual components needing to run in tandem again for the smaller places/one man bands. They might not have capabilities to run Docker (IT blocking etc) and if the alternative is 15+ individual components all needing to be run at once then it'll be overwhelming.Your package avoids this currently so definitely worth sticking to that in my view. Outside of that some way to choose the destination DB engine would be good, Postgres is great and all but again smaller teams/OMBs might not get a choice and might be required to use MSSQL server or Oracle, or even just have a section within a larger warehouse like Teradata/Snowflake/Databricks that they get to use for operations.

I have asked my dba about version control and git. He said that he never needed it before and that if I want something on git then that’s my job. In all fairness the few times I have used ssis at work, I have it a shot initially when he asked me to, I put the packages in my own GitHub repo. Not it’s good that I have a version but I brought up that that’s just my copy from dev. I can’t see what’s on production. I’m not saying that I want or need production level access but I’d a real pipeline where there is some tangible proof that my dev package went to production aside from him saying he copied it to production. It would also be great for him in case something goes wrong with a new update then he can roll a package back to the previous working version.Overall I get your point and it’s valid and I know I get sucked up in the python vs ssis argument because that’s what started everything and I’ve felt that my dba outright didn’t listen to some of my concerns because I wasn’t doing things his way.

This is true and I only have one counter to it right now and that he doesn’t use the emails for the the packages he has built in the past that my team relies on so often I am stuck trouble with stakeholders emailing me because he doesn’t let me know that something went wrong on his end. This brings my next point.Better data practices. You could say that I could do this with SSIS and I could if I had the opportunity to but it’s not my environment and the dba will not let me try anything different in his environment. I want to standardize things like ci/cd and proper data pipeline monitoring as well as documentation. From my point of view it seems easier to do so with a tool that aligns better with my skill set and the skill set of my team if I cannot change anything in SSIS environment. I mentioned in another comment that the dba didn’t go for implementing ci/cd in his environment.Shorter product delivery times. This isn’t really because of ssis vs python. I could make an arguement like that but I know that that is subjective. This is more about man power and ease of deployment. There are more coders in my agency than gui developers and the business units are required to build their own data pipelines (dba words because he said that he doesn’t have enough staff who know ssis to support the business units. He only got two new people in the last few months and they aren’t trained.) from my point of view leaning into a coding based orchestration tool or a coding solution in general will alllow the business units to really build their own data pipelines efficiently and then IT and the dba can just manage production which is what he seems to want anyway. I guess I’m saying this will play to changing skillset of employees and allow the organization to develop faster as a whole instead of business units feeling frustrated by a slow IT.Technical debt. This one is tricky because I can see both the IT setup as technical debt and mine. My team is technically acting like a shadow IT in some ways and that always resulting in technical debt. However the dba is on an outdated SSIS. By that I mean he still uses msdb and hasn’t upgraded to ssisdb which would at least allow for basic version control. Additionally as I said, he doesn’t really have anyone who knows ssis well on his team and therefore if he leaves one day my organization is in a pickle. He can say similar for what I want to do but I am documenting everything I’m doing so there is at least that. Also I am training and have already trained people on my entire environment in case I leave. I do know that this point is probably the most debate point that I am making however. Overall I’m saying that if we move to a more modern setup that fits better with the skillset of those in and outside of the agency (outside matters since they are required to build their own data pipeline) then I think we can eventually get off ssis completely and overall have a more manageable system that more people are familiar with.I typed this up very quickly so it may not be the most clear response.",lilde1297,2025-09-20 23:02:56,1,dataengineering,t1_nezlx34,True,

nf0wss9,"Thank you! Pandas is a very sophisticated system. From what I understand, it primarily relies on NumPy and the Python runtime for memory allocation and deallocation. Under the hood, NumPy typically uses C-level memory management (`malloc`/`free` or aligned variants) from the system runtime, though it also supports custom allocators.In contrast, I expect stampdb to have lower overhead since it uses a straightforward C++ `std::vector` for memory management. By default, `std::vector` relies on the C++ allocator API, which eventually ends up at `malloc`/`free` as well. Our current plan is to provide only the thinnest wrapper around the C++ core.

nf0ibqw,"So, are you doing this locally or on PowerBI service on the cloud?Personally, we started there, and then started working on a data warehouse so we had the data centralised, updated regularly and with a single place to find it, every report gets the same result. But, it's a massive investment, and 3 years in we're still working on adding components that our manager estimated we'd have done in the first 6 months.If you don't need that, its good, but get documentation of your code, your sql tables, try and centralise into a single semantic model if you can (short of data warehousing). But the one thing that we keep running into with people creating their own dashboards is that they change the queries, they're no longer performant, take forever, use more resources, and they're reloading and recalculating the same details x 10 different queries in a power bi dashboard x 10 dashboards.So, consolidation - if you can at least run the data out to a table, and then have any dashboards read from that table, then you'll be saving yourself.Try to source control your dashboards.If you're using PBI online, if you can use things like datasets, that centralise the data, go for it.Stored Procedures may give you more centralised control, semantic models are more or less exactly what you're creating in PowerBI anyway (source -> dim/fact tables + relationships + measures).Creating a centralised semantic model/warehouse that has all of your tables and data in one place, that you write your code and measures and everything once will definitely allow you to reuse it multiple times and is a big win.",-crucible-,2025-09-19 04:05:29,4,dataengineering,t3_1nksner,False,
nf3lue4,"I don’t have a lot of experience with Power BI specifically , but I have some more general technology-agnostic recommendations.

Kimball’s Data Warehouse design approach is a highly-recommended resource in that space.I also like thinking about creating stored procedures, views, and similar objects for these use cases - really any sql you’ll be reusing should be functionalized/modularized in some way, either by developing views, stored procedures, or pipelines that materialize the data you’re retrieving based on what makes sense for your data environment. I’m coming from a DBA/SSIS/sql-heavy background though, and those approaching from a more software engineering background will likely recommend different approaches based on their favorite tech stack and their CI/CD and version control preferences.I’m not a big fan of text-to-sql or promptql-style approaches mainly because I feel like that’s something that should be more for data exploration and presented to the end user rather than a way to streamline your reporting pipeline - all my opinion though, I just don’t like that added layer of abstraction from data when I’m thinking about robust data processes.",dgwyr,2025-09-19 16:51:52,1,dataengineering,t3_1nksner,False,

nfye951,+1 on this from experience. Current company started with the direct pipelines but had to hire someone (me) to fix it all. I started evangelizing Snowflake as the “single source of truth” which helped with adoption. Now we have a dedicated snowflake schema for each external integration so permissions are handled at the schema level rather than table level and all I have to do is create secure views when they request more. Another benefit that I have seen is that when you share via snowflake you tend to have more data that can augment the raw platform data. Imagine something like hubspot customer data being joined with product sales numbers. You suddenly have much more valuable context which leads to better insight signals.,MoodyOwl,2025-09-24 14:40:02,2,dataengineering,t1_nfxug4k,False,

Write each user into SEPARATE ordered extents into S3.Step 3: Run a single historical spark job to rewrite the data into historical logs for each user in the order the tables were designed in. Select where id > 0 && id < step1.table_id_seq.

Obviously the quality of the instructor and code they write can lead you to good practices or bad practices so that’s important to keep in mind. If I jumped right into an idea I would’ve absolutely gotten overwhelmed, lost, confused, and put together a shitty project. It’s important to note that you’re early projects aren’t going to be great but you can save yourself a lot of time by knowing what a project structure should actually look like. I’ve been working for a few years now but I owe a lot of my knowledge to educators that took the time to explain concepts clearly. Building a few code along projects taught me a lot about how things are wired together and that was the most effective method of learning for me personally.

nfxkew2,"I want to add that making the 'badass' item you wanna do is easier said than done for a lot of people. It is a daunting task, as in the act of taking the first step is monumental for a lot of folks (and why creating something you deem a 'stupid website hosted on aws with shitty architecture' is FAR more impressive than doing a calculator app (literally anyone can do it and there is not real value/insight to glean from it). It is like trying to do calculus when you can barely add two numbers. If someone wants to make a game without the foundation then they will most likely flounder about cause they are trying to start on step 10 where instead they need to start at step 1 (what language do you know, downloading an IDE etc...)But with the prevalence of AI, the barrier has been reduced down considerably. I condone the idea of 'vibe' coding ie copy/pasting what you see and not digesting (reading what the AI spit out doesnt count). But I do recommend asking thoughtful questions that are small queries to AI (how to do print statement, why is ('hello' + d) not working etc...). And when you get the response back, think about why it is telling you the error is happening. So if ('I said hello' + 10 + 'times') threw an error then the AI might respond you cant add a str to an int. Now think about why that is ie you are adding two incompatible data types (string, int) which should lead you to asking what kind of data types are there and why data formatting is important etc...Work on the proof of concepts, small building blocks first. Even if it is stupid like learning how to add two numbers literally on some scratchpad of your coding IDE that will help you on your journey.

Here’s what you need to do, even if you don’t like it.Leetcode is a terrible assessment of ability, but I do believe you could get up to speed in about a month of regular study, at least enough for interviews. Go to neetcode, learn the algorithms first for the section you are about to try, then go do them. 30 mins is your max timer, if you get there, look up the answer, and move on. At the end of your session go back and do the ones you missed. It took me about 2 weeks to get up to speed. Pick a language, and “master it”. What I mean by this is find a language you actually enjoy, who cares if it’s the most practical. Learn the basics, tips and tricks, become familiar with the standard library, build a pair with it, connect to a database with it, etc etc. roadmaps.sh is a good resource for what order to learn things. Being very capable in one language does help as you are aware of what is possible, then you can go translate it into another language. You like frontend? Pick 3 popular websites, and remake them. For each use a different frontend stack if you don’t know what you like. I’ll choose them for you, tailwindcss with svelte, bulma with React, and plain CSS with vanilla JS. Don’t stop until you have a working homepage and links. Add to GitHub and repeat. Obviously go expand on this as you go but these are starting points. Along the way take the time to explore and learn. Since it seems you’re still in school, get a tutor, join clubs, make friends to program with, go to hackathons, go to game jams, job fairs, etc etc. If you really want to do this, write down a plan that would make it seem silly if you didn’t make it and then go execute.

So here would be the steps:- Tell the AI of your choice to write some small application. You want it small to ensure you can fight it all by yourself, but make sure the AI doesn’t actually just knock it out of the park in one shot; if so, try again until you get something sufficiently buggy.- Debug the code. You might think that this needs to be fancy, but I cannot stress enough how basic this is. It can literally be just notes to yourself with a date explaining your thoughts. I wager it could say things like: “So, the AI said it wrote X using Y method. Whaaaaaat is happening - I better check the documentation for Y. That is *not* how it looks, the documentation from Y imports completely different methods….” Etc- Document the whole process, by which I mean the prompt used, the AIs response, the code it gave, and your debugging notes.",Bahatur,2025-09-20 18:06:50,3,learnprogramming,t3_1nm196f,False,

neve673,"I will go in the exact opposite direction if some comments here: This is a tough question to answer, because it doesn't really matter. I mean, languages are cool and all, but learning a new programming language really is not that hard, once you already know how to program. You can learn any language similar to the ones you already know in a week. The more important question is: What kind of project structure, architecture and patterns do you learn. If you are going for ""applications and tools"", that can also mean many things. GUI or no, Desktop or mobile, which target audience does it have, what should it do? If you want to be the most versatile, able to learn ""anything(TM)"" that might come up in a few weeks time, I would suggest having experience in at least one project / language out of all of the following categories (and each project must have a minimum complexity to ""count""): \- 1 web based frontend. Can be pure html/css/minimal JS, or be fully based on a JS framework. maybe a homepage for a simple business, without a shop, like a bakery or a hair salon. \- 1 non-web based frontend. A C# GUI in windows, a Java App on Android, a Swift UI on iOS or a QT-App in any language you want, it doesn't matter much. Probably a complexity between a calculator and a calendar would be good. Games work, but are normally structured differently, do I would advise against using a game engine unless you want to stick with gaming. \- 1 complex application, written in a low level language, optimized for speed. A raytracer is the classical option, because it has good visual feedback, but a compiler, OS parts or a real time embedded component can all work. Suitable languages are C, C++ and rust. A compiler has the additional benefit of teaching you more about programming languages in general.\- 1-2 APIs. It is great if you have both written a REST (or similar) API, accessible through the web (in theory, you don't need to deploy) as well as a library, that exposes a C-standard API for use from other programs. They are pretty similar in conception, but quite a bit different in practice, and understanding how both of these actually work, can be hugely helpful, even if you are only using them, and never have to build them again! You should 100% have experience in one Object Oriented language. The best options are Java and C#. OOP (or some half hearted attempt at OOP) is still the standard in most industries. Additionally, you should be comfortable in a language, suitable for scripting. Python and JavaScript, but also Bash are all options with different advantages. You need to know at least one. I think everyone can learn something from trying something completely different, so you should have done one project in a completely functional language. Haskell is my favourite, but F# and Clojure are also options. You will have to re-learn to think about programming, which is exactly the point of the exercise, not to use this exact language again in production.

So 1) If you want workplace experience after graduation, definitely don't give up on internships (plural, even if you finish one, don't assume its gotta be one and done); post-grad internships are out there and experience is experience and employers love demanding 2-3y of experience from new grads and junior devs for some crazy reason. 2) Build your connections, reach out to your connections, never stop making them even after you land a job; they don't stress that enough in school, hell it probably should be it's own course its that important.",elanestra,2025-09-19 04:54:46,2,learnprogramming,t3_1nk1wan,False,

nfkx4oe,"What the other commenter said. ""Efficiency"" like you describe is what managers see to juggle scrum points and velocity. It's a useless metric for actually working on code.Imagine programming as a gigantic space of possibilities. You're searching for positions (programs) in that space that fulfil certain functional (the thing the program should do) and usually some non-functional requirements (memory/time constraints, being readable and maintainable). There's not one solution but many, but they are far out (as far as lines you need to write to get there). Each line you write gets you closer to some solutions and farther from others.Unless you have decades of experience and the program is quite small, it's usually not possible to just ""see"" a good solution and write it down in one go. You need to iterate on it, write parts of it you know will likely be part of a good solution. And even identifying those is lots of experience. Often you'll have to rewrite parts to make it work.The first running prototype is usually garbage because it shows the meandering path you took to get there. Restructuring and cleaning up your solution is still expected when you work on large programs, so that the overall commit history doesn't look like a rabbit on acid typed it. This is something that is discussed in professional settings as well. If coders think refactorings are necessary, who will pay for them? Some teams just silently do them as part of other tasks, others try to communicate the need to higher ups.> I've tried the Algorithmic thinking tip from the FAQ to help me plan the processes, but I don't notice classes and objects immediatelyThat part of the FAQ is not for planning programs.

Later, when I go ahead and actually map my first classes, I will open ""Mapping Python Classes"" and ""Relationship Configuration"", and then, when I go to test it, I would probably read more configuration stuff, so that I can be sure I didn't miss any important config options. 5. I will skim the relevant Dialect Documentation, PostgresQL in my case.

nfdwzo3,"There's a concept called the Entity Component System model, or ECS which solves this issue in a way that also makes writing high performance code much easier. The idea is that instead of having discrete classes for different kinds of creatures, items, or other game entities with all sorts of complex logic attached to them, you create simple data structure called an entity. An entity is usually nothing more than some kind of ID value, like an integer, UUID, or even a string. You then ""attach"" additional small components to that entity which give it additional properties. It's these components that hold the data that would have been held in the class. So the `hasHealth` component would hold maybe 2 numbers, max health and current health. All of the logic for the various components is handled by a set of ""system"" classes. Their job is to handle the logic associated with the various components. For example, the health system would handle adding or removing health on entities with a health component.Typically the way ECS are written let you query the world for entities with specific components (or the components of an entity and such), or sometimes more complex conditions like ""has components x y and z, but not a"". This query then will find the components that match and produce a list of entries which can then be processed by the system.This is probably complete overkill for what you're doing, but it's becoming a very popular way to write games. It gets rid of the awkward problems that come from a more object oriented approach, and completely strips all dependencies between components and entities. This allows you to build up unique entities simply by combining different discrete components. Of course, for unique interactions you would occasionally still need to make 1-off components, but a *lot* can be done with only a small collection of basic components when you can freely mix and match everything, and implementing new kind of entities is often just a matter of figuring out what components they need.This roguelike tutorial in Rust does a great job of explaining/teaching how you might use an ECS in a roguelike game: https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/chapter_2.htmlRoguebasin has a very basic Python implementation of an ECS: https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Entity_Component_SystemThere's a ton more information on ECS out there, this was just meant to give you a very very rough idea of the overall concept. There are quite a few ECS libraries out there in a whole ton of languages, but it's not that difficult to write your own either (at least as long as your not trying to squeeze every bit of performance out of it).Here are a couple blog posts that explain ECS and implement one:C++ - https://www.codingwiththomas.com/blog/an-entity-component-system-from-scratchC++ - https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/C# - https://matthall.codes/blog/ecs/Here's an ECS FAQ: https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq?tab=readme-ov-file",Bobbias,2025-09-21 08:23:15,26,learnprogramming,t3_1nml899,False,

Now, in terms of efficiency, there is virtually no difference because the compiler will just inline it for both.

The reason is because when it is 1.1, the C standard automatically casts it as float by detecting it as a decimal number. But it doesn't know how to handle 1.1d0 in this context.

Programming books also occasionally contain such problems in the exercises sections but are normally paired with whatever you were supposed to learn in that chapter.For this problem I would try to figure out the ""general rule"" (someone already said that it is the distance from the center). Usually this will result in the easiest-to-test and most-likely-to-be-correct solution.If you can't figure out the general rule, take a piece of the problem which is solvable and then work backwards from there. For example, for n = 3, the middle line is this: 32123First write a loop that outputs just this line, for any n. That's part of the problem. Then work backwards to make it work similarly for the other lines (so that the line before middle is 32223, and so on). Doing it this way is fine too, but there are more opportunities to mess things up or to get edge cases wrong.For the given problem this is not really a problem, though, since ""exhaustive testing"" is pretty straightforward. You can run your entire solution on all values of n = 1 through n = 9 inclusive and make sure that the output is according to the specification.

Can you entirely avoid branching aside from the necessary loops by writing a value every time? How can you generalize your condition to give you a number to write instead of a boolean? This will prevent a large void in the middle.Something that might make it more efficient: how can you restructure the loops such that the number to be written at each position can be directly inferred from only the iterator values at that position, so aside from the code configuring the loops, nothing else needs to be aware of how large the square is? If you try to make n only exist in the loop headers, I think you will find a more elegant solution without a big mess of addition and subtraction of i, j, n, and 1 going on inside every iteration.

We can convert ranges by subtracting n from all members. From there, it's just whichever coordinate that's farther from the center what takes precedence. From that, we can derive a function like this: printBullseye(int n){ for(int i = 0; i < 2*n-1; i++){ for(int j = 0; j < 2*n-1; j++){ int iDif = abs(n-1-i); int jDif = abs(n-1-j); int distance = iDif > jDif ? iDif : jDif; printf(""%d"", distance+1); } printf(""\n""); } }EDIT: I realized while driving to work that I should've converted the range by changing the for-loop start positions instead of cluttering the function with more math.

IMHO good for training problem solving and debugging skills, as well as some logic (AND, OR, etc.).TIS-100 - Somewhat like Shenzen, but more simplistic. Has you program the fictional TIS-100 chip for various purposes. Uses an Assembly-like language.While true: Learn(); - Primarily visual programming, teaches AI and neural networking concepts.Grey Hack - Very nice hacking game where you can build your own exploits and helper programs. Uses its own scripting language, but does teach you problem solving and how to help yourself with code.Then there's the real kicker - try to program simple games in C# yourself while learning. One of my firsts was a simple hangman/wheel of fortune game that I made as a console app. Trying to render simple console stuff and text graphics is a good way to start out learning the fundamentals of graphics programming.Another good start could be making a simple 2D engine for a shoot-em-up, which can teach you how to manipulate graphics, make sprites and move stuff around. My first one back in the day ran inside a C# form using GDI - it was a b\*tch to program, but included a very simple AI, parallax scrolling and some other neat stuff.Back in CS class, I had a semester project (actually two), that consisted of a tile engine running a sort of educational RPG. It was written in C# and ran on the now-dead XNA framework...It's probably the harder way to go about things, but it's something you can do as side projects while learning the basics of C# before moving on to Unity.",Potential_Copy27,2025-09-24 07:03:35,5,learnprogramming,t3_1nol44l,False,

Learning a language is easy but learning how to program is hard the same way learning to use a saw is easy but being a great wood worker takes time. The language is your tool. Being a competent programmer is to change how you think. Which is something anyone can learn. You just have to be patient and be open minded and it will eventually start clicking. Break every problem down to tiny micro steps and tackle each one. Want to move a character? Well how do i read what button to input? How do I set the velocity of the character? How do I animate it? Three little problems from one problem that sounded small in the first place. Don't let perfection be the enemy of progress as a professional programmer i still look at my code and think I can do better. Body builders are never entirely happy with their figure and still want more muscle growth. The same thing happens in our brain with code. Even very successful games have had a history of terrible code. Pokémon sun and moon is a very famous example of poor project organization and I'm pretty sure eve online had to rewrite their engine before because of how much spaghetti was in it. It happens and you will learn with experience. Just keep making your games and more will clickAlso, I do want to address the anxiety here. If you go in to every hobby and skill wondering if it's for you and get analysis paralysis then you will never truly enjoy anything new and give it a chance.

All non-trivial programs that we are making nowadays are essentially algorithms to solve problems for which we (almost never) have a truly complete specification. The ""Algorithms"" in algorithms books are simply smaller problems which have been studied thoroughly, for which complete specifications exist.For example, we know 100% what we mean to say whether a sequence is sorted or not, so it's easy to specify that a sorting algorithm takes a sequence for which that property may or may not be true and produces a sequence for which that property is true. Though even in that problem there are sometimes overlooked edge cases. For example, occasionally the difference between stable sort and unstable sort crops up naturally. If you have never studied algorithms, how likely is it that you would even understand the difference between a stable sort and a non-stable sort.

If you tell me you have spent the last 3 years sitting on your ass and playing video games, maybe any kind of switch is going to take time, if however you told me you have been busy with other hobbies and interests, I would honestly and seriously tell you to choose one of those to turn into a profession if you can. Software development isn't going anywhere, but the gold rush is \*over\*. There were times when you could phone it in, and collect your $250'000 salary but you missed them. If you enjoy it, it's great work and you wont get your hands very dirty. If you can't be bothered and just want to get through your day, you'll be miserable and a nuisance to everybody around you \*even if you can find a job\*. Be careful with this.

nfzr24t,"Massively simplified analogy: You need to find the email of Professor Dan to beg him to let you into his full class next semester. There are a number of ways you can go about getting that:1. Ask your current CS teacher what Dan's email is. He says ""I don't know, Professor Smith might know though."" So you go ask Professor Smith what his email is and she says ""I don't know, but Professor Stevens might know."" You go ask Professor Stevens and she says ""I don't know, try Professor Jones."" You keep going down the chain, each person telling you to go talk to someone else, until you reach someone who knows what the email is, and who knows how many people you're going to have to talk to and you just don't want to do that.2. So you realize that oh wait, you can just look him up in the staff directory and find the email that belongs to him. You know he's a CS professor so you can just start with the CS directory instead of scanning down from Dr. Aarons in Academic Advising, and you already know the guy's name is Professor Dan so you can just jump to D.That's basically the difference between finding something in a linked list vs. hash table In reality it's a bit more complicated:3. Suppose you go to the staff directory and it's not in alphabetical or department order -- it seems totally random. Also, it's split into 20,000 pages. So you have no idea where Dan is and you're thinking you've got to just work your way down, and you really don't want to do that. But then you see that the directory is maintained by the department weirdo Dr. Bryant. You go ask Dr. Bryant, who tells you almost immediately ""Dan? He's on page 56."" You ask, astonished: ""You just memorized that???"" Dr. Bryant: ""Nah, I just multiplied the letters of DAN, so 4 \* 1 \* 14 is 56.""4. You go to page 56, and sure enough there's Dan's bio and email. Problem solved! But then the next day you have a realization and go back to Dr. Bryant: ""Wait a minute, what if you hire another guy named Dan? Only one of them can be on page 56, your system won't work anymore."" Bryant goes ""Uh..... wait, I know, his employee ID is 4LBA8F, and his ID is unique so I can just use that instead!""5. Satisfied, you leave his office, then 2 minutes later turn around and go back in. ""But that's not gonna work either, what if you have employee 222 and 22B? Or 2BB? What about 6666, 666F, 66FF?"" Dr. Bryant says he needs to think about that.This is also massively simplified and obviously the actual calculations are more complicated, but that's the general idea: since your data is probably not going to be perfectly ordered, you need to come up with a function to map each item to a numerical value, and that value will be the index to the ""bucket"" of memory that data will go into. You don't want that function to come up with different values because that makes things complicated, but unless you have an infinite amount of space, it's impossible to prevent that completely. All you can do is try to limit how often it happens; there's mathematical theory for the best ways to limit that and various implementations for how to handle whatever collisions do happen.""OK, why not make it ordered then?"" You could do that, but then you'll have to continually fix the order every time you insert new data, instead of just crunching a number for where to insert it.

Tye point is that a linked list gets slower the more items you have. So, for that matter, does a binary tree. A hash table takes the same amount of time no matter how many items you have. So if you need to process or look up a few million items, hash tables are hard to beat. Plus, who cares about performance when you’ve only got a few hundred item?

Very sophisticated CPU caches do have the ability to notice that you're chasing pointers (they correlate values previously loaded with the addresses fetched) but that's most helpful if you repeatedly access shallow data structures.There just isn't much that can be done to hide memory latency when the data structure is really deep.If a linked list is the best choice it's probably because you need a LIFO or FIFO queue and search is rare.Other points in favor of linked lists* concurrent LLs (multiple threads will access at the same time) are easier than concurrent hash tables and compete with concurrent ring buffers* The objects you intend to link are members of some other data structure and the LL acts as an alternate way to access them.

nfovzv1,"Repositories are self-contained dependency trees of commits. Every repository has an index or staging area which is where you add the changes that you intend to commit eventually. The staging area acts as a temporary safe space that is not a full commit and to which you can restore your tracked files if for some reason you aren't happy with the latest changes, and the changes saved to the staging area can also be restored. When you make a commit, only the changes tracked in the staging area are used.Commits in a repository are uniquely identified by hashes, which look like long strings of random characters that are in fact generated from all the information that they save. Commits contain the hashes of their immediate ancestors, the differences in the code between them and their immediate ancestors, the names and E-mail addresses of their authors, a timestamp, a message explaining what they change and why so that other people in the future can gain a deeper understanding of why specific changes were made, and optionally a digital signature to reinforce their authenticity. Commits represent snapshots of branch states at specific times.Since commit hashes aren't easy to remember, git provides the ability to tag them with more remarkable names. Tags are often used to record milestones, like the official version of a project at that point, but they can be used for anything you want, and can always have descriptions independent of their respective commit messages.Branches represent distinct and possibly concurrent development paths, and every git repository has at least one conventionally named main these days or master in the past, however branches can have arbitrary names. Branches are simply alternative HEAD pointers, you can create a branch from any commit in the repository, which will result in its HEAD pointing at that commit, and after that every commit you make to that branch will have the original commit of the branch as an ancestor in its history. Branches are typically used to avoid cluttering the main history of the project with irrelevant versioning information related to refactoring, bug fixing, feature development, or even to continue developing old versions of the same project concurrently to the main branch.Remotes provide the ability to name external repositories, and are intended to synchronize with the work done by other developers. Each branch can also track a single branch on a remote repository, which is typically used to synchronize with an upstream source of truth, and doesn't really need to have the same name as the local branch. Pushing to a remote branch attempts to append your changes in a local branch to the remote branch, whereas pulling attempts to append the remote changes of the remote branch to your local branch. If this succeeds then the resulting trivial merge is called a fast forward, otherwise you will be required to resolve the conflicts before the local and remote repositories can be synchronized. The HEAD of a tracked remote branch is pointed at by REMOTE_HEADMerging is a process in which two divergent branches, both local or one local and one remote, are synchronized by a commit that addresses all the conflicts. Since only local branches can be written to, the merge commit is always created locally. After a merge all the concurrent commits are added to the history of the local branch, which can make the commit history rather confusing to understand. A different option to merging is rebasing, where all the divergent changes in one of the branches are added on top of the other branch, but this too can mess up the commit history, because if both branches have been getting concurrent commits, the timestamps in the resulting history where all the commits to one branch are logically applied after all the commits to the other branch will result in a history of commits that are not progressive over time, so git also provides the ability to squash commits, which can be used to coalesce a range of commits.Reverting is the process in which the changes made by one or more commits are applied in reverse to a branch, effectively resulting in those changes being removed from the code. Reverting commits does not alter the commit history of a branch, instead a new revert commit is created specifically to remove the changes, at which point the author of the reverse is given a chance to address any conflicts that might prevent the operation. Switching is a process in which git is instructed to go back to any commit in the repository. If the switch is made to a branch then the local files will be updated to the HEAD commit of the branch, otherwise the switch is considered headless and no commits can be made until a branch is created to track them. Resetting moves the HEAD of a branch to any commit on the repository, which can result in some commits becoming unreachable and eventually garbage collected.Stashing is the concept of committing your changes to a local commit tracker and restoring everything to how it was in the previous commit. Stashes are global and as such are completely independent of branches.Other concepts like pull requests, forks, and releases are specific to GitHub. Pull requests are just regular posts to a repository linking to a branch on your own repository whose changes you would like to get merged with the remote repository. Forks are just other developers cloning your repository under a new repository on their own account. Releases are essentially tags on steroids that you can use to provide ready-to-use builds of your project.Git is also quite versatile when it comes to rewriting history, however this is a fairly advanced subject that I'm not going to touch on here since it requires a good understanding of its fundamental concepts. Rewriting history can sometimes make commits unreachable from any branch, and These commits are kept around for a while but eventually git's garbage collector gets rid of them, however this grace period makes it possible to recover them, so even if you completely mess up a repository it's almost always possible to manually recover everything back during this period.Hopefully this comment covers all the basics with enough detail but without being overwhelming.",Fridux,2025-09-23 00:31:03,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nnyadm,False,

They're mostly concerned with syntax, not how to use the language or solve problems. I think you know enough to be dangerous, and it's time for you to move on.You are not expected to code in a vacuum. This idea of a lone wolf single-handedly engineering the future is MOSTLY a myth, and the few who were brilliant enough to do it come far in between. That ain't you or I. The industry has a collective domain knowledge that is in between US, all of us. You have to actually talk to people, work with people, to get access, because it is this specific experience that allows for the development and transfer of knowledge. If you keep to yourself, you are going to have to grind at your own insights, and from personal experience, that will take YEARS. Don't get me wrong, you'll be doing that your whole career anyway, and that's a good thing, but to do ONLY that, that's unhealthy and counterproductive.---C++ and Rust are low level. Too low to start building things? I disagree, but I absolutely concede that you have to have a very developed understanding of the language to know how to get off the ground quickly with it. C++ has a diverse ecosystem, and it all exists for a reason. With great power comes great responsibility.C# on Linux is actually very good. Don't conflate Microsoft's business nature and history with Linux with their ability to deliver an excellent development platform. C# .Net Core is platform independent (.Net Framework is the legacy Windows-only language - and YES, Microsoft is ABSOLUTE SHIT at naming things). VS Code is also platform independent. My last employer has arguably the largest options trading platform in the world written in C#, and we knew we were 300x faster than CBOE, for example. It's a robust platform for you.The Java community is currently enamored with Spring Boot and cloud computing, which I also previously supported, among other things, when I was at Pivotal for 5 years. If you want to find Java in the industry, look to that ecosystem. It's otherwise still the Enterprise language of choice if you want a whatever job. Minecraft was originally written in it. But for my professional niche, C# is just Microsoft Java. Either language - JIT compiles to machine code comparable to optimized C, but it's GC and managed objects that just drive me insane - you never know when objects are going to be collected and finalized, it makes the timely and automated release of resources torturous. Java is going absolutely nowhere, because other languages target the Java platform. Python can, Clojure does, for examples...Python is the past, present, and future. You want standalone? PyInstaller. Graalpy. There are others. Who cares if Python is interpreted? Most computation doesn't happen in Python, it happens in the modules, which are written in C, C++, or Fortran. The more and better you can offload to the modules, the more efficient the program gets. There's very little, only very niche reasons, to implement solutions in lower level or more specific languages these days. Everyone knows Python, and it's worth learning. It's not hard to find a job because of Python, it's hard to find a job that doesn't explicitly ask for at least some rudimentary comprehension of it. It's everywhere.

nfzpwhb,"I think you ought to focus on contributing to FOSS - pick some such software you ACTUALLY USE yourself. You will learn a lot about collaborating with people, learn what they know, understand business software, and legacy, and project management.As you said about struggling with writing a roguelike - it's not the fault of the language, but the inexperience designing software and managing projects. You went to writing software before you actually figured out what it was you were to do. The easy part should be writing the code, the hard part is the thinking you have to do beforehand. It doesn't matter what the language you pick is.Speaking of roguelikes - Nethack is written in C. It's a terminal app. Yeah, of course. Well - someone wanted to create a GUI for it, so they made Falcon's Eye. How it works is - they didn't modify Nethack at all. Instead, Falcon's Eye spawns a Nethack child process; Nethack writes to standard output, which is received by Falcon's Eye, which uses that information to draw the screen. Your inputs into Falcon's Eye, including mouse clicks and the like, translate to serialized input on the Nethack child process - standard in.So Nethack is written in terms of the `stdin` and `stdout` file descriptors, and is none the wiser of the GUI that was built on top. This comes back around to the Unix concept of small programs that do their tasks very well. You are meant to composite programs together. If you wanted to in C, C++, or Rust, you could build an HTTP parser (I know you said you're not interested in web, but this is my default example) based on standard input and output, and then use `netcat` to create your listening socket and spawn your program. You could even spawn a whole script that includes an `stunnel` for encryption. You can write a web server without knowing a lick of socket programming. You can write video games and defer the GUI to later. You don't work in a vacuum, and you shouldn't be focused on building monoliths - because even for performance reasons, processes can be better than threads. If a process fails, your parent process can restart it. Network Rx and Tx lines bind to processes, not threads, so if you want actual network IO performance, you have to fork your programs. And IPC can be made astoundingly fast with say page swapping for low latency, and then large pages on top of that for high throughput. And then you can get zero copy by memory mapping the pages.But the point is - start making real programs, you already have everything you need to communicate those programs with hardware, processes, and the rest of the world. You have facilities to make them fast. The OS is a collection of resources, utilities, and services to help you. You can composite lots of little things into to larger and more complex things.",mredding,2025-09-24 18:28:14,1,learnprogramming,t1_nfzpvim,False,

Since you have an Arduino, you could start with a simple programme that uses the Arduino to control an LED.Here are some things you can try in order:- Make the LED switch on after a second (a basic ""Hello World"")- Make the LED flash on and off (teaches loops)- Add a push switch to the circuit and have the switch cycle the LED between on and off states every time you push it. (teaches you events)- Use the push switch to turn a flashing LED on and off (combines events with loops)- Add multiple LEDs and build a binary counter from 0 to `n` (teaches `for` loops specifically)- Pushing the button resets the counter.- Add a second button that changes the behaviour of the LED (e.g. switches between flashing and counting; teaches functions/separation of behaviours).Everything you do with the LED, you can do with a servo, relay, transistor, or anything else that can be connected to a circuit.Once you've worked out how to control output with a button, you can think about using different kinds of input, like using a thermistor to react to a temperature change, or an LDR to react to light levels.",marrsd,2025-09-23 10:44:49,3,learnprogramming,t3_1nob8pb,False,

Problems will sometimes have a full sentence to just say something is equal (the same) to another thing. You can usually simplify it into formulas or terms like: 3 bananas + 3 apples = 6 fruit.

So in this way, you're already heavily reliant on C, C++, and Fortran, and yet you don't have to worry about that.There is effectively no performance to be found in writing a whole application in C++. You have the critical path, the core data structures and computation, and that's going to be fast and efficient - and the rest of the program is going to be non-critical interfaces, glue, and some business logic, where it frankly doesn't matter if it's slow.There's still a need for C++ developers. Some places prefer to be homogenous, because it's just easier to manage software projects if you don't have to consider who knows what language or how well. There is also a need for lower level programming and performance - someone has to write that module in the first place, right? You're not going to write an OS in Python. Don't rely on die-hards who think that all C++ programs are inherently necessary for full end-to-end maximum performance. These people and their philosophies are naive and dangerous. There are also industries that are heavily invested in C++, so while the specific need for the language is no longer necessary, there isn't an incentive to reinvest. Game-dev, for example. But you see cracks in that, too - there are all manner of scripting engines on top of game engines. Lua. Unity has UnityScript - a form of ECMAScript. C# is also increasingly popular in game dev. C# is also growing in popularity for HFT.So do you want to write modules, or do you want to get work done?",mredding,2025-09-24 17:48:29,1,learnprogramming,t3_1nkglzt,False,

I'll try to answer each of your specific questions, as well as point you to reading material for each of those areas.>Based on my understanding, I have to `tsc` client and server since the browser and node can only read js.Let's talk about each of those two separately, starting with your client. You are correct that the browser can only read JS. However, since you're using Vite, one of its built-in features is that it will automatically transpile your TS to JS ([docs](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html#typescript)). Therefore, you don't need `tsc` to do that — and, therefore, you *should* have `""noEmit"": true` in your frontend `tsconfig.json`.Moving on to the server, Node.js recently added native support for executing TypeScript directly ([docs](https://nodejs.org/api/typescript.html)), so you *might* be able to use that. However, if your hosting provider uses an older version of Node.js that doesn't support that, then yes, you are correct that you'll need to use `tsc` to transpile your server code.>I had a hard time outputting a dist folder when I ran `watch:ts` because I had `""noEmit"": true` and `""emitDeclarationOnly"": true` in my tsconfig.json file.If you want to better understand each of the options in your `tsconfig.json`, I recommend [the official reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/). In general, official references for anything are always the most up-to-date, reliable, and comprehensive.>I get `Named export 'SupabaseClient' not found. The requested module '@supabase/supabase-js' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.` But my package.json has `""type"": ""module""`, and tsconfig has `""module"": ""ESNext"",` so why am I getting a commonJS error? Make sure to read the error message very carefully. It is not saying that *your* code is CommonJS; it's saying that the Supabase package is CommonJS, and as a result, named imports might not work. ([MDN source if you're not familiar with what a named import is](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#named_import))This is pretty easy to fix — since they don't want you using a named import, simply use a default import instead. If you want to understand why CommonJS modules might not support named imports, this is explained in [the Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#commonjs-namespaces).",abrahamguo,2025-09-20 22:22:35,2,learnprogramming,t3_1nma549,False,

nfbr4nx,"> Where can I read up on how the whole ecosystem works so I'm not running into one problem after another?...I don't want to follow a recipe but rather understand the chemistry behind certain types of food combinations.You've got a few things going on. We'll skip Typescript for now.All node.js projects are defined using a `package.json` file. This file's primary purpose is to allow you to define the structure of libraries or applications you write. If you ever publish an app or library to an external repository, such as npmjs.com, this file will be used by Node to work out which file bootstraps your code, what dependencies it requires, and so on.Usually, we aren't publishing packages, but we still use the `package.json` to manage dependencies, which are located in (and downloaded from) the npm repository by default.The `package.json` file is managed by the `npm` command. For example, `npm install` will install the dependencies listed in `package.json`. `npm run` will run any script defined in the `scripts` property. `npm test` will run your test suite, defined in the `scripts.test` property. See the [docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json) for a full breakdown of the file.Dependencies are installed to the `node_modules` directory.In the old days, modules were included in Node.js apps using a system called CommonJS, in which you export variables from modules by adding them as properties to an object called `exports` (e.g. `exports.bar = bar`). You could then import it with `var bar = require('./foo').bar;`. The path has to be relative for modules you define. For dependencies installed via npm, it would be `require('foo')` to load the module from `node_modules/foo`.The trouble with this approach is that you always had to import the entire module, even if you only needed one thing from it. If that same module is imported multiple times throughout the code, that's a lot of redundant duplication; so ES modules were invented to allow you to import/export specific vars and only those vars (e.g. `import { bar } from 'foo'`).This feature has to be enabled in Node.js before it will work. I don't recall if it's backwards compatible with CommonJS or not, but the error you reported above (*The requested module '@supabase/supabase-js' is a CommonJS module*) suggests that either it doesn't, or it doesn't by default.I expect there will be a supabase package that does support esm, or a package that provides Typescript bindings.Typescript is a language that compiles (transpiles) to Javascript and has its own additional syntax. It's described as a superset of Javascript, meaning that it should be able to read and understand JS, but I swear I've had issues running normal JS through the compiler in the past. Anyway, Node only speaks JS, so you have to run your TS through the `tsc` Typescript compiler first. In order to import dependencies into a TS programme, they must themselves either be TS, or be JS with TS bindings. These bindings are located in files with the extension `.d.ts`.Bindings exist for pretty much all popular dependencies now.I've not used Vite so I can't help you with that.Here's a simple config I wrote from scratch for an interview I had to prepare for recently (that never actually materialised).

nf9vygr,Essentially it’s software that spits out an html file. Imbedded in the file is extra data than can be translated to obtain more information. It has to go through wordpad or something like that to see the raw data. They extract the data that’s imbedded and create a more readable file with the extra data. I’m not sure how they do this.

nfb1iea,"Got it. I don't know what the context is here -- and anything involving working with raw data is well above the level of this sub -- but the gist is probably this:You have an HTML file, which contains a table presenting some text, two cells per row. The *tr* is the element for a row, the *td* the element for a [cell](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/td). Each of these cells has a class called ""datavalue,"" and from that HTML file, you could write a script that grabs everything out of any cell with the ""datavalue"" class, so you end up with a text string of ""003F00502040003F00502040"".... (I assume that there are also rows with 00, 04 , etc.)The screenshot is a [hex editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_editor) of some kind -- I don't know which one but they basically all do the same thing: they open a file and let you directly see and edit the raw data. Right now you don't have the actual raw data, though, you have the text ""003F00502040003F00502040"" etc., so you'd have to convert that to the equivalent data file. (Don't worry about the specifics of that, there are probably built-in functions for it in whatever language you're using.)Then in the hex editor you can view what the bytes of the file are, where they are in the file, and what characters they would be if it was supposed to be readable text. This data is almost definitely not supposed to be text, but without more context I don't know what it's supposed to be. (i.e., the 00 3F and 00 50 are probably supposed to be 63 and 80, but I don't know exactly what the 63 and 80 are being used for.)Again, all of this is very much above the level of this sub.",motherthrowee,2025-09-20 20:27:49,1,learnprogramming,t1_nf9vygr,False,

nf0pch8,"I mean literally every post on Reddit tells you this lol.Anyway, I was always a weird nerd, hung around nerds, shy non-popular guys etc. But because I was always great at sport and athletic I would hang around jocks and even gangsters so I learned how to get along with alot of different people.This is a big question so there's nowhere to start really but for Reddit I will say this, biggest killers for the guys here are the following: Introverted, self awareness and over-valuing intelligence. I can explain lol.1. Introverted: People use this as a self-built cage rather than just a label. It shouldn't even be a label the way this word has a mental hold on people on Reddit. Firstly, yes you can be naturally inclined toward introversion or extraversion, but there's caveats. Being introverted or extroverted doesn't neccessarily mean bad at social interaction versus good. I've seen plenty of extraverts who fucking suck at social situations and introverts who are great, they just prefer to be alone more often. You can be good at social skills and continue to carry your special little introvert label if you want, it's just going to be a little harder than if you were an extravert ***simply because you're getting in less reps.*** An extrovert will try and fail more = more chance for success. Also, you can switch between being introverted or extroverted, this isn't WoW where you can't cast a spell because you chose the paladin class. You're allowed to try being extroverted for a week, year, decade if you want.Like OP said it will feel weird at first, but ask any guy who got ripped from being fat if he felt like a natural in the gym the first day he picked up a weight. Nope, he worked through the pain and embarassment and got the reward. The good thing about social skills is that it doesn't even take that long, nor do you have to always be the social guy.. you can just learn the skills and keep it in your back pocket until you need it.2. Self awareness: Reddit copes alot by thinking that extraverts in engineering are just ""smooth talkers"" wrong. Smooth talking is a skill that comes with social skills, but it's not the whole pie. Some social people over-use smooth talking and get found out real quick and exposed, luckily here on Reddit we're all extremely intelligent and know what's best for the world so that won't be our issue... right?There's a negative connotation in engineering for having good social skills and confidence. I get laughed at by my friends for having ""good english"" and ""talking shit"".. like that's something to be embarassed about? In reality, I have great language skills to explain things to people of all levels, and I can basically nail down concepts into managable pieces for customers to understand without confusing them with jargon.. that's a skill that requires intelligence, humility and understanding concepts. Engineering isn't just about calculating numbers really fast, or memorising a fourier transform, we're here to sell products and create ideas. You NEED to be able to communicate those ideas or else the math and physics is lost in the void. What's the point of being able to create nuclear power if the government is scared of it and thus bans it because you can't explain to them why it's neccessary. 3. over-valuing intelligence: In the sense that people here like to min/max intel stats, that's great. More intelligence is always good, but again that's not a license for you to suck at conveying your ideas or to treat people like shit. Yes conceptually a team of really high intel nerds will be good for a company, but in reality we live in a market where we need to promote ideas and actually be able to understand from person to person. You can't do that by being very intelligent but a dick or can't explain your ideas to people in simple terms.",whathaveicontinued,2025-09-19 04:58:06,6,cscareerquestions,t3_1nkttp4,False,

Without stars and citations, GitHub repos and arXiv papers are laborious to evaluate and are indistinguishable from slop.* Our work inevitably requires some research, which usually doesn't pan out. If a manager makes a bad hire, and they're not competent in ML themselves, they have to wait through a long string of failures in order to decide ""okay this person is incompetent"" and finally fire him.So hiring managers have to be very, very careful. In such murky circumstances, it's rational to resort to costly social signals. Publications in conferences, placements in Kaggle competitions, and of course experience at prestigious companies are reliable signals of competence, only because they are so costly to fake.

nfbftw1,"I've been on both sides of this. I started my career as an 'ambitious overachiever,' burned out hard, and then tried the 'maintain boundaries' approach. Here's what I learned. **As an Ambitious Overachiever:** From my personal experience, going above and beyond only **works if you're able to ""showcase"" your work.** That is, people in the company need to actively **see you as someone who goes ""above and beyond""** in order for it to matter. You should also make sure to **document your achievements and positive feedback** received so you can later present them to management when discussing raises, promotions, and so on. I would also say, though this is also another personal experience thing, that **going above and beyond in every category is both ineffective and leads to burnout.** It's better to **have one project which you own/lead and excel** **at** at a time, and do the ""regular"" amount of work on your other projects. In addition, it is important to build rapport. You don't have to be an extrovert per se, but **people should leave feeling positively after talking with you.** On the downside, **career progression** at any one company inherently **depends on how much room there is for promotion** and the budget of your department. Plus, overperformance makes you advance faster but rarely do you ever skip progression tiers. You may be a truly stellar, outstanding, junior engineer, but you won't get promoted to senior engineer immediately. You'll likely just spend one year less in junior, one year less in mid, and so on. It also only partially protects you from layoffs--**you'll be the last junior engineer laid off**, but if they're **laying off all junior engineers you're still gonna get laid off.**Something I learned the hard way is that no matter how much of a ""go above and beyond"" employee you are, **one period of poor performance**, even if do to extenuating circumstances, **can very quickly destroy your reputation** as an overperformer. If this happens, you should immediately look for a new job unless you really love your current workplace. I also found that **opportunities to truly excel can be difficult to find and sometimes even be gatekept.**It is important to remember that much of **your excellent performance will evaporate** when searching for a new job **unless you're able to show public artifacts** which showcase it. Maybe references can do this too, but you need to tell the new employer to actually contact them. I got laid off without any public artifacts to show off, and it made job searching ***much harder.*****Do great work but maintain boundaries approach:**I took this approach after burning out, though that burnout was partly due to a toxic coworker. I found it to be less stressful and often my outcomes became more consistent, which many employers value more than someone who does overall better work but in an inconsistent fashion. In general, it's only seen as a bad thing at (healthy) companies if it's the kinda role where overtime is inherently expected or a startup. How your work itself is recognized largely depends on your manager and how well they understand it. I'd say your manager's **subjective perception of your work matters far more than the actual work quality.****Advancement** felt like it **depended** more **on the state the economy**. Good economy, relatively normal advancement rate. Bad economy, slower advancement rate and layoffs. **Summary/takeaway:**Brute-force 'tryharding' is rarely worth the investment and often leads to burnout. If there's a project you can take ownership over, do that and make sure to 'show it off' like a salesman.

nfbln86,"More is more obviously, unless you're blatantly doing the wrong thing. The question should be more nuanced though- people (especially engineers) LOVE to microoptimize on a single variable when that isn't actually productive because our lives are multifaceted (e.g. either minmaxing saving money, or being a yolo spender). My practical recommendations are 2 things1) oscillate based on priority. Some projects are important, high-vis, high-impact and will leapfrog your career more than the rest of your work combined. Spending a bit more effort here pays dividends. Similarly, if you're close to a promo you care about, it's worth doing a bit extra. Rest of the time, it's okay to just do enough.2) understand the rubric better. Unlike school where assignments are graded 0-100%, work is very ambiguous. Understand who controls your career trajectory (usually your direct manager and maybe skip level), and optimize for success. Find ways to proactively make your manager's job easier, and make your manager look good to their management. This will do the most. One anecdote I've shared a few times: I grinded really hard when I joined this job, manager denied my promo again and again based on random nitpicks from career ladder doc. I eventually threw in the towel and said fuck it, that manager left, my new manager was chill and I kept sandbagging. I'd be responsive and helpful on shared projects, but I was also literally playing video games during the day (wfh). Despite all this, my new manager pretty soon put me up for promo successfully without me asking, and handwaved a bunch of career ladder ""requirements"".

If you feel you are stuck and will have a hard time being thought of as senior by your peers because you can't keep up in architecture and design discussions that might hold you back and force you to job hunt.I agree you should talk to your manager and try to feel out how likely it is you can meet their expectations to stay on assuming you enjoy the work aside from the new hoops they want you to jump through.I saw some others suggested asking more questions to keep improving your skills. Many people are afraid to ask dumb questions too often as it can make you seem too dependent on the other engineers. But these days honestly you can try talking to an AI about technical details. Most software design and architecture is very well understood and the AI can easily walk you through design questions and help you understand any parts that don't make sense so the next time you have a discussion you are more clear about what is happening.Just a month back there was a discussion at work explaining a mesh network setup for one of our products. And my networking is super rusty. An hour conversation with the AI and I was following their mesh design much more clearly and asking their team good questions, not the dumb ones where I was unaware of basics or some lingo. Most designs in software aren't super novel or deviant from knowledge the AI has.The AIs can still lie so I do recommend double checking it's statements if you are going to put your reputation on the line defending a claim it made. But I feel like there has never been a better tool to help drill down on some ""dumb"" questions we all have.I will say I am generally perceived as very good at my job and I love software and design discussions. I am totally not immune to feeling stupid or inadequate. Especially on newer projects. Imposter syndrome creeps up on most people unless you have a godly ego. So it's hard to say how you feel really equals no hope of reaching senior in your current role. Also I don't do side projects. Clearly they are great if you can.

It's difficult to tell the difference between early career and experienced commenters, and good advice is often counter intuitive. There are two pieces of bad advice I am constantly trying to correct. First is learning more skills won't lead you to being overworked. People complain about the rising popularity of full stack development. They say they refuse to learn frontend or backend because that will just lead to your employer expecting you to do two jobs. That's not true. Learning more skills will make you more efficient at your job, saving you time. It will also make you more competitive on the job market, meaning it will be easier for you to find a job with good WLB. There's more than enough dedicated frontend or backend work. If an employer is going to overwork you, they're going to do it regardless if you know full stack or not.Second is becoming more senior destroys your WLB. That's again not true. The things that destroy your WLB are getting a senior title before your ready and getting a senior title at a mismanaged company. Some people get thrust into a tech lead role 3 years into their career. These people are usually stressed AF because they don't have the experience to do it effectively, and the fact that they were promoted means the average level of experience is lower then theirs. That means they're going to be even more stressed trying to bail out all of the people on their team, because they also don't have the experience to do their jobs effectively. Don't try to avoid promotions.

Keep conversations up with your manager (ask for skip level 1v1s) to ensure you stay in communication so your manager can continue to gauge how you are doing vs. what your lead is saying. That then allows your manager to know how to work with the lead to make them a better leader as well. It is not being arrogant when you say I’ve worked on this and this and this and these are the outcomes. If you mess up, own it and say I learned my lesson and don’t do Y again. That goes a long way and gains lots of respect, which helps with stability.It doesn’t hurt to put feelers out there for other jobs, but each job has his own crap to deal with. I would evaluate the opportunities you have and get vs. this lead being a pain. This lead may not be here for forever either. If the lead is your only problem, do skip level 1v1s and go from there. Remember, everyone is learning. The lead, yes is being not a great lead, but likely it’s their first time being a leader and trying to figure it out and needs some guidance. Just like you when you first started. Try to highlight the wins with the lead too! Maybe that will get them thinking more positively as well.

ng10ad7,"I live in LES ( a neighborhood in NYC). 120k sounds good very good entry level and fintech is a good space to be. Almost every major fintech has an office here and its the 2nd largest tech hub. It also is the largeast finance hub. Also NYC the sky is the limit so you can really use this as an oppurtunity to spring board.Its very likely you will be making double to tripple what you are currently making within 5 to 8 years.What life style is like in NYC at that salary? 120k in NYC is around a 6500 month net salary (due to city taxes).1. If you want to live somewhere fun for singles in their 20s, you would need to eitehr pick between living alone, living somewhere nice with roomates. You'd qualify a miximum of 3k a budget rent and at that price you can live alone. But you have to choose between living in a nice apartment in jersey/outer areas or in a pre-war shoe box in the nice trendy neighborhood. Nice in NYC is 'mid' in other cities. Its usually means you have a building with some amenities like laundry room or laundry in unit (rarer) and a dishwasher. NYC is a story of under consturction. Most apartments here are 100 years old (prewar) and lack modern conveniences like laundry, dishwasher and central AC. I picked the shoe box, its more fun to be in a good neighborhood if you like to go out and party.2. A lot of people your age would choose to live with roomates in order to be in a nicer apartment in a good location. Generally apartments are a lot mroe cost effective in a 4 bed 2 bath or 3 bed 1 bath situation. If a studio in an apartment building is renting for 4000$, there is a good chance the 3 bed is only 8000$ and the 4 bed is 10,000$. So a very common strategy for young professionals is to just have roomates to live in a nicer apartment in a fun location.3. You can afford to live alone and somewher nice, but it would generally be in outer neighborhoods that are either gentrifying or in places like jersey city, a part of New Jersey that is connected by Manhattan via a subway called path.The biggest cost in NYC is rent. Almost all of the cost of living is real estate. That effects things like entertainment and other stuff, because bars/coffee shops/ restaurants and gyms are paying even more per sq feet than you are. But outside of that the cost is the same its not like Amazon charges more here when they are deliving goods to you. Groceries can be all over the map, but trader joes generally is cost effective as they use national priceTo give oyu some idea what prices are like. Manhattan (you can take off 20 percent for other areas1. Hair cuts 40 to 75$2. Gym depends on which but 50 to 300$. 125 would be mid-tier3. Fast Casual lunch 15 to 20$4. Street food from a take out only operation 8 to 12$.5. Specialty Coffee from a cafe (6$ - 7$ before tax)6. Dinner at sit down casual restaurant with a waiter 40 to 80$ per person. You can easily spend 150$ per person at more upscale. This is assuming no alcohol.7. Alcohol 6 to 10$ for beer, 10-20$ for wine, 16 to 25$ cocktails. Non-alcoholic options will be offered at most bars. NYC has a BIG drinking culture. Tech community in particular has a lot of happy hour networking and social events that they host through apps like Luma, Posh VIP, Super Momos, Partiful. So even if you don't drink a whole lot, its in your interes8. Ubers 20$ per mile in Manhattan south of 96th street, 10$ per mile in Brooklyn/Queens/Bronx without manhattan entry.The other thing thats nice about NYC, because the city is so expensive you won't have pressure to be extravagent which happens in middle cost of living cities. This is a place where people who make 300k a year might live like college students and no one would bat an eye.TLDR: 120k is a great salary for someone your age in NYC in the fin-tech space. You will ahve enough money to go out quite a bit, save adequately for retirment and you can essentially pick where you want to live. It is a place where you will need to budget some and not be extravagent, but you can enjoy some luxuries. From a career perspective its also great, the only city that is better for Tech is SF and NYC is good at multiple industries. Fin-Tech space there is always the option of just transitioning into tech roles in finance and NYC is the capital of finance.

Don't just repeat the same exact thing that isn't working and expect it to suddenly start working.If you're getting literally no interviews, the problem is your resume. Hard stop. A lot of people read a bunch of resume advice, get people to review it online, even pay professionals to review it, and then just assume their resume can't be the problem after all of that.Well, the proof's in the pudding. If you're not getting interviews, it's your resume. So instead of blindly believing your resume is good, look into some differing advice. There's the ""meta advice"" you'll get on this subreddit (impact, KPI's, etc), but there's *lots* of different approaches to resume writing. Try some conflicting advice, and build a 2nd resume from that. Maybe even build a 3rd or a 4th all using different strategies that disagree with each other. Then A/B test those resumes. This is something I did in the middle of my job search because I had a hunch one of my titles was hurting me, so I started using 2 versions of my resume.If you're not struggling to get interviews, consider yourself lucky. It's much easier to improve on whatever interview techniques you're struggling with. Reflect, be honest with yourself where you're weak, and work to improve whatever that is. And don't sleep on the behavioral/communication aspect of interviewing, it can be hard to point the finger back at yourself and say you're not doing a good job at communicating, but you need to be able to be introspective.",SouredRamen,2025-09-22 16:00:19,16,cscareerquestions,t3_1nnonqn,False,

nfd2ed2,"I actually gave a short talk about this last week. My short opinion is ""yes, but a bubble doesn't mean the technology is worthless"". Right now what most people call ""AI"" (which is really just a small subset of generative AI) is almost definitely in a bubble. There's an unbelievable amount of investment in it, a ton of business ventures that use it without a clear plan or analysis, and a lot of integration in places where it doesn't add much value. There are also a lot of people banking on it doing things in the future that it doesn't do right now, and putting money into it based on an assumption that ""it'll do everything we need soon"".There's also an issue at the very top. Companies that provide the service are not making money off it yet, and they will need to either raise their prices or lower their costs to make it profitable in the future. They're all hoping to win a market share and then hike up the prices. This is disastrous for businesses which are, by-and-large, planning as though their current rates will be stable forever.Unlike blockchain/crypto, however, AI does show many profitable use-cases. AI does work that would cost money, and it provides services people will pay for. Business analyses DO show that AI is successfully being used by businesses sometimes. It's just that most businesses don't know what works or doesn't work, and are using the technology blindly.I would liken it to the ""Dotcom Bubble"". The internet as a business technology was absolutely in a bubble in the 90s, and that bubble crashed. It wasn't because ""having a website for your business"" was a bad idea, it was because people were trying to do it without a good plan. Nowadays every business has a website, but unlike the 90s we've established clear use cases which provide value instead of just guessing what works and what doesn't.I expect AI to be the same. AI will ""crash"". There will be downtime where a lot of businesses disappear, and from the ashes will rise a few clear uses where generative AI is used by almost every business.",dorox1,2025-09-21 03:52:13,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1nm9i8a,False,

Whether you would call that a bubble depends on what you think will happen when the market for the technology moves beyond hype into a mature, useful stage. There are many realistic and valuable business applications for LLMs, computer vision, etc. These tools are incredibly powerful and will only get better as the models get refined and as more skilled developers work on them (whether they are newly trained in an ML-specific context, like me, or they're crossing over from more rigorous, traditional SWE backgrounds).I'm currently a manager in a non-technical role but taking point on some exploratory AI projects, and I'm looking for a role as an ML engineer down the road. What I'm paying attention to, both in my current role and in my job search, is whether the product brings real business value. Investors and execs don't understand this stuff, they see how quickly and confidently chatgpt spits out text and they believe it's magic that's going to relieve them of the burden of workers. Dishonest hype men are more than happy to take advantage of that. But if you actually understand how these models work on even a rudimentary technical level then you can smell the bullshit from a mile away. I'm not going to peddle bullshit and I'm not going to go work for bullshit except as a last resort.

If you have a medical facility near you, any communities related to them are also a good place to look because a lot of doctors have nannies. New residents and med students with kids in particular may be looking to nanny share to save some money. Your other option is to aggresively consolidate your day and hire in-home help for that time. For example, make your working hours 9AM-1PM (or whatever). Find a part time nanny who is willing to do 4 hours per day. Then tell work that your hours for meetings and other syncronous work have shifted into that mid-day block or to hours when your husband is home. Both of these options, a nanny share or a part time nanny, will run you a similar cost to high quality infant daycare, but will keep your child from getting sick with all of the daycare sicknesses.

new0fsz,"People here have good advice but I'll tell you my story as it's very similar to yours. Advice at the end.Some background here: My wife and I had twins 4.5 months ago. My wife is a PM at a startup (she has anywhere from 2-4 hours of meetings a day), I'm a senior dev at a more established company (I have 30 minutes of meetings per day), and we both WFH full time. Also, I often can get away with working 10 hour weeks but the occasional crunch time for a project means I'm working 40 hours. My wife had \~3 months of maternity leave and I had 2 weeks of PTO that I used all up front when the babies were born. Ours were also underbaked (lol) at 37 weeks which is actually full term for twins. Our twins for the first \~4 months were also EXTREMELY clingy and could not be put down. We we wearing them almost all hours of the day.Our original plan was to attempt to balance them between meetings and work - we thought this might be feasible since my meeting schedule is so light and my working hours are extremely flexible.Towards the end of my wife's maternity leave, we realized things were only getting harder with the twins. On days where I happen to have a few extra meetings and she does as well (nearly every day for her) we really didn't have a backup plan other than 2 screaming babies behind me on camera or me skipping meetings. So in the final week before she went back to work, we hired a nanny who came to our house to watch the babies from 9-2. That offered us enough time to get things down and squeeze our meetings into this time window and then do any work we needed to follow up with later in the evening. Even this was not a very sustainable lifestyle as we found ourselves far too often working into the night when we were exhausted from taking care of twins most of the day. Our nanny didn't end up working out - she was unable to care for the babies as they needed a caretaker who had more energy (you can read my previous posts for more context here) so we ended up letting her go a few weeks ago and we are currently on week 3 of working while taking care of the twins. Let me tell you, it is extremely difficult. I take meetings in my airpods with screaming babies and then run out of the room to give my scrum update and then immediately after (2 min later) run back into the room to continue looking after them. I take meetings on walks. I cram as much work into their short nap windows as I possibly can. My wife and I both work late into the night to make it work. It is HARD. I would not wish it on anyone.My wife just put in her 2 weeks notice and work and I just landed a new job that gives me a raise to cover enough of her loss in comp that we should be fine for her to just be full time SAHM for now.TLDR;My situation is slightly different than yours - 2 WFH parents with 2 babies. But I think you also will find (especially with your heavy meeting load) that it's just not sustainable. You might make it work for a few weeks but inevitably you'll find that you can't dedicate enough effort to either work or your baby and likely both will suffer for it.My advice would be to spend the time now (before you go back to work) finding people in your network/community/neighborhood who would be interested in nanny sharing and then find ways if possible to reduce spending in other areas of your life to free up some funds for this. It's not going to be easy. But it will likely be SO MUCH easier than trying to do everything yourself.DM me or I can put you in contact with my wife if you have any questions!",natey_mac,2025-09-18 13:59:13,5,cscareerquestions,t3_1nk5eig,False,

They can even say ""Great!"" and not be lying, because what a ""Good WLB"" is is very subjective. They may genuinely think their WLB is great because they only have you working 60 hours instead of 80.So instead, ask them about stories. In the exact same way they use ""tell me about a time when..."" questions on *you* to gain insight into *you* as opposed to directly asking.

Because a lot of the Mediums are generalizations of Easy problems, and the Easy problems give you a good foundation of key techniques.Once you find a solution to an Easy, take around 10-15 minutes and think if you can find a faster solution. On Leetcode it is usually to tell if there is a faster solution by the speed/memory distribution.Once you get the hang of Easys, then start doing Mediums that are semi-related to the Easys you've done. (For example, if you did an Easy in strings, do some Mediums in strings. If you did Easies in arrays, do some Mediums in arrays.) Your mind will be somewhat attuned to possible patterns and techniques.WRT AI... please don't. People will find out. If they don't find out then, they will find out at the interview when they make you code in front of them.

nfdhqk7,"The ""open-ended"" questions typically involve market-making scenarios, probability puzzles with multiple valid approaches, or trading situations where you need to make assumptions and justify your reasoning. They want to see how you break down problems, ask clarifying questions, and adapt when given new information mid-problem. You can't really drill these like you would technical coding questions, but you can practice explaining your thought process out loud and getting comfortable with saying ""I'm not sure, but here's how I'd approach it.""Jane Street's bar is high and they're looking for a specific type of analytical thinking that either clicks with you or doesn't. But the uplifting part is that if you've made it to round three, they already see potential in you. Focus on being genuinely curious about the problems they present, don't be scared to ask questions, and show them how your mind works rather than trying to guess the ""right"" answer. The topics can range from basic probability and statistics to market dynamics, so having a solid foundation there helps, but your reasoning process matters more than perfect recall of formulas.I'm on the team behind [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically to help with these kinds of challenging interview scenarios where you need to think on your feet and articulate complex reasoning clearly.",akornato,2025-09-21 05:59:18,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1nm695j,False,

nf3ndn3,"This one is tougher than it looks tbh. Ill give you my story a bit, I worked at a defense contract company for 4 years. Started at 75k and worked my way to about 90k (not a huge bump but defense doesnt pay that crazy). I decided to jump ship during the last hiring boom of covid. Ended up at a big tech company (one of the bigger ones) for 200k TC. I took it without even thinking. Defense - i loved my co-workers and was moving up the latter quickly. It was so chill and the work was fun and easy. I did 20 hours of work and chilled the rest of the week. I was my team's scrum master and developer and i didnt think about work after 5 pm and was a top performer. There werent any real deadlines and i could sit on a task for 2 months and nobody complained. Big tech - things got hectic quickly. I was working for their cloud service. What i didnt know is that cloud is where work life balance goes to die. At first i wanted to respet my balance and stuck to 40 hour weeks for the most part. Then it slowly got more and more hectic and since i was remote id idnt realize my coworkers were pulling 50-60 hour weeks sometimes mroe. so after a year i obviously was behind the rest and even if my work was to my standards, they compared me to my coworkers standards and i got less than average. I drank the kool aid for a year and worked like crazy. Matched the 50-60 hours but i realzied i just didnt lvoe the work but the economy was shit so i kept it going. After a year i got another bad review and a few months later fired. Im not saying dont take AWS, for the money it sounds amazing. You might have a way better experience than i did. I know someone who works for AWS, has 300k+ in TC and it's one of the easier AWS projects where people sign off at 5pm and dont think about work. They dont even have on-call. You could land ion a project like that or you could land in a project that requires 80 hours from you in tough weeks. Im just saying sometimes the fame and fortune isnt what it lives up to be. You need to decide if you will be ok with the potential burnout.

Greater than 1 YoE, resume can be 1 or 2 pages, or 1.5 is okay white space kind of looks bad. Use a big font if 2 pages. Honestly, big font is underrated. Eye tracking surveys you can search for show HR reads you resume for less than 8 seconds. Don't make it an adjective fiesta. I list the tech stacks both in the job descriptions and in a separate section at the bottom for ease of reading.3. A select few companies like seeing community involvement such as volunteering. Can attend young professionals events and maybe make friends at companies that are hiring. Adult kickball leagues, I know multiple married couples that met on teams.4. Sounds obvious but be within driving distance of the office. I don't list my full address, just City, State, Zipcode. Remote jobs all well and good but those get the most applicants. Almost every company I know went back to 3-4 days in the office.>still managed to hit \~120 applications. No job still.In 4 months, that is slack. 10 applications a day = 300 a month is still slack.

nf59viu,"It's definitely possible to get hired as a software engineer without formal SWE internships. You just need to show you can build and ship projects, not just that you’ve taken classes. The app you’re working on is a great start. Keep working it, and add at least one or two more projects that show backend and frontend skills. A strong portfolio will make up for the lack of SWE internships.Networking is another big piece. Stay active on LinkedIn, connect with alumni from your school who are in tech. Recruiters care more about what you can do than what your degree says.

ng0uzys,"There are probably several people from FANGs who were able to get rapid promos with similar stories, but this was one way to get on the fast track for promos there.I came in as an L3 at Google working on a product that was about half a year out from a product reveal. It's on Android, which is good because we didn't lack any Android expertise in our org. This was in the Lollipop - Marshmallow era. We were trying to write what was effectively an Android-on-Android ""emulator"" to sandbox Android code, which was a non-negotiable from Android Security for our product launch. I was part of an org built around solely this one product.The problem was that the Android framework code was heavily customized by different OEMs (for the framework services) and SOCs (for e.g. the egl GPU drivers, as well as the Bionic/libc runtimes themselves). The main architecture was there, but we couldn't figure out how to proceed with working through the thousands of miniscule differences between the various different OEM customizations that would cause our sandbox to break in subtle ways.I had some RE experience in the past, so I asked if we could get approval from our OEM partners via our account managers to reverse engineer the proprietary framework code for different OEMs to work through these bugs one by one (obviously, we couldn't get src code access). A lot of them okay-ed the request, though for very few bigger OEMs, we had to create a setup to do slow black box RE instead since the TAMs couldn't get an agreement in place.It turns out that most OEMs and SOCs reuse their customizations across all of their devices (with the exception of Samsung, where even within the J series, things changed drastically version to version), so the final list of things we had to RE and then add hackarounds for was a fairly feasible space of changes.We did have to redo our go-to-market roadmap since we couldn't tackle the whole thing in just one half. Instead, I wrote out a quick roadmap for what I thought would've been a good ordering of OEMs to unlock, and a ""PoC"" demonstrating how to fix up one specific OEM. My skip LGTM-ed it, and I started as the de facto L3 TL of this program that went to weekly program review at our org level steering.I spent about 1.5 years running that program to completion. I spent the first half teaching 2 other SWEs how to do the RE work and then working through most of the low hanging fruits to get to our launch target (IO). Then another year to grow out the team and get to something like 95% coverage by device count before we hit diminishing returns (the fan-out of highly customized devices with low user base that we scoped out from the program). By the end of it, I had made L5 as a TL for a team of 8.I won't lie, that was definitely the funnest 2 years of my career. I was also blessed with good mentorship, since my EM really helped me figure out what I and the team needed (e.g. swaying me away from the tendency to become a single bottleneck and instead focus on growing the same skills in my peers). At the end of the day however, it's mostly a matter of being at the right place at the right time.Another year down the line, and the org lost interest in maintaining the product.

nfjgsq3,"Wanted to give some perspective as a SWE that left Squarespace earlier this year (based out of the NYC office). Squarespace definitely has a pretty chill wlb and has a good engineering culture + you should have a very supportive engineering manager. There were regular company-wide panel meetings for engineers to showcase their recent work and share interesting news and upcoming tech. However, from my own experience, the product management and roadmaps can be a little shaky and if you are the type of dev that prefers autonomy and moving at your own pace, you might feel bogged down by all of the meetings and politics between different teams & departments.As the other commenter said, options are definitely a crapshoot and thats part of the reason I left for a startup where my options would have a little more upside + I could have more eng & product ownership. By the time I left I had a few years of stock refreshers that were worth about 75k a year in straight up equity which were then converted to plain cash payouts after SQSP went private. The change to options was def a downgrade for me given that any potential value hinged on growth in valuation and going public again or doing a stock buyback/other liquidity event. At the time that I left a lot of people viewed the valuation target from the company leadership as a bit aggressive but who's to say that they can't meet it with some aggressive catch-up against their main competitors (eg. shopify with a current valuation \~25x that of Squarespace when it went private).I'd say to not make the jump just because of the potential value of the equity, but if you're looking for a good engineering culture and interesting product to continue your career growth I would definitely suggest considering Squarespace",steiner26,2025-09-22 03:30:05,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1nlw0dz,False,
nf9swh3,"For software development, the languages that companies value most right now are Python (super versatile: backend, automation, data science, AI, security), Java (still huge in enterprise and backend), C# (popular for backend and enterprise systems), C++ (more specialized, but strong in systems, embedded, and performance heavy apps). You might find backend, automation, or even systems programming a better fit. Python is especially powerful because it crosses into both software development and cybersecurity. For cybersecurity, it’s useful for scripting, automating scans, and working with security tools.If you’re interested in cybersecurity, focus on Python scripting for automation. Networking basics (which you’ve started on). Linux security and command line skills. Certifications like CompTIA Security+ or CEH (these can help open doors). If you’re more interested in software development, building a few solid projects (maybe a command line tool, an automation script, or a backend system) will help you stand out.EU companies often look for flexible engineers who can do multiple things. Stick with Python as your main tool, add depth with either Java or C#, and build some focused projects. Also, check out [Cloud Strategy Labs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) for more clear roadmaps and step by step guides for both software development and cybersecurity.",Content-Ad3653,2025-09-20 16:40:42,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1nlu07s,False,

nfagyy8,"C# and Java are definitely used in web development, but that’s not all they’re good for. Java is big in enterprise backend systems (think banking, telecom, or government software). It’s also used in Android development and large scale data platforms. C# shines in desktop applications, enterprise software, and especially in game development with Unity. So even if you’re not into web dev, both still have strong non web uses.For projects you can still build things that stand out without touching frontends. Automation tools to write a Python or C# script that automates boring tasks (like cleaning up files, organizing data, or generating reports). System utilities to build a command line tool for network scanning, log parsing, or monitoring resources. Cybersecurity mini tools which are things like a password strength checker, simple intrusion detection script, or vulnerability scanner. Data focused projects to parse large datasets, visualize trends, or build small machine learning models. Game or simulation projects using C# with Unity or even Python with Pygame, create a small but complete game or simulator. Make the project useful and complete not just half finished code.
