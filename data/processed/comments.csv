n219wr6,"Hey, [r/dataengineering](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/)! Hope you're having a good day.We are excited to announce Sail 0.3. In this release, Sail preserves compatibility with Spark’s pre-existing interface while replacing its internals with a Rust-native execution engine, delivering significantly improved performance, resource efficiency, and runtime stability.Among other advancements, Sail 0.3 adds support for Spark 4.0 while maintaining compatibility with Spark 3.5 and improves how Sail adapts to version changes in Spark’s behavior across versions. This means you can run Sail with the latest Spark features or keep your current production environment with confidence, knowing it’s built for long-term reliability and evolution alongside Spark.[https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3/](https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3/)# What is Sail?Sail is an open-source computation framework that serves as a drop-in replacement for Apache Spark (SQL and DataFrame API) in both single-host and distributed settings. Built in Rust, Sail runs \~4x faster than Spark while reducing hardware costs by 94%.# What’s New in Sail 0.3* **Compatibility** with Spark 4.0’s new `pyspark-client`, a lightweight Python-only client with no JARs, enabling faster integration and unlocking performance and cost efficiency.* **Changes in the installation command** now require explicitly installing the full PySpark 4.0 library (along with Spark Connect support) or the thin PySpark 4.0 client, offering greater flexibility and control, especially as Spark Connect adoption grows and variants of the client emerge.* **Automatic detection of PySpark version** in the Python environment adjusts Sail’s runtime behavior accordingly to handle internal changes, such as differences in UDF and UDTF serialization between Spark versions, ensuring that a single Sail library remains compatible across both versions.* **Automatic Python unit testing** on every pull request across Spark 3.5 and Spark 4.0 to track feature parity and avoid regressions.* **Faster object store performance,** reducing latency and improving throughput across cloud-native storage.* **New and improved documentation** with updated getting-started guides, architecture diagrams, and compatibility to help you get up and running with Sail and understand its parity with Spark.# Our MissionAt LakeSail, our mission is to unify batch processing, stream processing, and compute-intensive AI workloads, empowering users to handle modern data challenges with unprecedented speed, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. By integrating diverse workloads into a single framework, we enable the flexibility and scalability required to drive innovation and meet the demands of AI's global evolution.# Join the Slack CommunityThis release features contributions from several first-time contributors! We invite you to [join our community on Slack](https://www.launchpass.com/lakesail-community/free) and engage with the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/lakehq/sail). Whether you're just getting started with Sail, interested in contributing, or already running workloads, this is your space to learn, share knowledge, and help shape the future of distributed computing.

Get comfortable packaging Python jobs in containers, wiring them into CI/CD, and writing tests with pytest; that’s the bridge from classic ETL to modern DE. Learn dbt for in-warehouse transforms so you can show you can model data the “analytics” way, and skim Spark only enough to talk partitioning and schema evolution-real heavy lifting there is less common than the hype suggests. Fivetran covers the boring ingestion so you can focus on orchestration; I’ve also kept DreamFactory in the mix when I need instant REST endpoints over old SQL Server tables.

Both of them offer a free account for testing with limitations (Databricks daily limit, Snowflake also limited 30 day trial but you can create a new account later). Databricks notebook / compute environment is very similar to Fabric so that's what I'd recommend.Also pandas isn't really appropriate for any of these environments as it not parallel compute optimised (the whole code ends up running on the driver node). You may end up working with some code some data scientist wrote in pandas but you likely shouldn't be writing it from scratch (although pyspark does have pandas api on spark which is mostly cross compatiable). All of these platforms have a variant of SQL and I've found data teams who migrate from on-prem to cloud tend to prefer using it as they're not as comfortable with python, but you could also familiarise yourself with pyspark which will be relevant for both Databricks and Fabric.For loading data, I would get comfortable with e.g. using spark.read() for either append, overwrite or merge. Beyond reading CSV, look at reading/writing parquet and look at processing e.g. JSON files and handling semi-structured data operations (e.g. exploding on list elements) as you will often need to ingest from APIs with this structure and then flatten it for a reporting requirement.I would also familairise yourself with data platform design patterns, e.g. Databricks medallion architecture.

n2qlkwz,"It’s my manager estimating. So here is the thing-when I started my job, I had a good experience with my first project. I was creating data products for a team and frequently was looped into calls with the stakeholders and the stakeholders would spend time with me explaining their side of things and it would “click” what I am trying to do and what I’m looking at. Over the course of the job, I’ve gotten more and more projects. At one time, I feel like I’m working on 5 things but they’re not being explained by stakeholders but more tasks where im given things by my team members. There’s so many random things, acronyms never explained to me, the content is never explained to me. Like I almost feel I’m doing tasks where my mind isn’t interpreting the data in any meaningful way but just told to do.These are the projects that have been the most frustrating and taken me the most time-because the team members giving them to me have become semi-hostile when a field is null or not showing up as expected and I don’t know bc I don’t know what this data is and what to expect. I don’t understand what I am looking at in the end. I’m just “doing” and then things come back to me frequently bc “xyz wasn’t right”, “this field is not coming correct”, “is our data up to date bc why am I seeing this”. These are very nuanced things about the data I just would have no clue until somebody who had greater context of it trained or explained it to me. When I told my boss about the difference between my first project and later projects, they’d say “few projects will be as straightforward like that”. It almost makes me feel I just have to be comfortable with things that don’t make sense but I have to just do.I’ve been complimented by people who work at the same level or below me-my fellow team members and interns who have been impressed by the way I figured out how to link data together when there was no straightforward way to do it. Earlier in my job, it felt like it was both the context of my project and technical skills that worked hand in hand to develop solutions.My managers and higher up’s are the ones who don’t seem to appreciate as much- “do this, no don’t do this” one second they’ll tell me to do something and then same second they’ll tell me what they told me earlier is wrong. There’s so much changing around too-like my team is saying our roles will evolve. Few months ago, they told us what our tasks would be vs a purely technical team. It felt like our tasks would be semi-technical and semi-business and I was fine with that initially. Now they are saying our tasks will be 100% business-related and we will be creating the requirements and feeding that either to AI apparently or our technical team who will do the technical work for us which seems a bit unrealistic to me and more time consuming for us to have to both define things and wait on another person to get it to get the product out. Everyday feels like a new thing, new contradiction. The only silver lining is I’m working on a different task and hoping there will be an opportunity where I don’t feel as burned out as I did these past few months.People say “change jobs” but for me finding this job took 150 applications. I need to mentally prepare myself to apply in this bad job market. When I look at other DE jobs, there’s so much tech I don’t know bc this role didn’t give me the technical skills I hoped for as a DE.

n1qlfvr,"There's a lot of good questions here to unpack. I work in this area, so I can give you an overview.**What is real time? Is near-real time enough? (tldr; question)**This is defined differently for different use cases and there isn't one definition for this. For example, the definition of real-time is different for real-time operating systems (think RTOS) or high-freuquency trading (they literally measure cable lengths to minimize propagation delays) and other use cases. For data engineering, ""real-time"" rarely means milliseconds in my experience, but is very often seconds and even minutes, depending who in the org-chart you talk to. That said, a lot of large-scale compute workloads we see often do end up in the milliseconds. The most common place I see those is in the security space, but their setups don't resemble a typical data engineering environment. Instead of CDC, Kafka, warehouses and ETL jobs, you will see transactional workloads, APIs, and processes directly talking to one another over HTTP.**Complex transformations (2)**It's historically been pretty hard to pull off but that's changing. The foundational work/papers to do this at scale is fairly recent (I'd say, last 2-3 years), so it's not surprising you haven't seen off-the-shelf solutions here that live up to the promises.Fundamentally, to compute in real-time, you need to be able to compute ""incrementally"". That is, update views over your data in real-time by only observing how the input tables ""change"" (inserts/updates/deletes). No batch engine (like the ones you mention, Trino, Spark etc) can achieve this, because they are designed from the ground up to recompute queries from scratch, which gets slower as the data size increases.For an actual incremental engine, I encourage you to give [Feldera](https://github.com/feldera/feldera) a spin (disclaimer: I work there). It let's you define pipelines as tables and deeply nested views in SQL. When the tables ""change"" (get inserts/updates/deletes), the views are updated incrementally. The guarantee is that the amount of work a pipeline does is proportional to the size of the changes, not the size of the overall data. It's main strength is that it can do such incremental evaluation for **arbitrarily complex SQL, including recursion**, not just simple queries (as you seem to have noted about alternatives).What this means is that pipelines do so little work per event, that it routinely hits the millisecond timescales in real-world workloads (users have even reported 4ms latencies to keep views over terabytes of data, with low tens of milliseconds being more common). Of course, it depends on the queries, the arrival rates and what not. But we do see users run some beastly pipelines that update at sub-second speeds over billions of rows (think 10K line Spark SQL code, with 100s of joins, distincts, aggregates, and what not).**Infra bottlenecks and processing delays (1, 3)**You are spot on here, but not due to actual hardware issues (modern hardware is ridiculously fast and if anything, most software and cloud infra sucks at taking advantage of them). NVMe storage and modern CPUs can pack quite the punch.When it comes to building real-time systems **end-to-end** however, you might still end up in the seconds to minutes range, even if the analytics/compute side is instanteous. This is because most data stores and plumbing infra aren't built for high volume real-time ingest (i.e., they cannot handle inserts/updates/deletes to data).For example, if further downstream of Feldera, you want to serve the results off of something like Delta Lake, you have to incur the additional latency from having to run Delta Table merges before you can serve this data. We have (painfully) seen pipelines update complex views in milliseconds only for things like Delta Lake and Kafka to add another minute afterwards. There are of course ways to architect around it, but it does take a lot of custom systems work (see the security industry context I mentioned earlier).**Hype vs reality (5)**There is a tremendous amount of hype and marketing here. Don't believe any vendor (including me :)) -- reality about this space is that it is quite nascent, and whether you can hit the right operating points around scale/latency/throughput does depend on your workload and the laws of computational complexity at play. Throw your worst queries and most challenging use cases at them before you make a decision, rather than believe any hype.",Unique_Emu_6704,2025-07-07 02:01:26,16,dataengineering,t3_1ltg0pt,False,

n202zx2,"First, OP, your post reads like a marketing flyer with all the buzzwords. There are definite good practices for many needs but not a generic one size fits all. There are a list of things I would suggest,1. Stop calling it medallion architecture (it is a pet peeve of mine). The three tier design has been around for 35+ years. It was originally called staging, core and semantic layers. There are very few hard and fast rules around them; just generic guidelines.2. The best datawarehouses don't have any particular purpose (at least not until you hit the semantic layer). This is especially true of the core layer. It should be modeled around the business processes. As such, it only changes as often as the business does. Normally, this is not very often.3. Things happen in the processes between layers. It is not very often that things happen inside a layer.4. Staging is for landing data and, if desired, keeping the historical feed data. You should always have the original feed from the operational system so that you can trace your data back to it. The data warehouse is considered ""correct"" when it balances back to the system of record (SOR). If the SOR isn't right, you don't fix it in the DW, you fix it in the SOR and let the correction flow forward. When you change source data in the DW, you lose your chain of accountability. The Line of Businesses (LOB) or legal will tell you how long they want you to archive that stuff. Remember, they look at it differently than IT.5. The core layer is where data is kept that has been cleaned and adjusted to standard values. Different LOBs may have different abbreviations and meanings for data components. The processes to create and update the core data is where you adjust those to the standards. I tend to make my core layer in 3NF because it shows the proper relationships between the data parts without assigning specific purpose to the data. You make it fit for all purposes. This is where you also clean up things like addresses. (These can be a nightmare. Look at all of the ways Peachtree is used in Atlanta.) You also generalize things like customers, employees, vendors, etc. to generic terms like Party. You don't have to have the entire core flushed out before you use it. Just have the design as far as you can and flush the data out as project come along to fund it.6. The third layer, semantic, is where you put your data products, created from core, that the various LOBs need. When you create something like a star schema, you assign specific purpose to the data. It may or may not fit with other LOBs in the organization. Trying to reuse data products across various LOBs can be a tricky proposition and needs a bit of thought.7. Traditionally, you would only give access for users at the semantic layer. I tend to break this guideline. While still having appropriate security controls, I give users access to any layer they want. Data Scientists tend to like data a early and close to the operational data source as possible. I give them access to staging with the caveat to them the data is still abit of a mess. Regulatory reporting normally can wait a bit for the much cleaner data in the semantic layer. Those are just two examples.8. Don't ignore the other data parts like security, metadata, governance, etc. This is why you want to find an experience data architect to help you.

The size of these files is utterly insignificant. Iceberg is designed for, as stated later, ""tens of petabytes of data"" and a few dozen bytes per write is utterly inconsequential. It is less than a rounding error. You may as well be complaining about the unnecessary weight of a heavy duty door on a mining truck - half a kilo isn't going to matter when you're carting 5 tons around.So, from a *purely technical* perspective, yes it has a *slight* amount of redundant data, but in practice the difference wouldn't even be measurable.> ""Tables grow large by being written to, they grow really large by being written to frequently""This relates to a complaint about optimistic concurrency, and again it completely whiffs. I don't know where they got that quote from, but it doesn't inherently apply to the types of uses that iceberg would be used for. Each operation is for updating or inserting millions and billions of rows. We're not expecting to do *frequent* writes into iceberg, we're expecting to do *big* ones.He follows up with...> Did I mention that 1000 commits/sec is a pathetic number if you are appending rows to table?... and if you'll excuse my language: Who *the fuck* is doing 1000 commits/sec for a use case where iceberg is even remotely relevant, that is completely fucking insane. You're not using iceberg for subsecond latency use cases, so just add 1 second of latency to the process and batch the writes, good god.> you need to support cross table transactions.No, you don't *need* to, because the use case doesn't call for it. This isn't a transactional database where you need to commit a correlated update/insert to two tables at the same time to maintain operational consistency because this isn't the transactional store underpinning an application state as a system of record. Data warehouses can be altered and rebuilt as needed, and various constraints can be, and are, skipped to enable high throughput performance.If you're ingesting customer data, account data, and a linking table of the two, you don't need a transaction to wrap all of that because you use your orchestrator to run the downstream pipelines dependent on the two after they've both updated.> This is extra problematic if you have a workload where you constantly trickle data into the Data Lake. ... For example, let us say you micro batch 10000 rows every second and that you have 100 clients doing that.Why write every second? Why not batch writes up every minute? Why have each node do a separate metadata write, rather than having them write their raw data, then do a single metadata transaction for them? Why use Iceberg streaming inputs like this at all, when you can just dump to parquet -- it isn't like you're going to be doing updates at that speed, you can just do blind appends, and that means you don't strictly need versions.The writer is just inventing problems by applying Iceberg to things you shouldn't apply it to.

As a quick win to get something in place fast, you could use Airbyte to ingest data, then build procedures inside the database and schedule them using SQL Server Agent to run a few times a day.

In my experience it's best to focus on conceptual know-how and broad technical skills with your main ability being 3 things. 1) listen to and deeply understand what people need, and what they mean by what they say. ask questions until you understand (with a drive to answer these questions yourself or by asking people if you can't).2) train yourself to be really good at problem solving, with whatever tools you have available. Do expand your toolset over time and if you can, but do not focus on the tool as such. Instead focus on solving the problem at hand with the tool(s) available, as effectively and efficiently as possible. Also keep in mind someone else will eventually pick up where you left off, so document what you've done in an accessible way.3) know and paint the bigger picture for yourself and others to understand more easily what is going on. This helps you to do a better job and explain what you are doing, but it also helps others to understand and match their skills to the task at hand. If you focus on these 3 abilities, you can work in any company of any size. Your experience in some tools, like Databricks, counts of course, yet less so because you know the tool technically, more so because you know how to apply it to the above 3 abilities.

n24wolg,"Hey!First, sorry to hear that. Startups are tricky to get into and until you have been working for a bit, it’s hard to know the right questions to ask to avoid coming in too early.Regarding what you should do next, I would advise against freelancing. Most companies don’t want to hire freelancers with 10 years of experience as they can simply go with a boutique consulting company. I’m not saying it is impossible, but it is a steep hill to climb and it also sounds like you could benefit working in a team environment and learning from more experienced engineers.The top 4 things that will help get the average data engineering job are the following (in this order):1. SQL2. Python3. Shell scripting (aka bash)4. Data modeling (i.e. fact and dimensional modeling)Once you get a good grasp of these, then you layer on whatever are the current popular tech stack tools/platforms like the following (no order):1. Clouding computing (AWS/Azure) - sounds like you are already good here.2. dbt 3. Snowflake/Databricks4. Orchestration (Airflow or Dagster)5. Extract Load tools (dltHub, Airbyte, etc.)These are going to be your most common tools. While there are things like Spark, Trino, Kafka, etc., not all companies use them so there is limited value in focusing on them.Next, I’d also pick up good software development tools like:1. Docker2. source control (GitHub)3. CI/CD (GitHub Actions)4. Infrastructure as Code (i.e. terraform)This is quite a bit and I suggest starting at the top of my post and slowly working down. Next, while you can apply to jobs, the entry job market is very strained right now. You need to start networking, ideally in person but if that isn’t feasible then you need to seek out online networking.Feel free to message me if you have any questions.",teh_zeno,2025-07-09 07:39:03,11,dataengineering,t3_1lvc94v,False,

I agree that if there are substantial improvements in AI consistency and rigidity that something like this could work out okay, but just based off of your user story, you are skipping the idea that typically these requests flow from:Director: We need X and Y info for our QBRBPM: Gotcha, what we actually need is X and Y filtered for Z1,…Zi for date range Date1-Datei.Reporting Lead:Gotcha, what we actually need is a dashboard of above requirements in various different categorizations & breakouts for data from domain1 and domain2, and include the micro filters that actually make up filters Z1-ZiReporting Dev:Okay, this is a significantly more involved process than the reporting lead believes, we can accomplish about 60% of the ask with given information, an addl 20% is achievable if we go through this 2 week permissions loop, and the final 20% is currently non-existantReporting Dev creates ticket details, Reporting Lead submits ticket to DE team, work is completed anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months from now.The data needs that are now available, are no longer aligned with the pain points the business is trying to get data on, repeat.—-Hopefully that helps make sense. The painpoint is not at the “we have data, lets make a visual” level, its at the “we have x data access, and need y data access, or we need z pipeline built out for our use case” level.Which is what you addressed in your user story as well, but like, the business user will have absolutely no clue about this if that makes sense.

n2hgz4a,"I run into the gap but the communication gap you're describing is also a prioritisation and planning gap, in that the business has a completely different understanding of what a deliverable is. The business just don't think in terms of ""I need this report to be a 12 month rolling average that can be sliced by location and drills through to existing reporting with colour coding"", and they shouldn't need to.The communication gap comes from business users having clear understandings of the problem but can't (and shouldn't) be able to solution specifics. But at the same time centralise BI or engineering teams sit outside the business and, having been burned by getting blamed before, want to push the risk and design back to the business as much as possible.So pretty much every place I've worked has done kind of communications barrier between technical and business but when you get right into it, it's really more about the data side being unwilling or unable to think about the business process and do effective blue sky thinking about how to leverage their talents against a shared problem and pushing the business to become data designers instead and come to them with a spec.I reckon there's definitely some value to be had by getting an AI in the loop somewhere to help translating, but I don't think it attacks the core of why people always have this problem and the model you've described sounds like it's trying to remove the need for data development to understand the business world and problems.

n2i74ht,"Again, just want to tag on that I do believe there are real, niche problems to be solved with llms even at their current level of progress, so wanted to preface so I don’t sound like I’m being like intentionally antagonistic to your idea or anything, quite the opposite. I’ve had had some success and made a lot of duds when testing and deploying AI/LLM solutions for non or semi-technical SMEs in enterprise orgs, so when I read your idea, I recall a lot of those learnings.To me, the communication gap you are looking at is the like, 20% problem that requires 80% of the effort to solve. It’s one of those permutative problems that when solved destroys agility and flexibility of organizations and when pushed all the way in the other direction of giving everyone free reign and no direction can make other orgs look like a barrel of monkeys. So all that preface is to say tools that presuppose that you will be able to solve knowledge transfer between more than like 3 layers of a business of how information passes through competency layers (ex in my prev. comment) is a cursed problem. Because of that, I see problems with a tool that suggests that a Director can cross 5+ competence layers and genuinely get what they need, because to be completely clear: While data is served at a wide scale to many ICs and SMEs, the general purpose of all data is to help teams inform leaders, because all of that data is meant for those teams to make better decisions, and to then show data of improvement to the leaders. So for a tool to cut across all of this and save money or time or both, you would need to create a tool that solve all of these layers based off of a leader level prompt, which is really hard to do, and I think cost/success% wise outside of scope of existing tech. What I personally see as the clear line path for llm products are places where you can extend a sme 50% of the way in the direction of a couple of other domains that require proficiency and time spent learning. Tools that can take a great manager with ok tech chops, and solve the little simple ad-hoc tasks that you would originally bog down report devs / automation analysts in excel, idk the examples arent always great they are niche and reveal themselves through iteration. I think that smart LLM practitioners will not try to replace the human in the middle, not because its the right thing to do, but because its the financially prudent and performant thing to do, and they will support SMEs to become more proficient in adjacent domains. More so, at least, than was previously possible or expectable in the past. That will help solve the communication gap (a bit) in these orgs that prevent end to end technical implementations today.Sorry if this was too long! It’s a really interesting topic. I think good historical cues to take are to look at how no-code / low-code tools have started, been hyped, and where they ended up. Sometimes they do pretty good (Power Automate, Zapier), but they never have a “playing field levelling effect” across all layers of an org. Rn a Director could use Power Automate to already pull and transform their own data, but they won’t. Not to say those loops can’t get better and more accessible, that does seem to be a good use case for LLMs, I just think that it will more often than not require that someone knows something about the field they are using an LLM solution for, even if its an adjacent one (which is the more practical value prop of AI except for OpenAI who get to be the core chatbot, lucky them).",Gabarbogar,2025-07-11 06:29:13,1,dataengineering,t1_n2hi2uy,False,

n2jb97q,"Here's my list of why it's tough to teach yourself.**Figuring out what to learn**This is the number 1 problem. How do you know you are ""learning the basics""? Which YouTube videos are you watching? There's so much stuff, it's hard to pick. There's even a bit of procrastination. Some lay out plans that will take years to complete which means it won't get done. They will add an intro programming courses, maybe discrete math, maybe SQL, maybe operating systems. The fact is, most people never get much past the first course. Lesson: you don't have to plan that far ahead**Hard to make progress**It's tough to motivate yourself. For a handful of people, learning to program is (kind of) fun. For others, it's boring (yet, not easy). You have to learn syntax, e.g., a for-loop in C. You have to learn what you can do with that syntax, e.g., iterate through arrays.**You fail to learn control flow properly**If you're learning a procedure language, or a language that has procedural aspects, like Python, it becomes useful to emulate the computer, going one step at a time. You want to know what happens at every step. This low-level approach helps you understand how your program behaves.The human mind often skips steps, making assumptions about what stuff does. This is where it's helpful to learn a debugger, or do the poor man's equivalent and print ""debug"" statements.**There's not a lot of material on debugging**As a beginner, you're likely to write buggy code, ie, code that has mistakes. Fixing those bugs means determining *what* caused the bug, i.e., identifying the bug. Then, *fixing* the bug.For as much time as a beginner spends learning material, surprisingly little covers debugging.**There's a lot of advice**Perhaps the most common one is ""build projects"". Here's the thinking behind that approach. Beginners sometimes learn from tutorials. However, many tutorials are too advanced for beginners. Worse than that, they tell you *what* to do, but not *why*.You might wonder why they don't explain things. After all, don't learners want to learn? Here's the problem. How do you know how much the person watching your tutorial knows? If you can barely program, then you'll spend time talking about programming basics, and the part about building what you're building is now a fraction of the tutorial.Even if you know programming basics, it's still not enough. For example, you might be following a tutorial on React (not recommended for beginners). It will tell you to do this and that for React, but not the *design* of React. What was the philosophy behind React? Why does it look the way it does (i.e., why Javascript)? Explaining how React does stuff takes time, and tutorials predominantly skip over it, and jump into using it. These tutorials fail to show you the big picture. Instead, you're in the weeds (stuck in the minute details).Some beginners begin jumping from one tutorial to another, building stuff, but not understanding what they are building nor how to change what they are building.This leads to the common advice *build a project*. Here's my beef with that approach. You need to learn basics first. You need to learn basic syntax, control flow. You need a mental model of what the computer is doing. You need basic debugging skills. You need to do small exercises to help you learn, say, for-loops.That part, to many, is boring. The other complaint I have is you're asked ""find something you're passionate about"". Most beginners have a hard time identifying what they want to build, or they want to build something far too sophisticated, like a 3D game. They struggle with coding tic-tac-toe, and that's far too boring to be fun.The analogy I typically give is learning a foreign language. There are two popular approaches. The academic approach teaches it like an English teacher teaches English, i.e., it's about grammar. The other approach is to learn phrases. The second way is meant to avoid long hours of learning a language's grammar so you can take a vacation somewhere and get by with little knowledge of the language.I liken the second approach to building a project. It only works if the following happen: you have a reasonable sized project (can be hard), you figure out what you need (also, can be hard), you find what you need (also hard). The driving motivation is you're building something you can use. A programming exercise doesn't do that, but I feel it's a necessary prerequisite.Still, some can manage to learn enough of a language by searching for what they need. But the part they leave out is how they search for what they need. They tell you to build a project, but then no one ever shows you how they build the project. I suspect if they showed the steps, a beginner would say ""but how did you know to do that?"". It requires search skills (or you could capitulate and let the LLM do all the work, but then you're not really learning).**Staying motivated**Many beginners burn out. Or they procrastinate and play video games (or something else) or they have family issues that require their time. With no one to motivate you but yourself, many quit after a month or two. It's not fun. It's not easy. The concepts are too hard. It seems like it will take forever to do something simple. There's so much material out there.**TLDR**Many things contribute to self-teaching being a challenge.",CodeTinkerer,2025-07-11 12:12:49,35,learnprogramming,t3_1lx0f13,False,

X hobbits begin 'sick'. Each day, any healthy hobbit travels to visit another hobbit. If a healthy hobbit visits a sick hobbit, the healthy hobbit becomes sick. At the end of the day, all sick hobbits are removed. On average, how many hobbits will become sick? On average, how long will the contagion last, how many days?""Once implemented, then vary it up by changing how many hobbits are visited per day, how long the sick hobbits stay around (maybe more than one day).

To do projects, you need to start worrying about system design, modularity, testing, and more advanced debugging.

I learned programming by opening Excel, entering the VBA editor, and trying to get it to select a cell. Once I figured that out, I worked on changing the cell contents. Before I knew it, I’d built a VBA-based invoicing system, from the ground up, one step at a time. Right now, I’m learning procedural geometry in GDScript. I started with making a triangle. Then I made an icosahedron. Then I made an icosphere. Next I’m going to make a hexsphere.

The advantage here is that you could use a template engine like Jinja2 to serve dynamic content. The old TurboGears framework (yes I'm that old), Flask, or Django are commonly used with python, PHP is another commonly used one using the Laravel framework for example.2. API driven, here you serve endpoints (routes) with a web server and various methods just like with the server side rendering but instead of serving HTML you serve some other machine readable media formats like JSON, JSON-RPC, XML, etc. You then combine the ""backend"" with a frontend website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that calls your backend routes and then utilises that data to change the front end.

n25v8on,"You're asking more questions than you think. 1.) Tech is extremely competitive. Many factors contribute to this. It used to be that tech seemed such a brain-dead obvious bet for a lucrative career that it seemed foolish *not* to attempt some sort of STEM career. This means that you can have a CS degree, several fullstack apps in your portfolio, and are able to steamroll the LeetCode 150 and not even get interviews. The constant rejection of any job search process is soul sucking, but the energy that goes into the ground level for software development makes the search a really special journey into feelings of worthlessness.2.) Gaming is the worst part of tech. That's not even discussing the wild freefall the AAA side of the industry is experiencing. The reason is because gaming is a prestige position. No matter what happens, folks like you are gonna say, ""I don't care. I want to make games."" Because games are awesome. Since the line to work on projects is out the door, management can pay less and work their talent harder. A normal tech job outside of start-ups can give a really good work/life balance, even more so if you land a remote position. That is considerably less likely for a similar position at a gaming company. Call it crunch or ""Bioware magic,"" but those companies you dream of working for know about your dreams, for better or worse. 3.) As game projects increase in scale, distribution of labor gets more distinct. You aren't ""programming a game,"" you're ""responsible for the flow of the inventory system but not the menu system itself or the actual UI of the system."" This isn't a bad thing. It's just how the sausage is made. But it can take away some of the razzle-dazzle of ""making a game."" 4.) This is an incredible time to work in a small group or going yolo solo. Unreal Engine is free, and blueprints make it a lot more accessible than raw-dogging C++. Unity is free (but don't use Unity). Godot is free. Phaser3 is free. YouTube U is free. Check out /r/gamedev and r/IndieDev. There are posts on those forums every other day from folks who are further than you in this process asking themselves, ""Am I wasting my time?"" And the answers may be illuminating. 5.) Game dev just isn't something you should be going into for love of the game if you want to make money. If you shift to the most lucrative corners of making games, you will bleed out your love, and if you focus hard on making projects of love, you won't have as much money or as much help (co-workers), and it's an uphill battle to be noticed. Undertale is the exception. Balatro is the exception. Vampire Survivors is the exception. I hope you're an exception.... but you'll probably need a day job or a rich spouse/parent. 6.) Learning to program is worth it as a skill on its own, I truly believe that. I LOVE that I can have an idea, think about how to make it, and just... make it. It's a really, really fun superpower. It was also really hard won. Understanding how all the pipes fit together beneath the user level is incredibly useful. I think everyone should at least learn to build and deploy a CRUD app without AI so they can just understand what the hell is happening.

Clean Code had a lot of great ideas to course-correct.However, the example code could have been better chosen. A lot of the example code constructs HTML from strings, which was common at the time but seems really dated now because we all use templating libraries for that which are way cleaner and more general-purpose.In addition, the book goes into gnarly details of mocking in Java and a lot of that content is totally out-of-date today.I'd recommend this book instead:The Art of Readable Code: Simple and Practical Techniques for Writing Better Code[https://www.amazon.com/Art-Readable-Code-Practical-Techniques/dp/0596802293](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Readable-Code-Practical-Techniques/dp/0596802293)I think it's designed to be more timeless and applies to lots of different languages and types of code.",dmazzoni,2025-07-11 19:17:04,99,learnprogramming,t3_1lxf5el,False,

If you're spending a bunch of time learning a little bit about a lot of different languages, then you'll never build up your depth.

In whatever language you've chosen, learn as many built-in functions (and operators, syntax, etc.) in that language as you can (with the theoretical goal of learning all of them). New programmers often make things harder than they need to be on themselves, because they don't realize all of the tools that the language offers (and they try to write extra utilities themselves, or reach for code from the Internet or third-party packages, when the language already offers a helpful tool built-in).3. Just like how when you're at the gym, you don't do each exercise only once and move on to a new exercise, apply the same approach to coding. Once you get your code working, start over from a completely blank slate, and try to do it again. See if you can look up even a *little* less than you needed to look up last time, or if you run into a little bit fewer bugs than you did last time.

So your goal, if you want to make a living, is to get good enough to do the stuff that is too hard for AI to do (well).Can you get to that skill level without university? Sure, if you're motivated and intelligent and want to put a lot of hours in. University is still the most straightforward way though.

There are lots of ways to solve this problem, and many of the solutions aren't ""clever"" but they're just as good. It's far more important to come up with a good solution than to come up with a clever one.* Second, nobody sees a problem like that and just immediately knows the solution. You have to figure it out. Figuring it out might mean experimenting, trial and error, going back over things you learned before, going down dead ends, taking a break and coming back to it later, or even asking for a tiny hint here on r/learnprogrammingThe most important thing is that you need to persevere longer and not just peek at the answer. It might take you an hour, it might take you a week. But if you force yourself to keep trying until you get it, you WILL get better.On the flip side, if you give up and look at the answer, you will never learn to code.Go back and try again. Don't expect your solution to look anything like that solution. Don't aim for any specific length. It might be 3 lines of code, it might be 30 lines of code.

n1r8qyy,"Honest programming is about divide and conquer. To print your pyramid, you just need to go step by step.something like: for each line print_lineThen how do you print a single line ? Well there a bunch of space before, a bunch of ""o"" in the middle and then we go to next line so the code become: for each line print_spaces(numbers of spaces) print_stars(numbers of o)Now can you do print\_spaces and print stars ? Well we just need to repeat the same stuff the specified number of time, something like: line = """" repeat for numbers of spaces line = line + "" "" repeat for numbers of o line = line + ""*"" print lineBut to be more concise, we could write as well: line = repeat("" "", number of spaces) + repeat(""o"", number of o) print linewhere repeat would repeat the string the number of time we want. That's not so different than line = "" "".repeat(number of spaces) + ""o"".repeat(number of o)or even: print "" "".repeat(number of spaces) + ""o"".repeat(number of o)Now how many number of stars we have per line ? From the solution it's: Math.floor((i * 2 - 1 - row) / 2)To really get it, we would need to understand what i and row are as well as floor. But you can likely come with you own way to count the spaces.From your pyramid, to me it look like there zero space on the bottom pyramid and 1 the one before, then 2, then 3. So it like the (max line number) - (current line number) - 1 So the whole for me would be for I in range(0, max_line - 1) num_spaces = I + 1 num_o = max_line - I - 1 print ("" "".repeat(num_spaces) + ""o"".repeat(num_o) or for I in range(0, max_line - 1) print ("" "".repeat(I+1) + ""o"".repeat(max_line - I - 1) Anyway, what I try to explain to you that you go step by step, trying to solve a complex problem by dividing it in smaller problems and solve each sub problem one at a time.It the same even for the Math.floor method you would normally have constructed it step by step.And yes maybe repeat was introduced too fast in their example of maybe, the Math.floor was not well introduced.

Because you've put that in quotation marks.Sadly creativity was always or has become almost a meme, because (as the other posts confirm indirectly) it sounds like some kind of superpower for almost anything, from programming and maths (""multiple way to solve a problem"") till songwriting and visual artwork (doesn't even need any argument for those...does it?).But actually creativity is something so abstract that one could write philosophical essays about it (no irony here). And in my experience most jobs, even the more intellectual ones (or maybe especially those) have the cliché that they give you freedom of how-to-do-this-task, no monotony but possibility to be even creative, and so on.My experience is that sure some people are lucky and get their visions and wishes related to their job satisfied and most things are as great as they expected, but that's unfortunately more exception than a rule...I studied chemistry for few years and how did I learn for maths, physics, chemistry modules etc.? By f-ing REPEATING various catalogs of ""questions/tasks that can be asked in the exam"". That's frustrating and I'd hope less people would have to work and especially to learn this way (because it's one of the heaviest turn-offs imo).Before I drift off into more pessimistic stuff, one thing I can tell you as a (hobby-)musician and occassional painter that aside from let's say 0.1% of the population who have superpowers, top genetics and were raised very effective & without any damages, creativity is a bit like natural mutual attraction (""love"") - you can't enforce it. Still you want to achieve it, how you should do that?By doing certain activities, which you have to find out for yourself, what fits for you somehow, the newer and the more they differ from each other, the better. Just try things out you wanted to f.e.. You will gain experience, expand your conciousness (literally & still in a natural way), the more contrasts you can gather and experience, the better. Nothing is true, everything is permitted!And by automatically building new associative nodes & connections in your neural system / ""soul"" through this gathering of new experiences, by natural passive (""background-process""-)learning you will already make one step after the other on the way to more creativity.

However, code in the real world has to be constantly maintained by several developers. The piece of code that you wrote today should still be understandable to you when you read it 6 months from now (and you've forgotten all about it) and understandable by your teammate who has never worked in that part of the code and maybe has never even met you.So your plain loop solution would still be good, and some might argue even ""better"" than the clever single liner.",plastikmissile,2025-07-07 07:29:18,3,learnprogramming,t3_1ltkhbx,False,
n1rvq9h,"> [Code snippet of cool mathy looking formula]> ... I think I couldn't have discovered this answer myself. I don't think I would have written it that way either. But it's rarely (i.e. almost never) important to have the ""perfect mathematical solution"" to a given problem, even assuming one exists.For this particular problem, I would personally look at the pattern first. How many spaces do you need to print at each row, if the pyramid has a height of 4? Do it manually first in a text editor: 3, 2, 1, 0. Now, what if it has a height of 5? Manually in a text editor: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.Now do the same for how many ""o""s you need to print. That one is a little easier. It always starts at 1 and then it always advances by 2, to count out all the odd numbers until the pyramid is done: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ....So in this situation I would say that the ""goold ol' C-style for loop"" is easier to understand in this situation. Luckily JavaScript supports that style of loop: // Pretend that height comes from the user. let height = 4; // Starting out the pyramid with an initial \n so that it looks // nicer inside the JS Console. let pyramid = ""\n""; let ohs = 1; for (let spaces = height-1; spaces >= 0; spaces--, ohs += 2) { pyramid += "" "".repeat(spaces) + ""o"".repeat(ohs) + ""\n""; } console.log(pyramid);Some people won't like that style and will prefer a more ""functional"" or ""mathematically correct"" style. But at the end of the day your job is to solve whatever problem you have, in a way that is easy for you to understand and which is fast enough. The above solution is perhaps less ""elegant"" but it gets the job done and it's usually easier to debug code like that than to debug code which is too much in a functional ""mathematical"" style.",chaotic_thought,2025-07-07 08:15:48,2,learnprogramming,t3_1ltkhbx,False,

Compare your code, without ego, to others' code. Compare approaches. Decide what works best. 4. When making a decision or a trade-off (for example to make a function static or not, or to use a particular data structure), explain to yourself why you are making the decision that way.

C is a bit unforgiving, it totally lets you shoot yourself in the foot and C++ lets you do the same, except that your entire leg is gone afterwards.Beware of any mention, that C++ and C# are just supersets of C. That might have been true very very early on, but both have diverged from C quite a bit, some things just work differently.Find a resource, that teaches C with a proper focus on how to write secure code, having to debug undefined Behaviour, memory leaks and segfaults is no fun if you just came from python. Personally I like the book ""Effective C"" by Robert C Seacord. Despite the name, (effective LANGUAGE usually means advanced in a lot of programming books) it is written for beginners, but it is well written, up to date and doesn't make stupid errors where the example code won't even compile (surprisingly common).Then, once you have a grip on the language, implement various algorithms, like the problems on [projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net), reading and processing some files, playing with raylib (since you came from gamedev with godot). The best way to learn C is writing programs in C, but they need to be small self contained things that compile cleanly and pass through valgrind cleanly. But most importantly, you need to understand various concepts of C first, otherwise the compiler will be like a girlfriend you forget to feed.If you have a sound understanding of computer science, you might read the K&R book, but it is written for seasoned programmers that just don't know C, yet. It is from a time when Programmers already went through college and might had a PhD or a Master at minimum, home computers and self-taught coders weren't really a thing yet. It assumes that you know how computers work, potentially already have programmed in some form of assembly. It's more of a historic document than a valid learning resource.

While people who are starting new projects from scratch might be more likely to use Rust now, most existing C++ projects are not going to rewrite.Even places that use Rust for all new code use a lot of code written in other languages. Rust programs often call into libraries written in C, C++, and other languages, and sometimes you'll need to read, debug, or modify that code too. So knowing C++ is pretty useful.Another reason is that experiencing the flaws of C++ will help Rust make a lot more sense. Rust was designed in particular because it just wasn't possible to write memory-safe code in C++.

Memory stays constant and predictable unless you create new objects manually.However, in case of recursion, each function call gets **its own stack frame** in the call stack.

You have to use a pointer. Arrays have never become full first-class values in C. You also can't assign one array to another: int x[2]; int y[2]; x = y;The reason, 50 years ago, was that it would have required emitting too many assembly language instructions from that one statement (and passing a large array as a value can overflow your stack); the restriction has never been lifted because `strcpy` and `memcpy` work better for most people.*As for why it's a pointer to the first character of the string and not to the string: pointers in C are designed to be the interface to arrays. They're how you access any element of an array, any time you do. An array, when used as a value, is always converted to a pointer to its first element; adding (or subtracting) an integer to a pointer moves it that many places through the array, and, of course dereferencing the result accesses the selected element.`x[i]` is syntax sugar for `*(x + i)`, which means (assuming `x` is an array): take a pointer to the first element of `x`, move that pointer (hopefully forward) `i` positions, then get the element at that location.So once you have a pointer into an array, you can access the whole array from there.* Citation needed, according to anyone who's ever passed the wrong length to `memcpy` and smashed the return address on the call stack.

n218if7,"Sorry if this is not what you're looking for but here's a brief summary using C as an example because it is kinda the base and most other languages like java and python run by doing something with C.First, computers have CPUs, they are the things doing the instructions your code makes. Code and CPU instructions aren't a one to one mapping, the way a language works is it must be translated to CPU instructions. In the case of C the thing that does this is called a compiler. CPU instructions are whats known as binary code. Assembly language is a CPU specific programming language that takes CPU binary code and puts labels on specific binary strings that mean do this thing. For example ADD. CPUs also have access to registers, which just hold a few bytes of values, for example a 32 bit machine 4 bytes 64 8 bytes, etc. These registers are what the CPU uses to do math with. So ADD register1, register2 would take the sum of these two numbers and put it into register 1. Assembly is a 1:1 mapping with that architectures binary, meaning if you learn to understand it you can write code that tells the CPU exactly what to do. C is an abstraction on assembly, meaning that it let's you write code, the compiler does something, then you get an assembly file. For your use case you don't need to know how this file works, but the general theory is pretty simple, basically it builds a stack, which is just like a pile of variables, and the compiler writes the assembly in a way that instead of variable int x, it's base of the stack + 10 bytes or something. And that is how it knows where x lives. But again you don't need to know this right now. What you need to know is that when you compile C code, you get an executable, a file you can run directly in the command line, or just run like any other windows exe or other executable I forget the mac and linux extensions. You can do this in command line or depending on the code treat the executable like it's own app.Python is a little different. Python itself is a language built in C. Python does not compile into an executable, python is an executable. When you click run, all it does is the command python3 yourfilename.py. python3 is an assembly file that opens the file yourfilename.py, reads what you wrote, and then figures out what to do with the text and updates things accordingly. You CAN compile python, but it's not popular, not efficient and kinda weird.

In that case, you'll have to *think* about how to solve the problem you're faced with. And there is always a possibility of making a mistake in your thinking. Those are the mistakes that tests can help you catch.To use your example of input validation: Maybe you have a set of ideas in your head about what kinds of inputs are valid, and what inputs are invalid. And maybe you write a regex that matches only valid inputs. The test exists to make sure you wrote that regex correctly, so that its behavior matches what you had in mind.(You could argue that if the regex is wrong, you'll notice the problem just by running the code and experimenting with it. Doing this kind of interactive testing is good, but on its own, it's a very unreliable and error-prone way of testing. Writing the tests down in an automated test suite helps you make sure you didn't miss anything. And most importantly, it tells you if a later change introduces a new bug, without you having to manually test every single feature every time you touch the code.)Of course it's possible you'll make a mistake in the tests too.

Semantics can vary.Edit:I also like the answer in the reddit thread someone else linked that mutexs can be reentrant. Reentrancy doesnt really make sense for semaphores.The top answer talks more about the fact that semaphores are built for managing concurrent access to a pool of resources (they store a counter for how many ""resources"" are available), where as mutexes are about critical sections. For clean code, you should really use these constructs for only the associated purpose above, even if you can use the other, since the names ""semaphore"" and ""mutex"" come with these connotations.Additionally, just sticking to using them for these purposes will basically automatically help you avoid problems with differences in reentrancy and and who can call up()/unlock().",TheBlasterMaster,2025-07-09 06:24:03,2,learnprogramming,t3_1lv13v4,False,

You're lucky if you end up at a startup that has some halway decent dev processes in place.But at a large company, process is key. There are very strict best practices in place. There's very strict change management, very strict approvals, very strict boundaries of responsibility, etc, etc, etc. They're simply too large to let devs just cowboy code some stuff into prod that gets introduced to their millions of users right away. They also have internal and external audits to think about, where they're straight up auditing *the process*. If your processes aren't good, you're going to fail an audit, and failing an external audit can have a significant negative impact on the company and its clients.All companies will feel slow compared to startups. Not just big tech. Startups are trying to get their code and product out into the world as fast as humanly possible.

A short downtime can easily lose 6-7 figures for them, whereas a startup DGAF about downtime. The benefit of releasing code quickly outweights whatever negative would come from prod issues.One thing that will be very valuable for *you* from a career-growth perspective is seeing what heavy-process looks like. Look at what this company is doing, how it differs from the startup world, what the pros/cons are, etc. That gives you multiple perspectives to view any given problem from in the future.

I have a very strong resume, I was able to secure a couple referrals from my network.

I was completely caught off guard how awful this last 6-7 months would be. At first, I was like it's just rust and we'll get other chances. I went on to fail A LOT of interviews.I actually have had 21 different positions that have made it to technical rounds. Of those 21, I got 2 offers and 3 are in progress (plus a 22nd chance round 2 this week for a remote job!)It's been absolutely miserable. Some jobs were actually laterals or upgrades in pay / situation, some even remote. Most of these jobs though are pretty sizeable paycuts + bad commutes and I wasn't good enough for them.I still have a few interviews / leads building up so I'll keep taking them until I actually start my new job, but man I can't wait for this to be over.

I do find they tend to skew NYC and SF based roles though. - When applying, if there's a section for ""skills"" that's fill-in-the-blank, go back to the job description and make sure to list any skill you find there that you have. If it's for a specific tech but you know a related one, go ahead and put down the specific one. One of my biggest annoyances is recruiters not believing that, for instance, your Postgres skills are not transferable to MySQL. Or express.js vs fastify. Or React vs Vue etc. If they're that rigid and don't understand what it is an actual engineer brings to the table, don't feel bad about it.I applied to the exact same job twice about a month apart, once without doing any of this and then after doing all of this.

It creates this warped perception where it seems like everyone's struggling when really it's just that the struggling voices are the loudest ones.I started Metana in 2022 when everyone was saying 'tech is dead' and 'bootcamps don't work' yet we've hit $1M ARR because companies still need good developers.

Not just another todo app, but something that solves a real problem you care about. Then write about your process, document your learning, show your thinking. Employers care way more about how you approach problems than your school ranking.Also, you mentioned 3 internships, that's actually solid experience.

n2ls3dg,"It seems like you are pretty self-aware and you've identified a gap in your interview skills compared to what a lot of the market wants. So sure, while there are a lot of valid criticisms about this particular type of interview, it makes sense to suck it up and try to get reasonably good that them. Personally I think leetcode problems are somewhat fun to solve and they're at least a semi-standardized interview format which is better than not knowing what you're walking into. But it's absolutely annoying to have to prepare for something that doesn't really align with the day to day job. Not every company asks them. Most of the higher paying ones do though.Personally I'd advise against mindless grinding unless it's a company that kind of expects that (e.g. one that rhymes with feta). Go through a categorized list of problems, try to figure out any gaps you might have and study those concepts. Then come back and build a muscle memory for that type of problem.Or... you can just keep going until you find a company that doesn't ask them.>During that time I would say about half was hands on engineering (coding, submitting or reviewing PRs) and half on architecture/leadership.> There are many factors here--I am self taught--and I discovered have more test anxiety than I realized. Also, these ""problems"" are often just little puzzles that I've rarely if ever seen in my 25 years of software engineering, so I am simply rusty at solving them in the allotted time. My problem solving may also follow a non-traditional sequence that the interviewer is simply not used to seeing (like, incorrect ""order of operations"" even though I solve the problem).It's easy to have a gap between what you're capable of doing and what you're capable of showing others you can do in an interview. You pretty much need a muscle memory for coding (and realistically specifically for these type of problems) to show your chops in a 30-60 min interview. You likely need to build that up even if you could probably solve the exact same problem without the time pressure. 5 min reading through docs to refresh your memory on how the python heapq module works is 5 min you might need in the end.I get interview anxiety too and I almost always bomb the first 2-3 interviews during a job search regardless of preparation.

If you're expected to push through the burn out or get pipped out, you may want to start looking for a job with better wlb and take the pay cut. There's only a special type of person that can go ham literally 100% of the time.But, if you are already in a position where you can decide to put up some boundaries when needed then you NEED to do it asap. For now: Since you are already burned out, you have to stop working at the end of the day AND learn how to turn off your work brain when you do. It is a skill and it takes practice. It's like meditation. When you catch yourself doing a work thought you need to intentionally and consciously think about something else. If that means you go do something else or change your physical location then that's what you do. You need to stop thinking about work in order to recover from work.Once youve already crossed over into being burned out, it may take some time (weeks or months depending on how bad the burnout is) for better boundaries to start making you feel better. But in my experience it does eventually happen. Just remember for the future that you need to be vigilant about the signs that you're working too much.

Each class I'm working on right now, I know approximately what it needs to do in my grand scheme of things, and usually write unit tests as I go. Usually at any point in my project I can either build my code and run the tests to verify that everything I've built so far builds and works as expected or I'm within an hour or two of being able to do so. There is no ""I'm going to work 3 months on this before I know anything about whether or not it works.""The projects you see in CS are not really the projects you'll see out in the industry. They've probably already told you that most software projects are maintenance. You'll very rarely ever see new design, just because on average most projects' lifecycle is 80-90% maintenance. The skill of reading someone else's code and understanding what they're trying to accomplish is not really something I picked up in CS. I had to learn that as I go. I'm not saying wait and see what industry jobs are like if you don't like CS, I'm just saying don't expect anything you do to look very much like anything you've been doing.They may also have told you that programming languages are as much for communicating with engineers as it is with computers. They didn't go into a great deal of detail about that when I was in school, but a decade after I got out of school a computer program was like a book for me. I can read it and I can tell you things about what the guy who wrote it was thinking. Probably things not even he was really aware of. Comes in handy, and it kind of feels like a superpower when you get good at it. Not saying you should do anything in particular except keep that in mind if you make a career out of this.If you enjoy doing this for a living, there is never an end state. It's impossible to know everything that there is to know about computers at the moment, and has been since the '80's. There's a lot of arrogance in the field because a lot of people seem to think that they do know everything there is to know, but it's far more important to have a pretty solid idea about what you don't know. At least as it pertains to what you're doing right now. The landscape is pretty much infinite here, and far more similar to the math landscape than I realized up until surprisingly recently. You probably can find something to explore there that's interesting to you. How easy that is or whether you even want to try is of course entirely up to you.Whatever you decide to do, *you* ultimately set the direction in your career. This is as true now in your academic career as it is in your professional one. You can decide to stay in academia somewhere and explore the frontiers or old problems there. You can go off to the industry and solve math problems for stabilizing fusion reactors or something. You can go grind out enterprise communication code at some company and probably make a lot of money. Long's as you have the rent by Friday it doesn't really matter all that much. But you decide what you're going to do with your life, or you can try to float through it without much of a plan at all. I think a lot of people try to do that.

Maybe all paths do, but if I end up regretting anything at least I was the one who decided to go that way.Hope you find a direction you like.

That is a way to make the WFH day worse than an office day.* Wake up at the same time as you would going to the office. It's tempting to wake up at like 9 AM. Don't.* Hooray! You have just freed up a block of time you can use to do whatever you want instead of walking to the office and sitting in a bus. I usually use it to start my morning slow. I wake up, go take a shower, put on fresh clothes, go prepare a real breakfast, and then eventually get to work. No rush. I am trying to wake up a little easier and actually fit more into this. Like, if I am able to get up earlier than usual on the WFH days, I could probably get the right temperature for a quick run and bike ride before the usual routine.* I have time flexibility. If I wake up early and I don't feel like doing the full morning routine, I just do a minimal one, get to work early, and call it a day early. The only requirement we have for WFH days is that there are two small blocks of time (1-2 hours each) where you **must** be available to answer a call. As long as you are available to answer a call during those two blocks, nobody really cares how you organize your time.* Set boundaries with extreme precision. It's very easy both to overwork yourself and work through your lunch break, and do the opposite - just go do something else and take an extra long break that ends up biting you. I try to use timers and alarms.* If possible, I try to get out of the house right after work. Quick walk, going to some event or gathering with friends, run some errands, etc. I find it's beneficial if you ""simulate"" the same separation rituals you get from an office day, except they are not time completely thrown into the garbage, but time slots for things that are good for you, or tasks that you should make anyway.Extra goated golden bonus tip:* If I want to take a break, instead of just going to get a coffee and use my phone or talk to people a bit as I'd do in the office, I do a quick errands break. Like, I do a part of an house chore I need to make. Load up and unload the dishwasher, clean the kitchen, something like that. This has two benefits: 1) it keeps you active and away from your screen, which is the best way to get a break. 2), when done consistently, it frees up a surprising amount of free time.

Forming genuine relationships with people.It's not forming fake relationships where the sole purpose you're speaking is to use them to get you a job.Tech meetups are common suggestions for ""networking"", but that's not because it's a place people go to connect on LinkedIn. It's because it's a place where people that all have a shared interest go to do that shared interest together. When you do that, you *make friends* with those people. When they're your friends, they're now in your network.You could go to a rock climbing meetup and it would have the exact same effect. You could go to your local dive bar and make friends with John Doe over a night of heavy drinking. It doesn't matter if John Doe is in tech or not, all that matters is that John Doe *has a job*. Anyone at a company can refer people to any position.

n1tfr4e,"Congrats.Your first week is usually onboarding., depending on company you either talk to your manager to decide how you're first few weeks will look like or you take an onboarding course. It varies by company. But in the end there should be an onboarding of how to build, test, etc.Before any of that, your first day will likely be signing up for benefits (insurances), payroll, etc. This shoudl be the absolute first thing you do so you get your money in the bank and not through a check mailed to you.Get your W-4 completed (takes like 5 minutes tops). Im not a financial adviser in any way but if you get RSUs, i'd suggest having them take a certain amount extra per check to account for the RSUs when you start to get them. I got burned by this the fist time I got RSUs. Because tehy are considered bonus they are taxed differently so I ended up owing a good amount to the IRS my first year. Ideally I try to have them take 100 per check to account for that.Sign up for any 401k accounts too. Your future self will thank you later. Put as much as you think is fair, experts suggest 12-15% a year.As for the job. Your first week is usually onboarding and then you get small tasks and build up confidence in the code. Ask your manager when he expects you to start getting bigger tasks. If he/she says in 3 months, try to get ahead of everything. If they say that the first week they only expect you to run tests and build, try to get that doen within the first few days and then by thursday tell them you are done and if you can at least look at the first task to get an idea of where to start.Ask questions, dont be afraid to reach out to people. it's scary at first but passive devs are the ones that get booted. If you start doing it before your manager has to say it, your manager will thank you. Managers have so much on their plate so they love devs who they dont ahve to say anything to, they just trust the dev will always be ahead of the pack. So if your manager is hoping to get you a task after 3 months, try to be ready at the 2nd month. Better to have him tell you to slow down then having to tell you to hurry up. Edit: also just to add. To emphasive the dont be a passive dev, report what you do. You have to play a game to a certain level. I once had a seniro dev tell me that it is better to do 2 tasks and report it during stand up and create dialogue about it (take ove rthe screen and show results for example, ask questions about being stuck, etc) than it is to do 10 tasks and just make simple 1 comment about progress that doesnt create discussion. Being stuck on the same task that should've taken a few days, but you are just stuck for weeks and dont say anything in stand up is a huge turnoff. Also find a mentor or senior friend you can do work with at a certain point. Someone who will hype you up to the manager and you can work along side with. At a certain point if you can be the guy who gets name-called during stand up, that's a plus. Even in meetings wher eyou are not there.

If done regularly, it wouldnt take more than 20 minutes to get the CD, transfer it go through protocols and put it in the secure network. But if you let it add up, it would exponentially be slower and slower. One time we had to transfer some major data coming in from an even higher network that was barely used but people started to use it more as the project was winding down. We realized that the higher network just was never updated so we had to routinely update it with huge transfers. I put the CD in, it took me half days work to do it. Thankfully one of the Product owners ntocied in the first week it was taking me forever so he told me he had a secure hard drive that I could use whenever I needed to transfer huge data and it cut my time down by so much.
