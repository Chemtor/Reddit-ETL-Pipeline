Photon, catalyst, etc. won’t do it for you. There is an enormous amount of electricity and money burning out there in unoptimized Spark jobs, where a traditionals RDBMS SQL shop was convinced they can unlock 20% performance by just migrating to Databricks, whereas with a little investment they could achive 10x+ faster and more efficient jobs.

OR do you want to just batch process with Hive/Tez where Parquet would also be fine but also ORC.If you have your data on prem, also also SANA and SQL Server...do you transfer every time all the data to the cloud?

nkc469e,"I did this at my last job, reluctantly. I was forced to do it as part of an initiative to surface metrics and data transformations back to end-users, and one of the engineers refused to use production data to test the dashboards; it HAD to be a fully separate env, hooked up exactly to the app's staging env. The rest of the company already had a full pipeline but tied to prod.I thought it was a waste of time and money when I was forced to do it because the environment was fully read-only. And after I finally completed the project I thought the same thing. The only good purpose of the separate envs was that it made it a little easier to test security, but it wasn't like that was particularly difficult. It would have been probably just as much work to set up a way to mock production data in localhost, and overall way more useful for the company.So, we got it working ultimately (separate Airflow deployments and separate Snowflake accounts), but it was a pain in the ass. I had a somewhat informal way of managing Snowflake account level changes as migrations / IaC, and setting it up perfectly still took a while. (This also corresponded with a company wide push to formalize migrations of all db's into a new software.) Then the Airflow instance, oh boy. You don't realize just how many assumptions you make about envs until you have to formalize the ability to make an arbitrary multiple number of them. I thought I knew, but I didn't. Oh, also, your staging and prod data will be different in painful ways. Like imagine a JSON field stored as a varchar, but the staging env has some bullshit that's not a JSON. Yep, that's one of many things that happens when you try to run your prod data pipelines on the app's staging environment.Overall, not worth it. The setup I had originally is very simple: there's local and there's prod on a single Snowflake account. When you run commands locally, you hit a separate database for writes and transforms that are handled by the env vars. All reads are exactly from the prod data. All developers have full permissions in the local or dev or whatever you want to call them environments. There were also simple utils to help clone prod into dev for easy development.Moving to the multi env setup was not only months of my life neither me nor the company is getting back, but due to how MWAA works, it significantly increased the costs of the data platform.Shortly after I left, the engineer who wanted this colossal waste of time and money also left. Or maybe he was forced out. Cool.Honestly, at the point you're doing this sort of thing to support multi tenancy across genuine staging/prod envs, my advice is to scrap Airflow and Snowflake entirely. Go to something like Clickhouse and use materialized views to manage your pipelines so it's orchestration free.I also want to note another thing. Not a single internal data end user cared about this. This came from a single frontend app developer and was supported by upper mgmt because it sounds good on paper if you're a conventional SWE. Even though it's completely divorced from how internal data consumers use and contribute to data pipelines. What data scientists do is they train models and do analysis on prod data. They don't care about the developers' staging data because it doesn't represent or cover real usage. As you note in your post, this seems to be what they want to do, right? Except now you're finessing with data shares instead of just some simple IAM and permissions.Lastly, the place I left to, I setup their entire data infrastructure. I'm still on exactly ""local"" and ""prod"" in one Snowflake account, and I have no desire to ever change this. Actually, we do have a ""staging"" env for testing full CRUD being run against our OLAP db in the app's actual staging env. What it is, is: a clone of the prod db, cloned weekly, so that state is preserved within testing sessions but it also up to date with prod. Also, we do have a way to mock user sessions in our app's staging env. That works well enough! I will literally write javascript dashboards myself, or migrate to an entirely separate DB and delete our Airflow pipelines and switch to materialized views, before I spin up multiple envs to assist someone who won't put up with a minor inconvenience for them at the expense of multiple months of my own time.",riv3rtrip,2025-10-19 17:08:46,9,dataengineering,t3_1oajs0h,False,

If you don't consider how you want to manage Infrastructure in this new world you get to great my advice would be look at a reference architecture for a lake house on AWS. Ask your company to send you to re:Invent in December take hands onlabs for building data lakes (avoid any sales sessions just do hands on labs) you will come out with a better idea of what to do. Also take a BASIC terraform course. It will make everything better. It will be confusing at first but ChatGPT/Claude will get you most of the way there. AWS + Python gives you A LOT of options. IMO DBT is kinda shitty. SQL ETL's are ass, because you cannot really unit test these things effectively. Focus more on python (it will get you 90% of what you need for most use cases) look at serverless event driven architectures, less work less thinking long term but you need to monitor that shit and make sure the SPICE FLOWS! Postgres is fine. Your use cases determine your data persistence. If you don't have a lot of data don't over complicate shit use and RDBMS + Python, geter done.2. look back at 1. I personally don't think much of DEs that focused on DBT or Databricks they usually don't know much....sorry to say that but it's the truth. I want coders. I want people who understand distributed systems. I don't care if people know Redshift of Snowflake as long as they understand what those systems are...MPPs. That's abstracted from most DEs. It means Sr folks have to learn ya some shit about an MPP like redshift and snowflake both great infra but they cost and abstract aspects of what's going on under the hood. They are not a golden hammer. Look at the use cases. Postgres on aurora can bang out A LOT of DE use cases. Don't buy a destroyer class ship to manage bass fishing :Db. pyspark is a good thing to pick up. Understand when you want a python script v a pyspark script to run a job. Understand shit like Airflow and how you split compute from your orchestration layer. Airflow is not an ETL it's orchestration. ELT work and computer is done on other infra like an AWS lambda. As you go further focus on microservices, apis, event driven architectures stuff like that. c. AWS tools are legit DE tools you just gotta look at the right shit.

nkd37lf,"Airflow is popular because at the time it was released it was really the only game in town that supported proper orchestration (prior to that people were essentially firing off cronjobs on a scheduler and inventing their own locking / readiness mechanisms).However it's really showing its age nowadays and setting it up for local development is a huge PITA. Astronomer tries to make this better with its Astro CLI but it's still a sh\*t compared to Dagster.I have used Airflow in production since \~2017 but recently I had to evaluate Dagster and in my opinion it's lightyears ahead in most aspects, *particularly* local development. I would seriously consider it for future orchestration needs.In both cases - don't tie your logic to orchestration. Both systems will try to get you to implement your transforms within the system, but this just introduces a tight coupling. Implement your logic in something standalone that can be called by itself (eg package it into a Docker container that you can call with \`docker run\`) and then just orchestrate *that* from Airflow / Dagster.

nk2gmz0,"1. In the modern data world partitioning should be approached with the following mindset: read patterns (increasing read performance by partition pruning), data distribution i.e. your partitioning should make sense in terms of how you organize the data in files AND partitions (avoiding small files and data skew, but also creating enough optimal sized files so you can parallelize reading), and considering your deployment/compute sizing so you can actually take advantage of the things you can do in parallel and scale accordingly (again has to do with how you organize your data in files). Although partitioning is a tool you can also use to “group” and “label” your data, like you mentioned, - e.g. being able to reprocess a subset of your data based on a label (processing time) - I would discourage you from using it like this. You have other tools for this purpose that will not hurt performance in the long run. Use partitioning as intended: a tool to distribute your data to ensure performant reads and scalability.2. If you don’t need an immutable bronze data use a lakehouse format straight away like Iceberg and do updates/merge. Optimize for copy-on-write or merge-on-read based on the volume of your late or dupe data. Do proper table maintenance for healthy filesizes and valuable snapshots. (This equals to SCD type 1 btw)If you need the raw data, you can do CDC in an extra column or in a side table. Just like in a regular DWH. You trade downstream performance for history granularity. (This is SCD type 2+)Note: Iceberg/Delta/Hudi are gold because they bring SQL and data warehousing back to big data.3. Look at 1.For idempotency you can also implement watermarking or something with the snapshoting/tagging/branching features of your lakehouse format. This “metadata” can carry the same information that you want to implement with the “processing time” partitioning. These are all small things that can help you, but ultimately idempotency and deterministic behavior should be achieved on the data pipeline level with whatever tools you have.

From your BI tool's perspective this'll be as if there are denormalized tables, but when the tool queries these tables the view will be executed. * This works if your data is small, but it gets harder to maintain, debug, and scale for larger datasets.* The more maintainable alternative here is to build a ""data pipeline"": * The pipeline would get the raw data from the production systems, as well as any other external systems you need data from. * Builds data models using SQL and Python and persists them into the database. * Your BI tools then connects to the modeled tables instead. * This allows the queries to be more efficient and faster, since the data is pre-calculated. * This also makes analyzing this data easier in BI usecases. * The added benefit of this is that if you want to use a different BI tool tomorrow, or if you need to use this data in some other way than a BI tool, such as jupyter notebooks and python scripts, then the data is also usable for that.There are a bazillion different tools that allow you to build data pipelines. In your case, it could be as simple as starting with a few views on your Postgres database, and see how it works. Once you run into performance issues or any other trouble, you can consider persisting the data with a proper data pipeline.",karakanb,2025-10-15 11:01:49,47,dataengineering,t3_1o77b20,False,

nkf5ltf,"My ideas on demos have changed over the years. Keep in mind that Agile and the demo they talk about was not designed for data engineering, so you need to adapt. Showing how a pipeline now runs 20% faster, or how you’ve improved data accuracy by 30% is dry as hell and demos terribly. What demos well is actual apps (or web apps) and clicking through them showing shiny features and pictures.In my latest project my team is creating a data pipeline and suite of reports for a new product. Our stakeholders are regulators, so we don’t get to talk to them. We have internal product people that interface with them. One thing we have done is create a crude diagram of each of the models we are building in the DAG. If it was created in the past sprint I color them one way so they stand out. I don’t go into depth on what they do, the point here is for upper management, product, and others to see “oh there’s more green boxes than 2 weeks ago”. Pictures demo better than words, and this shows progress. Obviously this works for greenfield work and wouldn’t work as well for other work.A challenge we have had is that we get different personas joining our demos. Sometimes they are upper management who think they are still technical and they want to get into details. Other times they are product people who are curious about how we interpreted a particular requirement. Other times it’s upstream teams asking things about a particular interaction. Honestly, any interaction is good interaction. However, I have been absolutely terrible at predicting which part of the demo will get the most traction. This is probably a function of how demos operate though. We roll with the punches and answer what we can.I usually have 1 or 2 people demo something we delivered. Usually it’s a particular table/model, but I push for something that is novel. People love novelty. If the report is “select everything from this table and aggregate” then it’s not a good candidate. We recently had a report that had the goal of showing the transaction record that crossed a certain cumulative sum threshold. That’s novel, and so that is what I pushed the team to demo. There ended up being a lot of conversation around that approach and the validity of the requirements. Good, we want conversation and interaction.I try to rotate different people demoing work they have done so everyone gets their time to shine. I make it clear that the goal is to a degree sales. Sell your work. Brag. Explain what you thought was interesting or challenging or whatever. People will engage with that.I also bring up specific challenges. This last sprint we spun out on a particularly ambiguous requirement. Attempting to nail down that requirement resulted in not delivering one of the items in the sprint goal. I made sure to relate those 2 things and called it out. It’s not just about painting a rose colored story, it’s also about showing we do more than just sling data left to right.Numbers also tend to register with people. An old manager of mine used to have a slide for git metrics. “this sprint we added 2311 lines of code and removed 5541”. It seemed a little corny to me at the time, but in reality it adds to the perception of “oh this team Got Stuff Done”On the topic of numbers, mentioning them can also make you sound like you know what you are doing. This can be more useful in non-greenfield areas. For example: “this table has 110 million records in it and grows at the rate of 5 million per month. Each daily run varies from 150k to 175k and runs for 20 minutes” if the goal of your project is to reduce cost then you tie it to that “…and with our new special sauce, we save $20k/yr”. If it is to run things faster you could say “and now we have partitioned it in a way that we have 10 parallel jobs that complete in 2 minutes”. Tie what you are doing to the goals of the sprint or project.Sorry if these ideas are a bit unorganized, hopefully these help you.",raginjason,2025-10-20 03:05:41,5,dataengineering,t3_1ob6d1n,False,

njyt4rr,"A lot depends on your tech stack but make it callable. In the example of Python/Airflow make it an importable variable. Finding yourself reusing the same default arguments put it in a variable and import across dags. If you find you need to change common elements in that variable put the definition in a function with parameters. Same thing with open telemetry or open lineage, define your structure for making the call and do it once. A big advantage of this is structure, everything looks the same data is captured in a uniform way and simplifies your life a ton. Depending on your size this can start as simple parameters but may evolve into some kind of log class that you pass as a parameter. Word of warning stay away from template files. I've worked with too many teams that start doing templates to try and enable non engineers to just drop in SQL or something and it makes life miserable. Speeds up initial work but it will cause a lot of headaches down the road with unmaintained, unoptimized code and leaves you with a swampy mess of data.Keep a good folder structure. Don't put your orchestration code in the same folder as your data quality code. Favor nested folders.

njq7mit,"Athena and Redshift are quite different tools. Redshift (2012) is a full data warehouse living on a cluster, you have to provision a cluster to store the table's data.

It has its own specific table storage optimizations such as distribution styles and sort keys. It is designed for data warehousing and BI.Athena is newer (2016), and solely a query engine (based on open-source Trino by default, or Spark), so you need to manage the data storage in another tool, such as S3. It's designed for interactive querying on data lakes, while Glue is designed for ETL. Although it doesn't mean you can't use Athena for transformations, I just would not bet that it will be cheaper than Glue (serverless Spark) for production ETLs. The design of interactive query tools is usually made to be faster in exchange for more resources consumption, which may not be the best trade-off for production ETLs.Running Spark on EMR may be a cheaper way to run distributed SQL transformations on AWS, but then you have to deal with EMR cluster management.",sib_n,2025-10-16 02:00:32,8,dataengineering,t3_1o7kzhx,False,

Boots the hardware, Manages CPUs, timers, and devices etc. - these are exactly what we call operating system.Not really. OS provides many other things. Hardware Manager is just there to do things needed by hardware, set up interrupts, nic, apic, boot cores, etc. After that is done it gets out of the way and exposes full hardware to software it got compiled with.

nkeugps,"Medallion architecture is an introduction to layering data, but you may find you have more 'layers' than the basic three it introduces.You can help keep data secure by making use of those layers to provide different kinds of access as you move from 'less well defined classification' to 'more well defined classification'.Your initial as-is landing area and bronze can be set up to be not-queryable by end users. Here you can have unclassified data, and potentially have it unmasked. The only access to these areas is either the automated system, or users with elevated privileges who are accessing it for the specific purpose of classifying data and setting up automation for ingestion and transform to later layers.You should track the classification for each column to determine what kind of data it has. Is it personal data? Is it PII? Is it generic contact style PII (name, email, phone) or sensitive identity-theft-enabling PII like external identifiers or private information (license number, tax number, birth details, passport, etc). Those classifications help you to understand the security policy you place on the column.With a lakehouse you have the option to also separate the data in the storage layer. You can have separate buckets for pii or sensitive data, so that you can specifically track and audit access to the buckets, and a leak of any kind on the general data bucket does not leak sensitive data.You will need some kind of query portal that enforces column-level security for you. Something like SageMaker, for example. You will need to set up rules for automatically hiding/masking tables/columns that people cannot access. You need to make sure people don't have an alternative for accessing the data.There are tools you could point at your bronze data to scan for sensitive data. They won't be perfect but they're a good start. I believe AWS comprehend can do it, but there's a variety of 3rd party tools you can run.---The main point is your early areas are kept inaccessible to users, so that you can hold the data in an unclassified manner that allows you to do ingestion and classification work on it. Users can only access data through a system that enforces security and access controls on queries, and you only add data that has gone through that classificatio process.",azirale,2025-10-20 01:52:34,2,dataengineering,t3_1oagoef,False,

I think you are dealing with a smaller amount of data (<1GB). JSON format is also slow. You are running into an old, solved problem. ETL can be expensive. It is one of the main reasons that file based looks so attractive (but is actually data on beer goggles).Let me share a way that has dealt with this issue. First, and most important, how are you using the data? This is the key question and will be the reason for your upstream choices. This should be used to guide all your choices. See which final format fits your SLA and performance needs best. See how I am moving to objective and not subjective reasons?The final form has to also consider flexibility, expandability and scalability. Have at least some good assumption on these so that you can use more information to make the case.BTW, ETL is just the homework you have to do in order to get the data into the final form. Until it is queried, data has no value. Zero. That seems obvious, but you would be amazed the number of people that don't understand this.Is your boss also the data architect?

(Wouldn't be right for me to go into too much detail.) We worked with many of the leading Pharma. The goal was to help the companies collect regular data feeds and ELT them into a data warehouse, usually Snowflake or Redshift. We used our own PaaS orch platform based on K8s. the main observability tool then was New Relic -- an OTel adopter. (What we did when I was there was basic. DataKitchen now sell an observability tool of their own -- haven't used it but it looks cool). We used NR to monitor data file arrival, data loading job execution, and platform and/or K8s errors coming out of our airflow-like orch tool -- including sql errors. NR captured user who created the job, what the job was for, how much data the job moved, and did every step in the process complete in \~expected time, history of the job over time. We also used NR for basic log aggregation and had alerts for specific conditions observed in log output. We didn't use traces. We wanted that for the steps in the jobs, but didn't have time to implement while I was there. The DevOps team used more sysOps sampling metrics to know how the pods were performing and the health of the underlying nodes and storage.Kind of similarly, I'm currently leading a project to build a data file feed ingestion tool called CsvPath Framework. We support Otel and OpenLineage for observability. the framework doesn't do any sysOps metrics. and it doesn't natively ship its own logs -- you would have to do that, same as for any system you're hosting. What it does is fire data processing events for arriving files registered, validation scripts loaded, runs started/ended, steps within runs started/ended, and validation errors. I.e. we're just focused on the data. CsvPath is kind of like [Soda.io](http://Soda.io) for databases, but totally focused on preboarding flat-file feeds with a lot more opinionatedness about how to do it right. if we didn't have Otel (and OpenLineage) we'd have to roll our own way of doing monitoring and alerting. that would not have been practical.Hope that helps. if it's not off-target happy to say more.",ProfessionalDirt3154,2025-10-21 19:30:56,1,dataengineering,t1_nkm2nzp,False,

nk80q6p,"I don't know how much moolah you all got because it can be expensive, but Google BigQuery is really slick. I have been using it for a project this year and I'm super impressed with its feature set, Python API, command line tools, and web console. It is so amazingly fast performing scans on big datasets, too, and you get detailed information on every query about how much compute it used and how much data it scanned. Big plus in my opinion is that it is a SaaS offering so it relieves you from database admin burden (which I personally kind of detest doing, haha).If you have < 1 TB of data it could be a good solution. A full scan of 1 TB is $6.25, but you can avoid doing that very often with decent table optimizations like partitions and clustering or even duplicate tables with different optimizations, since the storage is cheap. I like it better than either Redshift or Databricks, though I don't have a ton of experience with either. I liked Databricks but I feel like you really have to commit their platform and ecosystem.I don't know if it fits your use case but in my opinion it is an amazing platform and easy to work with as a developer.

Just do whatever you need; seriously doubt there will be issues with memory unless the server is really underpowered.BTW, an `updated_at` column in the source is exactly how this situation is typically handled so then you can store a ""high water mark"" (last update datetime handled) so you know which new records to import when your job re-runs. That's a major problem if that field is invalid.

Synapse utilized many of Azure's base resources all linked together, but their development was forked and specialized to Synapse - so they're not 1:1 migrations. To further add problems to this, based on feature requests we made and escalated support tickets to engineering, the development of those forks were done by a small overseas team that basically had no bandwidth but bug fixes.

Built out the first screen then created a ""mocks folder"", with Claude mocked up several screens based on the first one I'd manually coded. We iterate a bit and land on something that's almost ok.The code produced yes of course is pure trash but that's ok. I then cut up the mocks into functional components and fix the things I don't like.At the end I realized all it really did was save some typing during the design phase, if I tried to use it to produce any production code of more than a few lines it just couldn't do it.I had some use* bugs that were pretty obvious, Claude could not figure out the dependant arrays, it couldn't figure out how to correctly useMemo or useEffect, it would solve one problem create another solve that problem and the first problem would return. None of those problems were hard to solve, it was clear Claude couldn't remember or factor in multiple requirements.I've concluded that ai is not capable of building any real functionality and coding with ai is still more of a pipedream than reality. Now I've done enough to be convinced vibe coders and advocates just aren't very good devs.It was good for visualizing the app, and giving me some design direction, but none of that code is usable and for every minute it saved it wasted 10 of mine. In the past I've had success with small syntax / logic tasks, processing and formatting data.

Also worth noting, all the way back then, the game was very simple and didn’t have that much content, it wouldn’t have been that hard to rewrite. It was still in beta, with the really old terrain generation and even basic features like sprinting and the hunger bar hadn’t been added yet. The old, shitty pocket edition version you remember from your childhood was basically identical to Java edition at the time.According to autobiographies about Notch, at this time mojang was still a really small company with probably 10 or less employees and the rewrite was mostly entrusted to a single guy who was known as “the smart one”.Later that year they copied over the C++ engine for iOS, then next year to the Xbox 360, then the year after that to the PS3.

One part of that C++ code has a method that needs to be called in a thread-safe way at certain times in the runtime lifecycle.

Because sometimes the logic you want to implement is clearer as a for-loop with a counter and/or current element, and sometimes the logic is clearer as a loop that continues *while* a condition remains true.Some programming languages allow the use of an *until*\-loop, a loop that keeps running *until* a condition is met. An until-loop is functionally equivalent to a while-not-loop, so why is there a need for an until-loop?Well, it's not that there's a specific *need* for it, it's that sometimes the logic is clearer when you realize that a body of code needs to be repeated over and over *until* a specific condition is met -- or that the body needs to repeatedly execute with the goal of causing that condition to be true.",SpaceAviator1999,2025-10-16 04:27:46,3,learnprogramming,t3_1o7ueik,False,

It's very important to understand those two worlds, and if you're learning TS right off the bat, you'll probably conflate them a lot, which means that you'll misunderstand a lot of the core concepts.Instead, it's better to get really comfortable in JavaScript (which, as I said above, is one of the two ""worlds""), and then learn TS later, adding the second ""world"" on top of that.",abrahamguo,2025-10-19 19:23:37,24,learnprogramming,t3_1oay9mr,False,

Mid-sized businesses can't get loans. Companies aren't willing to spend as much money on advertisements, so sites like google, instagram, Facebook, etc. see their revenue go down. Consumers buy less products on Amazon.So everyone stops hiring, and then they start doing layoffs, which means people have even less money to spend on stuff, and the cycle continues to plummet downward into a recession.And that is what we're going through now.Are there some jobs being made obsolete by AI?

Once you know a few, picking up another is a matter of a weekend and a few hours reading the docs. C#, Java and C++ share most of their concepts. They might have slightly different keywords and implementations, but that's just the surface layer. Once you know one of them really well (I mean really well, like understanding and being able to explain WHY thing are the way they are, and how they work under the hood) you can really write in all 3. For Backend developent, you can basically choose what you want. C# and Java are better than C++ (in this specific case), many people also like Python or JS, Ruby, Go, PHP or rust. I could proably list 10 more languages if I took the time. I for one wrote backends in Python, JS, C# and rust and personally, the only language I didn't like out of those 4, was JavaScript. And, a last short point: Look at your local job market. Where I live (when I looked last), C# and Python were more popular than Java for Backend Dev specifically for example, but Java is also used for Android Dev and some Desktop UIs. But this does vary a lot from place to place. The world is not a monolith, it's a set of microservices.",Beregolas,2025-10-17 14:25:51,3,learnprogramming,t3_1o91tfy,False,

njv8t84,"You could look at the assembly and see what the compiler is doing. In practice, the compiler will enter `main` and move the stack pointer some offset; this space behind the stack pointer will go back to the end of the stack frame - the stack frame contains the information of where to go when `main` returns. This is the space allocated for the local variables. For you, that'd be about 4 bytes on a typical dev machine. So when `value_giver` returns, the memory for the return value is already allocated, and the compiler will generate machine instructions to write it into this stack space.If you're curious, you could pick up a book on writing compilers, and function call conventions, virtual registers, register allocation via graph coloring, caching and swapping, virtual address spaces, and all sorts of fun theory put into practice.Typically compilers will generate machine code that all the local variables are allocated all at once, so this code: void fn() { int x; // Stuff... int y; // Stuff...The stack memory will look like: [fn frame][x][y][stack pointer]So even though `y` comes into scope later in the function code, all locals were allocated at once; it's just less work to do it this way, and the memory for `y` is inaccessible until the machine code that uses it comes into scope. Compilers don't have to do it this way, and the C standard says effectively nothing about machine code generation. C is a high level language that targets an abstract machine. The compiler projects that abstraction to the actual machine.As far as C is concerned, `a = 25` because that's the code you wrote. How it's realized depends on the compiler and the target architecture that is going to execute those instructions.To blow your mind - Charles Babbage designed the Analytical Engine - a purely mechanical clockwork digital computer. He never did get the funding to build it; some private investor spent millions of dollars and commissioned his earlier Difference Engine to be built, and it was completed and put on display in a London Museum for 2 years, before being brought into his private collection. All the Difference Engine does is compute logarithms.But the Analytical Engine was digitized and simulated - and it fucking worked. Earlier analysis of the design has shown IT IS Turing Complete, and it was indeed designed to be a general purpose computer. So being Turing Complete means it is exactly equivalent to your computer you're using right now - just mechanical and slower.

The return value is then on the stack and can be copied. In reality this is optimised, but in a very simple stack based system you just return the execution to where the function was called and then the assignment copies the value on the stack. The return type defines the width (how many bits/bytes) are on the stack. After that the next function call will write to the stack, overwriting that value.The stack, CPU registers, and pointers that control program execution and function calls make it all work. There's a pointer that tells the CPU which instruction to execute next. That's the ""Instruction Pointer"" (IP). It can ""jump"" to where a function and and then ""jump"" back when the function returns. The pointers can just be on the stack because stacking those addresses makes it easy.

You need to learn to create the discrete steps that make the computer do what you want it to do. I fully do understand that your ultimate goal is to create your game, but that's a *future goal*. (A new carpenter doesn't directly start building intricate Victorian furniture. They start with learning to work with hand tools and with the grain of the wood and gradually work their way up.)Take two steps back and start with general programming. The suggestions I give you now are tailored to your desire of making games in the end:+ Start with the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki. It is a free, textual, extremely practice oriented course that is the current first semester of ""Introduction to Computer Science"". This course will give you a solid general programming foundation and understanding along with teaching you the *Python programming language*.+ Then, move on to [Making Games with Python and Pygame](https://inventwithpython.com/pygame/) - also free to read online. This book will lay the foundation for game programming. Maybe, if your game is simple enough, you can even realize it with Pygame already.+ Then, move on to Godot. And here, I'd suggest that you shell out a few bucks (it's really cheap) and buy the [Humble ""Learn Godot in 2025"" bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/software/learn-godot-in-2025-complete-course-bundle-software) (available for 2 more days at the time of writing this comment) - I've bought a previous similar bundle and can attest that the courses are excellent and well worth the money.My recommendation for Python first comes from GDScript's similarities to it.

Once that is covered, you'll be able to do a lot of things (still, it will be laborious and dirty. But the important part is being able to craft stuff).You'll then enter that part where you just try out stuff and document yourself with the eventual learning of x technology or y algorithm. This point is where some can get stuck in the infamous tutorial hell where you just drift from one tutorial to another one w.o. ever really achieving something. Thus why I suggested earlier to ""just tackle your own problems"".Now that I explained what I would advice and why I would advice it, I would still want to add this : encountering and trying to solve your problems rather than doing tutorials w.o. ends is one thing.

It’s also useful to get comfortable with Git/GitHub early; version control is super important even for small projects. Once you’re comfortable, branch out.

njwjipl,"If it makes you feel better, this is a field where you constantly feel like you're not smart enough for it. You basically get comfortable at feeling dumb, feeling lost, and failing repeatedly. Learn to allow yourself to experience these things without negativity or devaluing your self-worth. Being comfortable with that opens up your mind for everything else. That way, you won't feel discouraged for doing extra research or taking longer than others to figure things out...or you could just ignore that and stress out 24/7 :smirking_face:With that said, a lot of programmers are obsessed with the idea that learning it must be really difficult; if you can't do x thing in y way, then ""you're not cut out for it.""I find *that* ridiculous, just like I find the method to teach you for loops a little odd. Don't be afraid to take a few steps back and look up introductory courses to x concept and asking for a lot of guidance if you're stuck on something. If you wind up going further down this path, remember this - building usable programs is really important, even if they're very basic to start.My curriculum failed to even suggest that. We've never even built a basic calculator like you are now. This led to my growth in programming being at a near plateau for 2 years. I learned theory, syntax, and basic concepts but never actually trained the most important aspect of a programmer - solving problems. A programmer is a problem-solver who uses tools (languages, functions, etc) to solve them. That's why many people emphasize solving the problem with writing out diagrams, pictures, words, etc, then turning that into psuedocode you can easily follow. Here's a simple way breaking the problem down would look like:- If I receive 2 numbers, let's say 6 and 2, what would the end result be? 12? - How would I get from my base numbers to get to 12 while only adding? Adding by 2, 6 times?- How do I make my program loop by 6 times?- How do I make sure I correctly add 2 each time in that loop? - How do I see if my end result is 12?- How do I replace my numbers 6 and 2 with variables? - Would I get the same result assigning 6 and 2 to those variables before the loop?- How do I get user input to achieve the same result?So on and so forth. Maybe add some psuedocode to give a basic idea of how it would flow in code. Building a bigger program would follow a similar process. Whenever you break down a problem but get stuck on breaking it down further for x, y, z reasons, that might be a good indicator of searching up a little more about x, y, and z.Hope that helps! I'm a fellow beginner, so you might even be building something I find difficult right now lmao.",Happiest-Soul,2025-10-17 02:12:56,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o88d0l,False,

Could this be the solution to what I'm trying to do?It could be sufficient for your purposes, but more of an alternative to using React. Likely the technique you're looking for is what we call templating. It's also what SSGs use.I'm not personally familiar with react so I can't give an exact answer for your situation, but one common type of templating is [jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/), where you can have a template like `hello {{name}}` (which you should be familiar with from basic string interpolation), and logic like `{% for name in names %}hello {{name}}{% endfor %}`.Static site generators essentially use templates to produce static HTML that you can serve to people through stuff like github pager, a simple Apache webserver, etc. Usually it involves some setup in terms of theming and what you want headers, footers, etc to be, and then you can do stuff like add blog posts written in Markdown with minimal effort.You can find static site generators in pretty much any language. Some commonly used ones include* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (Ruby)* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (Go)* [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) (Rust, but more special-purpose)Some of the ones I've used include* [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) (node.js)* [hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/) (Haskell)You can find [a list of SSGs on jamstack](https://jamstack.org/generators/). There's 370 of them currently, some general-purpose, some special-purpose. Given that you seem to have some experience with node.js you could have a look at 11ty to see if it seems to cover your needs.",syklemil,2025-10-17 10:39:55,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o8upxz,False,
nk07opb,"I can't speak to React specifically, but I recently did this to build an encyclopedia in Angular with something called Dynamic Routing - essentially, you can set a route with some parameter at the end of the path, which routes to a page which uses that parameter to retrieve information from a database and populate the page's template with that information (using signals in Angular, though it's my understanding that React doesn't have signals, so your approach might have to be slightly different). In my case it was building an encyclopedia - based on the entry title in the url, it would grab information about that entry from the backend database and populate the template's title, description, etc, with that information.Anyway, I don't know enough about React to say exactly how you would do it, but it might be worth looking into seeing if the router you're using has any kind of dynamic routing as an option and go from there.",0bn0x10s1337sp34k,2025-10-17 17:27:16,2,learnprogramming,t3_1o8upxz,False,

Whatever matches your interests. You'll always be learning- Build up your knowledge while building many projects utilizing Git. Push a few into production if applicable - Always be curious about what's going on under the hood and dive deep into books- Find the fun in what you're doing and learning Then, when you've built a lot of personal projects (without following step-by-step tutorials) and maybe pushed some into production:- Go for a masters in an adjacent field (CS, software engineering, etc) if you can- Apply to jobs and internships Avoid paid bootcamps if you can. I heard that the vast majority of recent bootcampers don't get placements, which follows the unemployment rates of CS majors.I believe all of the information within a bootcamp and CS degree are available online free..If you absolutely need a job within a few months and absolutely want this field, well, I recommend being wary of Reddit.

njvjnly,"Write an HTTP server.HTTP is a text based protocol, and you can get away with just implementing GET and POST - and you don't even need the whole thing - you can just ignore authentication, for example. You generate an HTTP response IN TEXT. It's all text. That's the point of this exercise.Seriously, don't overthink it - it's not hard. You're not writing a complete web server, you just need to read text from a stream, figure out what message type you got, and service it.You can write main in terms of `std::cin` and `std::cout`. What makes standard IO so special is that you can use the `netcat` command to open a listening socket on port 8080, and launch an instance of your program - `netcat` will establish the TCP stream for you, and redirect all IO to your program's standard IO. So here you're coding against `std::cin` and `std::cout`, and in reality, it's coming from a TCP socket over a pipe across the network.Now you can just hit the localhost loopback device with a web browser on port 8080, and your program just reads `std::cin` to process the GET request, and you write back a payload with the most barebones HTML that says ""Hello World!"" in it. Or maybe some JSON, or XML, since both those are transport protocols - you can just write it raw, you don't need a template engine that processes JSON or anything like that.But you could... If you get ambitious...You can also use `telnet` or `curl` to interact with your little server and see a more raw view, or the developer tools built into the browser - whatever those do...As for your code, OOP is message passing to objects, so you can implement a couple message types: class GET {}; class POST {}; using request = std::variant; std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, request &);The stream operator will start to parse out the HTTP request, determine the request type, and then create the corresponding variant type. This makes this stream operator here a factory method. Once you get as far as knowing the message type, you could defer to the message type instance to populate itself from the stream: class GET { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, GET &); }; class POST { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &, POST &); };You'll probably want a response message: class response { friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &, const response &); };To make an object, you make it streamable: class http_server: public std::streambuf {};If you want to parse text, you overload a couple things: class http_server: public std::streambuf { int_type underflow() override, overflow(int_type) override; };And you can plug that into a stream: http_server svr; std::iostream ios{&svr};You can make a number of these, for being different kinds of processors and handlers and stages that all perform steps. Messages move content, objects do work. This is OOP in C++. This is why Bjarne invented C++, because he wanted more control over message passing, and he wanted greater type safety than either Smalltalk or C. Streams are the interface - and frankly you can bypass the stream implementations almost completely if you're messaging internally in your application - you don't have to serialize to text all the damn time. There's a lot you can do with OOP if you think in terms of objects and messages.I demonstrate these principles in past posts of mine, I spend most of my Reddit time answering C++ questions on Reddit, so look up a couple of my past examples.But if you can implement objects and message passing as OOP intended, I think you'll show your professor something he's almost certainly never seen in his life. MOST people can't even tell you what OOP IS, because they've never seen it themselves, before. Encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism? These principles are NOT OOP, they just come OUT of OOP. These principles exist in other paradigms, too. You've got polymorphism in everything from imperative programming to functional programming, for example. Most C++ code is C with Classes because people don't know what they're doing - garbage in, garbage out. I've spoken to other developers who understand OOP, but in 30 years I've never actually met one in real life, never worked with one. I've worked with a Windows 95/DirectX/COM co-author, I've worked with the former maintainer of the Intel Fortran compiler (and that's a big fucking deal, since it's used on all the worlds supercomputers), and I've shown them this stuff, how Bjarne writes code, and they've never seen anything like it before.",mredding,2025-10-16 22:40:33,3,learnprogramming,t3_1o8hxas,False,

Flask lets you make a simple website to view and edit data, and SQLite can store everything in a single file. You will need a backup plan for the database, but it's simple and doesn't require a server.If multiple people need access at the same time, you will need a server and a proper database. Node.js lets you run JavaScript on the server to handle multiple users. A NoSQL database like MongoDB is easier than SQL for beginners because you don't have to plan tables and relationships in advance. You can just add new fields as you go (Useful if they later need to add random stuff they forgot to mention). An online database just means the database lives on a server everyone can access, but it requires hosting, security, and backups. There are generous free tiers but it adds complexity.For now, start small with Flask and SQLite on your own computer as a demo. Focus on the key features, tracking animals, medications, and volunteer logs. Once it works, you can think about scaling it with Node.js and MongoDB if more people need access or using something like Pymongo to keep using your Flask app instead of redoing it in Node.js.What you are building is a basic CRUD app with a form to add new animals and a table to view them. It's simple enough that an AI could probably build it for you. If you want to learn, use AI as a tutor or guide so you don't get lost. Keep it simple.

Make the repo(s) public (watch for secrets and personal data etc.).If you have a website too I might visit it, but 95% chance I won't. 1% chance I look at any of the code in the repos. We just don't have time for that, generally. I'll just look at the repo README to see what it is, then move on. With this in mind, it's a good idea to spend a bit of time on the README, telling me the details I need to know ""above the fold"" (without having to scroll down) like what the project is/does, where it runs, key technologies used etc. In a few formatted sentences or bullet points. I will never ever ever pull+build+run your projects. Again, I've got tens more candidates to screen, so anything you can do to dial back the bullshit, not add to it, is great. (E.g. I once passed on a candidate that had an obnoxious loading message on his website whilst his unnecessarily large front end bundle loaded and hydrated taking seconds to do all these fancy JS things. The exact opposite of impressive.)You don't need to deploy things, but if there's a convenient link in the README I will probably click it just to see what you built. I won't run through the features or anything unless it's a button push.Saved on your computer is only useful if you're screen sharing for a demo or something, like in an interview.

Occasionally you get a recruiter that will click around but their feedback probably isn't very valuable in all honesty.

If we want to see you code we'll set a test (live, take-home etc.) as repo code could have come from anywhere and doesn't tell us much.

nk6hzvt,"If you’re looking to get back into programming and want something practical that you can tinker with, leaning on languages like Java and C# (.NET) is a solid choice. Both are mature, widely supported, and have a lot of libraries that can make building things like a hotel PMS or a roster scheduler much more manageable. Java will give you platform independence, so you could run your programs on Windows, Linux, or Mac without much hassle, while C# and .NET are extremely well-integrated into Windows environments and offer rapid development with a lot of built-in UI frameworks. For your particular projects, SQL is going to be almost unavoidable if you want to store reservations, employee details, or scheduling data efficiently. Learning to combine either Java or C# with a relational database like MariaDB would cover most of what you need, and it’s exactly how most professional systems handle persistent data.For the hotel PMS, even if you already use Opera Cloud, building your own simplified version can be a great learning experience. You’ll get hands-on insight into the data structures and workflows behind reservations, room management, and billing, which will inform your understanding of what a full-scale system does behind the scenes. For the roster builder, the challenge lies more in logic and rules enforcement—handling days off, labor law restrictions, and employee availability can be complex, and practicing this in code will improve your problem-solving skills more than anything else. You could start simple, storing employee information and preferences in a database, then gradually implement more advanced scheduling algorithms as you learn.Here me out though: some of the most efficient POS systems ever made weren’t built on top of an operating system at all—they were written in assembly language. By coding directly to the hardware, developers could squeeze out incredible speed and reliability, especially in environments where every millisecond counts, like retail or hospitality checkout systems. Modern frameworks make development faster and easier, but looking at those old systems is a good reminder that understanding what’s happening at the low level can make you a much stronger programmer, even if you never touch assembly yourself. It’s all about learning how things work under the hood, and how your high-level code translates into actual performance. This also saves a ton of money on client end systems as the hardware doesn't need to support a full operating system since you've built it to be application specific. You wouldn't use a pc for what you can do with a 5 buck Arduino.If you're willing to learn a new language though, I'd recommend c++ as you can compile it for any operating system.",bringrainfire,2025-10-18 18:24:43,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oa2us3,False,

nk7mdp5,"SRP and DRY are just guidelines, not the law. They're fuzzy. You have to decide for yourself when to follow them.In this particular case, splitting out repeated code into a common function created a lot of value for you. Not only did it make your code shorter, but if you ever need to modify that logic you only need to do it once.In terms of the name, I think you're focused on describing how it works rather than what it does. It sounds like you have a function that retrieves data and caches it. You could just call it fetchAndCache. Or you could describe in more detail what API it calls and what sort of data it fetches and we could help you come up with a better name.It's not immediately obvious to me that the one function violates SRP. Even though it does multiple steps, if those steps are all related and all necessary for your code, then that may very well be a single responsibility.Furthermore, splitting it up into three separate functions didn't actually help anything. It didn't reduce your total lines of code. It didn't help reusability.That doesn't mean you shouldn't do it, just that there's less clear benefit. Don't do it because you think you're ""supposed to"".>So according to SRP I need to destroy old function and in the place when it was 1 line call I need to past three lines chain in each place instead.I don't think that's what SRP says.Doing three related things that often need to be done together can be a single responsibility.SRP just suggests that if a function is doing multiple \*unrelated\* things, try to split them apart. In this case it doesn't sound like they're unrelated.Either way, whenever you follow a principle like DRY or SRP, the end result should make your code better.

So what does this mean exactly; it could be a caution against extracting logic when the information it's working with is very different from other forms of information that might be outbound/inbound to this kind of call. So while having a one-stop function for things like payload validation and Redis caching might sound nice, consider that the language and packages/libraries you're using are already doing that for you, and you adding more function calls as wrappers around those library functions may just be walling off even more utility and making your own code more inflexible",StickOnReddit,2025-10-19 01:58:00,1,learnprogramming,t3_1oa8oec,False,

Because if any of the three changes, it shouldn't affect the other two. So **you are better of with having three separate functions**, requestData, validateData and storeData.And of course you need a fourth function that uses those three, but don't call it something generic like `requestTokensThenExtractThenStore` \- use a better abstraction that fits in with what your application uses the data for.

Like you I thought finding a job wouldn't be hard, after all I had 4 years of experience at that point and jobs were handed out like candy in '98 when I graduated. I took 3 months off just like you, even spent a good chunk of my severance like an idiot.I spend the next 9 months looking for a job, I was out of work over a year. I ran out of cash, and I was 30-40k in debt on maxed out credit cards. I was borrowing money from friends to make the bills work and out of unemployment checks.My old company (the one that laid me off) called me up, they had an ugly project and were looking for current/ex-employees who had reputations for putting in the hours/work. Wanted to hire me as a contractor, I negotiated an hourly rate, and hopped a plane to chicago, worked remote there for over 9 months, nights/weekends... 80+ hour weeks. That hourly contract rate paid off all my debt, paid back my friends, got me a new car and a nest egg.That contract paid me more in 6-9 month of work then they'd have paid me if they'd just kept me employed during the year I was laid off plus the 6-9 months. It was silly. They hired me back full time to save money.About 8 months later I landed a job in my dream industry and happily walked away from them.Point of my story? It's rough. Being laid off sucks. We can all make mistakes. You may have to do things you don't like to recover. But you can and will recover given enough time. Hang in there. Do what you have to do to make ends meet.Edit: I should add since then I've ""lost my job"" to layoffs several more times in the proceeding years.

The industry is cyclical, so going through busts suck and will happen more than once (layoffs, business decisions that go against engineering etc...)2. Interviewing is stressful, time consuming, and arduous (leetcode etc...)3. Not finding some level of interest and enjoyment in the field. This is a field that requires constant learning so if you want to be competitive you cannot stagnate. This is not a great profession to coast bc that will either lead to the learning feeling like a PITA or to you being in a lackluster position which will make future job hunts harder (see 1&2).Personally I was most burnt out working boring jobs with outdated tech that did not have room to grow or stay competitive, even though they were fairly easy and chill.I felt the least burnt out working on interesting projects with modern tech and smart people, even though I was working 10-20 hours more a week than the chill jobs.",69Cobalt,2025-10-17 15:54:23,43,cscareerquestions,t3_1o94tsz,False,

That was not the norm in most careers.Second, LOTS of passion in this industry. Or at least, there was. Any industry that attracts passionate people who love the idea of the work has problems with burnout.Third, it's a type of work that many people find they really put themselves deeply into.

njzqzqb,"Capitalism as a system has two primary oppositional parties: the owners and the workers. Owners want to maximize their own profit, so it is in the owner's best interest to pay the worker as little as possible, and to work the worker as long as possible. This is made worse by the fact that profit under capitalism actually tends to fall over time, since capitalism is quite good at making things more efficient it tends to overproduce things in the long run, devaluing the products it produces, meaning often the only way to squeeze out more profit is by squeezing the workers.The workers in IT fields are well paid (still much less than the actual value they provide to the company), but work long hours, frequently more than full time, in order to meet arbitrary deadlines and push profits to an extreme. This work is highly mentally taxing contributing to burnout. Additionally globalization, outsourcing, and complacency due to high salaries makes demands for better working environments difficult.edit: To make things worse, since the 2010s tech companies have been relying on an extremely loan heavy monetary strategy due to low interest rates which actually requires profits to grow exponentially in order to pay their loans back, but this strategy is beginning to falter due to problems like ""running out of people on the planet to sell to"", and ""2% higher interest rates to combat hyper inflation caused by tech company speculative circle jerking"", and ""loans coming due"".

njsjzax,"I've spent most of my career in front-end leaning rolls. I began my career as a full stack developer, but I was always more passionate about the user experience. Around the time front end frameworks started to become a thing, the company I was working at began asking people to choose between front end and backend, and I went front end. In my experience, there are a lot of roles out there where most of the work is on the front end, but knowing enough about the backend to add a simple endpoint is valuable. If you want to move from front end to backend, those roles can make a good gateway.I find that there are a lot of interesting technical challenges to be found on the front end, and that if you focus on solving those, there are lot of great opportunities for more senior front end roles. But, you have to be very intentional about focusing on problems of performance and architecture. If you get caught up in building forms or even focusing on interesting UX components, your job stays very small. But, it doesn't seem like that sort of work is ever fully going away.It's worth noting that the top architectural roles at companies tend to be held by people with strong backend experience. If you want to design full systems, you are unlikely to get there until you also get some solid backend experience under your belt.I went from a full stack role with a front end focus into management. I've managed a mix of full stack engineers with a front end focus and pure front end engineers. Being more front end focused does limit my options for management roles a bit because there are some companies that want highly technical managers with lots of experience across their stack.

Don't let them flounder and meander if they obviously don't know, just move the conversation on. You only have a set amount of time to figure this person out.2. Let them show you what they do know and let them go into depth about it. If they have a project or past work experience this is a good place to start, ask them what they did, what decisions they made and if they might change those decisions in hindsight. 3. Have prepared questions. This doesn't mean a script but you need to be able to move the conversation on if it gets stuck. Hopefully your company has good enough practices the topics for your interview are defined, but if they aren't you should know what skills/tech/aptitudes are important for your job since ideally you have them.4. You aren't trying to trick them, too many interviewers do this where they will ask a misleading question to see if the candidate just takes the bait. The problem is candidates are nervous and will always be hesitant to disagree with the interviewer. Keep questions straightforward and open ended. 5. My most important advice especially if you are an early round interview, you aren't trying to find the number 1 candidate. You are trying to avoid the bottom 90 candidates.

I could've just quickly box-checked the task and closed the ticket but instead I dug about to understand the whole CICD pipeline and why the dependency even existed. I concluded it was way too complicated for what it did because it relied upon a convoluted ECS implementation to serve the frontend for no discernible reason (SPA , no server side rendering, never will need it given it's internal tooling with no need for major performance focus). I implemented a much simpler / cheaper way of hosting it as static content in S3 and ran it in parallel in dev as proof of concept.I spoke with our engineering manager who agreed it was a preferable approach and now we're integrating it to reduce architectural / build complexity.My point being, don't just take tickets to solve the immediate problem. See if you can solve the upstream problem too. My initial ticket was some version bump needed of a dependency for security reasons but the underlying problem was that we were managing unnecessarily complex infrastructure to serve up a basic SPA frontend.

nk6rsk7,"I wrote some Foxbase code on SCO Xenix for a dog track company in 1989 lol. I'd wonder if that was me but my naming conventions didn't include film stars. There was a compiled DBase III (Which Foxbase was based on) language called Clipper. My first job included some Clipper development in a MSDOS environment. In that same position I found that OS/2 and a third party multitasking DOS (which I think was built by the same guys who did Dr Dos) called DRM Dos were able to run the Clipper applications. The closest thing my company had to a ""Server"" application was a restaurant reservation application that I developed that ran on multiple terminals hanging off a 386 running Drm Dos.The oldest thing I've run across since then was a Motif application that a Satellite company was maintaining (*Edit:* This was in 2015). The oldest comments were from the mid 90's and some of the functions still used K&R function declaration syntax. I'd actually experimented with Motif while I was working at my first job, so I had bit of an advantage there.Their code actually generated three executables and shared a header file which declared 400+ global variables -- ALL the variables used in the application, pretty much. There were multiple places where global variables were mirrored -- another variable was created that duplicated the intent of an earlier variable. I was unable to determine if this was because they forgot the other variable existed or they weren't sure they could change the variable safely because some other function might need it set to a specific value at some later point. Probably a bit of both. This meant that you'd have to find the variable that was shared between the various functions of the code you were working on right now and insure that you were changing the right mirrored variable. You'd also have to hope that those changes wouldn't break some other functionality of the application. And yes, that was every bit as bad as it sounds.I went in with a philosophy of never adding another global variable to the code unless it resulted in the removal of at least two others. They were unwilling to do anything major with the code and everyone in that building got laid off a bit later, before I had a chance to really get it under control. Hopefully that entire code base was simply deleted after that. That abomination should not have been allowed to continue past that point.I'd say I'd seen worse code over the years, but only a couple of other cases I can think of where I'd actually define the code as ""an abomination."" All the code that I would describe as ""an abomination"" was developed by developers who clearly didn't know what they were doing in the least, because ""Global variables bad"" was something they were already teaching in college in the early and mid 80's.

It’s hard to explain but my advice, whatever it’s worth, is to keep your job and work your way up the economic ladder. Even if you went in as an officer, you’re losing 85-90% of your paycheck. If I were you, I would stay and keep working because the money you can and will make will provide the travel and fun experiences you desire. Sure they won’t be exactly the same as creating some relationships, however, not all relationships in the military are good. You will have corrupt seniors harm your promotions if you don’t play by their rules, you’ll go places and do jobs you absolutely hate doing. That’s why I say it’s better to be financially independent and choose what experiences you want rather than maybe experience them by chance. I never got the chance to go to Russia or Australia and those countries were the stuff of legends. But you can go there now where you’re already at. I feel like I keep saying the same thing differently, but I guess that’s my point. You don’t need to join the military to have experiences someone else got to have when you can make those experiences with the money and freedom you possess right now. If you want to feel like you’ve contributed to the welfare of the country then I would recommend you get hired at a tech company that fulfills that wish.

These companies are huge with around 100k employees so it’s impossible to have widespread cultural changes quickly). Baked into the agile process is the decoupling from requirements driving code and moving towards user stories. By the book agile means that every user story has an acceptance criteria which resembles a unit test. This means teams (again, not everywhere but it is slowly propagating as a culture) perform test driven development where they inherently do red-green-refactor. Built in the development process, devs usually are presented a failing TDD/BDD style acceptance criteria to get started (red), they write just enough code to pass the test (green), and they (refactor) the code with the safety of the tests performing safe operations from Fowler’s refactoring book that may use GoF patterns. Some teams have a senior engineer or software architect that write user stories or tests that explicitly force software into a particular architecture or forces a design pattern in order to be implementable. So yes, we do refactor but it’s baked into the process. Code doesn’t break because it is common to have projects have a strict requirement for 80-100% test coverage. Unit testing is just one level.

You can get an employer to pay for it or if you’re lucky the school will pay for it (I had the school pay for both, and option 1 seems off the table for you considering your circumstances). A few things about a masters, it absolutely can help you get a job if you’re struggling to get one now. However, you need to have a complete mental shift if you decide to get a masters. A masters will be entirely worthless if you view it as just more school. You should treat it like a job which means you should take the hard classes intentionally, if you look for easy A’s you’re wasting your time and money. You should also get involved in graduate research (this is also how you might be able to get the school to pay for your degree + a monthly stipend). Doing research is free experience that can help you land an internship and/or a job. Talking about my graduate research during an interview is probably how I got my first job.

They are FAANG equivalents. And honestly, many of them are flat out more selective and wanted than much of FAANG.I guess you are talking about firms like Anduril, Neuralink, Sentry, Discord, StubHub, Brex, Rippling, Scale AI, Cohere, Nuro, Plaid, Vanta, Glean, AirTable, Flexport, Retool, Verkada, Perplexity, Cadence, Mercor, Zip, Bilt, Ramp, Notion, OpenSea, Instacart, etc? Depends on what you did at those firms.Much of those firms are filled with ex-FAANG engineers and many of them are well known for top talent. And because those firms tend to offer 'top range total compensation' (if you believe in the valuation), tech companies take them as peers. I know no one here is going to say this explicitly here but TC (compensation) is levels as well.It's why Netflix engineers pre-covid had no issues moving around other tech firms despite only having 1 level aka ""Senior Engineer"". Pay is a serious leverage for getting the level you want.>Like if you have whatever yoes required to be Senior at Faang(let’s say 7) from lesser known tech companies, will your yoe be considered less and ineligible to get the role?A senior at most of the firms I listed will have no problems getting senior at FAANG.But a 'senior' at a nontech firm like Home Depot/JPM Chase/Capital One/etc realistically ain't getting senior at FAANG.This is also because tech firms tend to have rubrics for what is expected at each level. Those standards tend to be higher at known tech firms so naturally if you stay at those firms for a while... you will have all the requirements to be senior at FAANG.

Many people build careers through certifications, strong portfolios, internships, and practical experience. What matters most is demonstrating that you can solve problems, learn quickly, and contribute.If you enjoy programming, it’s worth thinking about ways to keep doing it without burning out. That could mean continuing your degree at a slower pace, taking a break, or focusing on building projects and internships that align with your goals. Leadership and managerial roles come later, and they often care more about results and experience than the exact degree.Honestly, there’s no perfect answer.

If you have an internal, bad/mid sr dev you don’t want to hire, it’s easier to justify hiring an external sr dev who is a ‘better fit’ than to hire an external jr dev into a sr role in place of the internal sr.Points 1/2 were great, I have just seen 3 happen before. My last company did a reverse-version of this for every manager role. “Promote the internal person, with 5+ yoe, already doing the managerial work, to the role?

All you can do is find a new job honestly, I have two final stage interviews lined up this month and will take either of them for a lot more money.

It lacks structure, has inconsistent code quality, minimal error handling, and an unresponsive, buggy UI. It feels like it was built without clear architecture or professional standards. The codebase is massive, so theres only so much I can do about this.And man, I totally get what you mean... we’re also using a modern stack, but the software engineering practices are also a mess...> At my company, getting a master's degree leads to a promotion quicker from L2 to L3, and I am thinking if I get a master's degree, especially in the AI/ML space, it will help me in the future when it comes to my career and opening up more jobs. However, doing this will keep me stuck at the company for several years and I won't be able to leave until 1 year after I have obtained the degree.I actually had the same thought you did and decided to go for an MSCS with an AI specialization. I’m over halfway done now, and honestly, I do feel kind of stuck. Not bc I have to stay for the tuition payback or anything (it’s cheap enough that I wouldn’t care if they wanted it back), but bc I’ve gotten used to this job now as working from home makes it super easy to balance work, life, and school. So even though I think about switching jobs almost every day, I haven’t actually applied anywhere. I just want to finish my MS first and then move on. And this job gives me the best balance for now since the school workload is kind of insane, and I don’t think I could handle it without having a WFH job.So...if you’re thinking about doing it, I’d say give it a shot, but just underatand it’s a huge time sink that sometimes I still wonder if I’d be better off just grinding LC and prepping for interviews instead of doing this MSCS... But I do know defense companies and the government are some of the few places that actually value master’s degrees. So i guess if you want to stay in this sector then definitely give it a try.
