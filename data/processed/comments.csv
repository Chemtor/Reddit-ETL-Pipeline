msdz10t,"I have a recent real world example of this, I think.I work with data from social media platforms. Instagram just deprecated their “plays” and “impressions” metrics and replaced them with a new metric called “views”.“Plays” was already a replacement for an older metric called “video_views”, and “plays” measured initial plays on Reels only. The new “views” metric includes replays. There was another metric deprecated called something like “reels_aggregated_plays” which included replays on Reels and therefore matched the new “views” metric.Also new “views” populates for post types that traditionally wouldn’t get “video_views” because they aren’t technically videos: think carousels, images. New “views” are basically “impressions” but they’re higher than impressions for reasons we don’t really understand yet.For almost a decade now we’ve been charged with creating cross-platform data sets that measure total video views. How do we do this when the metric you’ve always used for video views no longer exists, and views happen for more than just video? What we’re saying was a video view in March 2025 is not the same as what we’re saying was a video views in May 2025My point is: this sucks ass. How are you going to validate these changes and explain the data to stakeholders?

msc6kfj,"I’m a DS so what do I know. But here’s my two cents.I work at an org with a hybrid cloud approach. We have on-prem data, some data is in Oracle or db2, and my division mostly lives in Synapse.The Synapse data is often pulled from those other sources (via Synapse Pipelines or stored procedures), cleaned (usually in SQL, sometimes in pandas), and finally dumped into a table.Notice - there’s no bronze layer. I think this is the definition of ETL since we transform before we load. I could be wrong.What’s nice about this workflow: it minimizes costs and it reduces cognitive burden since, there’s fewer intermediate tables.What stinks about this workflow: it’s hard to reason about data lineage and there’s little to no audit trail. Where does this variable come from? Have to dig deep in some low level db just to find the source. If a table churns out questionable data, where did the mistake happen? Is it in the transformation logic, or was there some miscommunication with the source table? Again, tricky to understand. So while having a dumping ground for raw  data seems redundant and can introduce extra expenses, sometimes it’s worth it. I believe that pattern is called ELT, since you load the ugly raw data into a new source system before cleaning it.Another benefit of the bronze layer or ELT approach is that it can reduce the number of ad hoc queries against the low level transactional database, which slows everything down. And having the raw data under the same roof as your data warehouse’s clean data, again, opens up new forms of exploratory analysis.A nice compromise, instead of having permanent intermediate tables, is to have trunc and load tables that are refreshed at regular intervals. That way the data doesn’t eat up so many costs, but there’s still an audit trail for testing and observing data lineage.",BrisklyBrusque,2025-05-14 21:00:15,10,dataengineering,t3_1kmq1ew,False,

The reason is not so much the pleasure of starting a new project with them or the time it saves when starting. It is rather the ease of on-boarding a new member into an established tool, instead of spending months training the person to a highly specific home-cooked solution. I am also speaking from experience of being on-boarded into this kind of home-made complex ETL.Scala had some history as a DE language because Apache Spark main UI used to be its Scala API. Then it introduced a Python API with similar performance, so the complexity of Scala could not be justified, and the language is globally dying for all its niche use cases, as far as I know.So for me, it's not really a question of language, Python and SQL are consensual kings and here to stay.

Just because it’s used a lot doesn’t necessarily mean people like it a lot. Python is a very easy language to get up and running with, which is (in my opinion) why people who aren’t Software Engineers (ie data analysts/scientists) use it. Since it’s used so much by them, the data ecosystem ends up using it a lot in general, so it then bleeds over to tools used by actual engineers.I personally loathe python for basically the same reasons you outlined.

ms4t471,I think the flip side of this is that python makes it easier to write extremely unopinionated highly meta sort of systems that just eat up basically anything they get given. Doing this same sort of thing in other languages is much harder and almost immediately devolves into an explosion of complexity that can quickly become very hard to maintain and understand. Other languages are all fine and good when all your data is super well behaved and you have control of it at every layer. Python really is the goat for handling flaky weird sorts of stuff coming from systems outside of your control. This is why Python has largely won this particular race. Real world data doesn’t always have nice structure to code up as some nice fixed schema and you still need to be able to handle it.That said certainly there is a move within Python to use pydantic as the core serialization and deserialization system that builds basically better data class objects. Then your actual business logic Python code can simply check that it receives an object of the type it expects irrespective of internal complexity of those objects and their construction.,TheRealStepBot,2025-05-13 18:17:18,3,dataengineering,t3_1klpzaf,False,

mrlac50,"Welcome to the data world lol. To your points:constant state of migration:- this one sounds odd. If you’re constantly moving things from multiple platforms onto the same platform that would make sense. Or if you’re doing proof of concepts across other platforms it could make sense. But typically you pick a platform (AWS + Snowflake or GCP + BigQuery, etc) and stick to it.Data vendors with unique formats:- outside of a few industries like specific things are standardized for interoperability(healthcare, logistics, banking), it’s pretty common for each vendor even for the same “flavor” of data to do it their own unique way.- Ex. I work largely with POS (point of sale) data and literally every POS provider implements things differently and we have to standardize how order discounts, line item discounts, taxes, refunds and partial refunds are handled per system. They also come in all different formats - JSON via API, CSV via S3, TXT via SFTP and we have to have a pipeline per vendor.Tribal knowledge:- Yup, pretty common. Most teams suck at documentation. We have started hiring dedicated business analysts into our DE team so that they can document sources for our teams of analysts.- 4 years into a role I still find out some new random fact about how data is handled in our company. Same for a coworker that’s been here 15 yearsAs-hoc ingestion:- Fortunately we have a roadmap of priority sources to ingest. But if a big enough client or a VP in the business starts getting loud about needing something then ultimately their new source gets prioritized.

mrv97w8,"I was a software engineer for nearly 15 years. Worked in mobile, desktop, web development. I write network and security automation stuff for fun. My final role as a software engineer was a team lead in an insurance company. We had legacy C# desktop stuff, legacy web stuff (ASP.NET/PHP/ColdFusion), and more modern web stuff for the time (ASP.NET + Angular). I still used to write a lot of data engineering-like tasks in this job - financial services, so tons of integrating with SFTP servers and writing/ingesting XML everywhere. Heavy SQL Server stuff underpinned all of this, which is how I ended up in data. My track in data was BI developer -> data engineer in wealth mgmt (Python/BigQuery/dbt) -> data consultant (Azure/Databricks/Synapse) -> tech lead in retail (Python/BigQuery/dbt) -> senior engineer in security for retail org (Python/BigQuery/dbt for analytics, Splunk for SIEM + security automation). I am a very code-heavy data engineer. Everything I do is in code except for dashboards, which I wish I could change. Regardless - and I get downvoted into oblivion here a lot for saying this - I don't view data engineering as anything close to software engineering. The needs, requirements, and use cases are all entirely different. Your average software engineer will fail even the most basic data modelling task these days. Most don't know SQL or even touch a database directly. Your average data engineer will struggle with anything beyond a basic CRUD app. They are different specialties and the code for data pipelines is simpler by many orders of magnitude. I have watched this time and time again with data engineers thinking they can just switch between the two. I even think if I tried to go back to my old ways in the C# ecosystem I would have a really hard time (forgetting that I'm about 10 years older now...) Any pivot is possible, but keep in mind it will take a long time. It took me something like five years to fully move to data engineering after a complete reskill, and that was still with my prior SQL history. I was just lucky that I had all the soft skills in my back pocket so I could get promoted easily. re: stakeholder stuff, I've always had to do things and figure out requirements on my own, so I think you need to develop that part of your brain a bit.",mailed,2025-05-12 05:26:22,31,dataengineering,t3_1kkip1h,False,

Aside that, in both cases I had to talk with stakeholders to gather requirements and have to understand hard skills to design, deploy, debug and optimize my solutions. In that meaning I think that data engineering is a subset of a software engineer, you need to know which SWE tools you should focus to solve your specific problem. That is the same for any engineer such as a front-end, back-end, computer graphics or embedded devices.Personally having experience as both for me makes me able to talk with any kind of engineer to understand how data is generated and how it can be integrated in any part of a system (from internal data generation until front-end).

If transformed in python, then also depends how custom is the transformation framework. The more custom the more SWE. Here also a lot of data analytics and modeling.- Serving data’s - same as ingestion- infra - more dev ops- security …So to sum it up: data engineering is very broad discipline.

Also not sure off the top of my head what additional destinations they may support now - original post only says ""CES on **Azure SQL Database** and **Azure Event Hubs**, with plans to expand support for additional sources and destinations in the future"".

From there, you could use whatever ADLS-compatible tooling (including Databricks, Snowflake, Microsoft Fabric, et cetera) you like for further OLAP and reporting needs.Announced here [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/blog/2025/01/15/the-year-ahead-for-sql-server-ground-to-cloud-to-fabric/](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/blog/2025/01/15/the-year-ahead-for-sql-server-ground-to-cloud-to-fabric/)Should be quite similar to [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/database/mirrored-database/azure-sql-database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/database/mirrored-database/azure-sql-database) but for SQL Server 2025.OneLake also supports ""Shortcuts"" to translate between Storage APIs and avoid you having to move all your existing data; but I'm a bit fuzzy off the top of my head whether writes **to** S3 are supported ( [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/create-s3-shortcut](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/create-s3-shortcut) ) - OneLake is not my area of expertise, especially around the Shortcuts side of things.

Airbyte is not a scalable solution especially for high volume database; whereas Fivetran gets expensive real fast. Custom Python / AWS Glue – definitely an option, but as you mentioned, can become a huge maintenance burden. Hard to scale long-term. If your goal is to stream CDC changes directly to S3 in Parquet without managing Debezium and Kafka or relying on batch jobs, there are a few CDC tools built specifically for this. One example is my company [Artie](http://www.artie.com/), which focuses on log-based replication from transactional DBs like SQL Server into cloud storage with minimal setup.

In cell-based architecture, we develop various products and services in these cells that contain a grouping of cloud-based resources. It's not uncommon to have one of those cloud-based resources be a database or storage like an S3 bucket or blob storage depending on your cloud provider. With proper isolation in the cloud, you may have a database per environment, which leaves production having production data and dev with no data.However, depending how you use the data in said database, which you didn't provide, will give you the key to handling that missing data in dev. For example, if you developed an AWS Lambda Function that needs to connect to that database, read in data, do something with it, then write it somewhere else, then you don't really need production data to test that. You can mock database connection and data to test the AWS Lambda Function code without production data or the live database connection.That being said, if you're testing things like canned reports, dashboards or even ML process, then you just need to look into generating dummy data or completely anonymizing the data much like they do in healthcare. What you **SHOULD NOT DO** is bring over production data into the lower environments because you should treat everything below production as **UNSECURED ENVIRONMENTS**. The reason for that is because until it hits production, everything should be in test mode.

Heck, single enterprise SSDs can be a lot bigger than that these days. But it depends on how much compute you need to do. Also depends on the size of your host / VM / whatever. But a modern mid to high end server can have hundreds of cores and hundreds of GB of RAM and dozens of TB of storage. I generated a certain well-known benchmark dataset at 100TB scale on a single VM once, only took like a day or two with brute force and ignorance. Granted, that VM was either one of the insane Msv2 Azure VMs, or maybe a Standard\_D96ds\_v5, been a while. And those don't come cheap if you don't work for the cloud :D .You still do have to think about multi-threading or multi-processing here - but can maybe avoid networking.B) You could try to adapt Spark APIs to SLURM.It's by no means an *easy* thing to do.

I don't see any *horrific* bash scripts in sight, but I do see an independent cluster being set up as you put it, I think.[https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/spark#Before-You-Turn-to-Spark](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/spark#Before-You-Turn-to-Spark)They also call out a few other tools (that I'm not personally very familiar with) like Modin.D) You could wrap your rust tools in a Python API using PyO3 if ease of use of those tools is a major problem?[https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3)E) Polars, perhaps?

msgf7hq,"To summarise, you have at least two classes of consumer:* One for which order **within a transaction** matters* One for which order of **each customer's transactions** mattersWhichever key you pick, the messages will be distributed based on the hash of that value. This means that even if you have something simple like an incrementing integer ID for your entities, messages with close values are no more likely to end up in the same partition than messages keyed with dissimilar values.Changing to use the customer ID does increase the likelihood of hot partitions, as there will be fewer unique values than in the current design. You can mitigate this to some extent by using more partitions, so that the work is more spread out.

mrwncjc,"You should read about Git itself, what it's purpose is, and how it works fundamentally. Git is the actual tool here, it's an industry standard version control methodology. Github is just one of many tools that harness the power of Git. You can practice using Git directly on your own machine without using any other tool (and without even using code) if you want. You can just use a text file and practice committing and merging changes to the text via git.The basics are, essentially: You have a code base. You want to make one or many changes to that code base, but you want to keep the current state intact so you dont lose your functionality. You create a branch, which is an exact copy of that same code base. You make your changes to the branch. You test the branch. If it's a failure, it doesn't matter because the ""main"" branch hasn't been modified yet. When you get it to work properly, you merge your branch into the main branch.

mrwqqjz,"I think when trying to learn it often ends up sounding more confusing than it actually is as a concept. Obviously there are layers and layers of complexity but at first I would try to understand at its core what it is. Imagine there’s a massive library of handwritten books and your team need to make various amendments to different ones. Someone has written a list of requirements for you. Your team divides up the tasks. Your first task is to remove any mentions of parrots from “My Life as a Hamster (1974)” - don’t ask why. Better not to ask too many questions in this team. To do that, you check out the single book (My life as a hamster) from the library and tell everyone else you’re doing it for transparency. You do your stuff. Now you could just go and pop the book back on the shelf as you’ve finished but what if you’ve made a mistake? Instead you put it in a little box for “review” and your other team mates can have a look and check they’re happy with your work. Once they are, it goes back in to the library. Yours is now the correct version for that book. Of course you don’t want to shut down the entire library while you do your job which is why this strategy of checking one book out, making changes, getting it reviewed and putting it back in works well. Everyone can be doing different tasks at the same time. The library itself remains central and “pure” - hopefully with your robust review box, no mistakes are getting in. The library is a single point of truth - everything in there has been approved and checked and is correct. Any mistakes are picked up in review. Now instead of a library, as a developer, what you’re working on is digital. It means that people are working on all different books (files). Sometimes people might even be working on the same book but doing a different task. While you’re doing your hamster task, someone else is updating page numbers in all rodent books including your hamster one. Sometimes this can cause a bit of confusion if you make changes to the same page but luckily Git gives you a nice simple (ish) way to fix these and decide which changes to keep when there’s such a conflict.Most importantly, to reiterate, despite all these complicated changes all happening at once, the library itself is pure and “correct” - because people cannot make changes and put the book back. They need check out books, make changes, then put it into the review box (make a pull request) and others in the team must approve it before it goes back in (gets merged in) to the library. It may help, moving away from the library analogy, to imagine the alternative. Imagine word documents named version1, version2 etc. imagine everyone trying to change it at once. Everyone saves their own local copy. But someone else has changed the same bit you were going to. Whose bit goes in? Soon nobody has any idea which version is the right one. People are no longer copying the original. - they are copying version 17. But oh wait, while you were doing something, version 18 became available and now all those changes aren’t in yours.",Schwicke,2025-05-12 13:22:14,23,learnprogramming,t3_1kkrb3i,False,

And no, you don’t need to build the next Minecraft, in fact trying to do that too early is gonna confuse you more.On the other hand, if you really want to build something, being a app, a game or wathever, then code becomes the tool but not the subject. You’ll learn plenty by doing, that's for sure, but your brain is focused on making it work, not on understanding the system. The trap is thinking the second automatically teaches the first.

I will share withou you what situation I found myself in to better illustrate this.I am building a dashboard that will show some data like system usage, uptime monitoring and some other things. I have a Raspberry Pi with a display set up for this and it will live on my desk so I can quickly reference it if needed.I needed to get the usage data from my PC to the Raspberry Pi and the solution I found was quite simpler than I initially expected: I made a Windows client that just sends data to an API and I configured a webserver on the Pi.I still needed some data from the Windows client to see if any relevant events occur, like loosing connection, getting an error or anything that should happen at runtime I would like to be notified about, maybe a few simple configurations. So I decided to make the application run headless, but having a tray icon. This helped me have a few settings in the tray menu, simple toggles, on and off. For the messages that communicate my client application’s state I chose to use notifications. So like this I have settings and feedback from the application without any actual UI.Of course it is more of a particular case creating a dedicated web server, but I eanted to ilustrate to you that there are some (maybe non-conventional) solutions, other than doing the interface in Python. I have also thought about implementing some logic on the webserver so it could send some data as a response that would trogger some change in the client’s behavios behavior. That would basically move the configuration from the tray menu to the thouchscreen display of the Pi. There are solutions, just think of what is best for your use-case!As for my reasoning, I think Python is more of a backend oriented language.

If all the web browsers supported LUA or some new language, then maybe JavaScript wouldn't be he language of choice. Additionally you could argue that TypeScript is the web development language, but it's compilation phase turns it into JavaScript...so is it TypeScript or JavaScript?I suspect Java and Android is because Java existed, was free, and android needed some language for programmers to develop in. Also JAVA is nice in that it really hides the hardware/OS from the development process. You can develop a JAVA app on Windows, Linux, MacOS and be reasonable certain it will run in the Android OS.I would ague against C++ as the king of the OS, C is more the king of the OS development. Mostly because all the popular OSes were developed when C++ had more overhead and ran slower, so writing the code in C avoided those issues. You really don't want your OS to be slowing you down. The Linux Kernel for example is all C and now Rust maybe, I'm not sure. I suspect Windows is all C. These days C/C++/Rust are good because they compile down to native CPU instructions so your program has the least amount of overhead. There is a cost however, in that you have to handle idiosyncrasies between hardware and OSes yourself. This may be as simple as just compiling for that hardware, but can have other issues.C# and games I have no comments on. My guess would be time to market, some programming languages let you produce code faster with fewer bugs, the code may not run as fast as code written in another language, but as long as it runs ""fast enough"" then people will buy it, the company will make money, and the developers will get paid, so everyone is happy.",pixel293,2025-05-14 17:50:16,6,learnprogramming,t3_1kml1l7,False,

msbd8iz,"It just depends. You have the enshrined problem (this language is used for this field, so all the tools use that language, and at some point its hard to 'break in' with another language to do the same thing, even if it would be great for it). You have the 'no can do' problems, like java has a ton of things it simply will not do without arm twisting and work arounds, like operator overloading. Not a big deal you say? Consider some linear algebra: AX=B. In C++, that could look like B = A\*X; In java that has to look like B.assign(A.multiply(X)); Now imagine an equation with 5 or 6 pieces in it written the java way... it looks nothing like the math and is hard to write, hard to read, and hard to maintain. There are several other key things java does not directly support that make it frustrating to use for some tasks, including a bizarre workaround just to have an unsigned int. Java has nice stuff too, though: it works pretty cleanly on various OS without the frustration that some C++ projects can present when porting. C# is tied heavily to windows, and windows has 'won' the gaming audience by and large. Less so today, but like the enshrined problem with languages, gaming is enshrined in windows very heavily (compared to other desktop OS). Between that and game engine support and native OS tie in, it has a leg up right away. Then you add in the pointers and other support that push it towards C++ and away from java's rigid approach, and its performance, you start to see why it pulled into the gaming industry. Java got (and deserved) a bad rep early on for being slow, and while that has been fixed in a broad sense, it still suffers from the rep and the reality (it still isn't as fast as c++ when push comes to shove). So to sort of try to answer.. its a mix of the language's performance, tools, design, and so on alongside an almost 'social' problem of getting a foothold in an area that is already dominated by something else. New languages come and go, but the ones that stick and are used heavily in any field get there by being better than what was used before. Python is kind of an oddball there, as its niche is being easy to use for hobby programmers, which is an area that has grown huge (everyone wants a little knowledge now) in the last 20 years or so.

Learning development isn't learning a language, it's learning to solve problems. How you solve those and which tools you use is another topic and most of the time you can choose between multiple tools to solve the same task. Another - in my opinion - important aspect is that you need to be able to explain complex tech heavy topics as simple as possible without using the word ""code"" once. Many companies work in agile environment with different products, roles and departments and you'll have a lot of meetings where you have to explain what you did in simple terms so that every PO understands it.

Imagine you try to write an app that opens a window, shows a pink screen, then a special effect and changes to blue. If I'm in a new language first I look at how to write a function in general. Assume we do this in python. So, at this point I only know the function syntax work, what do I do next? def makeItPink(): pass def showEffects(): pass def makeItBlue(): pass def main(): makeItPink() showEffects() makeItBlue() main()Then I thought about it and got to the conclusion ""to make a window pink, how do I get a window first?""Lookup for frameworks for GUI, choose some one and realize that I should create the window before and pass around the handler in my main, so I modify: def createWindow(): return GuiFramework.Window.new() def main(): handler = createWindow() makeItPink(handler) showEffects(handler) makeItBlue(handler)The idea is that you split what you are trying in the different steps you currently understand that happen in your app, then you try to refine every step one by one. In the process you introduce as many axillary undefined functions as you need. At every step, if you got stuck in something, you leave it as an undefined function and continue with the rest. Eventually you reach a point where no more undefined functions are left except the problematic ones and you focus on them. This doesn't apply for big projects, but people planning big projects learned how to design them by doing things! The most important part of the process is that you move to do things! Otherwise (at this beginner stage you are) you get stuck forever and don't improve!Note: If you are refining your steps and you have to see a tutorial about it, do it. You already understand why you need this step, and would focus on how to do it rather than in why.

The idea was to solve these problems by abstracting the physical layer of persistence and using relational algebra rules to optimize the logical design.But normalization must be subordinate to proper modeling of entities and meanings.For example, suppose you have a product_quantity field in a product catalog table, meaning ""units per package"", and another product_quantity field in a warehouse table, meaning ""units in stock"".Should you normalize the schema to avoid redundancy, or disambiguate the semantics first?The answer is obvious: semantics first.

You probably spent more time searching for an effortless solution than just doing simple exercises.## How do you use FPThe answer is simple: if you want to ""edit something"", you create a copie with the new values you want.Imaging doubling the elements in a list. In procedural programming, like C, you would do: ```Cfor(int i = 0; i < myarray.size(); ++i) { myarray[i] = 2 * myarray[i]}```here you are modifying the content of `myarray` in place.If you use a comprehension, then you create a copy of the list```pythondoubledarray = [2 * x for x in myarray]```## Why FP ?FP isn't as popular as procedural/OOP, which is a shame IMO.FP has a lot of benefits, for example, the non-mutability helps the compilers to optimize, you also remove the need for synchronization primitives.But that's all there is to it. FP is also less prone to poorly written code.In procedural, people (not just juniors sadly..) wll just start to code without further thinking and will put `if` here, a `loop` there, now they get the data from the database, .. it becomes a mess hard to follow. This is because they declare ""how"" to do the changes: ""take this value here, change it, reassign it, ..)(Of course, there are coding guidelines like ""short-circuiting"" or ""input-data-output"" flow, but people don't know/respecr them all the time.)Instead of telling the computer ""how"" to do it, just tell it what you want: ""double the values in the list"".I always make the junior do a bit of FP when they start, this helps them take good habits",divad1196,2025-05-11 06:50:33,3,learnprogramming,t3_1kjdboe,False,

mrphv0n,"I see you have problems understanding the lack of mutability, let me try to help. First, conceptually.Since there's no mutability, if you have a state in your app, you need to explicitly pass it around. In the most basic way your functions would have a type like this doSomethingWithState:: BoardState -> (BoardState, a)This means, I took the old state of the app, then I generated a new state with the modifications I want, and a value related to whatever this function did. If all your functions have a type like that (accepting a state and retrieving one state with modifications) then all what you have to do to ""update"" a state, is to propagate to the functions the new state. If you think about it imperatively, you may get the sensation that they are wasting a lot of memory cloning the state. The truth is that a compiler would try to optimize this to mutate in place. What? Think about it, the compiler may see (in this imperative pseudo python code) def something(state): (newState, value1)= doSomething1(state) (newNewState, value2) = doSomething2(newState) return newNewStateAs long as value1 doesnt refer to something inside newState, the compiler can see that you used the `newState` only to pass as argument and is never refer again. So it can generate code that performs updates on newState to generate newState2. The compiler may choose to do this optimization or not. That's what it means that is declarative. You stated your desire to transmit the state of the app, the compiler chooses if it would remain inmutable, or not. You stated what the final effect is and the compiler filled the details. One example where mutability is nice: If you are parsing a string s, you want to try to parse something and restore the state if it fails, without immutability you need to explicitly clone the state before trying and restore it manually it after. With immutability you only need to use the old state that is still available. About nested loops, you use recursive function, you need to capture all the variables you are regularly mutating in your imperative loop. You put all of them in a state and that's what you pass around in your recursive calls, a state modified by your recursive function. def loop(state): (s2,a) = something(state) print(a) return loop(s2) def main(): state = makeInitialState() (endState,a)=loop(state) return aA more concrete example: def sumToNImperative(n): acc =0 for j in range(n): acc+=j return acc def sumToNPure(n): return sumToNPureAux(n,0) def sumToNPureAux(n,acc): if n>0: return sumToNPureAux(n-1, acc+1) else: return acc The nice thing is that with TCO the pure version can be compiled to the equivalent for loop. Again, the optimization can or cannot happen. That depends on the compiler chooses.",omega1612,2025-05-11 05:54:29,1,learnprogramming,t3_1kjdboe,False,

msi21ld,"I’m a little late to the party but I’ve played with elixir and nix so here’s my 2 cents. When you’re writing functional and declarative, there is no such thing as a side effect. A function can read its input, and spit out something new, but it can’t touch the original data. And since you can’t modify any data, you can’t really use iterators like you usually do. You can still walk through items in a list, but instead of enumerating what your current index is, you’re simply stepping to the next item until there’s none left, applying a function to each item, and appending the result to a new list. So `result = [x*2 for x in list]` is python syntactical sugar for ``` Result = []for x in list: Result.append(x*2)```Instead of telling the computer “find the item at i index in this array, then do x to it”, you’re saying “give me the output of this function for every item in this list.”Hope this helpsEta: I think a lot of these concepts are easier to understand if you’re actively using recursion instead of loops.",obiworm,2025-05-15 19:24:41,1,learnprogramming,t3_1kjdboe,False,

Than figure out what you want this SaaS to be and start somewhere. You know Python? Great, Django seems like a good option. Don't focus on ""I need to learn backend"" or ""I need to learn frontend"", focus on rather, I have idea **A**, which needs features X, Y and Z, and I need to figure out how to build them. Pick the right tutorial's, blogs and lessons that will help you implement the features you want. Soon or later it will all come together and you will naturally fill in the knowledge gaps when building something you actually want. Plus it's fun. Fundamental's are important don't overlook them. But have fun, break problems down to their core, figure out how to solve them and what knowledge you need to get them done. I believe learning something for the sake of learning is often, a huge waste of time.

Do i need frontend?""If your real goal is to work in AI, then picking up Django or diving into backend/frontend development might not be the right first move unless you're doing it just to get a job quickly. Let's try to untangle one of the most common knots. Stack accumulation is not directly related to CS learning process. So learning Django doesn't teach you software engineering, and ""learning backend"" doesn't automatically make you good at building systems or understanding how AI works. It just makes you... someone who knows Django.Stack accumulation is something needed AFTER you formed yourself, understood what you need and you're asking yourself ""what are the best, most common, tools we can use toward this?""Or if you want to become job ready on a specific path, pretty fast.But If you're serious about AI, you'd get way more value starting from the actual foundations: data, computation, algorithms, programming principles. Learn how software works, not just how to wire things together. Then, when you build something related to AI, you’ll know how and why it works. And how to improve it.TLDR, before picking stacks, pick a direction that teaches you how to think like a builder, not just how to glue tools together.

Be dumb.If that means rarely or never using 95% of what OOP has offer, then **that's the right way to do it**!Don't use inheritance at all, unless you know it's going to save you a LOT of typing. And even then, be very careful with it, keep it absolutely minimal, and don't layer it. Especially multiple inheritance.Don't use static props and methods in your design. They are typically just a bandaid on what could otherwise be done by regular props and methods. They're mainly helpful when you code yourself into a corner and don't want to redo large bits, so don't use them in the beginning.Don't try to organize your code according to the typical OOP tutorials. It never works. Real world code is not made out of Dogs and Rectangles.If you're fighting the multimethod problem, aka if you cannot decide between doing `dog.eat(food)` or `food.eatenBy(dog)`, consider making an `Eating` class, and then call `eating.eat(dog, food)`.Use OOP mainly to encapsulate state, as in, have each object only directly talk to its own data. Don't modify values inside objects other than self. Use getters/setters. That way you can intercept the modifications and ensure that the data within the object is always consistent.Try to have classes that are either mostly/fully just data, or mostly/fully just functions. Those are your ""nouns"" and ""verbs"", analogical to the structs and functions in non-OOP languages.Be perfectly happy with making a class which is only instantiated once. In fact, most of your classes should probably be instantiated only once.""The problem with OOP is that you want a banana, but you get a monkey holding a banana, inside the rest of the jungle"" - someone else's quote.OOP is too much. It's a huge pile of features. The worst thing you can do is trying to use them all just because they exist.Consider this: goto and global variables exist too.Write a basic class that doesn't inherit anything, add regular methods, regular properties, one constructor if needed to pre-fill the properties, and then instantiate it and use it.

It's easy to read it when you know all the context and all the considerations that are part of it, but you will eventually forget it. What happens then?* Is it easy to understand *why* something a code does something? For example, you do an if check for a specific value. Is the *reason* why we do this value clear? If it's not clear, then a comment should explain it.* Is the code efficient? No need to over-optimize, but we can at least not repeat things that don't need to be repeated. For example, if you need to fetch something that doesn't change during your flow, fetch it once and use it for all relevant operations, rather than fetching it over and over. Same can be said for complex calculations.* Is the code going to external APIs too often? Most APIs are rate limited, and you don't want to overdo it in order to prevent being blocked. Even if a single flow works, what happens if the flow is invoked a few times by multiple users? Some APIs also charge you for each API use, so you want to keep costs down.* Is the context of a flow clear? For example, say a user updates their details and clicks ""Save"". Is it easy to know what user triggered this flow, when, and how? How do you know you're not accidentally saving over the wrong user's data?* Logs and tests: this is for the real world rather for academic tests, but good to keep in mind. Are there useful logs placed in strategic locations in the code to make it easy to follow along a log trail if something goes wrong?

mrs9dyx,"The general route is this: You need to know about 3 languages in this current reality, this will apply for the rest of your career:A. 1 language to take advantage of the hardware: C/C++/Rust/Go (If you're hardcore then choose Forth or Factor).B. 1 language to take advantage of pre-written libraries and eco-system: Python/Java/JavascriptC. 1 language for higher level Meta-programming: Common Lisp/Clojure/Scheme (Don't worry about Meta-programming too much as a beginner, it doesnt make sense until you are somewhat used to programming)The internet is runned on Javascript and Typescript, so you basically can't really ignore them. Python dominates the market at the moment despite slow af, just because it's simple enough and there are many libraries. My suggestion is to look at Clojure/Clojurescript, as they would give the most benefits for someone without any experience right now. The reason being Clojure is a Lisp that runs on the JVM. This way, you have the best of many worlds in one, you would have all the libraries of the Java ecosystem helping you. You then can use Clojure, which is a Lisp and is excellent for functional and meta programming, and Clojurescript compiled down to Javascript so you'll be able to leverage the webs too. (Without the need to master Javascript or Typescript, besides Clojure is much more flexible and powerful than both Javascript and Typescript)Another perk is that Clojure compiled down to Java also, so if you want to target the mobile phone too, it'll be a nice perk. Clojure's flexibility, capability and expressiveness will amaze you and ruin your taste for clunky languages.",Frenchslumber,2025-05-11 18:02:04,4,learnprogramming,t3_1kk6vz3,False,

mrwfjg7,"The general direction I’d suggest, especially if you’re in 12th grade and thinking long-term about building a startup, is to build a strong foundation across three types of programming tools, each opens up a different way of thinking and building: # A. A systems-level language (C, C++, or Rust)These aren’t beginner-friendly, but even a little exposure helps you understand how computers *really* work, memory, runtime, compilation. Rust is a good modern choice, safe, powerful, and increasingly relevant.# B. A general-purpose language with a rich ecosystemThis is where you’ll probably spend the most time. **Python** is a great choice here, simple syntax, huge ecosystem, and good for scripting, data, and automation. Alternatively, **JavaScript/TypeScript** is indispensable if you want to build anything for the web. # C. A language that stretches your thinkingIf you’re feeling curious, try a functional language like **Clojure**, **Scheme**, or **Haskell** later on. They’ll stretch your brain in all the right ways, especially around immutability and design. # On the tech startup sideIf you're dreaming of launching a product, the key thing is to **learn by building**. Tutorials are fine, but try to solve your own problems. Build a notes app. Build a tiny CMS. Build a budget tracker for your classmates.You’ll learn programming, but also:* What users care about (hint: not your code), * How to debug weird production issues, * What ""simple"" really means when you’re maintaining something alone. And along the way, don’t ignore the command line, basic Git, and Linux tooling. Those aren't trendy, but they’ll save you countless hours.When I started working on what eventually became my own startup, the early tech choices weren’t dictated by popularity or benchmarks; they were guided by how fast I could test ideas and how well I understood the tools I was using.

To give you an overview of some other choices, read this (from the Kotlin programming language): https://kotlinlang.org/docs/async-programming.html Anyway, while we're talking about other choices, the Go programming language offers Goroutines. I think the Kotlin programming language also offers some sort of Coroutine type functionality. The Scala programming language offers The Actor Model in the form of Akka (you can search for ""Scala Akka"" or ""actor programming model"" for more information). Akka can also be used with recent versions of the Java programming language even though it was written in Scala (both Java and Scala run on the JVM). Microsoft and C# ported Akka over to their platform with Akka.NET . The Erlang programming language has its own implementation of the actor model which I assume is sort of similar to Akka. Also, a lot of programming languages (like Kotlin, Scala, and Haskell) offer some sort of parallel immutable data structures with built-in automatic multithreading. Oh, and in a lot of cases programming languages use async callbacks/promises, like JavaScript. C# has its own async keyword and await keyword for that purpose. The Scala programming language has its own implementation of Futures, which facilitates multithreading and asynchronous programming and is sort of like JavaScript callbacks/promises. Kotlin has a suspend keyword and libraries for working with that sort of asynchronous stuff.But yeah, in real world software, low-level multithreading should be your last resort, not your first.",Anonymous_Coder_1234,2025-05-11 06:16:18,3,learnprogramming,t3_1kjtyc1,False,

This is different in Rust, where suddenly changing to a multithreaded implementation will simply result in the compiler refusing to build the code until you fix everything, and this is also one of the reasons why I wonder why people are still choosing to start new projects in C++ these days.Regarding your specific problem, if you decide to listen to my advice and reimplement everything from scratch, I recommend looking up the Entity Component System architecture, which would greatly benefit your project, minimize potential threading problems (or completely eliminate them in the case of Rust), and maximize both CPU cache efficiency and thread parallelization.

I highly doubt it, unless it's a very niche situation like that one.I mostly use VS Code, by the way, because for my workflows that's the fastest and most efficient, and it has extensions for all the tools I need.

So as much as like the command-line and keybinds, I prefer the more visual approach, where I can swap over to the mouse at certain times (for for certain workflows). I prefer VSCode (even though I program on Linux).That said, you can use Vim keybinds (and custom keybinds) in VSCode, and you can use VSCode keybinds in Vim.Overall, I'd argue that Vim will slow you down (at least at first), and you're better off trying it out later when you have some more experience under your belt. With Vim, once you get a grasp on everything you're doing, all of your macros, and map all of your keybinds perfectly... you'll be blazing fast. Editing code, refactoring code, and navigating between functions, files, and folders will be instant. But getting there is HARD and, debatably, acute speed isn't a huge priority when it comes to writing code, or writing quality code.I'd say, in regards to people I've worked with who use Vim, they're typically ""not faster than me at all"" or they're something like ""10% faster than me at best"". There's always the rare exception, the sweaty nerd who's so good at Vim that they're flying through code and edits at light speed, but they're rare, and I'd suggest that ""it has more to do with them"" than it does ""Vim"".

Linux uses .elf, MacOS uses Mach-O, Windows uses PE ( I might be referencing old info here ).An executable and linkable format usually contains 3 possible forms:1. An end executable, which is an object file that has been linked, and it holds several things, like .code section, .data section, can also hold dynamic data if it links against a dynamic lib.2. An archive or static library, which is an agglomerate of object files, that are solely meant to be used as files to be linked against during compile time.3. A dynamic library, which is an object file, with a special format, that allows it to be placed on some part of the memory, and allows any program to link against it during load time.How does the overall loading process occur? Well it's actually quite expensive and full of things.

I know plenty of good things that have failed and plenty of crappy things succeed(Home Advisor). There's the old quote from Ford, ""If I asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.""I am getting constant negative feedback on my BIG personal project and that only gives me more commitment to the cause and it will take years to complete. I can see the Matrix and I know they're wrong. 100% wrong in every way. They just don't see what I see. And my idea isn't unique just very rare and I've seen it in action. The businessman I'm taking it from has made five $100,000,000 businesses from it, and one of them trades on the NYSE.My few month projects are to fill in gaps I see in the SMB space. Like an inventory app. Inventory is relatively easy. There are very few platforms that do JUST inventory. Usually its bundled with with custom scanners and printers and a POS system, or an MRP/ERP, or some other PM suite. Excel is a half measure here. Or a PTO tracker, which is ALWAYS bundled with an HR suite. Payroll drives so much of SMB software decisions and every system is missing something.>How many businesses are you dealing with?

But, let's just say that I was provided the opportunity to explore this entrepreneurial endeavor with some assurances and I'm not concerned at all about the solvency of my business in the short or long term.If you have concerns about bandwidth, I have existing and on-going business relationships with several established firms and individuals that exist inside and outside this country. Due to the range of unique requests I get from my clients that require specialized expertise the expense of a subcontractor is no different than the cost of burden to staff my own business. With my approach I get to leverage the different expertise of each firm rather than to be locked into a few skillsets. In addition to all of that, my business structure gives me the ability to scale based on project requirements without having to resort to end of project layoffs.Of course I am continuing to internally contract a few very qualified persons for a premium, but I am fortunate enough to have the luxury to take my time and cherry pick the right people. Typically these are not customer facing engineers unless the project requirements demand face-to-face or on-site time. I will be your point of contact, and available to contact 24/7. I'm not looking to be the next Facebook, I'm looking to establish a few quality business relationships that will last for years, ideally until I retire and pass the business on to my successor.I understand if this dynamic doesn't appeal to you. Not every contractor is for every client, and the last thing I want is to enter a business relationship where one side is unhappy.

ms26vtm,"Recently I freelanced for a UI-focused company, and I picked up some interesting practices from how they structure their frontend work. They use Tailwind for styling and Next.js for everything else. Here’s a breakdown of their approach:**Start with a clear theme**They rely on design tokens to keep things simple and consistent across the UI. It helps centralize color, spacing, and typography decisions early on.**Component architecture: two clear categories**- Templates:These are dumb components. They just display what’s passed in via props. No state, no logic. In Next.js, these are implemented as server components.- Traditional components:These do the heavy lifting: handle state, run computations, etc. They render templates and manage the layout. - **Avoid prop drilling by leaning into composition**Most components accept a children prop. That, combined with smart layout components, makes it easy to nest and compose without passing props down five layers.**Type safety everywhere**They use TypeScript, and schemas are defined using Zod.Types are derived from the Zod schemas, so you get strong typing and runtime validation in one go.**Always validate backend data**First thing they do with any data from the backend: run it through Zod. If it doesn’t match the schema, it gets rejected. This protects the app from unexpected API changes or malformed data.**Some of my own preferences that I mix in:**- For complex state, I like using a reducer. It can grow big, but having all actions in one place keeps things maintainable. Plus, reducers are easy to unit test.- For simple state, I lean on signals (when available). They’re lightweight and reactive, perfect for local UI state.- I’ve also grown to like the “crash fast” philosophy: use assertions to catch incorrect assumptions early.

msiqqyg,"Generally with ui dev, you will want info to flow in a single direction control -> model -> view where the control is simply the way the program receives input, the model is the internal model of the program, in a game this will be the simulation, and the view is how this is all displayed. Now this is a broad model of how a ui program works, there are many other paradigms used, however in event driven architectures it can mostly be boiled down to mvc or model view control. With games or any ui program with a simulation info does kind of loop in the simulation/model. But this still doesn't really break the previous statement, how paradox games work is in the event handling side of things it is basically 2 steps repeated over and over: get players input then compute new state, when one of the players is lagging what happens is its basically blocking on the get players input stage, the simulation doesn't look at real time it looks at simulations slices (ticks), and so to the simulation everything comes in at the same time, but at the get players input we know that isn't true.

msipel9,"essentially the engine paradox games are built in (like stellaris, cities skylines, europa universalis, victoria, hearts of iron etc.) have a dynamic tick speed that throttles based on cpu usage so you never really FEEL lag. Instead the game just runs slower and it takes longer to pass time in the game. Rimworld has a similar system where it aims for a set tick amount per second and throttles to a slower tick speed to try and prevent lag by slowing the game down.Lets say your cpu can handle 100 calculations per tick. In essence what happens is if over the course of the game you go from 100 calculations per tick up to 1000 calculations per tick over the course of a game, then the tick speed will get 10x slower by the end and you shouldn't in theory see your computer drop below 60 fps",TheSassyfrasLife,2025-05-15 21:18:54,1,learnprogramming,t1_msioc9j,True,

One for the simulation and one for UI and displaying.Assuming you can always handle UI and display at 60fps (which can never be guaranteed), then if you drop below 60fps, you first only slow down the simulation, to give yourself more time to display.If you break up the simulation into tiny, very short ticks, for example by not simulating the entire world in lockstep, then you can essentially cut off the simulation at virtually any moment.So, your UI can be 60 fps, you can zoom around and move your mouse, but if you look at your characters up close, they're moving slower than they should. Well, and if it becomes too slow, it's probably worth sacrificing some FPS to recover some simulation speed.

There is clearly a disconnect between how you see yourself and how they see the role that you are employed to operate.I’d also encourage you to bring some of these questions to these people. “What’s the point in leading meetings, id rather just listen to the subject-matter experts” is a question that I’d bet they would be happy to expand on, for example.Technical leadership is difficult, and for better or worse, the higher levels of engineering are just as much about people and process as they are about technology.

The market is tough right now and you're going to have to suck it up and basically throw everything you have at this if you truly want it. Each thing your do here increases your chances of success: Before interviewing- leetcode hard, follow neetcode roadmap to fill in theoretical gaps in knowledge, once you have an interview focus on problems given from that company leading up to interview- time every leetcode problem to 40 minutes. Don't look up the answer until you finish the timer. Every single time you fail to solve a problem, work aggressively to ameliorate your weaknesses. - come up with a methodical problem solving process. Don't just change things and run them praying it works, get good at thinking about what you're going to do to your program and similating the output before even typing. Get good at running your own test cases against your code in your head rather than relying on printf debugging- get as many swe interviewers you can to give you mock interviews and giving you mock interviews- fill any gaps in your text stack that you may have (frontend should be angular, react, nextjs and typescript, backend should be Java , spring boot, postgres, mongo, redis)- brush up on AWS knowledge of core services including networking, security and databases, - build example projects that actually work and document them very well on your GitHub and publish live links to your portfolio site and GitHub. This is a good chance to combine both stack knowledge gaps and AWS knowledge gaps all in one shot- create a portfolio siteSomewhere in the middle of the above after some leetcode and projects are under your belt:- dont be as stringent about pay- expand the set of rules you're searching for (i.e. SWE, SDE, SDET, full stack, backend, frontend, SRE, ops, devops, etc...)- be willing to relocate- get as many swe interviewers reading your resume as you can- ensure your indeed, LinkedIn and resume are fully beefed up and peer-reviewed- don't just cold apply. That's completely useless. Cold message recruiters, hiring managers, team members, random recruiters / hiring managers on LinkedIn, connect with family members, old colleagues, old peers, anyone and everyone. Don't seem too desperate, don't ask strangers for referrals. - always smile, be punctual, dress appropriately, take your time, make the interviewers feel comfortable like it's a conversation and not an interview, show no ego whatsoever, appear extremely eager to learn, admit when you don't know something rather than guess and embarrass yourself, have a list of thought provoking and insightful questions to dazzle interviewers, and AGGRESSIVELY ask for feedback and FERVENTLY correct all of your mistakes every single interview, after enough interviews there will be no more mistakes left. Most importantly...- keep your head up, realize that if you keep trusting in the process you will come out ahead.

It is your responsibility as the senior reviewing PRs to provide feedback to the person making the pull request that enables them to address your concerns with their code.OP, your issue here is that Mr.Newbie isn't pulling from your developer branch to merge the latest set of already merged code into their code, assuming your org is using *proper* version control guidelines of developers having personal branches per story, the team having a dev branch for every sprint and PRing work from the stories to the dev branch, then the dev branch to the main demo branch, then the demo branch to the production branch for use by the users. If your org is managing branches properly, the issue here is that Mr.Newbie wasn't pulling from the developer branch before PR'ing their branch to the dev branch. These conflicts tend to happen when multiple people are working on the same file. If anything, your frustration at this common inconvenience is itself indicative of a relative lack of experience working with version control in a group setting. **Try to be understanding of what it is like to be inexperienced with unfamiliar tools and a good mentor for the newhire.** Everyone is new to these tools at some point in their career, even you.Once you are both pulling from dev before PRing to dev, you'll have to *intelligently handle any merging conflicts on your local build***, so be sure to push your changes before pulling to ensure you don't lose any work if you make a mistake.** Try to become a mentor for the newhire and retain a positive attitude about the team expanding. You should make an effort to find ways to gain visibility for your mentorship and beat the drum of how much progress you've made with training the newhire to resolve these issues during your scrums so that you get credit for the effort.

You shouldn’t be asking if your experience gets you $X, but rather if your resume (and interview skills) can get you into a FAANG-level company. Given the job market, this means you need something that makes you stand out on paper and in person. Also, I would recommend not doing a PhD unless you’re really, really passionate.

You can read the code it outputs, but trust me - you can't understand it. Learning programming up to professional level is all about hitting those walls for weeks at time before it all ,,clicks''. You're saying that it would take 4x as long to learn - I'm saying that it's probably 20-30x longer - and that's the process that you consider ,,skipping'' now.Consider this: If OpenAI has a week long outage can you be productive or do you take that week off because it's like someone turned your brain off?To work in this industry, you **need** to be able to code, brainstorm and reason about the flow of logic in a big complex project. If you don't do it, you're maybe 20% better than a rando of a street after 2 weeks of crash course on vibe coding because you have algo/ds classes over him.

A few years ago, following something like this would almost gaurantee you a job. THAT IS NOT THE CASE ANYMORE. Without a degree, and without experience, practically no company in America will hire you for a CS related job. No matter how skilled you are, it doesnt matter because there are so many good candidates with degrees struggling. Why would a company do the effort to evaluate you, when they can spend that effort interviewing people with a CS degree. Maybe in the future, something like this and bootcamps will be viable again. But I don't see that happening anytime soon. If you want to work in this field, you need a degree at the bare minimum. Something like WGU would at least get you past the automated resume checker. This pathway would not. Following something like this, if you were lucky and skilled, might lead to a job where you are underpaid and overworked to get your foot in the door at best.

mrfvqat,"Roadmap is really solid.The issue is the degree is looked at as a minimum requirement nowadays for most entry level jobs. People do get lucky, and I mean lucky, and get jobs without degrees, but it’s few and far between currently. To note, I am only talking about post 2022 to present. Before 2022, the need for junior level developers was a lot higher, but with outsourcing and AI, junior level tasks no longer need an associate to complete. Not to mention during Covid, overhiring was ramped and some companies are still trimming the fat with layoffs.As a graduate you are expected to have atleast one internship under your belt, with a year of experience, and a deep understanding of CS. CsMajors who lack a portfolio or skills will not make it through technical interviews but will beat out ATS filtering because of the degree. I would say also, the notion the average CS major can’t code is relatively false on average, an average CS graduate is relatively capable, but there is roughly bottom 20% who are completely lost. Now keep in mind there are fewer jobs in SWE then their used to be, and more CS graduates both in Bachelors and Masters programs then ever before. Most good companies will receive 100s of applicants and have only 2 jobs available. From a business perspective, why not filter by degrees and get an academically strong candidate with experience and a portfolio. To beat this out you will likely need a strong open source portfolio, with live production level applications and very good networking, I can not emphasize this enough, without a degree you will need to be well networked. It’s possible but it is an uphill battle often as you don’t have the resources of college students or a piece of paper saying you know what you know.

You don’t need to pick a major right away, and you should explore that especially in the first year or so.2. I would say, you should ask yourself what is something YOU would want to build, and try to find resources online that tell you how to build it. It doesn’t have to be anything crazy, maybe a small tip calculator project or something. If it’s something you can figure out, and you find that you enjoy doing it, then there’s a good chance that you’ll enjoy a career in CS and could potentially figure it out in time. If you find that it’s too confusing to do even a small simple project or that you absolutely hated doing it, then this is probably not the career for you. Most engineers would tell you, the reason they enjoy CS is that feeling you get when you spent hours trying to figure out how to do that one thing and FINALLY figure it out. There is no better feeling. The reason I got into programming was because I liked making mods for games.3.

All it takes is one management change, one bad/good quarter, hell even one SWE hire can flip a team's culture upside down. It's only a matter of time.With that knowledge, I hold onto a good WLB for as long as it stays good. I have no interest in job hopping just to make some more money, I already make plenty. When the WLB is good, I couldn't care less if I'm underpaid. I know full well those small 1-5% annual raises don't keep me up with the market, and I'm perfectly OK with that. Once the WLB changes for the worse, and I'm *forced* to job hop is when I'll get the nice salary bump to be re-adjusted to market rate.$40k-$55k extra wouldn't make me consider leaving an otherwise good gig for even a moment. Irrespective of market, but it's doubly true in bad markets.

mrd79vl,"If by ""big tech"", you're also thinking of FANG, I can speak to that as I was in a similar situation in my career. I've made the transition from startups and mid-sized, low-billions-valuation companies to FANG. It wasn't hard for me to get interviews, as this was many years ago when FANG recruiters would reach out on LinkedIn and such. It was harder to get offers (there's more luck involved than anyone tells you), but I managed to do it by Leetcoding and really trying to understand the algorithms and patterns instead of memorizing solutions. There has been Leetcode escalation since my time there, but I don't have enough interview experience these days to tell you how much.I think if you're just in it for the TC and/or life experience to be at a FANG/Fortune 5 company first hand, then definitely at least try it so you don't feel like you missed something. I'm glad I did just so I knew what it was like.I would recommend against it if you are expecting to seriously level up your dev game. If you're already a highly productive dev at your company and you deliver things faster than your peers and understand all of the tradeoffs of your tech, then you probably won't learn as much as you might think. You'll probably just learn how to use their old, custom tools that solve the same problems you've already solved at your startup but with more popular, open-source tools. Some of what you hear about crazy WLB is because at one point (and maybe still, I don't know) FANG was hiring a ton of new grads who didn't know anything and then were dropped in the deep end. I wasn't at FANG very long, but I still saw many interns and new grad hires cycle through my team and it seemed like a lot of what they didn't like were just things they didn't know because they had no other work experience.I can't say it was the right move career wise because I'm personally of the belief that FANG doesn't have the reputation it once had and could be off-putting to some in this hyper-polarized society we live in now. Many of my teammates at a local company would actively trash FANG and viewed people who worked there as being active and willing participants in hurting society (not joking). At the very least, I suspect saying you worked at FANG today will be kind of like hearing another dev tell you about how they worked at Yahoo in the '90s.

For me, that's easy to deal with: everything we do must be towards some goal, I can get that done with the team, and management makes sure that impact/effort ratio remains high.After all, what I want for everyone on my team is to have a good, impactful review period which translates into good reviews.

Then there’s the question of why you’re looking for a new job so soon, and by that point it’s probably a tough sell unless you have a good referral that can vouch for you (also unlikely with only 1 YOE).By all means apply for roles that you find interesting and aren’t much of a stretch, but you’re up against some decent headwinds that will affect your success rate.",funkbass796,2025-05-09 09:13:45,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1kib4yw,False,
mrgjyav,"WIth 1 YOE apply to junior level roles (i.e. Jr Engineer, SWE1, etc). Plenty of jobs would take you but I get the market is tough. I think it's fine to have a similar resume as you dont really have that much experience so they may see you as a college grad hire with some experince. Add your current experience and when asked, tell them more or less what you said here. Say you felt the job wasnt in line with what you wanted for yourself. As for promotions, it may hold you back a year. Really depends on job and on you. Promotions arent really due to YOE. It's a factor but really promotions are due to your output. If your output is expected than expect 2-3 years to get promoted. If you always over-perfrom expect to get promoted quickly. It's easier to go from SWE1 to SWE2 than it is to SWE2 to Sr SWE. Basically the higher you go up the harder it becomes to go to the following level. So you aren't really in a bad position. If you try to overperform your first year you may get promoted between 12-18 months at the job.",Broad-Cranberry-9050,2025-05-09 18:15:52,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1kib4yw,False,

I appreciate being considered, but no. best case scenario you say this and they say ok and do not ask any follow up questions.2. (If asked why), I want to keep focusing on my current responsibilities as an IC over taking on a new role at this time. I feel my contributions are best delivered as me working as an IC. I am not yet in a place in my career where I am interested in exploring a managerial position. I know these kinds of opportunities only come so often, but I would still rather focus on my IC work at this time than step into this team lead role.If you stick to just ""no"" and ""I want to focus on my job as an IC"" as your two talking points, you really don't give them much room to try and convince you otherwise. it won't come off like you are looking for other work, it will just look like you prefer to be an IC and don't want to be a manager, which is common.",CVisionIsMyJam,2025-05-13 19:41:55,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1klqtq7,False,
