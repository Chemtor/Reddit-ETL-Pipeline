mvqu8my,"There is also the rampant confusion between doing data quality checks, and testing your code.Data quality checks are just going to verify that the actual data is as expected. Testing your code on the other hand should focus on the code logic only, and if data needs to be involved, then it should not be actual data, but mock data (Maybe inspired by issues encountered in production).Then you control the input and have an expected output. Therefore the only thing that is controlled is your code.While I see teams go for data quality checks (like DBT tests), I rarely see code testing (doable with dbt-unit-tests, but tedious).",ManonMacru,2025-06-03 10:22:37,168,dataengineering,t3_1l26xgo,False,
mvr9bzt,"I need to headline acknowledge that this is complex and generalisations are always going to struggle on a topic like this. And I'm likely to get downvoted for a practical non-theory answer, I know.BUT...Data engineering and software engineering are two different disciplines, so you can only draw parallels so far. And within data engineering, there's a huge difference between (1) a pipeline that supports a piece of software used by millions, or on which lives (any number, small or large) might depend, and (2) a pipeline that just ensures Sally from accounts payable can see the latest invoices in her report, which she only looks at once a month anyway, and occasionally forgets to look without anything bad happening.The same difference exists within software engineering, between that million-user piece of software and a script running on a server in a medium sized business to do something useful but not business critical, and that hasn't had a code change in 4 years. Those two things won't (or at least shouldn't) have the same amount of testing effort even if the same software engineer did both. Ditto for the two data pipelines. Ultimately, testing of any sort takes time that could be spent on other things, so for a business, it needs to provide more value than it costs, or you shouldn't do it. I see people forgetting this sometimes. Nobody should do testing purely dogmatically, except perhaps for FOSS projects, and any kind of libraries, which are a very different story. Another angle is that user-facing software typically has lots of code branches, conditionally-executed code, and complex object interactions. Data software _might_ have that too (in which case it has the same potential for testing), but it might be very simple and linear. If running a pipeline executes every line of code in the project - isn't running it an adequate test for a reasonable swathe of test conditions?",sjcuthbertson,2025-06-03 12:14:38,31,dataengineering,t3_1l26xgo,False,

For example just automatically converting tables to pandas dataframes and processing that way could cause some big inefficiencies, especially if you could just perform the operation in SQL to start.A good place to start might be to look at your existing pipelines and process and figure out where the rubbing points are and seeing if that's a place Python could help with.",full_arc,2025-05-30 15:27:46,17,dataengineering,t3_1kz6t8f,False,

Nobody can really disagree with that without sounding bad themselves.

mvvginy,"Part of our job would be to show why these practices are important. However, they may or may not listen. This isn't limited to just Data Engineering, this is true for all software engineering practices.There is no one right way to do this, so you'll have to figure out what works for you and your company. Here's a couple of things that have worked for me in the past (does not always work, but you can always try)1. Making them feel the pain - when pipelines break, make it known. Send an incident report email to everyone hen it happens. As you're fixing it, give updates, even if the update is still investigating. If they ask why its taking so long, let them know about the ""right"" work we have chosen not to do, and why it is making things slower to fix. This is especially important on data that is used in highly used reports. Connect these ""best practices"" to things that they care about.2. Insisting on specific practices - sometimes you just need to stand your ground and say THIS IS THE WAY WE ARE DOING THINGS. This is tough to do, especially if you don't have a high position in the company, but from the sound of things, you are the only data engineer, and you are the subject matter expert on the engineering pipelines. You will most likely not be able to say to them that you'll spend a month to ""fix"" the pipelines and make sure they are following best practices, but at the very least, for newer pipelines, you can insist on a few practices. Maybe automated data quality checks and alerts.3. Do things that bring value. While us engineers want to take the time and effort to design things well, and to make sure things are running well, what business cares about is always value - can I get my report in time? Can I trust the data that I see? Any best practice you want to do, or introduce into your work, should always be connected to something that matters to them. There is no use in doing medallion architecture if it means we will need to stall everything for months, without new reports, or fixing current issues. People will be more willing to go with you if they can see that what you want to do will fix issues that they care about. In this case, your lead seems to be focused on the powerBI reports - ask him, what things about the reports are bugging him? what does he think we need to fix in those reports? Can he think of things that will make it easier to build reports? Any dataset that would be commonly used? What issues in the data do they constantly see? If you can connect your practices to these items, it will increase the likelihood of them agreeing with you.Finally though, there is a limit to what you can do. I think a lot of people of this thread has basically said - time to give up, and look for a different job. And there is truth to this - sometimes people just don't know what the best thing to do is, and isn't willing to listen, even to subject matter experts. OR sometimes, they don't care about the long term, and only care about the short term. If your values don't align with theirs - leave. Find a company that cares about what you care about.

The “default tool” is often whatever the least-technical person understands, not what scales. You’re not crazy or missing anything; what you’re seeing is just bad design, period.2. **You** ***can*** **find real data engineering work.** Look for companies that actually value automation, code quality, and actual engineering best practices. Hint: If they use Databricks, Airflow, or even just ADF (with dynamic patterns and metadata logging), you’re more likely to find serious teams. **In interviews,** ask how they handle orchestration, monitoring, and tech debt. If they can’t answer, that’s a red flag... share how you’d do it instead and see how they respond.3. **With your current team:** Quantify the pain. Estimate hours lost to debugging, tech debt, slow refreshes, and cloud spend. Reference stats (e.g., Gartner: bad data/processes cost orgs \~$13M/year). **Write it up**! Put it in an email, a slide deck, or a doc, so the business impact is clear and visible. Propose practical alternatives: dynamic pipelines, metadata logging, or just consolidating flows so you’re not maintaining 100+ separately. Sometimes, seeing wasted hours or dollars is what finally gets through to non-technical leads.4. **If they won’t listen?** You’ve done your best, don’t let their lack of vision drag you down.

mvfytmu,"I was in a similar situation to yourself and some advice that's helped me over the years:- Get a Mentor, you'll find yourself mentoring others but that can sometimes restrict your own development and make things stale. Having a good mentor can help steer your own career. Working in FAANG it shouldn't be difficult to find one and they don't always need to be within your own reporting lines.- Teach, don't do. You'll find yourself a lot just fixing juniors problems but not solving the underlying issue. The teach a man to fish anecdote is so applicable and you'll feel less uncomfortable with them struggling. Failure is a part of learning so treat it like that for them.- Be informally formal. Imposter syndrome at your age is always rife and I too had the same issue. I ended up on a training course for working at an enterprise level and raised the same challenge with the trainer. The main learning was reading the situation and being yourself where applicable. The imposter syndrome is hard to shake but it'll get easier with time.- Most importantly, make time for yourself and your own development. You'll find yourself putting more time on others and taking a leading role. However don't forget to take your training days and learn.

Good things to measure are: * SLA availability/uptime* MTTA/MTTR for any pipeline failures* reconciliation (are all records captured from point A present at point Z)* number of errors * costif you can measure these few things, you can describe to your stakeholders the value that you add. It's really transformational to measure yourself. Even if you are consistently shit and not hitting appropriate benchmarks, you can highlight to management that you need more resources.

Without their participation, it would be an exercise in futility, if not a tremendous waste of time, trying to find the metaphorical ""one piece"" treasure, without any knowledge of what and where it is.

Some odd configuration requirements, but setting up the Schedules etc is very easy.Prefect, is my personal favourite, does orchestration and does it very well, has awesome support for some complex implementations, works well with any python package you decide to run, i personally like dlt or polar. Dagster, its an incredibly powerful tool, it has some incredibly features like sensors and automaterialization, however, the amount of fuck around to do some things like complicated incremental loads is a headache, especially because the way it's been designed almost forcing you to do things a certain way.I dont like the amount of inline written sql in dagsters documentation, seems like a huge fuckin liability ah, this should be handled through schema drift detection, it should be more flexible in that sense like dlt is, so easy to set up incremental loads, use state to prevent additional loads of already processed records.It feels like a serious amount of vendor lock in, im sure the software devs love it, because they want the intense finetuned control, but it'll become a headache long term.I also find retrieving data real time from the database to control current loads via looking for gaps in data or controlling max or min dates ranges for countries for example is much easier in dlt which works better with prefect or airflow mo.Dagster is amazing, I still use it, im keen to get more experienced but fuck me the documentation feels messy, 100 ways to do everything, constantly running into ""that's the old way"" It seems like a bloated tool... and that's compared to airflow which has been around more than twice as long.I'd go with prefect or airflow unless the team are software devs, they'll prefer dagster but it'll become a huge liability when the team grows imo",Snoo54878,2025-05-31 14:36:09,4,dataengineering,t3_1kz7tje,False,

mw7j9n2,They’re going to have a huge uphill battle. Delta and Iceberg formats started working together and now they converged as of the latest iceberg release. So you can have both iceberg (e.g for snowflake support) and delta (e.g for databricks / open source delta spark support) metadata on the same parquet. Hudi already took the back seat.

mw8hr3u,"Yes sorry, currently it’s duckdb doing the querying because I don’t think Postgres has a native parquet reader and isn’t really built around columnar storage. Although for smaller writes the data is stored within the database itself, so it is doing the planning for that. Obviously under the hood duckdb is querying for the metadata and then executing the query. I thought you were saying that when using duckdb you had to attach to the Postgres, then write the metadata query, then use that info to write your main data query. So what I was saying was that you just attach duckdb to the Postgres db and then you can start writing queries in duckdb as if the Postgres db actually contained the data.But yes even that might be too much for less tech savvy users. Plus other db formats that are able to read parquet files could implement the ducklake format more natively so that they are both the repository and the query planner.

I really love their branch based development where you can tested your code with production datasets as input (fall back option) to your current dataset under development. I personally am a huge fan of their data lineage tool. Unlike other data platforms creating a pipeline or a DAG can be done in a few mins. They have thought through all these concepts way ahead and in my opinion their platform is way ahead of other solutions. Foundry had this concept of table format way before Iceberg or delta got popular. One take away I have is if your organization needs a data platform that needs traditional data warehousing alot Foundry sucks in that area. This is a great solution for Extraction and Transformation but if your organization depends on datasets mostly for creating charts and dashboards with strict SLAs.

mvy96hh,I am going offer a different perspective one that is centered around permissions. Lets say you put your ETL logic inside your orchestrator for 2 use cases1. Extracting data from an RDS instance2. Extracting data from an external API endpoint You have to give permissions to the orchestrator (most likely ECS task) to access the RDS instance and also secrets such as API key and RDS password. But let us say the ETL logic lives outside (separate ECS tasks) then the orchestrator essentially only needs permissions to kickoff those tasks. The individual tasks get separate permissions to access their specific instances. This is in line with the least privilege principle often recommended for defining permissions.Giving the orchestrator too much permissions is exposing you to a lot of risk. There are some newer approaches like the ETL logic is defined in the orchestrator but the flow/task itself runs in a specific pre-defined compute which seems like a better balance. So if you do want to put it all in the orchestrator make sure you leverage such an approach.,anatomy_of_an_eraser,2025-06-04 13:49:02,8,dataengineering,t3_1l327w2,False,

Right now I'm taking an entrepreneurial class that's helping me refine my pitch in my financial forecasting models and stuff like that. My idea much like your own is that analyst team still spend a lot of time doing data prep writing connectors. I've been doing it for so long that I can pretty much do it with my eyes closed so I would love to build a system you know that's managed version controlled it's got row level security, everything is a description attached to it easy to use for anybody including non-technical people. So far I've got one client, but they are a bit more involved it's helping me keep afloat in the meantime. They pay 5,000 usd monthly and do a lot of things manually have a lot of data sources that are pretty complicated Don't have API connector stuff like that. I've got lots of insights but no diamonds yet. At first I tried really small businesses like Mom and Pop shops around town, it was really hard to educate them and also they have no money. Some other key things I learned is that in person referrals are worth their weight in gold if someone else can sing your praises then the person that they're singing to doesn't really need to do any further validation that you will be able to solve their problems. This is hand in hand with finding complimentary businesses that might need to outsource their work. So if you can meet with as many people who do similar work they may eventually have work for you. The other thing is social media if you can manage to figure out what your customers paying points are specifically and then regularly make content around it that may produce leads for years to come. I suppose alternatively completely cold outreach has not worked for me yet. I tried messaging on LinkedIn I've tried to emailing people, mind you not in the hundreds but rather and let's say the tens. But still 0% response rate on any of that and most of the time you just get ignored. After a lot of talking and thinking I realized that I'm really trying to solve my own problem as an analyst for so many years. So I'm doing a micro pivot and trying to focus on helping maybe slightly technical marketing teams or analyst and scientist teams that struggle with disconnected data sources and they would like a modeled data warehouse as a service. Including all of the business metrics reports dashboards The whole works. My pricing is pretty similar to yours, depending on the number of data sources I was thinking somewhere in the ballpark of 4,000 to $10,000 for a setup, and then a retainer feed to manage everything going forwards anywhere from you know 500 to $5,000.

mvumgxs,"I've done this for years as a side gig. I didn't have the advantage of relationships that could give me access to companies from the jump. The general flow is:Find clients: Upwork Upwork has significantly declined in volume and quality of clients lately so unsure if this route is still ok for beginners. In ODesk times and the earlier days of Upwork it was way easier to find quality clients. I worked for a very large well known production studio after slogging through lower quality clients in the beginning. Once you find clients you can start to build relationships with the good ones, and you'll start to get referrals from them to others. Pricing: Don't do flat pricing with new clients. Charge per hour and then once a relationship is built you can discuss flat pricing. Overall most clients think of things in terms of ""If I pay X, I get Y"". As engineers/analysts we know it doesn't work that way (bugs come up, requirements change mid-project etc.) but when you have discussions around pricing try to build in this uncertainty when you make hourly estimates. Anything longer than a 30 min intro discussion gets billed. Pitfalls: \-""I don't have a budget"" does not mean they have no budget, it means they don't have enough technical background to know what something takes and haven't done any due diligence to try to ballpark it. \-Intense technical grilling at the onset of the discussion. I've found that clients that do this are the opposite of the above client. You will never appease them because they think they've figured it all out and if you deviate from their plan they'll get upset. \-""Ideas"" clients. Sometimes a client will come with some vague idea of what they want. They won't be able to answer even the most basic questions because they want you to fill in the gap.

mv77ig1,"Analytics Engineer here. While your current role might not feel like pure data engineering, it is still giving you valuable exposure to tools and processes that are widely used in the field.Writing ingestion scripts in PySpark and creating views for analysts may seem simple, but these tasks are part of a much bigger pipeline. You are interacting with Databricks and the lakehouse architecture, which many companies are still trying to implement. This means you're in a strong position to understand modern data workflows from the inside.If you're concerned about limited learning opportunities, try exploring what surrounds your current tasks. Ask about the scheduling systems they use for ingestion, whether it's something like Airflow or another orchestration tool. Learn how they handle data quality and transformation. These areas can give you new learning opportunities without needing to change your role immediately.For self learning, continue strengthening your Python and SQL skills. Then branch out by focusing on the tech you're already exposed to. Look deeper into Spark optimization, Delta Lake, and how Databricks operates in cloud environments. You can also study data pipeline orchestration using tools like Airflow or Prefect. Tools like dbt are also helpful for managing transformations.If you prefer structure, try building a small personal data project. For example, collect data with Python, store it in a cloud database, process it using PySpark or Pandas, and visualize it using a dashboard tool like Streamlit or Power BI. This hands-on work will connect the dots and show you how the tools work together.The internship you have now is just a stepping stone. You are not stuck.

Based on that experience I wouldn't choose it as a general purpose DWH, it shines mainly when you know beforehand which aggregations you'll need to run. Trying to fit the usual exploratory analytics workload on it is probably possible, but will be painful.

I currently have ""copied"" the tables from our products as the lowest layer in our DWH and am then connecting them to several ""datamart"" tables that get used for dashboard/analytics, and in the future ML.

You would be surprised to hear the number of times when different teams disagreed on the definition of a subscription or what a logged in user is. After you have the definitions locked down you can set up a classic 3 layer structure: raw, cleaned/merged and marts.

Maybe it's as simple as cron jobs, or maybe you'll stand up Dagster or Airflow3. Database management. You can probably comfortably do everything in DuckDB, but if you want to get fancy, you can use a single-node Spark cluster to write out to Iceberg or some other table format4. Data modeling. Your data may have quality issues or just isn't structured in a way that's easy to work with, and you can learn about patterns like dimensional modeling and Data Vault. You can also pick up a transform tool like dbt or SQLMesh5. Optional: you can do some (simple) ML with keras / Tensorflow or PyTorch. Think simple classification or prediction6. Visualization.

mvwa4wv,"In Databricks specifically you can create [workflows](https://www.databricks.com/product/data-engineering/workflows) that specify what to run and what the dependencies are, and what to do on failures. That's obviously a bit different since you specify it separately, so I suppose the lineage is 'manual' in that case.The workflow tooling has some advantages. You can specify which clusters to use for which steps, so you can keep a cluster live throughout the process for faster job startups, or switch clusters if some steps need specialised settings or need to be larger.Obviously you don't have that with just Spark, but essentially any orchestrating job runner could work.You can mix DBT in with python functions for python models. Those can specify their model dependencies within the function, and other sql models can reference the python module. I believe there are some more hoops to jump through in specifying the model in yaml and needing to set up your spark session to be passed in, so it might take some work to figure that out.Then things like Airflow, Dagster, or more classic things like Ctrl-M can be set up to orchestrate things, or in Azure ADF can do it if it isn't too large. I believe they all have a similar limitation that you can't just ask for ""things leading to this"" or ""things following this"" or both, you just have a set pipeline to run.You can also do a very basic one yourself. If you have a function that runs some data process you can create decorators to specify dependencies, then as long as you `import` the module with those decorated functions you'll have a full dependency tree and can automatically execute what you need. You could find all dependencies leading into some data process function, so they are all refreshed, or run a data process function and update everything that follows from it. The functions to map all that out, but it is a pretty general dependencies problem so an LLM will likely have something to get you started.",azirale,2025-06-04 04:21:00,2,dataengineering,t3_1l2sbm1,False,

mvd1snb,"I'd keep a reasonable history. I keep all minor versions of the last 3 major versions. Probably more than actually needed but it has come in handy. A lot depends on what exactly the image is doing and how you are running it. I'd recommend only building the environment in the image and don't bake the code into the image directly. Use a volume (or bind) mount or a side car to expose your code to the container at runtime. Something like git-sync makes this easy but there are a lot of different ways to handle it. Now your version updates to the base image decreases substantiality, reducing build time and storage costs. It becomes much more practical to store many versions of the image. This has other benefits as well. Want to upgrade one pipeline to a new version? Just pin a new image version to the job. Testing becomes significantly easier by disconnecting the two pieces. Good advice when running in production is never rely on the 'latest' tag, always pin your dependencies. That goes for images as well as Python packages. tl;dr - Mount code to an image, don't build a new one every time.

mvmd3gx,"Not at all. The purpose of the container is to make sure the context with which your code runs is consistent. Your image should behave exactly the same way regardless of what server it runs on, that's the entire point of containers. This does differ from the approach you would take if you were building something like an API or a Django web app. In that case rebuild the image every time, for a lot of different reasons you wouldn't volume mount code in this case.For data pipelines there really isn't a good reason to do so. Build your python environment and install your required libraries as part of the image. Your pipeline code should not be responsible for managing its environment. You very much can put the code directly in the image and it is perfectly acceptable to do so. You'll just be building images extremely frequently and be storing a lot of them. If you are using cloud storage or Vms to build the costs add up at scale. At the very least though make sure you have an image per pipeline. You don't want to fall into the trap of needing to test every pipeline if you want to upgrade your image in any way. How you accomplish this can vary. Are you running on bare metal, k8s, some kind of runner? For example running in k8s using airflow as a scheduler kick off jobs from a yaml file. The yaml includes image tag, version, command to execute, some inputs or outputs depending on the pipeline. Git-sync container runs as an init container to grab the code and your image executes the desired pipeline. This makes the development cycle short and keeps testing easy.

If the volume increases they usually switch to open source solutions(spark on emr, airflow, hive metastore, etc) for cost cutting reasons.

Postgres is great and all but there’s no reason to do extract/load that you don’t need to, and if you’re licensed for MSSQL then use it!Having an intermediate layer means another tool chain. What would you use? I tried dlt for that and it can’t properly handle MSSQL sources or designations; its reader library fails on large column types and the writer library writes everything as varchar rather than nvarchar! I ended up rolling my own (for MSSQL to MSSQL). But also for performance tuning and investigation tooling wise, MSSQL has it all. I’d keep it all in there. I haven’t used dbt but I’ve been trialing sqlmesh which is a kind of successor to it. It’s good at managing nested views on top of data and materialising it, and I’m contributing a patch to make it run better on MSSQL also for my own purposes.To expand on that, sqlmesh works perfectly for all of the MSSQL data types I’ve thrown at it so far. Because you aren’t moving data through it and just managing views, that’s all it needs to do, and so in that case it’s great.It reads in your source tables and data types. You create your views and it understands what output types should be there, even in views that reference views too, and creates the output heaps to dump into with all of the right data types (they say you should explicitly declare them but I don’t want to and it seems to work without it, so why would I? that’s the whole point…).So there’s no repetition of basic data type information or table management. Just write your views and go.My patch is around improving the way it does its merge for incremental updates to the views. But also the output tables it creates are just heaps, there are ways to add indexes after the fact though and even in an automatic kind of way, it’s just not as intuitive as it could be. Still, it works!So yeah I’d keep it all in MSSQL but also if you’re mostly interested in materialising views I’d probably at least try sqlmesh before fully committing to dbt.

mvusjg9,The author would advise you to only enrich with these fields in the silver layer if those attributes provide a reusable and commonly understood entity for the whole enterprise. Do not enrich with fields specific to one domain or subprocess because now you add the overhead of having to know which fields have to be filtered out for downstream consumption. If for example your sign up date is an attribute that is relevant to the whole enterprise it would be a good candidate for a customer field. If it describes a specific sign up for a newsletter that is relevant to marketing it might be better suited to keep those sign ups separate. Maybe create a signup table that references the customer id so it can be reused across different business processes and is easily understood.In the end it is more about the approach itself. A few fields here or there wont break your architecture but once you have super wide tables because people keep adding columns to defined tables the madness starts. Thats where normalization comes in handy.,SchwulibertSchnoesel,2025-06-03 22:53:38,5,dataengineering,t3_1l2pg9g,False,
mvxhh4a,"I kind of agree with the article writer.When it comes to dimensions, the issue is that as you expand it, it starts to have data that is relevant to different domains with namings that are conflicting and/or have different meanings to different people.For example, the column ""region"" on your customers table could mean the financial region (let's say for taxes purposes), or marketing region (so more based on similar cultural aspects, like language. Think of the french speaking region of Belgium being in the same marketing region of France while being in a different financial region).Besides that you also have ownership issues. Who controls this dimension and is responsible for its data? What if they decide to change the region of a customer, will that break dependencies from other areas of business?So I agree with her. Keep only things that are relevant and have unified meaning across the business on the silver layer. I would go as far as create multiple dim_customer on the gold layer, one for each department (so, dim_customer_finance, dim_customer_marketing etc) so that, ownership, meaning and purpose of usage becomes clear for everyone who sees the table name itself.",slevemcdiachel,2025-06-04 10:54:14,1,dataengineering,t3_1l2pg9g,False,

If something is working, just fine even if it's nonstandard or antiquated, it may not be worth updating.From what you've said, here are my thoughts:>So, my question from here is: what's our best option moving forward for improving where we store our data and how we keep it synchronised?How many data sources are you trying to sync? I'm still a bit lost on how you're using both Power Automate and Service Bus. If you need low-latency, I don't think a data warehouse with reverse ETL is going to be a good solution. My guess is that if you have decent data volume and velocity, it's going to get costly pretty fast. If your message bus isn't getting you quite what you want, you could always look at Event Hub or Confluent for managed Kafka. Either way, you're looking at some amount of custom code to read / write data to / from your queues / topics.>Alternatively, the option of Microsoft Fabric to try to keep things within Microsoft / Azure, despite my many hangups with trusting it lol.I have literally never read anything positive about Fabric.>Trying to use FOSS tools to build our own stack, (difficult, we're a small team)I think your team is too small to take this approach, but it depends on your company's cost sensitivity. Some have the mindset that it's ""cheaper"" to avoid vendors and have engineers build everything in-house; in my experience, that math only works if you discount labor costs at 100%. You will certainly have some custom tooling and processes, but make sure that you're getting good value: the commodity solution is very expensive, or you can build and maintain a solution with minimal resources.It still sounds like you want a data warehouse for reporting. Snowflake is a fine choice in Azure, though you could also look at BigQuery Omni. You may want to look into ClickHouse, since it's got a realtime / time series angle. My hunch is that this still won't satisfy your systems integration requirement, but I'm not familiar enough with ClickHouse to say definitively.If your data is relatively small, I'd at least look at a recent feature from DuckDB: [https://duckdb.org/2025/05/27/ducklake.html](https://duckdb.org/2025/05/27/ducklake.html) This goes against my advice to do things in-house (although MotherDuck may offer this in a managed solution soon), but if you're not processing multi-TB datasets, DuckDB is very attractive in terms of pricing vs. traditional distributed warehouses.Good luck!",onestupidquestion,2025-06-02 11:25:18,2,dataengineering,t3_1l1eia9,False,

mvkmrf9,"> It would be useful if you could list what you're trying to solve for in making changes.Mainly, we hired a new Data Analyst and one of the big noticed pain points is that are data structure is kinda of all over the place.We generally have the two primary data sources that are in real-time sync atm, but the thing keeping them in sync (Power Automate) constantly breaks and constantly causes headaches. So one job is moving that into a more robust ETL/ELT/sync solution.The second problem is ingesting data for analysis is difficult. Right now, the reports that are ran directly on the web database have to be refreshed manually after opening an SSH tunnel (the DA opens it through PuTTY right now). Instead, I want to have this data pulled into a more accessible place. The data from D365 and our other tools would also benefit from being in here, as we'd be able to leverage something like ELT to transform these datasets into something easily useable for PBI reports or synchronising with each other.So, the problems I'm looking to solve are to find a good place to centrally store our data for reporting / analysis, and to then find a good way (not Power Automate!!!) to move that data there.> How many data sources are you trying to sync? I'm still a bit lost on how you're using both Power Automate and Service Bus.Main 2 datasets are MySQL are D365. This is through power automate. When one makes a change, it gets put into a service bus to be processed.Additional sources are:External API from a similar org that uses Power Automate to pull into D365. This runs on a schedule. Every change made then syncs real-time with MySQL.Series of spreadsheets from another service we use for raising tenders (it's complicated). These are processed by Power Automate on a manual basis, pushed into D365 which then synchronises realtime with MySQL.MailChimp also synchronises here, pulling data from I believe oth MySQL and D365. We're apparently contacting our D365 vendor about a quote for having this data more closely married with D365.> If you need low-latency, I don't think a data warehouse with reverse ETL is going to be a good solution. My guess is that if you have decent data volume and velocity, it's going to get costly pretty fast.

Either way, you're looking at some amount of custom code to read / write data to / from your queues / topics.Got it. I've heard about Kafka, the other two will probably be similar enough. Custom code is something to consider.Generally, I think the real-time requirement is one that causes more problems than solutions. Changing an accounts name on CRM might be nice to have immediately show up on the website, but I've found achieving that so far is difficult and time consuming.> I have literally never read anything positive about Fabric.Lmao, me neither. The only benefit I see is it makes setting something up a little bit easier.> I think your team is too small to take this approach, but it depends on your company's cost sensitivity.

You will certainly have some custom tooling and processes, but make sure that you're getting good value: the commodity solution is very expensive, or you can build and maintain a solution with minimal resources.This is something I've realised / been realising. Hiring an external vendor to build something is gonna be costly/ difficult to get to pass, but would be at least a decent idea. The vendor we use did suggest adding Data Factory to the unused Synapse instance we have, but with Synapse now being effectively discontinued I'd rather find a new solution than depend on it even more.> It still sounds like you want a data warehouse for reporting.

Main reason for a data warehouse / lake is that the main existing alternatives would be Microsoft Dataverse which isn't a great idea imo, or wrangling the Azure SQL DB that's sitting empty.

mvkiogx,"Yeah, that's a generally correct understanding. The data is by-and-large all kept within a Dataverse / D365 instance, although some bits of data are kept external and instead pulled directly into a PBI report.It's a solution that's been built over the course of a fair few years.The end goal would be either finding a new central data store or improving how we use Dataverse as one, and making sure everything is accessible within it.Dataverse / D365 we use generally as a standard CRM. The website contains much of the same information, on top of some additional website specific data: the actual quote requests raised and reported spend being the main pieces.We had originally used a vendor to move from a Dynamics 2014 system to 365 back in around 2020 and the requirement was to make the synchronisation between the new CRM and the website realtime as they shared a lot of data. From what I know, that requirement is intended to stay for the time being.Hopefully, depending on however the solution we end up with shakes up that requirement might change. But generally if say an Account (eg one of our members) has some of their details changed on say the CRM then that change needs to be propagated to the website on-demand rather than on-schedule.I am aware that's a rather big ask.

In ADF you are completely dependent on Microsoft for connectors and new features. Some people call SSIS legacy. However, the reality is SSIS is still the best ETL platform on the market and people not only continue to use it, but the use is increasing.

In that case, actually say that they should swap off Polars to use DuckDB combined with DuckLake for their metadata.DuckLake also requires a separate database, which DeltaLake does not, so there's more to do there to make this work. You don't address that at all with the seemingly throwaway comment.> Duckdb can probably handle the out of memory issues better than PolarsWhich you didn't bother to mention in your first comment, so there was nothing there to indicate why DuckDB would be better. That's the kind of information that, if it was included originally, would have avoided downvoting, because it would have presented actual useful information.It is also entirely unsubstantiated, and you've weasel-worded it with ""probably"". Considering [the number of open issues coming up when searching 'oom'](https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20oom) I wouldn't put much stock in DuckDB 'probably' handling out of memory issues better than Polars.> as you can chunk the data and duckdb natively streams.Polars natively streams as well. The issue is a specific incompatibility with the DeltaLake writer that prevents it.Perhaps you could have suggested that using DuckDB plus DuckLake would enable streaming writes - if that is even a thing - that could alleviate their issue. That's the kind of information that is useful and would be worthy of an upvote for providing good information. But you didn't bother to actually give any of that reasoning.> You don't think it's close to possible to convert a simple Polars read CSV with duckdb with a simple transformation?That's nothing like anything I said.I was talking about *all* of their pipelines, and the reason for that is that tables stored as DeltaLake need to be read with DeltaLake, and similarly things written with DuckLake will need to be read with DuckLake. It isn't just about this one writer pipeline, it is also about how they *read* their data and *that* process might not be as simple. It is also about their tooling, and whether they want to support multiple different execution engines for their transformations if they're going to make just this one table use DuckDB+DuckLake instead.You're completely ignoring the follow-on effects of switching out your metadata model, and how everything that consumes this data will have to update to use DuckDB+DuckLake. You're also completely skipping the decisions on how to implement the DB that DuckLake works in -- for example will they need to set up an RDS instance for this?These are the kinds of considerations that should be included if you're talking about a complete tech stack change like this. It isn't just a drop-in replacement.---Maybe DuckDB+DuckLake could work for them. There could be good reasons to do it, it could be easy for them if they don't have a lot of pipelines or aren't tightly coupled to Polars.

mvngmu8,"I'd vote for [Malbolge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge), if we're counting esoteric languages. The language was designed with the express purpose of being as difficult to use as possible, going as far as requiring the source code itself to be encoded in a cypher, making it essentially impossible to read. Beyond that, it uses base 3 arithmetic, and essentially requires to use of self modifying code to accomplish most tasks.There are very few programs written in it, with the first hello world program appearing 2 years after the language was published. And that code was not written by hand, but instead generated using a [beam search](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search) algorithm.If we relax the ""uselessness"" requirements a bit, and focus more on languages that are simply incredibly different from the ones you've learned, there are a lot of potential candidates.[Prolog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog) is a logic programming language where you basically describe the problem and the compiler finds a program that solves it (assuming it has a solution). This is a very radically different way of writing code compared to the languages you have experience with.Similarly [Rocq](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocq) (previously Coq) is an interactive theorem prover, where you wrote code that describes mathematical logic modeling something and can find formal mathematical proofs about it. It is possible to write programs and verify their correctness in Rocq as demonstrated by the [CompCert](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompCert) C compiler.[Koka](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/index.html) is a functional programming language with algebraic effect types, which clearly define what kind of side effects (if any) a function is capable of causing.[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) is an extremely powerful functional programming language with an absolute crapton of functionality that can be enabled for all sorts of advanced type level programming. As a bonus, since everyone loves to create custom operators, it's not uncommon for Haskell code to look like symbol soup with a handful of recognizable names mixed in here and there.[APL](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)) and other array languages treat everything as arrays and provide a bunch of super basic functions to manipulate them, leading to solving problems in a very different way than you might in other languages. As a bonus, APL specifically uses a bunch of custom symbols, leading to code that looks like this: life ← {⊃1 ⍵ ∨.∧ 3 4 = +/ +⌿ ¯1 0 1 ∘.⊖ ¯1 0 1 ⌽¨ ⊂⍵}This example implements [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in APL.You could also try Racket, as another commenter mentioned, or any other Lisp really, as they are different enough from what you're familiar with to require learning to think differently about solving problems.There are tons more languages in various different paradigms you could try, and they would all be valuable right now. All the languages you;be learned sit within a very tiny corner of the world of programming languages, and offer only the tiniest glimpse into the variety of languages, paradigms, and ways to think about solving various problems.While I respect that you aren't interested in learning something just because it's ""useful"", I think putting emphasis on the ""uselessness"" of a language is not the best way to think about this. Instead you should consider ""how different is this language from what I'm familiar with"", because the more different and alien a language feels, the harder it will be to learn, but it will also reshape how you think about solving problems.Edit: fixed APL link (at least on mobile)",Bobbias,2025-06-02 20:25:21,38,learnprogramming,t3_1l1qdkg,False,
mv10pn8,"As a full-time TypeScript / Node developer, I really, really like Go.Go is a batteries included language, you can start writing useful applications with nothing but Go itself, it has formatting and testing covered out of the box as well. Compared to PHP or Node, where you pull in tons of packages just to start writing any code, it's a really nice experience. Creating a new project is literally just creating a `.go` file and writing code.On top of that, the language surface is small and can be learned very fast, there is depth to it and gotchas you'll eventually, sooner or later, come across, but at that point you're already writing useful code.It also builds into a single binary which is easy to distribute, it has a far smaller memory footprint than Node and significantly faster start times. The builds are also very fast, making the development cycle very fast, almost like PHP or Node (in watch mode).Also, Go is often praised for its concurrency model.The syntax and paradigm of Go doesn't fit everyone, the language is definitely less expressive than TypeScript, and its type system is more rigid, at times it leads to lengthy code, but it tends to be easy to follow and understand, even if wordier than others.Go is just pretty good. Easy to write, readable, produces efficient apps, easy to deploy, if you don't mind its paradigm and wordiness, you'll generally enjoy using it.",xroalx,2025-05-30 07:15:27,288,learnprogramming,t3_1kyxbmi,False,
mv2hgye,"Go has several things going for it:1. It's a small, simple language that can do a LOT. No endless boilerplate, no forced OOP paradigm. It's got just enough features to be powerful, but few that lead to bad design patterns. This also means that whole teams can learn it quickly. I have presided over a team learning Go and getting them ramped up, it was fun and straightforward.2. It has a static, strong typing system, which both eliminates a whole category of errors found with languages with dynamic type systems, and frees up computational resources that dynamic languages use to reason about data types. If you like data correctness and unambiguity, you'll like Go.3. While garbage collected, automatic garbage collection is great in 99% of cases and you're likely never going to run up against it in your day-to-day. Also, and sorry for burying the headline, but **Golang is almost as fast as any other compiled language like C** but monumentally safer and free of a vast majority of memory pointer errors (the biggest source of critical errors in compiled software).4. It produces all-in-one binaries that run. *And a cross-compiler is included.* Want to compile for Linux on ARM64? Windows on x86-64? NetBSD running on a PowerPC for some reason? Go's got you covered.5. Along with 4, the included tooling is fantastic - one download and unzip, a slight modification to your shell's rc script, and you're cruising. You have a compiler, a robust stdlib, a linter, etc.6. Edit: I forgot a big one! Go's concurrency model is easy to use and easy to reason about. I have found so many uses for it.There are a couple of pitfalls though:1. It can hard to be understand at first how files, directories and packages are related to each other. 2. When you tread the usual, safe paths Go is absolutely phenomenal. However, that comes at a cost, so when you have to venture into things like runtime checks or the `unsafe` package, you get into a deep rabbit hole quickly.

I don't mean runtime error, this isn't like exceptions that propagate. I mean **no error**. The call seems successful, except you get nulls as a result. Nulls which you can't easily check for: see above.At this point I should note here that for a string value, null == """", for a number, null == 0, etc. Fun!So, what's this simple idiomatic and ugly way to check for error from the last call i hear you ask??You... you compare its second return value with a null........ go figure.Go is basically what you get when you take C, add garbage collection, and prohibit pointer arithmetics. That's the good side of go. The bad side, you're essentially in a stripped down C.They try to be ""clean"", yet keeping all the C weirdness. Like \* in arguments meaning the thing is a pointer, but \* everywhere else meaning the thing is no longer a pointer. But some things are pointers even without the \*, and you need to remember which ones those are, because that dictates how can you check those for null values.For some strange reason you can't do nested struct literals. Also, you need to call some built-in initialization things to properly initialize a hashmap. Good thing is, we now have generics. Bad thing is, they're weird, don't work on methods, and they overload the interface syntax for type definitions.I actually like their OO in theory, because having methods separate from the structs allows for multimethods. Except go doesn't have multimethods.Instead, they use ""interfaces"" who's main feature is that they convert null pointers into semi-null pointers, which don't equal to null when you compare them with null, but then fail on null pointer reference anyway.Despite this, it's not actually that bad, if you embrace all the discouraged practices, which the standard library devs use everywhere anyway.It's pretty neat for small and performant production level projects. Just don't use it for anything big. It doesn't have the abstractions necessary.And if you can't make big projects, this makes their insistence on having a fast compiler pretty strange. I guess they need it to be fast to churn through all the copy pasted code.It's worth learning I'd say, it has its use and does have some redeeming qualities.But the community of apologetics is so high, you'd think that this whole thing is just a front for a large copium smuggling cartel.",paperic,2025-05-30 10:52:38,27,learnprogramming,t3_1kyxbmi,False,

mw0ccfr,"A library is a compiled, distributable code base or part of one. It's often physically a jar, dll, or similar though it could be a source repository you build yourself. You use it at runtime and include it to do something. (e.g. ""I used the image processing library to sharpen the image."").An api (application programming interface) is a particular code interface (think logical types and methods/operations) that others on other teams are expected to use. Because of that, the publishing team will promise that changes and especially breaking changes to the interface definition will not be made without notice and time for code bases using it to adapt. When you as a programmer include someone else's library, you would be advised to interact with it through defined apis. If you don't and instead use reverse engineering techniques to find and interact with other internal points like internal methods, services, or data tables, the library publisher may change these at any point without notice and you may have unexpected emergency fixes.Note that something being an api is about the stability and change notification promises not about a particular format, spec, or connection method. An api is often a set of service layer or business layer web services using rest/json or soap formatting, but it certainly does not have to be. There are UI layer apis, which are usually js, iframe, or css interaction points. There are apis that are simply methods you call when you add someone else's code to your project. There are plugin apis where you code an extension that implements a published interface and register it using a published json or xml config file. There are data layer apis which are usually sets of tables, views, and stored procs you are to use when extending a product's data model.It's not all about web services and not every web service is an api.",Far_Swordfish5729,2025-06-04 19:45:14,99,learnprogramming,t3_1l3ekbs,False,

There are the tools that directly impact programming and the ones for organization and tracking progress.For programming, it's mostly about the environment; the editor, plugins and related tools. These are usually fairly straight forward to understand. Though, finding your preferences is a bit of a trial and error experience. Most people are fairly happy with Visual Studio Code for the editor. Try that and see what you like or don't like about it. If you're happy, move on to figuring out what additional plugins and tools make it work best for you. If not, figure out what you like and don't like about it and see if there's something that better fits your preferences or if there are plugins that fix what you don't like.For organization and tracking progress, it becomes even more personal. Maybe, you do it all in a series of post-it notes. Maybe, you type it out in a bunch of plain text documents. Maybe, you use something more sophisticated. You're the only one who knows what work flow works for you. There's more organizational and tracking tools out there than I could list in the 10000 character count limit.

If this is enough to discourage you, then maybe you don’t actually love or care about this enough to go all in.Think about actors — look at what age most of them got their big break versus how long they had been grinding. If you're ready to give up now, then yeah, quit — because the pressure this industry will put on you will be way worse than this.Your first dev job won’t be easy. It won’t be smooth sailing. You still have to learn how to communicate well, adapt quickly, and solve real-world problems. I used to volunteer, I used to code for free just to get experience and feedback from senior devs — some who worked at Amazon, Google, and Netflix.I’ve led teams while volunteering, participated in hackathons, and mentored people — taught them how to lead and grow. On my *days off* from working a warehouse job, I would go into coding Discord servers and help people debug their issues.I tried college — it didn’t work out because of life circumstances. Everything I know is self-taught. I couldn’t afford bootcamps, so I found free ones. I hunted down Udemy courses on sale or found ways to get them free.There are **plenty** of ways to make money coding. Go find one. I used to be homeless, and I was still learning, still listening to lectures and podcasts, still grinding.My first contract? Made me $300 and $7/month. My second? I built software for a company, but the staff all quit before it got deployed. I still got paid. Now? I’ve got a pending contract with a startup and I'm building a demo for someone else.I’ve been doing this for about five years now. I’ve worked with people in Canada, Africa — folks who don’t even have consistent electricity or stable internet, and they still made it work.So I’m saying this: If you *really* want it, then you have to *work* for it.

If they're not, then maybe this class should be a struct with plain functions. \* Check that every method plays a role in maintaining the invariant. If one doesn't, then move it out of the class. \* Check that every method is valid to use right after the constructor finishes. Does it make sense to invoke unload if I don't invoke load? If some method still needs more setup, then it should have its own constructor (and thus own class).Still, as always, the devil's in the details.

mw5se8d,"For clarity : My answer is based on my own experience in this field, but I have formatted the response with AI for clear reading, AI will never generate knowledge like this.Hey, wishing you a bright future—read to the end! No way is programming dead, trust me. The idea that AI will wipe out coders is a myth. Tools like GitHub Copilot are like having a brainy assistant—they make you faster, not replace you. Coders who skip AI might lag since it cuts problem-solving from weeks to hours. You’ll learn quicker, debug faster, and tackle big stuff, but AI needs your creativity to work. Coding’s been around forever (before you were born!) and isn’t going anywhere—it just evolves. Use AI to level up, and you’re golden. It’s totally worth jumping into in 2025. The industry needs solid coders who solve real problems. Stay curious, keep learning, and you’ll stand out, no matter how many others code.Learning paths depend on you. Self-taught is awesome but tough—you need discipline to avoid scams or getting lost. A mentor, even paid, can save you tons of time by guiding you right. Tons of top devs are self-taught, so it’s doable with grit. Bootcamps are great for fast, practical skills—3-6 months and you’re job-ready if you pick one with mentorship and job help. Check Course Report for legit ones to dodge duds. A CS degree gives deep theory for stuff like AI or systems coding and looks great to employers, but it’s pricey and takes years. You don’t always need it for jobs like web dev But remember that if you don't learn the deep theoretical stuff like systems design, algorithms, data structures, computer architectures and operating systems, and only the final technology like web development, you will reach a stage where you will not develop, and you will not move up the career ladder until you have comprehensive knowledge and experience in all aspects, not just simple technological skills like html, css, etc. Whatever path, you’ll need to self-learn, so try Coursera’s “Learn How to Learn” to master studying. Tech’s got endless free resources—use them! I’d start self-taught to test the waters, then maybe a bootcamp or degree if you’re hooked. Just know bootcamps focus on jobs and might skimp on theory like algorithms, which you’ll need.Please do not be tempted by crash courses, all of them aim to teach you how to use the programming language only or just a basic understanding, and do not teach you deep programming concepts, the least professional course may take more than 50 hours of learning, and time is not a condition on the professionalism of the course, but for example, you will not find an in-depth algorithms course of 10 hours ...First, see if coding’s your thing with Harvard’s CS50 on edX—it’s free and a fun intro to programming with bits of C, Python, and JavaScript. It’s not a full course but a taste of what coding’s about. You’ll know if it clicks and get a sense of next steps. After CS50, don’t jump straight to a track like web dev—focus on building core programming skills, like algorithms, data structures and solve a lot of problems on websites like hackerrank,leetcode,codeforces, and so on... . These are the foundation of coding and crucial for any field. You can learn them while exploring a track (like web or AI) or before picking one—it’s up to you. Python’s a great first language—easy, versatile for web, AI, or data, and super in-demand. But it’s not about the language; it’s about getting loops, functions, and logic, which apply everywhere. Think of coding like swinging a hammer: easy to learn, hard to master. Start with computational thinking to grasp how computers work before diving into languages. To gain a solid foundation in your level, I suggest reading books that will develop your way of thinking. It can be read while you are studying CS50. There is a great book called Computational Thinking: A Beginner's Guide to Problem Solving and Programming by Karl Beecher. I really like it and still read it from time to time, even though I am experienced but it's really a great book.Expect bumps—coding’s all about solving problems. Don’t quit when you’re stuck; take a break, hit Google or Stack Overflow, or use AI to explain (but don’t let it solve coding challenges—that’s cheating and you learn nothing). Everyone learns differently—some pay for courses to stay motivated, others grind free stuff. Stay consistent, even 2 hours a day. You’ve got this! Finish CS50, then focus on algorithms, data structures, databases , operating systems, programming with C++ and OOP, and any programming fundamentals that didn't covered in CS50(because 8 weeks not enough to know what you should learn ) (try free resources like FreeCodeCamp or books like “grokking algorithms”). Hit us up for next steps.What you did was the right move, you took the initiative to ask, keep doing that when you have questions, always ask the experts and don't rely on the answers of laymen or non-specialists, not even AI, AI can help you along the way if you know what you're doing, but it may not be appropriate at all times.And not all paid courses are good and not all free courses are bad, I can give you advices for hours, but unfortunately that is not the way you will develop, you have a path that you must discover for yourself, what I discovered is what you will discover, but you will discover it in your own way and with your own understanding, so I said it directly to you ...

At 15, you're not even close to starting your career, let alone getting the ball rolling enough to rely on your experience / tenure to help you settle down.First thing to mention (even outside of AI) is that this entire field goes through ups and down. Software development is not immune to economic downswings unless you luck out (there are some jobs out there that are more ""essential"", but not most), and we're in one right now. The current job market, plus all the AI advancements in the news, has everyone worrying about AI, but it's a scapegoat to larger issues over-hiring from Covid, interest rates, and tax laws (Section 174 being a big one).And in regards to AI, if software development gets to a point where a non-technical person can use AI like a ""cheap high-quality on-demand agency"", nearly every job is getting replaced. Put ""will doctors"" into Google search, the first result is likely ""will doctors be replaced by AI"".Being concerned about AI ***right now*** is pretty ridiculous. I've not seen any major instances of ""AI replacing developers"". There have been some decent showcases of AI reducing workloads (AirBnB did some interesting work in regards to testing migration), but even those are pretty limited. In general, it helped cut out some of the mundanity with repetitive boilerplate code, and helped people who have never written code to get things started, but that's about it.Being concerned about AI in 20 years is perfectly reasonable though. We've seen major advancements over just the last two years, but we still are not completely sure if there's a ""ceiling"" that might cap what AI can do, or if those advancements will continue to accelerate.Overall, if you're passionate about something, especially at such a young age, it's worth investing some time into that passion. No one knows what the world is going to look like in 5 years, let alone 20. People who are really passionate about what they do, and put in the time and effort to make smart decisions, tend to make things work.Edit: grammar",SpookyLoop,2025-06-04 17:15:07,1,learnprogramming,t3_1l3454l,False,

mv6zuqn,"The devs who create APIs are backend devs, and they typically work in languages like Java, Python, C#, and even JavaScript. They often use special frameworks for these languages that have built-in features that make building APIs easier or more performative. Typically they also work with databases in some capacity, as a core function of most APIs is retrieving or saving data to a database.Typically the devs consuming APIs are frontend devs who need data to display on a GUI. However, APIs can also call other APIs, so consuming APIs is something done by devs front or backend. It's becoming more common to become a full stack developer where you both create APIs and then consume them on the frontend. Often times though even full stack devs will specialize in one over the other. You'll find when you do this kind of work, you don't need to be a master of a language or framework to create passable features. Obviously it depends, but if your API consists of a lot of CRUD (create, read, update, delete) work, most devs can produce these endpoints with not a ton of experience needed.A great tool to start messing around with APIs is postman. You can call API endpoints from this tool and see exactly what type of data they return. Then you can start imagining how you could use this data, or how to build your own API that produces data you need. A real life example I'm currently working with is that I'm creating an app that uses flood data. Weather.gov has a great API that allows me to get flash flood alerts. Instead of just calling this flash flood API from my frontend, I'm actually calling the weather API from my backend. I'm doing this because I need to alter the data to fit my needs before using it. So I'm using my API to grab data with weather.gov's API, manipulating that data into a usable form for myself, storing that data in my own database, and then calling my own API from my own frontend to get that data out of my database so I can display flood alerts to users in the way that I need.

mv77ve5,"One good way to think about APIs is a way to connect 30+ different services, instead of having a single service that tries to do it all. You need a way for service 1 to talk to service 3. This is done through APIs. Here is a long winded example:Imagine you have one central platform that users interface with (the UI/website).But then you also have three services {A1-3} that take in data at the start, from three different sources. Say the data coming into A1-3 is different user activity, say everytime a user logs into some systems {S1-3}. Those systems send data in different ways to A1-3. A1-3 may transform the data in some way and send it down the pipeline. Possibly convert it into some central schema, since the three sources {S1-3} provide different sources data formats.Maybe one of these data-consumers {A2} needs to query some other service {B1} that provides additional user data. Perhaps A1 and A3 already get this additional data directly from their sources, S1 and S3. B1 is a service your company created that just stores a bunch of specific data in a database. When the service A2 queries it (or any other service), it returns some useful information. Maybe the database holds user host information (like their computer name). So B1 is an API that takes in a User ID, and returns their hostname/Mac address/location, ect. It just queries the database by user ID, and returns the information. So you might say, why not just have A2 query the database directly? Well, what if later on you have another service that wants the same data. So you made the API B1, which is the only connection point to this particular database. Once A1-3 enrich and convert their data into a central schema, they send that data using some messaging service (e.g. Kafka) to one consumer, C1. C1's job is to just store this data in some database. All it does is read data from A1-3 and store it (in a DB), and then it provides an API to retrieve this data on-demand. All of these could be called 'microservices'. Instead of having a single service that does it all, we have 6 that just handle their own little section. The user interface (the front end), needs to be able to provide information to customers. If the customer needs to know when User#45 last logged in, it queries C1. This event has the original data A2 consumed + some enrichment from B1. Now is the best part. Remember how we made B1 its own independent service? When the UI wants to give the latest login info about a user it query C1.But what about when it needs to provide just hostname information (which is not directly tied to a particular login instance). These hostnames are unrelated to the login information from C1 (even though C1 has some hostname info, but only when related to logins).So now the UI can query B1 to provide a bunch of hostname information. In this long example, we only have two APIs, B1 and C1. But whilst populates B1? Imagine we also need to manage payment information, basic account info, ect. If it's closely related, it could be with one API and in one database. But often there will be disparate data from different sources. Better to make everything modular.

Also, you're relatively unrestricted in what you can do with C++, so if you know what you're doing, C++ is a very powerful language.Since the C++11 standard, C++ has gained a lot of more modern features too.

This fuels the mythology: you’re either a wizard or doomed.Unlike Python or JavaScript, you don’t get guardrails. Crashes, memory leaks, and security bugs are easy to write.

There is a ton of existing code written in C++ that needs maintaining and the language is still unmatched in performance-critical domains. And there is a lot of learning value in it.

It listens to those local Telegram groups, extracts location and context from messages, saves it to a database, and shows the results on an interactive map. Basically, you can load the map and see where people say TCC recruiters are. Like Pokémon Go, but very... Ukrainian :grinning_face_with_sweat:It works pretty well locally — but I haven’t shared it publicly, because there’s a risk I could be accused of “obstructing military operations,” which is a very sensitive topic here.Anyway, it’s not really real-time (no WebSockets or live updates yet), more like a snapshot when the page loads.

Don't be abstract like ""calculate value"", but rather, be as specific as possible, like ""multiply cost with (1 + tax), then divide results by 100"".Do this for each step until you are able to manually, with no code at all, complete the process reliably, regardless of which values are used.Once you're done, copy all the steps as comments to your code. Translate manual actions to code. Using the above example, you'd do a line like `(cost * (1 + tax)) / 100`. Repeat until all steps are done, and that should work great.Writing code is the easy part, but when it's coupled with having to solve a problem, it becomes complex. When you do this, you're fully separating the problem solving and the code.

You identify the various components that you need, and then while you're going through the class list or API or whatever, you create a mind-map of all the classes/methods and what purpose they serve.If you're lucky, the documentation will provide some tutorials to demonstrate how to use the library so that at least you have something working.Ultimately, you should have some general understanding of what problem you're trying to solve, before jumping into a library.",mxldevs,2025-05-31 19:21:51,1,learnprogramming,t3_1l019s5,False,

There is always a constant set of concepts that underlies a lot of programming paradigms. Have a good grasp over those. Other things are a matter of comfort, and you can always re-learn and remember once you start working back in a language, framework etc.To specifically answer you:1. It is definitely okay to go with web dev and frontend path now. 2. Use LLM as a resource to learn. Write code to do simple things and make projects. And show that code to LLMs to ask for improvements and suggest conceptual lackings that are present in that code. 3. Titles are unimportant imo. Learn as much, and be ready to learn when you have a job. What matter is the ability to learn. 4. If your parents are asking for you to get a job, prioritize good learning environment. Ideally with senior devs. Good mentorship is totally another level of learning. I assume you are still early in your career. 3. Don't be too hard on yourself. Everything takes time.

mw38jzi,"Hey, first off - it's awesome that you're already this deep into programming at 18. The fact that you can zone in for 9 hours straight? That’s a real sign you’ve found something you’re genuinely passionate about. A lot of great devs started the same way - just getting lost in code.Since you're learning C#, that’s a strong start. It’s used in tons of real-world applications - especially in enterprise software, game dev with Unity, and even backend web stuff (with .NET). So don’t think it’s a “just-for-school"" language - it’s got legs in the industry.If you're eyeing cybersecurity and want to branch out smartly, here's a quick breakdown of useful languages based on where you might go:For Cybersecurity:Python – absolute must. It's everywhere in cybersec (automation, scripting, tooling, etc.), super beginner-friendly, and has a massive library ecosystem.Bash/Shell Scripting – essential if you're going to be dealing with Linux servers or writing security automation scripts.C/C++ – if you ever want to understand exploits, memory management, or reverse engineering.For General Dev / Building Stuff:JavaScript + HTML/CSS – if you ever want to touch frontend or build tools with a GUI.Go – gaining traction in cloud & network tooling, really nice for fast and secure backend systems.Since you're enjoying it already, I'd say:Stick with C# and get comfy building small projects.Start Python next - you’ll love how fast you can get stuff working.Maybe check out TryHackMe or Hack The Box once you’re comfortable with the basics - great intro to hands-on cybersec.Also, shameless plug, but I’ve been using this app called BootSelf lately. It gives you an AI mentor that helps explain code and quiz you with flashcards. Pretty helpful if you're learning solo and want to stay on track.

That's because figuring out *what* to learn and in what order often isn't entirely obvious, sometimes I just have to waste time learning something I'll never use in order to figure that out.But when l've decided, I start with a mix of reading independent blog posts, analyzing usage statistics and browsing Reddit. I look for what seems exciting or relevant to the kind of software I might want to build.For example, I wanted a personal website, which led me to Eleventy. I tried to dive in, read some docs, and attempt small things, until I realized that I was really struggling to get what I wanted. I then looked for a tutorial that builds a complete project, so I could get a notion for what it could look like. When doing tutorials, I try to actively change minor things, add small features, or try to integrate it with something else. I like doing this because it forces me to understand why it works and make it my own.I wholeheartedly agree with project-based learning.

I was hired into a team and at a time where all the others in my cohort had masters degrees and seemed so much more experienced than I was. And it's possible that they were, I didn't realize that it didn't actually matter that much. I was showing up, passionate about doing a good job, and learning every day.I have a distinct memory of talking to a mentor about it. A meeting had just ended and I asked him to hang back in the conference room with me. I mentioned those feelings, that I wasn't as good as the other junior developers. I'd hoped my mentor would have some sage advice for me, recommendations on learning materials to catch up, or even just a pep talk. Instead, he told me to never let anyone hear me say that again. Because people will believe it if they hear it. And it sort of crushed me, because **I believed it.**Later on, that same mentor was let go from the company. In my final chat with him he shared that he'd had a lot of personal things going on in his life. The reality is that he was struggling too, all that time. And his way of handling it had been to put up that front. That's why I thought he was the person who would be able to help me. Because he presented like he had it figured out. When really, he was falling behind just like the rest of us. He felt lost. His mental state was impacting his work, etc. And worst of all, he didn't have a healthy mindset of how to address it.Years later, I was one of the most senior people working on a product. I had a manager who was new in role and together we built out a team of mostly college hires to stand up and then operate a new set of services. Every one of those developers we hired were brilliant. I always felt like they were so far ahead of where I was when I started and found each of them to be so impressive. But sure enough, in the months and then years that followed our building that team out... those new junior developers would each take me aside on their own to express how they were struggling with feelings in inadequacy. Literally, every single one.Ironically, it was those junior developers who helped me to overcome my imposters syndrome. Not the experienced mentor like I'd imagined. It was when I realized how **we all feel behind,** that I managed to wrangle my own feelings. What you're feeling now is completely normal. Its okay to be vulnerable.

There is no standard for how fast the books will teach what it talks about, so you'll likely discover much later if you're taking anything out of a book.So just having read is a great gain, trying to maximize the benefits will make you read slower, read less or feel pressured to be 'better' at getting your money and time's worth from books during reading or immediately after. Dont think about a hypothetical quiz at the end, you're reading for you. If you did the bookmarks thing, you will be able to come back, write down, practice, etc. later when you've already read the whole book.And why read? Well... Imagine having read 3 books about a subject instead of just a few pages out of one book.

mw4jrwl,"Avoid AI for most of your project. I’m in a similar boat to you going back to college and ya AI is a great tool to help get through it but your not actually learning that much by tweaking the code after it spits it out. There’s a lot more to learn in how to take an idea and how to start making it. One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned so far is in planning and design. Sitting down and actually breaking down each element, what do I want, what do I need, who will be doing x and who does y? What “date” should I be using and why?Learning how to define the success factors and set realistic goals is vital in coding. As I’m going through it I’ll jot down possible approaches and methods I might need going forward. I don’t need to fully code them now but I need to make sure I have everything tight for when things get complicated later. You won’t be designing every system you work on from the ground up but you will need to be able to read and identify what the other coders were doing, what were they thinking when they made this method or class and where does it go? You won’t be able to feed full applications into an AI to read them out to you when you’re on a team. I also put a lot of work in before I started college and got advanced entry into Y2. At Christmas I was miles ahead of most in the class and took the foot of the gas looking at other languages instead. Come April I realised I’d slipped too much and had work my balls off to catch up. Yes I had a basic understanding of what we did but I couldn’t use it effectively. The best example was SQL. I could read SQL, I knew where the query was going how things joined but I struggled trying to fix it together myself. I used AI while making my database connections and had to constantly look back to do them from scratch myself. Eventually I just stopped using the AI designed methods as this is something I need to be able to do. We had interviews presenting our final projects at the end of the year and they asked “You have well designed methods for database queries in the first 4-5 frames but you don’t use them later in the project. Why?” I explained that while I would be using those methods from the helper files in real world conditions, I wasn’t happy with my understanding of them. I couldn’t do them from memory and kept making errors, so I decided to drill them in by typing them out each time. They loved that answer. It showed I was able to use helper files and methods to keep code clear and concise making the project easy to read, but I also knew how to make and adjust the process to perform custom tasks. They asked me to isolate certain conditions and how I would pick out individual combinations and I was able to do it on the spot because I knew the system and understood how it worked. Some of the others struggled with that as AI had done all the thinking for them. When it came to exams I flew through the test because I A) understood how I would do it. B) was able to identify what they were looking for and how to trace back to it. And C) I made the mistakes and worked my way through them so when they happened there I knew what I was looking at. TLDR:Don’t use AI to design everything. Yes it’ll spit out loads of lovely code that works for this window of the project but it won’t improve your skills or work when you only have this small section on larger projects.

mv666zm,"When it comes to debugging, while simple methods like console.log, print statements, or dump and die are useful for inspecting values and responses, effective debugging requires a more structured approach.My general advice is to start by isolating the issue and confirming each part of the workflow independently. For example, in web development, if I'm passing a value from the backend to the frontend, I would first hardcode an expected value directly into the frontend to verify that the interface and frontend logic behave as expected. This helps determine whether the issue lies in the frontend or further back in the stack.Once the frontend behaves correctly with the hardcoded value, I would then pass the same value from the controller to confirm that the data flow through the backend to the frontend is working as intended. If this succeeds, I proceed to review the logic within the controller itself. Essentially, the idea is to work backwards from a known, working state toward the suspected issue.For game development, I take a similar approach. If, for example, I encounter a bug in a movement script, I would isolate that script by moving it to a new, minimal scene with a single object. Once it works correctly in isolation, I would then reintroduce the object to the original scene and observe whether the issue persists. This process of isolating and testing components individually allows you to narrow down the source of a bug systematically.In both cases, the principle remains the same: isolate, confirm working states, and incrementally trace the problem back to its origin.One last trick is the rubber duck, honestly works :flexed_biceps: explain what your trying to achieve to a rubber duck or colleague in the explanation, you will realize where you went wrong.Good luck, troubleshooting and debugging can be super fun when you get some wins :flexed_biceps::thumbs_up:",the10xfreelancer,2025-05-31 01:09:23,1,learnprogramming,t3_1kzfy86,False,

mw5zduj,"* There's extreme pay disparity of SWE just in the US. Compare us to other countries, and the differences get even greater. Pay is not solely based on merit. A rockstar SWE living in bumfuck nowhere Montana might be making a very ""normal"" salary at a normal company, and a dumbass SWE living in the Bay Area might've weaseled their way into a top-paying SV startup. And we *certainly* don't make ""2x or 3x"" what ***most*** other white collar fields make. Maybe if by ""most"" you include working in fast food, but definitely not white collar.* For one, this isn't an inherent trait of a SWE career. It *never* has been. There are lots of fully onsite companies, even top tech companies. But it's also not unique to SWE. It's a trait *of a company*, not of a role. At every hybrid/remote company I've worked at, ***everyone*** is hybrid/remote and is afforded that same amount of flexibility. Marketing, sales, legal, IT, etc.* It's genuinely interesting to you and me! But to a lot of people out there what you just described is more boring than watching paint dry. Different strokes for different folks.* Variety also exists in many other careers... You know those prestigious companies you're talking about? And the exciting startups you're talking about? Guess what they both also hire? Non-SWE's.* Now you're just saying ""White Collar careers are the best careers by far"". This has nothing to do with SWE.* If you work for a large, well-known company it's just as likely (I'd argue significantly *more* likely) that you'll be working on some boring internal tool that has 20 internal users.

mvkcx2r,"I use to be that 'savant' and people paint a picture of you in all kinds of colours, whatever suits them usually, including being someone with a disability.What people, especially managers fail to realize is, it's just the ability to cut through noise and a long with experience. He probably doesn't think about how much people like him or dislikes him, not because he doesn't care but because he hasn't thought about it, he is there to work. Make no mistake he has feelings and is sensitive to being hurt, that said, I did socialize in a small circle but I didn't waste time either.I was protected at times, especially in one job but they didn't change the expectations of everyone else, no. Instead I was looked at as a leader following a company mandate ( saving money ahead of downsizing - in 2015). Other guys asked me what they thought they should be doing instead. I had no idea and I wasn't ready to be a manager of others.Looking back, your manager needs to put aside through put to a degree whilst also acknowledging that maybe you don't want that person to work, maybe like I did all the time, they may regret not taking it a little slower and not enjoying the role more. And if they at all care about the person, they unilaterally should and it should be a concern discreetly shared to his peers, like you.As for letting him fail, I'm not surprised it being stated but still feel awful hearing other people say that and probably did about me. There's better ways and conversations then to just let someone drop and if I'm honest, you've probably got no idea if you're really testing him in the role. What I mean is, this may not be a strain for him or even considered work. This might be a passion and something they take a great deal of pride in and not even work but is paid to be. You have every right to raise a concern though and your manager needs to look at the person aspect. You all do but do it with them in mind as well as yourselves, maybe with their skills, they can learn to articulate them and go towards the team. It might be sensible to expect that the standard of work will improve and that doesn't have to be a bad thing (doesn't necessitate 'harder').

mw4nrq6,"I'll try to offer a bit of a different perspective from the other comments here.Some companies have super well structured internships with planned social events, fun activities, and intentionally chosen teams with projects which are easy for interns to jump in on. For a long time this was ""internal tools"" teams. Others just put you in a seat and check in on you in 3 months. I'm going to assume that your team is somewhere in the middle, which is unfortunate because:The reality is that, in most cases, interns are barely even beginning to be productive by the time a 3 month internship ends. This is more and more true as you move along the scale towards larger and more mature companies. Teams are more specialized, the systems are larger and more complex. The backend isn't a public firebase db anymore, you've got actual laws to follow and a compliance department who checks to make sure it's happening. Teams also usually have deadlines to meet and projects which other teams are depending on them to complete.This means that in many cases teams begin to see interns as a drag and ignore them or assign them to non-critical work (which often isn't checked on). It's tough!My advice is to try to meet other interns in your cohort (if there are any) and to try to make the most of each learning opportunity you get. You can earn the respect of the more senior people by helping fix the mundane banalities of their day to day work. Fix that flaky test, or find a place to cache container images in the CI pipeline so that it runs faster.They'll probably start to include you more as you become more valuable to the team.In a few more years you'll sigh when an intern joins your team, and you'll try to think of a good project which fits the impossible criteria of being doable in 3 months, not too boring, and actually brings some value to the team.Good luck and keep your chin up.",aj_stuyvenberg,2025-06-05 13:10:12,12,cscareerquestions,t3_1l3t56r,False,

mvx6tt8,They do and they are. Wages haven’t kept up with inflation in many industries in the US since the 1970s. Every year people are being paid less. It’s a slow process because if they don’t pay good employees enough they jump ship to a competing company which is why today in a lot of white collar roles in the US it’s common to work 24 months at a company then switch. Larger companies like FAANG have attempted to address this through vesting. You don’t get fully paid unless you’re there for 4 years. On year 4 you’re getting paid for your first year of work. Leaving is like losing 4 years of half of your pay. In Europe wages are lower in part because people are far less likely to jump ship due to pay so they can just low ball everyone from the get go.

Startup environments like that are chaotic, and can be very exhausting, and aren't good fits for *most* people. I think you might be burnt out on startup culture, not the industry itself.Instead of abandoning your career entirely, have you considered looking for a more traditional job at a large company? Where you could work on a normal team, doing normal things, with normal expectations, where you aren't in a fast-paced high expectation environment where the founder or CTO aren't talking to you directly and are many, many layers removed from you and the work you do?

Do something relaxing, get some exercise, just something to hopefully help with healing. Then, when you start looking for another job, be mindful of vetting them. While you want a new job, you want to make sure you find something that aligns with what you want (work-life balance being a priority).

A mediocre performance on a very supportive team will likely be better than a stellar performance on a highly dysfunctional team. I think you should as a minimum try to find: * A manager who's been with a team for multiple halves* At least one IC6+ who works around you (if not associated with your work), also multiple halves on the team* Ideally, clear scope and some sort of vision for the team. There's a lot of subjective opinions, but I think these are generally agreeable things that are worth prioritizing. It's relatively common to have weak support (either by a manager carousel or lack of E6+ sponsors) that can block your promo - ask me how I know lol. More subjectively, I think it's worth finding a team that you trust in their feedback (there are some people who are 10x more critical than average), and if you care about timelines, a staggering of levels (if there's like 8 E3s, it might take longer for your promotion to come through).

At meta the requirements are pretty clearly laid out but its really up to your team. They might not want to/cant give you opportunities to check off those requirements.Impact is also important. Theres an idea in big tech where you need to make impact, which means “what can i do to make something easier for another engineer”. Its not always “i have to work on the newest feature”(although ig is alway making then removing features lol), it could be related to fixing something for On-Call, etc. You just need to optimize some part of the job to “make life easier”.The only thing you need is to adapt and meet these requirement, but the hard part is if your team is going to even let you/give you the opportunity.

mvox3a7,"Approximately 1/50 application to interviews is pretty good in the current market. My advice would be to try to figure out what went wrong in the three interviews you did get, and work on fixing that in addition to applying. Because if you can fix that, you just need 1-2 more shots and you're good! Assuming you posted your resume to solicit feedback, here's a huge text wall of resume advice you can take or leave: As another user suggested, you might want a different template. I linked one at the bottom. I'm not sure if your template is the issue, but it doesn't hurt to try something different and test results, you can always circle back to what you have now. I'd also include a projects section, put your 2-3 most impressive school projects with some jazzed up bullet points (you can get an llm to help you with jazzing them up) and work on a project yourself using industry tools in the space you want to work in. Using and mentioning industry tools in projects is a great way to get through ATS assuming it's checking for keywords (for example ""Docker"", ""React"" and ""Java""). Here's an example of what I mean by a personal project, say you want to work with python full stack? Make and deploy a django app or something. Link the frontend on your resume, maybe the github too. What kind of app? I don't know. It doesn't have to be crazy, but try to use docker, a common database, maybe make the frontend with react that's popular af. If you can't get actual work experience in a company, try to get a bit of experience doing a project. You don't have to use industry tools to make a toy project, but doing so gives you a little practice and exposure to them which is what's valuable, and can help you get through ATS. Maybe even better than a personal project would be if you could contribute to an open source project and put that on your resume under the projects section. TLDR get a projects section and have your 3-4 most impressive projects on there until you get enough work experience to de-prioritize them. I'd shorten the skills section up to make room for the projects, mine is only two lines, languages and frameworks. I had an interview where the person was like, ok i'm going to list stuff from your skills section, you tell me on a scale of 1 to 10 how good you are with it, then proceeded to ask me corresponding difficulty questions about that skill/language/framework. After that, I trimmed my skills section up to stuff i'm at least a 4/10 confident in and it hasn't had a negative impact on my response rate.I'd consider putting one or two of those summer jobs back, you could put them under ""additional experience"" section at the bottom or something, just one liners very brief, if you give a description I think that describing teamwork and communication would help the most. For a template that has additional work experience I think the ""additional expereince"" template in this google doc from Codepath would be a good start (make a copy don't request edit access).

For example in your data analyst resume put a data project you did in there that uses powerBI or something at the top of the projects list, maybe change the skills up to include numpy pandas excel and tableau. Anyways, good luck. I'm curious from a scientific perspective if your response rate will improve after tweaking your resume.

We can't just give a single description/anecdote to describe that entire period.2010 for example was the recovery period from the Great Recession. Hiring was picking up compared to 2008-2009, but it was still slow and cautious. Companies were not hiring with confidence.2021 for example was the golden era of SWE. Companies were massively over hiring, the demand for SWE drastically outpaced the supply of CS grads, and that single-handedly created an entirely new sub-market of bootcampers and self-teachers. People already in the industry were job hopping and getting insane 100% raises,.That said, in my experience, good market or bad market, thing's aren't all that different. I still do the same interview prep, there's still the same kinds of startups/companies hiring, the expectation of this industry is still that you have a CS degree, etc. The difference I notice between a normal market (2011-2018-ish) and a bad market (2023+) is that the response rate is much lower. You need more applications to get responses. When I was applying for jobs in 2016 I did 10 applications total. When I was applying for jobs in 2021, I did 11 applications total. When I was applying for jobs in 2024, I did 82 applications total. I didn't feel like there was any difference in the process itself between those markets, once I got a company to actually interview me, the process was the sameFor your second note, I think the insane over-hiring of 2021 is what ruined todays market. Not AI. We're still recovering from that overhiring. A lot of people that wouldn't have had a chance of being hired in a normal market broke into the industry in 2021, and the industry is trying to self-correct. It's a slow, and painful process.AI is a valuable tool for SWE's. Some companies are buying into the hype, and might try to reduce headcount as a result, but it's still just hype. There's always some sexy new hyped up thing in the industry that companies try to chase, and might make them increase/reduce headcount. AI is no different.

mw12lcu,"So, everyone that has gone through green card knows about the PERM dance. In practice, it means that the law says an employer has to post a job ad for a role that had already been filled and ramped up a year+ earlier.The undertone of these kinds of exposes seem to be that some cohorts are more ""deserving of the opportunity conferred by the law"", but arguably the immigration lawyers involved are actually going by the spirit of the law (even if it may technically be malicious compliance) when they ask the H-1B worker to provide job descriptions with excruciatingly high level of detail to construct these job posts. It is already hard enough to get candidates to match nice-to-haves in a regular job post, so who else can check every checkmark in a huge and highly specific list other than the person that is already doing the function, and with zero ramp up time, to boot? Or so the rationale goes.One could argue that labor market assessment ought to be done upfront, and it actually is in some countries, notably the LMIA in Canada, but as Canadians might attest, that's not necessarily successful in practice either.Personally I'm pretty cynical about political reform in general.

It's going to take a bit of time to read, to process the noise, to think of a solution and it takes time to write the code for question 1 and by the time you finished writing the code for q1, you are met with a bug. Then by the time you solved the bug, you now only have 10-20 minutes left to work on question 2. There is no time left to work on q2, especially when both qs are leetcode hard. Not sure if that's very reflective of the industry, at least in the internship I did, it wasn't like ""you must solve this in X minutes, otherwise we are all doomed"".The other thing I don't like about leetcode questions being used for assessments is that we can't use debugging tools.

mvo1byi,"I'm in a very similar boat. First job out of college, working as an integration developer at a startup for a year and a half. When I first started, I was told ""Go build an integration between our product and X CRM"" and that was about as much interaction as I got.Same thing where everything is always urgent, everything is always broken, everyone always needs something from you CONSTANTLY. I think that's unfortunately pretty common in SWE, but even more so at a startup.My advice would be first, to stop caring so much, and second, keep looking for new opportunities with a healthier company. I'm not saying give up, or slack off, but I am saying that you should understand and accept that you will always have work to do and tickets to complete, and if you put forth your best effort and don't get all of those tickets done, it's not a reflection of you or your productivity, it's a result of poor management and unrealistic expectations.When I first started, I felt like I had to grind late nights and weekends so that I could meet the needs of every customer, and I would often work 60+ hours a week just to push a project past the finish line. Time and time again, I would put in all of this extra work and a few weeks down the road, the customer would churn for a reason unrelated to my work and then suddenly all of those extra hours were for nothing.Nobody else cares about your mental health as much as you do, so you need to learn to set boundaries to protect your mental.I adopted the mantra ""Not my circus, not my monkeys"" lol. At the end of the day, if this company lives or dies, your life will ultimately be the same. Don't let it consume your life or your mental health, because one day you will find that it was all for nothing. My only other coworker in my department was just like me -- he stressed out about customers after hours and worked extra, and guess what? One day they decided he was too expensive and they canned him. All of those late nights and extra hours for nothing.Put forth your best effort during the work day and try to leave the stress in the office. If work is unfinished, it's unfinished, but it's not your problem because you already did as much as you reasonably should.I could go on and on, but my point is, *while you're looking for another job,* try to at least make this one more tolerable in the meantime by learning reasonable ways to protect your mental health. If you get punished for that in any way, let it roll off your shoulder knowing you're gonna leave the toxic environment as soon as you can anyway.",sheepbitinganimalman,2025-06-02 22:07:28,8,cscareerquestions,t3_1l1nq2d,False,

Most people find 45-50 hours a week with short bursts above that sustainable, and I think that's a good place to target. You will be be pressured to work more; be ready to gracefully wiggle out of it.2. Whenever you ask someone for a piece of information (""what is X?"", ""how do I do Y?""), also find out how they know/obtained that information. Getting questions answered is good (and you should ask a lot of questions), but you should also be learning how to find answers yourself.3. Underpromise and overdeliver. You should describe every single task task you complete as both absolutely amazing and the product of tons of hard work.4. Optimize your commute. If you spend an hour sitting in the car each way, that's equivalent to working an extra 10 hours a week. Live close to work, work from home, or go in early and leave early to beat traffic. I usually listen to a podcast on the way in and call out of state family on the way home, much better than feeling your brain bleed out your ears as you sit in traffic.5. Be *very* careful when it comes to agreeing to take responsibility for something. Once you take responsibility for a project or feature you become the person on the hook for it, and if/when things go poorly you're going to be working 80 hour weeks while out of your mind. You need to be strategic, you need to advocate for yourself, and you need to resist peer pressure.6. If you're on a team of workaholics, just lie.

mvic3s6,"On going to college in general: If money is not an issue (which it sounds like it isn't because the state program is helping you), then going to college is generally a good idea, regardless of major (see [https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2011/collegepayoff.pdf](https://www.ed.gov/sites/ed/files/policy/highered/reg/hearulemaking/2011/collegepayoff.pdf) for how much it's worth in $$$). The piece of paper you get at the end is one thing, but what's more important are the general skills that you can learn from pursuing a college degree: time management on a progressively longer scale, learning independently, collaborating with other people. Of course, these may be skills you have picked up from elsewhere, but if they are not (or if not to the level you would like), then this is an excellent opportunity to pick them up. Note that these are not necessarily things that happen automatically, though; graduation requirements get you the piece of paper, but how you spend your time engaging with your coursework determines what skills you'll actually get out of your degree. This is especially true if you're able to go full time and not worry about work during that time, because otherwise you will rarely have the time and energy to spend as you like on thinking and learning as you will during those 4 years.On majoring in CS: choosing CS because you ""like math and computers"" is a much better rationale than choosing it because of the job market, and part of why there are a lot of people complaining about the job market now is because a lot of people entered this field only because of the second reason back when the market was good. This of course does not guarantee you a job, but it does mean you're more likely to engage more deeply with the material in the degree, which means you will get more out of the degree one way or another. That said, do you know whether the program will allow you to switch majors? While you shouldn't switch out just because some class is harder than expected, if you discover that CS is really not for you, having the option to switch into something that better matches with your interests will make starting the program feel less constraining.On getting a job after: Let's be honest, no one actually knows what the job market will look like 4 years from now. Will it be challenging, especially with your nontraditional background? Probably. But would it be so bad that you would regret even \*trying\* in the first place?

Regardless of your decision, I don't think you should base it solely off of the opinions of people from the internet. Not saying you are, but I just wanted to make note. Do your own research, make a plan (budget, time, courseload) and look into possible programs. Do you have any connections in the industry? Even a connection in something software-adjacent, like IT, would be valuable. Any sort of connection would help. Even a help desk job, or some IT position on campus would be great, assuming it makes financial sense for you. Sign up for CS50 or start The Odin Project to see if you enjoy this stuff. I can't speak for CS50, but the actual CS degree would be different from The Odin Project. The common ground is problem-solving. Just see if you enjoy the actual problem-solving process, whether it's practical or theoretical.Best of luck!",tabasco_pizza,2025-06-02 02:13:45,2,cscareerquestions,t3_1l12okm,False,

But if you’re expecting big tech salary then it’s a big no. If you do go I would encourage you to get involved in research as early as possible. It will help you build you resume (which is extremely important as an older student) and it will help you find out what parts of CS you do and don’t like. Given you like tech and visual arts I would suggest game design but that industry has a really bad reputation. But maybe you can do some indie stuff with it. As an older student I would go with what another commenter basically said, you’re starting your career way too late to have a “serious” career. You might as well try to follow your dreams and do something you’ll love regardless of the money. Hopefully this helps some. Also beware there are a lot of doomers in CS and generally those seem to be people unwilling to move or who were only in it for the money. So take things with a grain of salt.

These are generally around 10am-4pm local time, but you're often expected to work at least 9am-5pm/6pm daily.

That's a win, regardless of the stack you're using.Also, especially this early in your career, companies won't necessarily require an exact 1-1 match of their tech stack expectations. You know Java. That's big. You can learn Spring on the side, or even on the job, it's not that hard. Just because you haven't worked professionally with Spring doesn't mean you're unqualified for Java/Spring positions.Anecdotally, I've switched stacks completely many times. Companies aren't DQ'ing me because I have no experience in their stack. They know I can learn on the job, and my resume paints that picture. One company I was talking to used Java/Micronaut, which was a completely new concept for me. That interested me, I had some great conversations about it with my interviewers, its pros/cons compared to Spring, etc. I got an offer. My confidence, and my interest in learning the new tech, made up for lack of experience in a core technology that company used. You can do the same, swapping out Spring/Micronaut with GWT/Spring.All that said, right now you're disqualifying youself without even trying. You've made this whole post freaking out about starting to find jobs... *but you haven't started lookign for a job*. You have no idea how it's going to go for you. Make sure your resume is on point, get rid of the negative thinking and start oozing confidence because you're an intelligent SWE that can pick new things up easily. Companies will see that.

How are they staying within the country?Some of them end up leaving. There are ways to stay, but for a lot of those people they need a legitimate job that pays legitimate money, and if they can't get that, then they end up having to leave because of not only immigration status but also finances.>Also, could this hiring freeze combined with the layoffs be intentional to make the foreigners leave the country without overstaying illegally on an expired visa? Basically slowing down hiring for 90 days until the foreigners on visa have to self deport?Hiring freezes and layoffs are company-driven decisions. Those companies have no incentive to drive foreign workers out of the country - that would just make the cost of labor for them go up. Most companies want foreign workers to be available.So this makes no sense. Companies are doing layoffs because layoffs = higher profits, and that has always been true.>If people on those visas do an unpaid internship, for example, can they stay in the country until they find a real paying job, even if it takes more than 90 days to find the job since they're not unemployed technically while doing an unpaid internship?Yes. As long as it's a valid unpaid internship - i.e., an internship that is consistent with their field of study/profession. Like, on OPT you can't go get an unpaid job as a janitor and have it count. But you can, for example, work as an unpaid researcher for your former grad program (I've seen this done several times).Again, the problem with that strategy is that you need to then have the finances to float you until you do find a job, which isn't something everyone can do. And in a lot of cases, if you get to that stage, a lot of people end up preferring to just go back to their home country and not have to deal with that situation.",dfphd,2025-06-05 14:13:37,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1l3n490,False,

That doesn't mean that there are no open doors for you, but it's going to limit you.

I have never even once had regrets, and many of the opportunities I've had wouldn't have been possible without it. If you have the time, and can afford the expense (I received a partial scholarship), I cannot recommend it enough.Additionally, considering the current job market, it is so competitive for new grads right now that I don't think companies are taking risks on giving someone their first CS job with no work history and no degree. At this particular moment in time, I think it would be incredibly difficult to get your first job in the industry unless you already have personal connections to do so (getting the first job without a degree and proving yourself is the biggest hurdle) or are prepared to work for absolutely abysmal pay or conditions (which may have lifelong career repercussions -- people will probably know exactly how your previous employer paid you and treated you, and it can be a struggle for your wages to catch up even as you move to better and better companies).

Call it coders and SWE. Coder will be a pretty run of the mill middle class, white collar job. SWE is highly compensated working on harder, more interesting, problems. Access to the latter category of jobs will increasingly be gated on pedigree: where you went to school, who you interned with, where you previously worked. Jumping tracks will be difficult to near impossible without some sort of inflection (like getting a graduate degree from a top institution). This is already how it works in other fields like law and finance. In finance there is retail finance and high finance. In law there’s big law raking in big bonuses and local firms that aren’t.

The issue isn't that you lack skills, it's that you're not effectively communicating how your existing experience relates to what they're asking for, and you're being too honest about what you haven't done instead of focusing on your ability to learn and adapt.Stop saying ""I haven't worked with that"" in interviews and start saying ""I haven't used that specific technology in production, but here's how I'd approach it based on my experience with similar concepts."" Your Spring Boot background gives you microservices understanding, your Java skills mean you can pick up any backend technology quickly, and your database experience shows you understand data persistence regardless of the specific system. Build a few small projects using React, deploy something simple to AWS, and set up a basic Kubernetes cluster locally - you don't need years of experience, just enough to speak intelligently about the concepts and show you can learn.I'm on the team that built [interview help AI](http://interviews.chat), and it's designed specifically for situations like this where you need to navigate tricky questions about skills gaps and position your experience in the best light during interviews.",akornato,2025-06-05 06:24:24,1,cscareerquestions,t3_1l3p2xo,False,
