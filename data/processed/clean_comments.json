Then, when the call started, the guy had a super common Brazilian name, so my husband greeted him in Portuguese — but the candidate replied saying he preferred English because his Portuguese wasn’t great, and actually, he wasn’t from Brazil. That was a bit of a red flag, especially since his resume said he graduated from a public university in Brazil (where it’s rare to have classes in anything other than Portuguese).He turned his camera on for a second, then quickly turned it off saying his internet was unstable. My husband mentioned he seemed to be of Asian descent, but it was hard to say for sure. Weirdly enough, the guy still managed to answer some pretty tough Java questions and even spotted issues in code with no problem.A few days later, we randomly saw a video showing AI tech that can fake someone’s face during a video call — the example showed a low-res, vaguely Asian-looking face... and it looked a lot like the guy from the interview. :melting_face:",

When you want to put python functions into your pipeline your options becomes severely limited.

Now flip side. We have some spark jobs that need to be spark jobs. They deal with massive amounts of data, plenty of complex logic and you just aren’t going to get it all to fit in a single node. These are not being migrated away from spark, but are being tuned a bit as we move them to ingest from redshift instead of hive. And I’m going to say that length of runtime when reading from hive to generate an extract is not directly related to decision to keep in spark or migrate out. Some of our jobs run for a very long time in spark due to the hive partition not being ideal. These will run very quickly in redshift because our distkey is much better for the type of pulls we need. It really is about amount of data required to be manipulated once in spark and how complex that will be.",

But there are a few points I don't entirely agree with.I also work for a company that is relatively reasonable in its tech stack. We only have a few TB of data for more than 10 years of operations and most of it runs on an on-prem setup using mostly open source tools. No cloud bloat or any of that.> There’s a tool for ingestion. A tool for orchestration. A tool for transformation, reverse ETL, governance, monitoring and if you’re lucky, a tool for remembering why you started this project in the first place.I'm a big ELT proponent. Part of the ELT philosophy is that each part of your pipeline performs as few tasks as logically necessary.My ingest/outgest scripts run in python and they *only* do ingest/outgest. They don't perform a single transformation unless they absolutely have to.I run my transformations with dbt.I schedule my jobs with Airflow. I don't really see how I would orchestrate my pipeline unless with an orchestrator (CRON would also do fine). Or does the author imply we should have an alarms set somewhere so we can manually run these singular scripts he seems to such a big fan of?> But here’s the secret the consultants won’t tell you:> Fewer moving parts means fewer bugs. Faster answers. A fighting chance that someone on your team actually understands what the hell is going on.One script. One machine. One person who can debug it without a PhD in vendor certifications.I have seen these 'One script. One machine. One person.' solutions he's talking about. I've made a bit of a career out of refactoring them. Often that 'One person' fucked off some place else and now no one understands this one script that is taking 40 minutes to run every 30 minutes.These one scripts typically had hundreds of moving parts that seemed to perform tasks with varying degrees of usefulness and efficiency. Except it's almost impossible to figure out what part does what since it's all thrown together.If you One Script performs ingest/outgest and transform at the same time, good luck debugging your hot mess. If something goes wrong you've now got hundreds of lines of code to comb through to find the offending part.When something goes wrong in my stack, debugging is easy as hell.Does the problem happen between the source and my RAW schema? Well, just look in the ingestion scripts. Is it between RAW and the final data set? Check the dbt queries. Is it between the final data set and the consumer? Check the outgest scripts.When each moving part performs a single, clearly defined task, debugging is a lot easier.Yes, it is true in engineering that fewer moving parts typically means a less complex system, trying to cram as many functionalities in as few moving parts as possible is also not the best idea in general.Imagine building a house and having your water and your electricity lines all using the same pipes in the wall/floor. Sure, you've got to install fewer pipes, but good luck when one of your water lines has a leak.",

That said, I would highly recommend updating your toolset as Pandas and MySQL aren't a great fit for analyzing data of this size. Pandas is a great tool for in-memory processing, but it really isn't a good fit for data that size. Pandas and MySQL aren't going to allow your machine to run at their full capacity on a project like this. You *can* do it, but it just isn't what they were designed for.Instead, I recommend using tools like Polars and/or DuckDB. Armed with those, you can run analyses on data this size (and bigger) with a laptop, stream through terabytes of data, and imagine what you're going to do with all the money you just saved on cloud spend. Happy coding!",

Poor quality code and broken data pipelines are often tolerated because it's internal-facing, not customer-facing. This results in lower salaries.There are a lot of really bright, talented DEs out there for sure, don't get me wrong.

If you didn't do that, I would definitely suggest starting right there.To that end, the more you can get queries to execute in batches together the better.

That'll make a significant cost decrease. * Dont stack tables on top of each other in layers if you dont really need to. e.g if your table is almost 1:1 from your staging to your gold layer make bronze and silver views then gold a table -- Conversely if some of your long running queries have a lot of joins on heavy views then make those incremental tables * Last one - heavy filters on CTEs where possible",

At best you may want to align with a business that creates a product that you agree with. But keep in mind there are dark sides of a lot of these aspirational businesses; Apple wanted to change the world and they did but they still exploit the labor of foreign sweatshops. Tesla wanted to increase EV adoption and they did while at the same time working to block legislation for high speed rail which would have reduced carbon footprints even more by giving an option to those that can't afford EVs specifically because it might cut into their EV sales. Nonprofits in foreign countries spend a lot of time distributing aid but at the same time outcompete local vendors and stifle the local entrepreneurship that actually would bring those countries closer to prosperity and instead keep them in a cycle of dependency.",

Generally brevity is best, it's just less mental load and easier to read but you will find exceptions where the tradeoff is worth it.",

Unless you have climbing locations very close by reusing the weather info, why not bake this into the fact? Then separate your dim route I to dim route and dim location?

I really want to emphasize that before my next comments, as you did ask for a roast =). Also really appreciate you showing your limitations and where you asked for help in this. Now for the actual roast part...While I have no issue with the whole ETL as a tech process and completely agree with it, I wonder if going for a full analytics/column-based solution as your destination was the right call here. From what I understood, you want the users of your product to be able to look up the weather for their next climb. Meaning your back will probably have to serve data a couple of rows at a time, at most. Look up a crag, get the weather, yeah no it's bad, look up next crag, and so on. But no aggregation on the average yearly temperature at 6pm every day on all the crags in Cumbria. The first example is a row based workload, or transactional; the second is columnar, analytical. Parquet and duckdb are really good at the latter, no so much at the former.I understand you tried using PostgreSQL then failed and went to duckdb in order to make some progress, that's good. Going forward I really think you should give PostgreSQL another try, it's way better suited to what you want to do. Also it has a great extension (postgis) to deal with geodata, which you will need to. For the same reason I think you would benefit from reconsidering your data model, as I think a fact/dim approach is going to be deserving you. Your model feels like you had to forcefully bend it in order to fit in. Sure, it works, but there's a lot of tension between your data and the model. Don't know how to express it otherwise.Hope it helps, don't hesitate if you have questions, I'd be happy to provide further guidance if needed.",

Once they can see what you are doing they will just follow. They need to see it, experience it, support it. You can’t convince them by discussing new ideas, they will always shoot them down.

They are the backbone of Airflow and, in fact, they are being used underneath the taskflow API. It's important to understand that there's no direct value passing between task-decorated functions in Airflow (xcom is used for that). Note that I'm talking from my experience with Airflow 1.x and 2.x, and the newest 3.0 release may invalidate some of my knowledge :)Always treat Airflow tasks as separate processes running on separate virtual machines, even if they aren't. It'll save you time when you decide to scale Airflow workers. E.g. use shared object storage or database to exchange the data between tasks. Make tasks granular enough for ease of retry and debugging.Use idempotency for complex data pipelines to its fullest. In Airflow, data\\_interval\\_start/end macros are leveraged for that.",

Use airflow for orchestrating not for data processing, while that is not a hard and fast rule, I see a lot of failures when workers run out of memory because their pandas ingested too much data. Worst part of that is, you loose all your logs, so it’s hard to work out what went wrong. What to do? Track the size of data you are processing and compare them to the memory you have. If you see a trend that tells you you are headed for OOM situations, export the data processing function into a serverless option, be it a k8s pod or any other option.2. When you download files to a worker, make sure you clean it up reliably, to avoid running out of disk space eventually. Use the tempfiles module appropriately.3. Avoid large xcoms. It stresses the meta data db and impacts overall processing. If you have large data to pass between tasks, consider using external storage.4. Avoid dags that run more frequently than once every 10 minutes. The round robin nature of the scheduler means for a non trivial setup can exceed several minutes and you may not be able to keep up. 5. Avoid dags that watch for file changes and do that every few minutes (as above). See if you can have an external file watcher trigger the day instead. Alternatively space it so it checks every 30 minutes.6. Review the day code for expensive functions at module level. The dag gets executed every few minutes and everything at module level gets run every few minutes. So variable.get uses your database, why stress it with hundreds and thousands of such calls. Move these into your python functions.7. Use logging but use it judiciously, your logs can end up in your metadata base, or at least in your file system. 8. Monitor and manage the size of your metadata base. If it’s too big you can’t run snapshots/backups.",

A good product doesn’t mean shit if they can convince people to buy it.Funding can try up in an instance.Becoming c suite elevates you into other c suite roles after the fact. You are now competing with individuals with decades of strategic cto experience with your few years. You either have a strong exit, or be prepared to sell yourself downwards to re enter normal engineering positions. It’s a double edged sword.Comp: cash is king if it’s a startup and team you know very little about, equity is always a risk but has the highest reward. If you take cash and funding dries up, high comp means you get the axe first. If you take equity, it better be no strings attached, decent % and you need to understand fundamentally what the projections out could be. You will owe taxes on the equity as it vests/earns so if it’s sizeable are you willing to pay cash now for something that could implode.",

Sharing the model across workers and pinning GPU tasks to local memory is exactly what most folks miss at first, so you are on the right track.A few thoughts from the trenches:If you want a thesis-level demo, polish, add tests, and maybe a little dashboard so people can see the speed and insights. If you want a portfolio project for data engineering jobs, spin up a tiny Kubernetes or Ray cluster on something like AWS Spot nodes. Even a three-node run shows you can handle cloud orchestration.Streaming ingestion can be worth it if your target is “near real time” dashboards for devs watching new reviews flow in. Stick Kafka or Redpanda in front, keep micro-batches small, and output rolling aggregates to a cache. Transformer summarization can handle chunks of, say, 128 reviews at a time without killing latency.with Dask on multiple nodes, workers sometimes drop off during long GPU jobs. Enable heartbeat checks and auto-retries.Good luck.",

The worker distribution helps with the cost as instead of a sequential run which took me 30 minutes to process a single file which contains 200k reviews, the current implementation takes 2 minutes to do the same. and the application is session based and does not run the whole time. I still have a few optimizations to do. streaming ingestion, though i mentioned it in the post, does not make sense right now because the steam reviews need to be extracted from their web API, since the application summarized millions of reviews, it would have to redo the whole process for the previous reviews as well as the new reviews which just came in. I could work on that as a future addition. Thank you for your input and would love to know more about how i can improve.

Building the full cloud pipeline helps me understand concepts like auto-scaling, load balancing, and production ML deployment that I can't really grasp from tutorials alone. though... even for learning projects, it's good to think about what actually matters vs. what's just engineering for engineering's sake.

In the MSSQL world this is desired as SP code is compiled and sql optimizer can do its job. In Snowflake you get accurate errors and simpler code.

        "body": "Been doing data engineering for 15 or so years now (even before it was called data engineering) and for about 8 of those years Ive worked for different health plans. If there's a constant... It's that healthcare data is an entirely different ball of wax than you're used to working with everywhere else. Not only are the structures weird and deeply nested but the context of the data can be hard to grasp for some. Also, security is a big factor you have to understand. For example no offshore employee can even get a sniff of production Medicaid or Medicare data or you're violating the law. That's a federal law. Some onshore people can't ever look at federal employee plan data for certain situations. Not only that but the amount of vendors and integrations that have all these mind numbing weird schema layouts that don't at all conform to a standard like FHIR makes everyone's life hell in this space.Understanding the complexity of healthcare plan info like the relationship of a member to the group to the plan(s) to the product(s) can get a little out of hand. Then you have a claims where you need a 45 day runout because a single healthcare claim line can change a ton of times before it's actually approved or rejected but you have to capture everyone of those steps along the way. Then you always have to be prepared and ready for an audit by either someone internally in your org or someone from the government so your documentation and processes need to be on point.The reason why we need people with experience in healthcare data is because it's very hard to ramp up people with 0 experience. When I bring on juniors to my team I don't expect them to \"get the data\" for like 24 to 36 months and even then you are always learning new parts or domains of healthcare data and probably still don't understand all the nuances around the data. It's just easier to bring someone in that would have at least a clue about what a care plan resource in FHIR format looks like, how to load it, and how to extract from it.The true gatekeeper is really the rules, regs, complexity and lack of enforced standardized format amongst all healthcare companies whether that be health plans, pbm's, provider groups, client groups, hospital groups, these middleware companies that claim to give you robust integrations... It's all a pile of steaming shit and we are the plumbers to keep it moving.",

        "body": "Learning DE is quite difficult, because its not useful on its own. I have a hard time making learning projects, because the end result of data engineering is just more organized data, not really a product. I work as a DE, so I get to play around there, but there I am limited with the tools I can use. I see two paths for you. Either you make it a project you enjoy and people get value from it. But that here would mean making a useful website, and probably adding more data because if its just weather, people already know what sites are near them and its easy to just check the weather for those sites.The other path is just going full on tinkering. I would suggest maybe getting some free cloud resources and use one of the big data warehouses in one of the clouds. Create tables there with DBT. Maybe your extra data can be weather history. Maybe there is a thermometer at some sites and you can check foretasted weather vs real weather. Optimization is really not needed most of the time. You just make something that works, and only improve it when it stops working.",

You might get insight what you should improve on ETL side and most importantly it gives people option to actually do something with your work.I went through your code yesterday, it was really interesting. Good work! You can, for example, always add more or better data validation but what's point in that since your data source is relatively static and error in data isn't critical. Or make more efficient database schema for few thousand lines of data which is extremely little and databases handle that with ease, same goes for changing from DuckDB to PostgreSQL. You can always make better ETL process, or program, but if your goal is to get something out then you have to stop optimizing at some point and publish or finalize something.",

If you have like 3 tables about the same thing and it make sense to just have 1 table you join them. The second layer is where you test your data extensively. At this point there was no business rules applied or anything. Just renaming, retyping, null value handling at most. Your tests will return errors present in the system you extract. Third layer is where you add your business rules. I like to make one model for each business rule as dbt with duckdb takes like 1-2 seconds for 200k rows. Having multiple transformations together is exhausting to debug, and not really more efficient. Forth layer is where I make my Kimball modeling. One fact for each thing I look at. Dimensions all around. Junk dimensions are build using a SELECT DISTINCT to only have values that happens. Just remember to generate surrogate keys with dbt so you can joins dimensions and facts using a single column. And never join facts together, it's not how a star model work. Having multiple facts inside a single powerbi dashboard works well if you keep it classy. Also remember for each dimensions to have a default value for missing keys. Like adding a \"missing customer\" to your customer dimension.Lastly with dbt and surrogate keys you do not need to join fact and dimensions during the ETL phase as you do not need to use the foreign keys to retrieve the surrogate keys. It's weird to not have integers as surrogate keys but trust the process.",

No more 3am pipeline debugging sessions.Three years ago our data team was drowning. Beautiful medallion architecture (bronze → silver → gold) that looked great in slides but was a nightmare to maintain. Every layer had schema changes, quality issues, debugging headaches. We spent more time figuring out which layer broke than building features.Breaking point: a simple schema change cascaded through 7 tables and killed reporting for two days. That's when we rebuilt everything around FITT principles.The four FITT principles:1. Functional - Pure functions only. Same input = same output, always. Made everything immutable by default. Storage is cheap, debugging corrupt state at 2am isn't.2. Idempotent - Run it 1000 times, same result. Recovery = just re-run it. Junior devs actually experiment now instead of being terrified.3. Tested - Tests as architectural components. Every pipeline has data quality, business logic, and integration tests. They're living documentation.4. Two-stage - Raw → Final, that's it. Raw data stays immutable forever. Final data ready for consumption. Everything in between is ephemeral.We ditched bronze/silver/gold entirely. Those layers were just arbitrary complexity.Key implementation patterns:Dev/Prod split: Dev uses yesterday's data + today's code. Prod uses today's data + yesterday's code. Never deploy untested.Git as truth: Want results from 6 months ago? Check out that commit and re-run against raw data.Incremental processing: Each increment is idempotent. Run once or 50 times, same result.Results after:On-call incidents dropped %New hires productive in weeks, not monthsData quality issues caught in dev, not prodNo more mysterious data driftCommon pushback:\"Storage costs!\" - Compute is cheaper than engineering time.\"Performance?\" - Less debugging = more optimization time.\"Over-engineering?\" - Worth it if you have 3+ people on pipelines.Getting started:Pick one pipeline that breaks a lotMake raw data immutableAdd comprehensive testsEliminate staging layersMake it idempotentFITT made data engineering boring again (in the best way).

If you use streaming iterators, use your languages equivalent of chunked and call batch functions on chunks, don't call single element functions in an iterator.3: Understand the difference between struct of arrays and array of struct (aka row based vs column based), be aware of which of the two applies to the data formats you use and process things in their natural order. This combines nicely with chunking.4: If you use python, use ruff and uv, declare dependencies clearly in pyproject.toml, and use type hints on anything public. Prefer simple functions over classes, take protocol classes as input and spit out concrete data structures as output. Use asserts often, especially if something might need a comment.5: Make your data partitionable if possible. If you use a database, there should be a clear way to split it into (for example) ten smaller DBs with the same layout, and only need to copy small tables. Try to identify or create natural keys that are shared over the entire data pipeline that can be used to neatly split data without overlap. If you can't do this, you have most likely made things too complex and your data should probably be flattened.",

I am trying to not do any premature optimization whatsoever but it just doesn't feel right anymore to write everything in scripts and have coupling between business logic and data specific logic ( schemas etc), especially if I know that the pipeline is going to scale later on. I thought maybe start with the minimal solid base and then add and learn along the way. Again I am not trying to over engineer things, but I want also a solid starting point, maybe the SWE philosophy gave me the impression that it should be the case for DE as well and that mere jobs and some orchestration are kind of spaghetti and highly coupled code ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯",

However, only if I felt that I would have the opportunity to follow-up by upgrading to event-driven fairly quickly.The issue is that temporarily-scheduled jobs *seem* simple, but have very serious issues that some people don't notice: * Late-arriving data: the upstream system is down, crashes, slow, incoming data is slow, logic errors, whatever. The result that is the warehouse is missing data from upstream systems. * Ingestion system is down when scheduled to run, crashes, etc - cannot run, this period never runs or only runs after someone wakes up and starts it. The result that is the warehouse is missing data from upstream systems. * Infrequently-run scheduled processes often have enormous data volumes and run very slowly. The result is that users have to wait to see data, and when things break then engineers get woken up to fix problem and then are up all night babysitting them and users could miss out on an entire day's worth of data.",

Dump a file system snapshot of the database and run a giant global shuffle sort spark job to get thousands of partitions historically up to the above quiescence point. Write to the same S3 partitions you created in 1.4. Run a thread pool and your custom application code to query it in parallel and make it look pretty on your dashboard of choice.

        "body": "I've had experience with multiple clients with similar use cases -- specifically dealing with many single tenant use cases (same schemas) and aggregating into a warehouse for analytics.A few questions you have to ask yourself: **What are you optimizing for downstream?** \\-If your use case is dashboarding and analytical queries across large datasets, Redshift will scale better than Postgres. It’s columnar, optimized for scan-heavy queries, and handles large joins better. At 2.8TB and growing, Postgres will get painful for historical analysis.\\-Syncing data into Redshift with 5-10 min lag is fine using CDC, we have multiple customers doing that at terabyte scale and we are consistently getting <5 min latency even after taking into account the time to run Merges.**Is it important for data to get into the \"warehouse\" quickly and it's ok for analytical queries to be slower?** \\-If this is the case, CDC to get data into Postgres will be faster (seconds, instead of <5 mins). But the tradeoff is analytical queries will take much longer to run on Postgres vs Redshift. **As for your questions:** 1. Depending on the use case downstream, you might want to think about fanning in from many single tenant DBs and writing into large multi-tenant table. Separately you could do a 1 to 1 sync and then use dbt to transform and combine the tables. Our CDC pipeline ([Artie](https://www.artie.com/?utm_source=reddit)) can either fan-in in-flight or do 1:1 syncs, so we've done both. 2. Postgres vs S3: very diff roles. When you land in S3 in parquet files, you'll have to write the logic later to Merge delta files and recreate the current table view - that's overhead you need to consider. 3. Redshift will be easier to manage long term IMO. You’ll likely outgrow Postgres for analytics. Redshift can save you a future migration.4. DMS is great to start off, but at certain scale it becomes unreliable. We've observed that it starts causing problems with data consistency and latency when you start doing mid-to-high 100s of millions of rows a month. That's when we see a lot of DMS customers migrate over to Artie (disclaimer: I work there) for a CDC pipeline that they can trust to scale with them. 5. We see folks mostly running materialized views, but admittedly we have less visibility here.",

On each event, performs a lookup (query) of the other collection to join the data 3. Sends the event to an HTTPS or AWS Lambda function to perform the write the parquet files to S3, using batching as neededI'm actually a PM for this feature so if you're interested or have any questions let me know!",

Your Lambda just needs to make the query, then post the data to the firehose API.An average of 1-2 requests per second isn't going to stress firehose.Configuring firehose will let you choose how big you want your S3 write batches to be. You can make them more like every 15 minutes, or every 60 seconds. It is a tradeoff between object count and maximum latency to write to S3.If you *need* to have the data in S3 within seconds, then Firehose isn't the tool for that. You would just be writing individual objects directly. I am struggling to think why you would need low latency S3 objects -- that's what Mongo would be for. S3 would generally be for your long term analytics or bulk data store, which is more latency tolerant.",

Are you trying to scan all 11 TB to find certain information? Can you partition the data based on additional knowledge to reduce the amount of data you need to scan? If you do need to scan all 11TB, can you add additional indexes to your data table to help processing. Clickhouse has data skipping indexes called bloom filters that are used in scenarios like these to filter out what data is NOT there. There already also projection indexes that you could add to help with the processing. You could extract specific keys from the JSON string you are trying to scan and index off that. I’m on mobile so I can’t test this in Clickhouse but a quick query of Claude gives a few examples on l indexing on the key value of the JSON string. If those don’t work and you are running into issues, it may be time to consider a different processing engine. Spark is excellent at processing large data with distributed processing. If it needs to be in Clickhouse, you may consider re architecting the schema you need in Clickhouse and transforming the data with spark and then reloading.",

That is how I got here because they mentioned that the CRM will give you all of your data if a written request is made, but now that the request has been made, they are saying that the only way to export the data is manually one by one. As in even the team there has no capability to do a data dump, which is BS, but whatever. I also did a deep dive for anything related to web-scraping and I think I'm safe. There are restrictions on trying to test vulnerabilities of the site and accessing data that isn't your own, and I think it's the only option I have at this point unless I want to spend the rest of my career clicking links. I would like to get the data exported and into a google drive because that is what the team can consume. The new CRM has an entire API team I can work with, so I'm not as concerned about the import.

Then spike out supporting them, by actually writing proof of concept queries.Be aware enough of other reporting requirements so as to understand how their additional attributes or concepts might theoretically fit into your model.",

That comes in the gold/datamart/semantic model layer.At this stage it's more 3NF data modeling, which really just requires understanding the source data and determining the primary key and foreign key constraints that (should) obtain in the data. Once you have a detailed, full-fidelity data model you (or someone else) can build various dimensional models for support the analytic use cases.",

When selecting tools, prioritize data volume capacity, latency requirements, and cost efficiency. Streaming solutions like Pub/Sub are well suited for high frequency data but may be overkill for batch processing. Consider your team's expertise level and the learning curve.For orchestration and transformation, evaluate scalability, fault tolerance, and monitoring capabilities. Apache Airflow (via Cloud [Composer](https://cloud.google.com/composer?hl=en)) provides workflow management with error handling and retry mechanisms, though [Cloud Workflows ](https://cloud.google.com/workflows?hl=en)offers a lighter alternative for simpler pipelines. [Dataflow](https://cloud.google.com/products/dataflow?hl=en) handles transformation with Apache Beam, but assess whether your use case requires its complexity or if simpler tools like [BigQuery's builtin functions ](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/functions-all)suffice. Factor in maintenance overhead, debugging capabilities, and integration with your existing tech stack.[Windsor.ai](http://Windsor.ai) offers a solution for data integration challenges. Rather than building and maintaining custom connectors for each platform, it provides prebuilt integrations for +325 sources, including Google Ads, Facebook, LinkedIn, and many others, with direct pipelines to BigQuery and Looker Studio.",

I'm genuinely curious and would think it's awesome if we could combine tech stacks like that, but for now, especially at the enterprise level, it doesn't seem feasible yet)",

One of the rows is identified as the \"Golden Record\", or a new row is added to serve as the Golden Record, and all the duplicates are pointed to that one. After the data stewards and/or some algorithms identify which rows are duplicates, you selectively copy column values from the duplicates to the Golden Record, and when done, the golden record rows are the mastered and de-duplicated data.The table would have columns something like:EntityKey, SourceSytemId, SourceSytemKey, GoldenRecordKey, Name, Description, ...",

We have a data eng team <3 And 50-60 downstream users. Not every user is directly querying but we support a lot of SFDC, Hubspot, Zendesk, any SAAS platform some team decides to use. We cannot keep up proper optimization of every single one of these platforms tables by setting the correct split and dist key it's just unrealistic (yes they have an automated version now last I heard it was in private preview but I don't expect it to be good)Databricks automatically handles via liquid clustering and automated vacuuming.Because of this your price per compute usage is so much lower on Databricks (probably other platforms as well). The queries run much quicker on the same priced clusters. - Severless yes redshift has Redshift serverless and it's fucking dog shit and you're paying a lot. Because it's so bad you're effectively still tied to paying for compute + data, which scaled horrendously for us.Other platforms allow spinning up and down compute much simpler than Redshift does imo -> more savings.- Because of the simplified compute system you can separate jobs much more easily so resources aren't fighting with each other during a heavy dev dbt run or fivetran sync. You can do this in Redshift by modifying the WLM but it's just a bitch and you can still run into problems, it's very much a trial and error process.- If you're working with any JSON in redshift I'm sorry.- We had some governance problems that were helped via the transition, but I don't think the problem was redshift specific.- Not totally relevant but we also had some ML/GenAI jobs we were wanting to use Databricks for so doubled up our use case.- Federated queries make a migration insane easy.Caveat databricks really can be just as pricey as redshift serverless if you leave it to auto scale and aren't particular with your compute sizings. Downside: a lot of SAAS platforms support Redshift integrations but don't typically build out much more than Snowflake, BQ. Any datalake solution you kindve get fucked on here.",

Your initial plan has 6 table scans, the second has 11, but you only specified 4 tables.Your first plan only specifies inner joins, but your example has left joins.The joins are not exactly equivalent. In the first example you've essentially aliased the column names from df1, so everything explicitly joins on those columns. In the second example each table joins based on the value of the the columns as they are after prior joins. If you have any aggregation or select that alters what is in the df between joins, then it may not be able to guarantee the same behaviour as joining on the original column, so it does a different plan. If you want to resolve it yourself, you should take just the first join and validate what it is doing. Then add the second join and see how it looks. Step through it until you see what went wrong.It could easily be some difference or nuance not shown in your example code.",

Spark uses the **output of the previous join**, not the original `df1`.This can cause:* **Incorrect matches** (joins on the wrong side),* **Silent column overwrites**,* **Data skew** if partitions aren't aligned properly,* And **wildly inefficient plans** that trigger full shuffles and Cartesian joins.# :magnifying_glass_tilted_left: Query Analyzer DifferenceIf you checked the query analyzer in Databricks:* You’d likely see **extra shuffles**, possibly **Cartesian products** or large **broadcasts** in version 2.* You might also see duplicated column names or hidden renames like `_col1`, `col1#123`, etc.",

        "body": "I have thought about this a lot lately. I disagree with you when it comes to students. They absolutely SHOULD NOT use A.I. A.I. destroys your ability to think. It may not happen immediately, but it does. I've read countless stories from developers that lose their ability to not only think critically, but can't even remember basic syntax over time. This isn't just happening to programmers. This is happening to other fields as well. The brain is a muscle and if you don't use it, you can't develop it. Now, I'm not saying that its not a valuable tool. It definitely is, but if you are a student or still in the process of learning, A.I. takes away the process of learning that develops your critical thinking skills and the repetition that you need to learn syntax when you are learning. This is also why you take so many math classes. Are you going to use Trigonometry or Calculus out in the real world? Probably not, but that's not the point. The point is that the process of doing it helps develop your critical thinking and analytical skills. The same goes for programmingI'm speaking from experience on this. I'm a 3rd year CS student. My first year I made the mistake in using A.I. in my Computer Science 1 class. Its essentially the 1st class you take that teaches C++ and programming fundamentals like OOP, abstraction, and recursion. Halfway through the class, once we started working on anything remotely more difficult than defining a function, I used A.I. I didn't realize how much I didn't learn anything until I got to Computer Science 2 the following summer. I couldn't write anything beyond basic console apps. I turned off all A.I. including Intellisense, and went through my Computer Science 1 book and did all the projects from that class again. I actually retained the information that time.I have seen so many posts about people who are on the last year of their CS degree, or even graduated, and they don't know how to code. I don't know how this is even possible if you aren't just copying code for projects. This summer I'm in Data Structures and Algorithm Design. Last weeks project was to write algorithms for linear sort, merge sort, quick sort, and selection sort, and print to console the running time along with their Big O Notation to prove their runtime complexity. I would love for someone to tell me how they did that if they don't know how to code.",

I really think people should understand the fundamentals of what they're doing first. Ive seen people trying to use functions that don't exist in c++, I've seen people using endless loops that do nothing not tick in unreal, I've seen people try to mix class component and functional component syntaxes in react due to just not knowing. There needs to be some basics first imo.Personally I still don't really get the hype, but if you do, please learn the fundamentals first so you can know when it's bullshit",

This is NOT what the IT field is like normally. What you're describing is a toxic workplace that's taking advantage of you.$4/hour is insulting even for outsourced work. No training, unrealistic expectations, being asked to train others when you're barely trained yourself? These are massive red flags.We run Metana and we've trained hundreds of developers. The good news is that your interest in programming is still valid, you just landed in a terrible situation that would break anyone.Here's what I'd suggest:1. Start looking for other opportunities immediately. Don't let this place crush your spirit2. Use whatever time you have to build your fundamentals properly. The \"training\" you got sounds inadequate 3. Document everything you're learning on your own. Build a portfolio4. Connect with other developers online, join communities where you can ask questions without judgmentThe real tech industry has proper onboarding, mentorship, documentation, and pays way better. What you're experiencing is unfortunately common with some outsourcing companies but it's not representative of the field.At Metana we actually have students from similar backgrounds who've gone on to great roles. If you want to chat with someone about mapping out a better path forward, happy to connect you with one of our career folks. Just want to help :)Don't let this experience kill your programming dreams. The field needs good people and you deserve way better than this exploitation.Hang in there but definitely start planning your exit strategy.",

For example, accessing the first item in an array. It doesn’t matter how many elements are in the array, it always takes the same amount of time.O(n): linear time. This describes behavior that scales linearly as the input gets bigger. For example, printing each element in an array. As the input grows, so does the time.O(n²): quadratic time. This usually shows up when you have nested loops (a loop inside a loop) both running over the same input. For example, comparing every element in an array to every other element. The time it takes to complete a nested loop structure increases more and more as the input grows, even more than linearly.",

Also, its VERY easy to get confused about WHAT YOU ARE COUNTING. Bad books; you can't tell if they are counting the comparisons or the swaps in a sort algorithm. Those numbers can be similar or very different.You are in part telling me without telling me that you don't understand the NOTATION. The concept aside, O(1) is notation for the simplest thing you can do: you do one operation (this can have several steps) and get the result. Eg array\\[user\\_input\\] = 0; you go there, you do something, you are done. Sure, that is like 8 assembly instructions or something, but big-O is a conceptual level thing, not a detail level thing. You wanted to know how many assignments, you did 1.O(N) is similar. you iterate an array and add 5 to each element. How many times did you add 5? Well, you did it for whatever the size of the array is, but we didn't say... that is abstracted to the letter \"N' which just means \"some amount of them\". You write that one O(N), see how that works?looping over every element with nested loops is a multiply.. for(1-n){for (1-n again)} .. how many times does the inner part happen? Its N\\^2 .. the outer loop does n inner loops for 1, n inner loops for 2, ... right? And that is unsurprisingly written O(N\\^2).So the notation is O (some expression of N). some expression of N could be almost anything you might see in math, from N! to log(N) to N\\^3 to sqrt(N) or whatnot. Big-O only keeps the dominant terms (eg 3n\\^3 + 11n\\^2 + 37) is just written O(n\\^3) .. because in the big picture, the cubed term will soon dwarf the others and give you a general sense of how slow it will be.\\-------------------a log is just an exponent, with its own math notation that is weird and a bunch of cool properties that you are told to memorize without being led to connect the dots, the first time you see them, and many people never get much past that part. I mean, its stuff you know, though, if you can just see past the notation and look at the numbers. 0,1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128 ... you know these guys ... its the powers of 2. How many times, using only integers, can you cut the number 100 in half? Even rounding it up.. 50 (once), 25(twice) 13(three times), 7(4), 4(5),2(6),1(7) and done. Hmm. 2\\^7 is... 128. Hmm. See the connection? The math problem is \"to what integer power do I raise 2 to get 100\". The answer is 6 or 7 depending on if you want to over shoot or under shoot the target. THAT IS A LOG problem, and its all you are going to see in big-O is powers of 2. No base 17 logs or e or anything from math that gets weird, just powers of 2, and that is the question it is asking and the answer. Its not that scary, when you see it written out, hopefully? All the log algorithms are about cutting the data in half over and over, just like that, for example think about how you search a physical book dictionary for a word: you open in the middle, and its more towards A or more towards Z, so you cut the half where it will be in half again... is it more towards M or Z... more towards M or S ... whatever... (and yea humans jump to the first letter section better than by halfs but play along with the blind approach ... this is just what a binary search does ... cuts the list in half until its down to 1 element and its found or not at that point). That is about 85% of the big o stuff. There will be other notations at the same time that denote best case, average case, worst case and so on that you just need to memorize (the notation, I mean, memorize THAT) and rules (like the dropping of constants and taking the dominating term of the equation that your code defines.there are not that many REAL in use big-O answers. There is 1, lg(n), N\\*lg(n), N, N\\^powers, and the ugly stuff like N! or 2\\^N etc. And practical algorithms rarely go abouve N\\^3 before someone gets mad and finds a better way (there are some things where there is no better way, but MOST stuff you see day in and day out has an answer N\\^3 or better). I mean there are screwballs... shellsort for example often ends up with some form of O(N\\^(x+1/x)) eg N\\^7/6 was a common find back when I studied that algorithm. But shell sort needs a freakin PHD level analysis to find the complexity for many of the sequences and its not handed out lightly to students. You won't see that kind of mess most likely, or if you do, they will just give you the answer and tell you (indirectly) that it was a pain to figure that out.",

Basically you count the number of operations that your code performs.For example, the very first LeetCode problem: given a list of integers, find a pair of integers that sum up to a given target. An example of non-optimal solution: def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: for i in range(len(nums) - 1): for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)): if nums[i] + nums[j] == target: return [i, j]It has a loop with n iterations (i index) and inside each iteration is another loop with n iterations (j index). So the code may evaluate the if statement up to n \\* n times, hence O(n\\*\\*2) time complexity.An optimal solution: def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: prev_numbers = {} for i, num in enumerate(nums): complement = target - num if complement in prev_numbers: return [prev_numbers[complement], i] prev_numbers[num] = iIt has only a loop with n iterations. The code may evaluate the if statement up to n times max, hence O(n) complexity.Another common introduction to the notation is a binary search. In a binary search you halve the length of the list at each iteration. How many times you divide the length of the list (n) until it becomes 1? Roughly log(n) / log(2). Hence O(log(n)) complexity for binary search.Look up multiple tutorials and introductions and build your own understanding of the subject. Don't just rely on a single course or tutorial.",

        "body": "So lots of other people have given good breakdowns on Big-O, but when it comes to practical applications I find where a lot of learners struggle isn't actually the time complexity part, it is the part where they look at real algorithms and figure out the Big O. Because they can't read and understand code well enough to make any conclusions on how many times some code might loop or the like.Like, look at some pseudo code like: function maxproduct(List l): int { int maxproduct, i, j = 0,0,0 while (i < l.length) { while ( i + j < l.length) { int product = l[i] * l[i+j] if (product > maxproduct) maxproduct = product j++ } i++ } return maxproduct }If the list contains 1 item, how many times will the \"`int product = l[i] * l[i+j`\\]\" line be executed? What if it contains 10 items? 100?If you can look at the code and figure that type of thing out pretty quickly, then figuring out Big O becomes a lot easier to understand - you're really just talking about the relationship between the number of inputs and how many instructions and how one grows as the other grows.But if you *can't* look at a code block like that pretty quickly and tell me roughly how many times the interior loop will run based on the length of the list, your problem isn't really understanding Big O notation. It is that your programming knowledge isn't advanced enough to really be able to grasp it. So if that's the case, I'd put worrying about Big O aside and instead return to focusing on the basics of reading and writing simple code until you really get it and can read it easily before returning to more theoretical concepts like Big O.",

I had a \"computer class\" that introduced the idea of programming and maybe we copied a couple of small programs from the book but that was it. I was fascinated by it so I asked my teacher and he gave me like, a BASIC programming manual for the apple IIe. Just a list of all the commands and what they did. I didn't have a computer at home, just at school, so I wrote programs on paper and transcribed them at school and took notes and tried to debug in the time I had (usually lunch time)It probably took me a lot longer than if someone could have walked me through it, but I knew absolutely everything about programming the apple IIe.That was my experience for most other programming languages. Usually I would have just a book about it - sometimes these were more tutorial oriented, like they'd have code samples and explanations and stuff, but often they were more like reference manuals. It's a hard way to learn, but at the end, you'll know it.In many cases, there wasn't even a book. You want to learn how this library works? Well, here's the header files and the source code, go nuts. It surprises younger people I work with a lot when I basically say, let's skip the docs and just look at the source for this function. But, the docs can be wrong, the source code can't.I honestly can't imagine learning from a youtube video or something and I am a \\*little\\* skeptical that really works, but people are doing it, so I guess it does, for some people",

This then results in the viewer beeing left with a lot of holes in their knowledge that they aren't even aware of and will therefore likely never be filled. These holes then become a problem during their entire learning process.- Imo, if you're learning about a topic, you should learn about it in it's entirety. Books and official documentation are the best for that.- Also, most (modern) documentations (if you go to their actual websites) are very beginner friendly, offering tutorials and even (practice) projects.So, to sum it up. Online courses/videos are in my opinion to basic and don't cover topics deeply enough. This results in flawed or missing knowledge. Therefore, I recommend books or official documentations.",

Focus on learning 1 framework and all the connections around it ( routes, apis, database schemas, error handling, logging and documentation) is more valuable than experimenting with more frameworks as in the end of the day most of them do the same exactly thing.

So being wiling to jump into other areas when needed can get you more experience outside of what you where hired for. This is how I've gotten much of my experience, basically fixing bugs \"outside\" of my area/domain when needed.When I got out of college I was writing C/C++ code. This new language came out named JAVA which seemed interesting so I started playing around with it in my free time. Someone I knew, knew someone who needed a JAVA programmer. I had written a simulation using genetic algorithms in JAVA for fun, demoing that program got me my first JAVA programming job.A while later I found this interesting technology SQL/JDBC and started playing with that in my free time. About a month later boss asked me if I knew SQL because we had a possible contract but we would need to use SQL to access a remote database. My response was \"Funny you should mention that...\" Anyway we got that contract and I started working with JDBC and SQL.",

UUID version4-variant1 has 122 random bits (4 bits reserved for the version, 2 for the variant).That is 2^122 or `5316911983139663491615228241121378304` possible variations.

How long does a randomly generated alpha-numeric GUID has to be in order to ensure it's collision-proof? It sounds like you're thinking about this the same way I did when I first looked into the subject. \"So, I'm supposed to generate a big-ass random number while jillions of other devs are simultaneously generating big-ass random numbers and just hope that none of us bump into each other? What's the logic here besides 'Trust me, bro'?\" The secret, at least for [Version 1 GUIDs](https://guid.one/guid/make), is that it's actually not entirely random, and that's a good thing. The idea behind a GUID is that it should be unique in time and space. With that in mind, it's pretty easy to deliberately avoid collisions by incorporating spacial (physical or logical space) and temporal components in combination with randomness. Identifying the exact latitude and longitude of the device generating the GUID is often infeasible, so a common practice is to use the machine's MAC address, or a hashed namespace (e.g., company/app URL). Basically, you're saying that this particular GUID was generated by *this* computer at *this* time, down to millisecond precision (or at least, as accurate as the onboard clock can be). That's probably good enough for most uses, but to kick it up a notch, we also generate a pretty good-sized random number, *and* check it against ones we've already made, and increment it if, by some miracle, we managed to come up with two of the same random number in the same thousandth of a second. The thing to take comfort in is that you don't actually need to be unique in all of time and space in the universe. You don't even need to be unique in the history of computing on Earth (although you almost certainly will be). You *probably* don't even need to be unique within your organization. What you care about most of the time is being unique within your application, or, really, within the primary key column of one single table. With that in mind, you can be confident that the pretty good-sized random number generated by Mike's computer at 3:14:15.926 PM on June 10th, 2025, to be used strictly for identifying records in sale_item table in SysCorp's home grown CRM, isn't going to conflict with any other GUIDs in that table. Further, if some rando in Timbuktu, or in the sandwich shop across the street, manages, against all odds, to generate the exact same GUID as one of yours, it doesn't matter, because *they're not putting it in your database.* I hope this helps you feel better.",

No, a player isn't an enemy, wtf were you thinking? You already had a common base class, use that. Besides, an \"enemy\" isn't even a class in itself, nor should player be. They are just specific characters used for specific purposes. You're trying to inherit roles or behaviour, which is bad. Create one character class that supports \"can be controlled\", then player is just an instance that's controlled with mouse/keyboard while enemies are instances that are controlled automatically.Same thing with your archer/mage example. Being an archer is a playstyle, a role, or a behavior. It's still a character, use composition to indicate its roles and/or weapons that it uses. One useful tip is to think of \"can this change at runtime?\" If the answer is yes then use composition. Can a character become a building in the middle of the game? Uh, no. Can an enemy become an ally? Yes, people change their mind => use composition.Also I have no idea what your issue with the Button is. Yes, use composition. Is checkbox something you can press? Then inherit from button. Or just use button as-is, and disable its \"lift automatically\" property so that it stays down (\"checked\"). You don't even need two separate classes, just one button.",

You *should* of course think about the relationships between different objects, and you *should* prefer interfaces/protocols and containment over inheritance. But at the end of the day, what you really need to do is to be willing to aggressively refactor as needed. And that has little to do with OOP specifically... you're bound to make some mistakes as you write code in any paradigm, and you have to be willing to reconsider past decisions and change course.>Your object can't be two things at one.Of course it can. That's practically the definition of *polymorphism* \\-- \"many forms.\">Let's say you have fighters, archers and mages in your game - three classes. At some point, you want the player to be both an archer and a mage. How do you do that without complex or ugly workarounds like creating another class named FighterAndMage ?Well, you *don't* do it with an inheritance graph like Object->Character->Player->\\[Fighter|Mage|Archer\\]. Instead, you could give the class that represents a player an attribute, like \\`role\\` and a corresponding \\`Role\\` type that sets the expectations for what a Role is. Fighter, Mage, and Archer *could* be derived from Role, or they could just be instances of Role -- i.e. all exactly the same type of object, but with different data. For example, it might be that any role can hit an adversary, and any role can cast spells, but a Fighter might just hit harder, and a Mage might have a higher probability of success with magic. If a player can have more than one role at a time, then the \\`role\\` attribute should really be \\`roles\\` and refer to some kind of collection or combination of the roles.>Encapsulation is a useful trait for OOP to make code more secure but getts and setters can add a lot of boilerplate.That depends on the language. For example, in Swift you don't have to write any accessors -- you just use whatever attributes an object has. But there are implicit accessors there, and if you later want to modify them you can do so at any time.>With ECS you have a relation of \"IT HAS\" instead of \"IT IS\".With OOP you have both types of relationships. Your concern about careful planning of the inheritance graph suggests that you've been prioritizing \"it is\" over \"it has\" when in fact you should usually do the opposite.",

Composition is almost always superior to inheritance. An ECS is a great example of this. I use OOP for polymorphism, abstraction and encapsulation.Modelling problem domains like you describe, with a Player class and an Enemy class deriving from Character or Triangle deriving from Shape is very rare in practice in my experience. It works when your domain is more or less fixed, and you can draft the entire type hierarchy from the start. But if there's enough uncertainty and you need to add new types to the domain over time it's just too hard to get right. This is where something like an ECS shines because it's designed to give you maximum flexibility when defining types and assigning properties to them.I also don't think that DOD necessarily conflicts with OOP. DOD just tells you to design your classes around the data and how it's mutated instead of modeling your domain in code.",

Joe Armstrong, the inventory of Erlang (a functional/actor language) once said that he thought Kay would disagree, but he considered Erlang more \"object-oriented\" than almost any other language, and Kay agreed.Now, that's a bit of a minority opinion, but it just goes to show how widely the definition of \"OOP\" can vary.IOW, I think your view of OOP is frankly very incomplete.

That a class can act as a simple object containing only it's properties without behavior (POCO / POJO / DTO), or a class act as a namespace with methods (note: avoid static methods this way) but without properties.",

I try as hard as possible to stay within strict typing and view weak typing as a curse and a crutch.But that’s me. I’m not a web developer, I’ve always been more interested in embedded systems or high-performance code designed to run within restricted resources.Functional programming abstracts too much of the control flow aspect for me to rely on it. When I write code I am thinking about data as real data stored on a medium or memory being accessed and modified. OOP allows me to effectively model and interact with data with several strict guidelines enforced along the way. This is obviously possible with any paradigm but OOP simply gets the job done best for me.When I don’t use OOP I use heavily packed structures and end up attempting to implement similar behavior.",

I totally coasted through my object oriented design class in college and then all those topics we discussed suddenly came flooding back to me the first time I tried to build a personal project of considerable size.As a side note, this may be controversial but I’ve found that explaining design patterns and best practices is one thing AI chatbots are quite good at. They will never give you a definitive yes or no answer, which is probably for the best, but if you ask it a question like “what are the pros and cons of making an object field public when it doesn’t need to be” it often gives pretty insightful responses with some reasons you may not have thought of before as a beginner.",

Again, my brain anchored erroneously on initialising the count at zero:for (i= 0; i < 10; i++)I then realised that I could pass a function as part of the conditional, and also count down re: i-- It took me a **long** while to realise that the initial value for i could be a different value than zero.  Once my brain was no longer anchored to commencing from zero, certain problems became a lot more easier when I rid myself of this anchoring issue.",

Even if half-baked. This is because actually finishing the project is VERY hard, but what I always valued is the tinkerer approach. Of course I'd also talk with them about this to further understand if they are in-fact a tinkerer or just cosplaying as one.I just like working with this kinds of people.

As a simple example, in C and C++, there is a preprocessor step, and there is nothing like that in Python. It is not a \"huge\" concept in and of itself, but it does take some getting used to, and to learn how it can be used effectively, and when to use and not use it, for example.Another peculiarity of C++ is that when doing OOP, member functions are not virtual by default. You must \"opt in\" to make a function virtual. In almost all other languages (including Python), methods (that is, functions placed onto a class) are always virtual. And because they are always virtual, you might not even yet know what the difference is between a function being \"virtual\" or \"non-virtual\", for example. But you will learn this when you learn C++.C++ also has function overloading, which Python does not have.C++ has templates (generic functions), which Python does not have.Python also has some stuff that C++ does not have, or which is hard to do in C++. For example, \"generators\" in Python are pretty useful. Maybe you can do something similar in C++ but it will not be so convenient. Python and most dynamic languages have an \"eval\" facility which lets you evaluate code \"on the fly\" but this kind of thing does not exist in C++. Again, it can be done but you will have to implement it yourself (e.g. by calling out to a compiler to compile code, or else embedding your own small compiler along with your executable).",

Moreover, if you try to switch from a high-level (abstraction-oriented) language such as Python to a low-level (system-oriented) language such as Rust or C++, you will have to learn a lot of additional theoretical material such as memory management and data mutation safety rules.

Famous computer scientist Donald Knuth once said \"premature optimization is the root of all evil\", meaning basically that we should worry about correctness and simplicity first, otherwise we will end up wasting all our time/shooting ourselves in the foot.2. The correct approach is to first have a working program/code/feature, and then assess whether the performance even is problematic, and then if it is, use profiling or instrumentation to see which part of the code is slow and why. Then, focus on optimizing only that part of the code.3. In order to understand why code is slow, you can look at it from an algorithmic standpoint, like for instance noticing a double for loop, meaning a potential N\\^2 algorithm, which could maybe be redone in some clever way to become O(N) or NlogN, OR you can look at it from a systems standpoint, for instance you are only using 1 thread/1 cpu core but your machine as 128 cores available, or you should be doing CPU work and IO at the same time, etc. to maximize utilization of the resources.4. I don't really think it's realistic to be able to write thing fast and efficient \"in the first draft\" as you say, it sort of goes against everything else I wrote here. That being said, depending on what kind of code you are writing, if you have a general understanding of basic algorithms like sorting and searching and so on, along with time complexity, maybe you can build some muscle for doing this just at a basic level. But I would not encourage you to try to optimize things at the system level in the first draft because usually it's more trouble than it's worth.",

Highly recommended so that you're not guessing at the impact of different options re: performance.There's different types of programming and obviously there's areas where speed is priority but I personally don't worry that much about the speed of my code on the first draft. I'm more focused on the quality of the interfaces/organization of the code units and how the mental model is reflected in the code, etc. Not focusing on speed first helps me to only compromise the design in areas where it's truly necessary due to identified performance issues.Usually when I do wind up fixing performance issues in my code, it usually comes in the form of caching. Has its tradeoffs. Sometimes I'm also able to change things to avoid garbage collection running as often or at inopportune moments. Rarely, I'll have to do something like replacing recursion with a loop. Rarely, I need to change data structures or the way data is fetched (this matters but I just rarely make mistakes with this on the first draft.)",

Develop a good intuition for complexity (as in Big O) so you can make snap judgements about how catastrophic performance will be in a loop or whatever. Use that judgement to trend toward low complexity, so that if/when you get to an optimization pass the basics are already sane. 2. Pay close to attention to your intended throughput. Think about how fast this needs to go and how often and how much data it's working on so that you're aware of how much you need to be thinking about #1. Like sometimes my brain has some complaint about a n\\^2+ array operation, but I also realize the array is only every like 10 items and it doesn't matter, readability dominates the considerations. Other times I have to pull down 6 or 7 figures worth of database rows and do some heavy shit to them, and now I'm thinking pretty hard about how to streamline, filter, cache, batch, etc.",

This subreddit isn't called learnCoding either, it's called learnProgramming.IMHO what sets a programmer apart from a coder is that a programmer is capable of understanding (software) architecture decisions in their programming field (and maybe even make their own architecture decisions). A mobile app developer has learned the architecture layers of mobile apps, a backend enterprise application programmer has learned how to keep their growing projects maintainable, a frontend dev may know a thing or two about designs, ... .So what can you do? Understand that coding is one of many means at a programmer's disposal to achieve something greater. Then get a grasp on which field(s) of programming actually interest you.If you like coding, which usually involves breaking down a larger problem into many small steps, you can think of programming as doing the same \"breaking down problems\" into manageable chunks, just at a grander scale. Trust me, it's just as fulfilling to see planned parts of a program work well together as it is to write individual methods that do what they are supposed to do.If you still have absolutely no idea what to do, maybe think of a more-than-trivial, less-than-difficult business use-case and implement that into a program with an agile development style. A business use-case doesn't have to be money oriented, it can be anything you'd use in a business, including any open-source software idea that comes to your mind.While/after you get the right mindset how to approach program development, you can return to game development. If you do it right it'll probably involve having/obtaining some math knowledge that you aren't thinking of yet, which is why IMHO business applications are a tad more approachable if you just want to get the right mindset regarding project work, while doing some goal-oriented coding.",

It’s a process that takes time because we in normal days solving a problem we use the real logic but in programming you have the abstraction to representing real situations in a programming language. If you think in closing a door, you imagine the door fiscally and the knob, but in an algorithm you could think in the coordinate of the knob or if the door is open or close or even if there is a door, so after you have this clear in you mind so you translate each action in code. This is a process to take time to become automatic, similar to drive a manual transmission, the first times you really think a lot when changing the velocity, but after you don’t think on that at all. Furthermore, if you don’t know something exists (a solution) how can you know about it. I mean, my point is I am very ignorant about some music if I never listen before, but the first time you hear it you can know if you like. Solving problems is like that, you don’t know the solution and even where to start, but with practice and learning how others approach the problem you will develop this sense of recognising patterns. A way to deal with this more in practice is learning how to debug and learning debugging tools, so you can see the step by step of the code and the output. Take a look at (python/C tutor)[https://pythontutor.com/c.html#mode=edit] try it and solve some algorithms there.",

I even ask help to people in chat, it's part of what I like about streaming, having other experienced devs who can chime in and I can learn from. The first times I streamed I admit I was quite nervous, afraid people would just mock me when stuck. Instead I found out that worst case scenario some viewers leave, but, as I said, I am more in it to just have fun and learn from others, which is probably why I am pretty relaxed now when I stream, even if I get stuck, which probably helps not going in complete blank mode. Then, there is also the experience factor, if I were to stream stuff in python that I have worked with a lot in the years, I would be able to make something working quite quickly, but I don't want to do things like work, I want to learn new languages and technologies. So either the guy in the video is very experienced and so he cna do a lot of things through \"muscle\" memory, or he may have rehearsed some parts. In whichever case, a lot of things come from experience but we all get regularly stuck, sometimes even on silly things.",

Try Vim (nvim with something like NvChad, or just try the Vim plugin for VSCode and get a taste for it). It is so much fun once you’ve got the basics down. It is worth it just for convenience on its own.This is my recommendation if u are serious about getting a job in this field as getting to know git linux and maybe even vim can help you get a foot hold.",

When I access the db, my .go file reads the .env file that's stored in the same folder as my .go file, but assuming I don't want to share that .env file with anyone at all, how would I give them access to that token?Is this something that's handled in the hosting process?

Also, referencing Stack Overflow or other repos for help doesn't mean that you are lagging; it means that you know exactly *where* to look when you get stuck. If you have understood the concept, that's the real win. And eventually you'll learn how to build projects without using any help :)Keep going, and soon you'll be able to connect the dots faster than you think. You've got this!",

And most of all, py makes it harder to transition to other langs because you got used to everything being too easy, so your difficulty perception gets cooked and when it’s time to go to Java and C/C++ it’s way harder.

Starts directly in the browser and later moves to Visual Studio Code (with full setup instructions).The course is top quality, targeted at absolute beginners and is a proper first semester of \"Introduction to Computer Science\" that will not only teach you the Python programming language, but also *programming*.Sign up, log in, go to part 1 and start learning.Yes, it will be hard. Yes, it will be difficult. If you want to achieve something, you will have to bite through.Learning programming is not a sprint.

Then learn Java/Kotlin. Do you want to develop websites? Learn javascript. Do you want to develop operating systems/embedded systems? Learn C/C++. Scripting or task automation? Go with python. Keep in mind that once you have learned the general principles of programming (i.e learn to think like a programmer), learning a new language is very easy, because basically the only thing that changes is the syntax, and some quirks that each language may have, but the core concepts are always the same. Python is a good generic starting language to learn programming concepts because its syntax is not complex, and it has libraries for everything you might want to do. As for resources, I would suggest first using youtube tutorials/books to learn about different concepts (variables, operators, functions, classes, etc.), then figuring out what the best language is for your use case, and trying to solve leetcode challenges. Leetcode is a very good resource to teach you algorithmic thinking and program optimization. Another alternative for when you get decent is to choose an open-source project that you like from github and try to contribute to it, in order to learn about integration and work with real-world systems. Try to fix some easy bugs, update the documentation, run unit tests, etc.",

It's your brain literally rewiring itself to think logically. Don't give up yet. Give it at least 2-3 weeks of consistent practice before you decide anything. Python usually clicks around week 3-4 for most people, but everyone's different.About whether you should continue, programming skills are pretty valuable right now, especially with AI stuff happening. Even if you don't become a full time developer, knowing how to code helps in almost any field.As for next language, worry about that later. Get comfortable with Python first. Maybe after 6 months you can think about JavaScript or something else.You're not wasting time, just being realistic about the learning curve. Stick with it for at least a month before making any big decisions :)",

What you need to do is learn to write a function that takes inputs, aka parameters. The basic idea is that you write the code once using the functions parameters, and then you can call the function any number of times with whatever values you want. You can use parameters for anything that you want to be adjustable in the function. If you write a function that draws an enemy, you can use parameters to specify the location of the enemy, but also what color(s) to use, how many legs or teeth the enemy has, and anything else that could change from one enemy to the next.Once you’ve got a function that draws the enemy, you can create a list of sets of parameters. Then, you can use a loop to iterate over the list and call the `enemy` function with each set of parameters, and the function will draw all the enemies in the list one at a time.This is one of the fundamental ideas in programming. Computers work largely by repeating simple sets of instructions, very very quickly, with different data.",

(which technologies get you past those early filters? that is location dependent as you've already intuited - the only way to know for you area is to check local job boards)Another early filter is \"do they have a 4 year degree in CS?\" You don't *need* one but, again, if a company is flooded with applicants you can toss all the resumes without a 4 year degree in the trash and still have plenty of choice. If you don't, you're going to need some networking (as in leveraging and building your network of personal contacts, not TCP/IP!) skills, so work on building those up.But the really important things are - can you *think for yourself?* Can you *solve problems?* A lot of young programmers have never really solved problems by themselves, they've either just been following tutorials or, worse, using AI for everything. Once you get past the HR filters, getting through the interview is going to be show that you've got the interpersonal skills every job needs (can you take direction? work as a team? self-motivate?), and then your problem solving and thinking skills.Not every interview is going to have a \"whiteboard coding\" problem, but all of them are going to try to do something to capture how much skill you have versus just how much you've memorized.",

Entry levels are really competitive because of a combination of a couple things: 1) AI is replacing a lot of aspects of a junior role, 2) as a result of the AI influence, companies seemingly want more specialists vs generalists in the market rn (this is my opinion though from speaking with companies and seeing their sentiment), and 3) in general, less companies are looking to spend the time mentoring + training junior talent when they know they can use AI for a certain amount of tasks + hire intermediate/senior talent to come in and hit the ground running right away.What I'd recommend: build your projects and experience in a way that shows your adaptability to pick up new technologies/skills as fast as possible. Show that your insight, productivity, and understanding of how to solve a problem is there, something that AI cannot show! Some things you can do: build an awesome portfolio website to showcase your projects and present them in a case study like format (showcase your thinking and process), align your resume to the very specific skillset that the company is looking for and if you have some dream roles/companies, building projects very specifically towards that, and most importantly: build up your network. Reach out to people on LinkedIn/reddit/conferences/forums etc and build connections to learn and connect with them. You never know where a connection can lead to - I've had people that I met 6 years ago offer me a great job when I needed it most! And finally, as I always do, you can always check out our talent community where we help you upskill on exactly this and find directly recruited jobs for you (but ofc, you're welcome to apply outside of our community too).

She did get hired, of course, but she turned out better than expected.I've noticed some bright people who are pretty quiet. In the past, just being quiet might mean you didn't get hired.

Python is really good in prototyping and creating quick scripts that can fix smaller problems without trying to change the whole architecture. Sorry that this doesn't provide any answer, but it's really depends on the situation at hand. Learn the concepts, and what is left are the syntax and architecture the languages can use for the best. If you are somewhat adept at coding as a whole, you will see many repetitive patterns when we talk about imperative paradigms. Tldr: learn concepts and architectures as a whole and be flexible.

The first internship is rarely a dream job. Nevertheless, once you are on an actual job, opportunities might present themselves to get some light programming done for your company on your free time: small utilities, data conversion tasks, app scripting, etc. that will look good on your resume. Perhaps ask your internship contact whether something like that is likely to be possible. That's what happened to me: I was tasked with just data entry, but I saw the need for an extensive database of all companies in the NYC tri-state area for the data entry personnel, so I purchased a then CD-ROM -based business directory with appropriate data, wrote a custom utility in C++ to convert over a million records into a flat-file database format used by the company, converted all the data on my home PC and handed that huge chunk of data to my boss. He was very impressed and even gave me a monetary bonus.",

Working as tech support doesn't do that.

Switching to macOS helped me with moving closer to Linux, but grabbing a cheap laptop from Facebook marketplace and installing a dozen different Linux distros will get you further and faster. I suggest using a separate machine so you can go scorched earth.**No** because you should stick with whatever you're comfortable moving forward with. People may give up over the tiniest things. DO NOT accidentally kill your interest in programming by changing your environment so much that you lose faith in your foundations. Edit: Forgot to mention that WSL is pretty good right now. When I'm forced to suffer through Windows I tend to use Git Bash for simple operations and WSL for anything that Git Bash can't handle. These days Git Bash for windows has the option to install a bunch of command-line tools that make life on Windows a bit more linux-like. Can't live without it.",

The exam is unknown so you'll need to use your best judgement and logic to put together a solution. Problem solving logic takes practice of similar questions to really perfect, but once you do it becomes a universal skill.1. As an exercise that combines these topics, I recommend making a small hangman program. Try reading the word from a .txt file, handling the guessing part in the console, and outputting your final answer + the amount of guesses it took to a new .txt file. This will cover comparing matching values between an answer/guess array.2. To cover some basic math and parsing, you could also try reading a string of numbers e.g. \"15326\" from a .txt file, then calculating the average and median (requires sorting), and outputting that to a .txt file.Good luck on the exam!",

It's a journey, so allow yourself room to fail. Text books and 3 months? This will be dependent on your current life situation and how adept you are at learning new things. If you read through text books and aren't applying that knowledge practically I'm not sure how much you'd actually retain. Everyone else is pretty spot on. If you rush through the basic you will most likely regret it later on so give yourself a little grace on time frame.",

That is, read a book like \"Automate the Boring Stuff with Python\" and see the kinds of \"boring problems\" are being automated there. Then do something similar for your own needs, or customize one of the examples there to add features to it or to make it more to your tastes.I recently had an issue where I wanted to put some music (e.g. 50 files) on a cheap MP3 player, but the \"artist\" tag was too long to display properly in the \"choose artist\" screen of the player. So, I wrote a Python script to open each one, change the Id3 tag for the artist using a rule I defined (to make it shorter but still legible on the player), and then save it.This was not a genius script by any means, but to me, writing something like this is 100x more rewarding than solving a \"leetcode\" problem. Will anyone else care about the code I wrote? Probably not; I didn't design it to be a general purpose tool. If I put it on GitHub it would receive exactly 0 stars and 0 forks for example (probably I would post it as a \"gist\" if I posted it at all), but I didn't write it to get points or something, I wrote it to solve \\*my\\* particular problem and it was fun to write.

The more you learn about a languages the more you realize that you will only ever know a pin drop and never be a 'master' of it. It's good that you have taken on a role for now, but I'd just set a time limit for interview prepping and just start applying for jr roles when they happens.

A surprising number of people don't even have a computer.

Once you get to know the exercise which is being solved in the video tutorial, pause the video for a few minutes and try to figure out the solution on your own. Your notes don't have to be perfect; you can start by breaking the exercise into small parts and try to guess what the instructor will do next. You can resume the video and then check how close you were.Also, when the exercise is solved in the tutorial, teach it back to yourself or someone else by writing it in your own words. It really helps with revising the concept. Happy learning!",

        "body": "I'll give 3 I can think of. Or 2.5, maybe.1) Honestly I'd already learned most of the important lessons the hard way before hearing advice around them. One piece of advice I can think of though that I didn't stumble into myself was that an engineer once said they view passing self/this to a method/function to be a smell. I hadn't considered that and I don't even really know why it's true if it is. Maybe it's true because it reveals a potentially unnecessary bi-directional dependency/coupling. Sometimes I can't figure out a way to prevent this where the pros outweigh the cons but sometimes I can and in those cases it seems to result in a much better design.2) Not advice per se, but, If I go back, as in really really far back to before I programmed professionally, I saw somebody diagram a program top-down before implementing it. This indirectly resulted in organizing the procedures by level of abstraction and exposed a mental model of the program to latch onto while implementing it. Thinking of things that way (or bottom-up works, too) felt like it unblocked me to create much more complex programs before drowning in my own mess.3) Some advice I got but debatably not \"software engineering\" advice, I would say it was actually a soft-skills thing. A product manager mentioned to me after a meeting that instead of saying things like \"we can't do that\" it would be more helpful/productive to say things like \"Do you think X would be a problem if we do that?\"In other words, it really matters how people feel as a result of technical back-and-forth. I think this can be overlooked if you only interact with engineers. Seems obvious in retrospect but this helped me be more effective when communicating with non-engineers which actually made me a more effective technical lead as well.I think in certain types of software projects cross-team communication of technical mental models around the problem solution is crucial. So this was a breakthrough for me and arguably made me a better software engineer than any technical advice I'd ever received.So I would say to your \"but I wonder if there's more\", YMMV but I would advise to focus on people stuff and notice that people problems are actually more likely to kill certain projects than technical decisions are. And also along those lines I think for certain projects the value is actually more in the understanding of the problem/proposed solution and effective communication around it than the implementation itself is.",

And then again, and again, and again, until finally something snaps.*\"Just one more feature man! Just one more! Please man! One more, then I'll stop, promise! I need just one more feature!\"*No. Fuck that. Not gonna happen. Too many projects, industry and FOSS, die because of feature creep, because codebases bloat- and then blow-up.And people don't prevent it, because a yes-man seems to have an easier time getting ahead in his career than someone saying no, because coporate shills and useless consultants have poisoned modern corporate culture portraying saying \"No\" as something evil.----*\"Any methodology becomes useless when it becomes an ideology.\"*This is true for everything, but by far the worst offenders of this in programming, are OOP, TDD, FP, and early optimization. The fetishization of \"memory safety\" that some acolytes of a certain language that shall remain unnamed are carrying before them like a holy relic, is a close runner up.All of these are useful. All of these have their place. All of these absolutely have the ability to kill productivity, burn out teams, and crash entire projects when driven to extremes.So when someone says \"Write the test before the code\" or \"We should really rewrite this in oxidized iron\", ask them why, and if their answer smells like something a missionary would say to trick people into coming to church, its better not to listen.",

        "body": "Can you give an example?Generally, it's a separate skill. Teaching as a TA or tutor helps practice; so does a client facing job like consulting. My first advice is to go in knowing your audience and what they expect and to tailor your level of detail to that audience. If the audience is non-technical or time is short, it's best to just give a recommendation or answer and let them ask questions. Maybe list the possible choices with a few pros and cons first. If it's an hour long review of said recommendation with a client technical team, be ready to go through the twenty considerations that led to that recommendation as they want you to be thorough. Teaching really does help. After you've explained polymorphism to freshman a few dozen times with a worked example, you can do it with an interviewer who already knows it pretty easily.My other suggestion is that you want to keep a conversation going but at the same time it's fine to pause and frame your answer. There's a video of Tim Cook taking a question at a shareholder meeting where he literally sits at a conference table for almost a minute thinking before giving a twenty second answer. It was complicated and he wanted to check all the angles in his head and decide how to phrase his answer succinctly.It's fine to use a whiteboard or paper if needed as long as you're not being rude. I get interview questions about how I'd design something complex and I'll do that with the interviewer. We'll basically sketch the landscape and they'll add things and ask questions as we go around.I will also stress that BSing technical interviewers usually doesn't work. You may be able to lie to them, but your answer will still be technically wrong and they'll just think you're confidently mistaken. I like people who say they don't know and tell me how they'd find out as long as the question wasn't too foundational. I say a lot of things like \"I've never used that product, but I assume it has X/works like X/can integrate using X/runs on X, right? If so, I'd find the docs and plan to implement it using \\[high level approach that works with the underlying tech\\].\" If it's weird they'll just tell me and I'll give an answer that works with the weird. Show you know the first principle or pattern and can learn new things.",

Don't hate yourself just because you failed an interview. I flat out froze up in my first two interviews, it happens.The way you improve is by first looking up mock interviews on YouTube, and learning what a \"good job candidate\" is even supposed to look / sound like during a coding / behavioral / systems design interview. This is not one of those things that's \"obvious\" in the sense that you should \"just know\", especially if you don't come from a white collar background and aren't used to presenting yourself as a professional. You gotta at least see a good example.After that, you gotta do what you can to prep. Look up \"X interview questions\". Replace X with Python, Java, Springboot, Javascript, React; whatever you think may be relevant based on the job description. You usually don't need to be extremely thorough, just some skimming to be sort of mentally and emotionally prepared for the kinds of questions you're going to run into. If the questions do seem wildly off from what you know, just do the homework and try your best to study up.And beyond that, you need to be honest with yourself. Did you really know the answer, just not how to phrase it? I did a lot of random LeetCode / Hackerrank before I even did my first coding interview. I knew ***nothing*** about DSA though, I relied entirely on my intuition to solve problems. That ultimately meant I was bad at doing coding interviews, and I had to swallow my pride and work through neetcode before I got to a good spot with coding interviews.Edit: I also verbalize everything when I interview prep. I'm not a naturally good speaker, so I try to talk through everything to be good enough for interviews. It's important to not talk too \"hastily\" though, you typically want to talk like you're trying to hold a conversation.",

If you're reading a book and coding along side it and suddenly you get burnt out - move to video tutorials for a bit. If it's too easy or feels like review, skip to the next chapter. Being thorough and learning everything is a waste of time imo, it takes away from the actual building of stuff that cements the long term learning and problem solving skills.

You have an idea in mind and you can ask AI for a working example that you can explore.Like you ask them to write down an Hello world example of Async API written in Flask with Rediss queue, and it write a few line of code on which you can understand the code structure and then implement on.Back in 2000 years you had to do that by trying to write you this code, it doesn’t work, and then write in a forum for a guru that reply to you and you pass two-three days for a working example.Off course asking for the correct stuff, for alternatives, searching for WHY something is done in a certain way is extremely useful.For example Gemini have the DeepSearch function. When you need to develop something you can ask a researcher on the better technology to do that with pro and cons, and it provides even resources linked that you can check to its responses.Then you need of courses to made experience.For me this is another windows on the knowledge.Back in 2000 one “difficult” feature to write in PHP was write the pagination function on blog/forum/stuff with multiple page. I mean the function that show >> it was a really pain to write and doesn’t exist frameworks that automatically write it for you. I need to say now that all are not able to programming due to framework?! No! All of them are tools.Remember in programming the abstraction is EVERYTHING! Meanwhile the technology become complex you will continuously need to focus on the high level programming and less on the details. And AI is this for me.(You don’t now how many bug and cve you bring in your code with npm install when you work in Node.js and multiple library, but you accept it because you can’t reinvent the wheel every time).To conclude: the important things is always challenging the tool to learn and use them in the right way.",

As long as you're aware of that, though, and have the instinct to check something with primary sources or \"up to date\" references that needs to be checked, I don't think this is as much of a problem as some people seem to make it out to be.Next, you cannot do common computing tasks on a book like \"Search\" (at least not in a print version). But for this, there is \"the table of contents\" and \"the index\" which may seem quaint but are actually better for learning, in my opinion. If you go to the index to find a term, for example, then your eyes will encounter other related terms and you'll naturally want to look up a few more and to increase your knowledge.Personally I like the feeling of holding a book and flipping through pages. At least, to me it feels a lot more enjoyable than scrolling through pages on a screen. Maybe it's just because I use a computer for work so much, that doing something on the computer (looking at document) feels like \"work\", whereas looking at a book on paper (even about programming) feels like not work, even if some aspects of a physical book are more laborious, such as flipping pages or finding the correct page number.",

That is why everyone always suggests doing projects, because then you apply your recently gained knowledge, and then you learn!Books have the downside that it is tempting to skip through the boring stuff, and only read whatever confirms what you already know. They can give you a feeling that you totally understand things, because the book explains it so nicely.Interactive tutorials like free code camp and others, have the downside that they only ask you to answer predefined questions, and you risk becoming like a monkey pressing switches, without any idea of why or what you are doing. And since they tend \"finish\" every topic without ever returning, you forget the first things you \"learned\" before the course is complete.Video tutorials are mostly just watching someone else repeating a project they have done before - kind of like watching someone play a game they've already completed. It can be great for actually seeing what is going on, but like in life, there's a huge difference between seeing someone else doing things, and do them yourselves.My recommendation is to look around, try some different things, see what you like, and then focus on applying the knowledge to projects where you can't just fast-forward or skip to the page with the solution. Then you are learning!",

I'd say with Go there's a slightly higher chance the interviewer wouldn't be as familiar with Go and might ask you a question about your syntax. Should be fine if you're good at it, though.Picking C as your primary language for interviews can occasionally be a weakness. While C is a great language, there are some things that are just a lot more tedious in C. Just about any problem that involves appending strings, for example, is more tedious in C, especially if you want it to work with arbitrary sizes and handle errors correctly - whereas C++ and Go have nice high-level string objects that you can easily split, append, and so on.It depends on the problem. Probably more than half of coding problems would be just as easy in C.",

There's a final project (I believe) that you are supposed to submit.There's also CS50p. This isn't CS50x in Python.

Depends on what YOU want. Skillset or More Money from levelling up what your job requires.If you have the same interest as the thing you work, that's the cherry in top. If not, you can work something else. Maybe strengthen your unity skills, one good indie game can make you hell lot of money. You can try freelancing and other things.Also, as you said that your are finding new things everytime you learn something, don't get overwhelmed. I've been a unity game dev for 7 years and everytime I open Unity documentation almost always I find something new. Coding is such a thing that would not fully end even if you die. It's natural to get overwhelmed and fell lost but don't,my friend, it's a long journey.Also please don't try to learn everything at the same time, like you metioned java, 5 other things, first master one thing and then move on the other.3. You can use AI to either make you an intellectual or completely destroy your brain, depends on how you use it. ONLY use it when you are stuck on a problem or a bug for a few 20 minutes. AI doesn't destroy anyone, they let AI destroy them, it has been the best thing that happened to me because I used it responsibly.This was my answer, believe me , thing will get better, you WILL overcome the doubts you have, just believe in yourself,good luck and ALL OF THE BEST BROTHER, YOU CAN DO IT.",

It's more similar to a ternary operator than an if statement, just less cryptic.You can also do pattern matching on function arguments; for example, if a function takes a list, you can do foo :: [a] -> b -- function type declaration foo (firstelem:rest) = -- something that splits off the first element and does whatever with the rest foo _ = -- something that is evaluated when the first pattern isn't met (ie, the list is empty and there is no first element to split off)(anything after `--` is a comment in Haskell)Monads/Functors/Applicatives can also be used for flow control; effectively, you can execute a function on an input only if everything upstream didn't encounter issues.",

If there are designers, they will take care of most UX/design thinking, but you do get to participate and offer suggestions.Designers often work out of figma or similar apps, which don’t really behave exactly like a browser, so they do need the programmers help. Designers also often expect people to behave predictably, and there always those ppl who don’t. I happen to have degrees in both engineering and graphic design and can tell you: if you enjoy coding , FE will be your cozy niche. If you enjoy creating the visual interface and interactions, but coding in general bores you, stick with graphic design.I CAN do some BE in Java, but it bores the hell out of me because it’s so predictable and stable and mostly boilerplate. Which is why I have never gone fullstack, and will continue to avoid it hopefully until I retire. FE is chaotic and I love it. It’s always new, every interface has its own problems to solve, ready-made component libraries only get you so far and sometimes they introduce more problems than they solve, and that one goal of less than 2 seconds to page fully loaded really keeps me going. Doing a website with React is easy, keeping those page loads under control is priceless.",

My situation very often in the FE is like ”console.log and pray”.Doing stuff like phone/desktop apps might also do it for you. I work as a webdev and do iOS apps as a hobby. As for AI fears… I thought that my job would be one of the last ones to be substituted by AI. Silly me. If we think that way… given you are about 20ish… it’s way more scary now than 5 years ago. However… which job right now isn’t in danger? Humans are good at adapting. I’m 45. When I was in highschool and begged my parents for a computer because I wanted to code, the internet wasn’t a thing and they had a hard time believing I’d be able to make money out of a computer.In 30 more years, maybe ppl will have jobs that don’t exist yet… or the world would have been parkinglotted by nukes, who knows.",

A consulting company usually wouldn't care how you accomplish a task as long as it works. A product based software company will usually demand more as they have invested a lot of effort and resources in that product.> Now, I have found out that, that I'm really dumb. I had been using web servers for an year in JS and only recently I figured out the entire architecture when I had to build an HTTP server from scratch in C. It has been a huge challenge and still is.A common pitfall many new devs fall into. Do you really need to understand everything about everything? Don't get me wrong, I want to differentiate between you wanting to know how HTTP server works architecture wise and you feeling like you have to know how HTTP server works. One serves to broaden and enhance your skills while the other only serves to impede you.> If I learn how to apply a concept without first trying to understand it completely, is this a good strategy?It depends on what you are trying to understand. Do you want to know if it is possible to do a task using a particular concept? Sure, you can implement messaging between two clients using BLE(Bluetooth Low Energy) by following a YT video. Do you want know the limits of what you can do with BLE? You then go and read the RFC for BLE, learn about it's specs, versions etc.TL;DR:- Both approaches are fine, it all depends on what you want. Want to get something done and don't really care for implementation details, go for application over mastery. Want to know what is possible and what isn't? Go for mastery over application.",

It depends entirely on what I'm doing. If I'm using a library and need a refresher on how something works, I'll look up its documentation. How long and how often depends on so many factors, it's impossible to even give a guess answer. Some days it's an hour or more (if I'm learning a complex framework), sometimes I don't need to at all (if I'm doing simple stuff). 2. Mainly what's changed is I'm able to find information much faster. I still read docs a lot, but the amount of time it takes me to find the information I need is less. 3. That depends entirely on how good the docs are, and how complex the thing I'm looking up is. If the docs are good, it may take me less than a minute. If the docs are bad, I may need to find the source code of the thing I'm wondering about and figure it out myself. In that case, it may take 5-10 minutes if the source is complex. 4. AI is barely even a substitution for docs, especially in the beginning. You should not be using it as a replacement for docs until you're experienced enough to know when it's feeding you nonsense.",

WebGL has multiple versions and a bunch of extensions, and shares GLSL with other graphics APIs (Vulkan and OpenGL), each with their own versions - which ends up creating a mine field for LLMs.Trying to build something outside of your current abilities is a good way to grow though, it'll show you real quick where the gaps in your knowledge are and give you something to work on!

When you do an operation like copyto, the underlying code performs a loop requesting the amount of bytes to fill the buffer, it then moves those bytes to the specified destination. If the amount of bytes received was less than the number of bytes requested then it repeats the operation fetch operation until the number of bytes received is less than the number of bytes requested.The idea being that some streams have an overhead for reading or writing, by reading a chunk at a time (rather than a byte at a time) you can avoid a lot of that overhead. Also have a look at r/csharp. If you've got c# questions it's a more specialised community",

The whole \"use a thesaurus to avoid repeating yourself\" thing that English majors do in prose is actively frowned upon in comp-sci works. If you mean the same thing, use the same word again.Also what happens in real settings is that rarely used words are just not as present as other vocab, so we either need to think for a bit (either to mentally translate or to search for the word) and this is bloody exhausting. Just reusing the smaller core vocab is kind of a defence mechanism then.> Listening, especially when there are native speakers, provides some challenges.

What sqlite cannot do, is process multiple *WRITING* requests at the same time, as this requires exclusive access (either locking of the WAL (Write Ahead Log) or a pending db lock). sqlite does support multiple concurrent *READING* requests### WAL ModeSince WAL was introduced, if it is activated (by default sqlite uses the older rollback-journal), readers and writers do not block each other any more, and reading doesn't block other readers.So sqlite, with WAL enabled, supports multiple readers at the same time, and supports reading and writing at the same time. The only thing it doesn't support, is multiple writers at the same time, those are forced into sequential access, because they need to lock the WAL.https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html### Rollback JournalIn this mode, which is the default unless the journal pragma is set otherwise, sqlite still supports multiple readers and only one writer, but; other than with WAL, readers in this mode block writers, and vice versa.What this means (since sqlite version 3): If someone writes to the database, the DB goes into a `PENDING LOCK` mode...allowing current reads to finish, but disallowing further reads from the DB. As soon as the last read finishes, the database goes into `LOCKED` mode, the writing access does its thing, and then the lock clears.This means, with the older journal mode, if a lot of writes happen on a DB, read performance suffers.https://www.sqlite.org/lockingv3.html#rollback",

I haven't seen any sqlite distribution that wasn't for a loooong time.Good code should check however, wether the sqlite compilate used supports this, and if it does, which thread safety mode it uses. The catch here is that there are 2 different modes:`SQLITE_THREADSAFE = 1` means multi-threading is supported, but auto-serialized. This is slower, but safer.`SQLITE_THREADSAFE = 2` means true multi-threading is supported, but there is no auto serialization. If this is the case, and in many sqlite distros this is the default now, *threads cannot safely use the same connection concurretly*. In this case, a connection-pool is usually the way to go if you have multiple threads accessing the DB.https://sqlite.org/compile.html#threadsafe",

Otherwise, one user would be able to see partial incomplete updates from another user's in-progress transaction.And locking happens at the granularity of connections, regardless of whether those connections are used in different processes, or different threads of the same process (as long as `SQLITE_THREADSAFE` is used, as you said).

Even then it may lie and tell you configurations that aren’t valid, are deprecated, or are extremely bad practice and bound to have issues in the next stages of work. It never wants to say “no that doesn’t make sense, zoom out and do it this way”. It’ll say instead “yes! Of course you can do xyz. Just change this flag to true!” When that flag does not and HAS not ever existed. In most cases I find it more useful to use the AI for some context on a given task, then go straight to looking up documentation and coupling that with stack overflow or other forums.

Lying in the interview is what got me two offers.I think lying in interviews just does both of us a disservice. I think it's important that we both know what we're getting into. I want to be able to actually do my job after getting it. Nobody would even give me a second interview if I didn't talk up my senior/lead experience. I was being honest. I have some experience leading projects. I'm very comfortable with it. I am not a person with *years* of lead/senior level work, though, and that's what they wanted to hear.So I spent a few days running through the stories I had of my experience, and I rewrote them under the guise of *being* my tech lead. Same story, different angle. I know all the decisions we made on those projects, because I was a part of them. I didn't *make* the decisions, but now, in my stories, I did.I went from getting past recruiter screens 1/10 times to 10/10 times. It felt a lot more like interviewing 5 years ago. I still failed a lot of the later stages, but I don't care about having a 100% success rate. I only needed one job.If the rest of the market is lying, then you have to lie as well.

One thing I'd like to maybe elaborate on is your point about lying on your resume. I think for that point it should be noted to not outright lie about things that can be verified (like schooling, certs, places you've worked, etc) however, embellishing your current (or immediate past) role is absolutely a must. Its important that you can speak confidently to that, however, so make sure you can answer questions about it at atleast an intermediate level in an interview setting. And this can also tie into your point on doing personal projects, which you can use that experience to fluff up your current role but it'll be worth much more if its part of your job experience (in an enterprise setting) than if its just a personal/home project.",

When I first started I would literally filter jobs on linkedIn to states nobody wanted to live in, like Ohio. You will be given jobs in locations that people don't even know exist. A lot of them have barely any applicants. If they are desperate enough they will hire you. Another tip would be to update your resume to have your location be within the same area, since companies might filter you if you are located too far awayIt's a good tip. *Even if you don't like the idea of living there*.As you'd only be there for a couple of years or so, then you're equipped with a 100x stronger CV because now you *have experience* (vs **none**), and you can make an attempt to return back to one of your preferred cities.This is a far better plan than never even being able to start your tech career at all.> **7. Interview advice: be honest but not too honest**Think of it as like going on a date. Should you be honest during a date? Yes, of course, *especially if* you wish to have a long term relationship with them (such as is the case with landing a job! You want this not as a one week long fling but to work there for years and years?). But you also want to show ***your best side*** during a date, don't be **brutally** honest.> **8. Do not negotiate**Depends on the person, as you can only negotiate if you're coming in from a position of strength. Are you ready to walk away? 95%+ of the people complaining on this subreddit are not in this position of strength, and thus shouldn't ever try to negotiate.",

Developing that range will also help you see modern problems in a different light, even though COBOL may not be directly transferable.

I work on systems far older than I, some as old as 50 years old. There's programs we support written in the 70s that are 140,000 lines long and none of us have any idea what it does - but it runs every night without fail, so we just leave it alone haha.Will this put you in a \"hole\" for COBOL only? Somewhat - the experience you gain on the mainframe is not directly relatable to other tech stacks like the cloud. On the other hand the mainframe tech stack is much more stable than the cloud and thus your job is too and I always see mainframe roles open online for banks, insurance, government, financial companies, and larger/older retailers.I've done Mainframe Dev for a decade. I've seen 4 migration attempts to the magical land of \"cloud\", with all kinds of unicorn farts and rainbows promised with it. I've seen all 4 fail.When I was getting into it all my Computer Science class, even the professors were saying \"What the heck are you doing COBOL for? That's ancient, it's going away, it's useless\". Meanwhile I interned at a shop (mainframe companies are called \"shops\") over the summer and was offered a job in my Sophomore year once I graduate. I literally had a job lined up 2 years before graduation.In my experience coding will be 25% of your time.An additional 25% is people that aren't mainframers (business folks, other coders) asking you \"Why did the mainframe spit out this value?\"The remaining 50% of the time is using Intertest and your brain to step through decades old business logic and in the process learn both the program and the actual business you support.This \"business knowledge\" will make you a critical to their business to the point they can't afford to lose you.I still play some in the distributed sandbox, debugging C# program error, updating Java classes for mandatory upgrades, and small at-home Node projects.Given how my life turned out, I would give it a shot.",

Don't take my individual anecdote as a rule or anything, but her experience is pretty relevant to your question.I hear her talk about her job and all I can think of is how thankful I am to *not* be in that industry. She recently invited me to a night out with some of her other doctor friends in the area, and you wanna know how early we planned it? *Three months ahead of time*.That's the time she needed to get all of their schedules and time offs aligned just to have a single Saturday open for a full night of plans.Whereas for me *all* of my Saturdays are open. I'm actually the opposite, I prefer not to make plans that far in the future cause I often do things spontaneously. If someone messages me Saturday morning to see if I wanna meet for happy hour, I'm free. Only exception would be on-call rotation, but even then I still go out and do things, I just don't do anything that would keep me from responding to an incident within the hour.And the amount of hours she works... jesus christ. I'm a 40-hour-a-week man. Even the crazy SWE's that work themselves into the ground are only logging 60-80 hours. That's like a vacation to this girl.And you know something else she recently complained to me about? Rampant misogyny in her workplace. Leadership that was making stupid calls, causing all sorts of scheduling drama impacting her hours, ruining the workplace, etc (she left that job over it).The *only* reason many medical professionals are working is out of passion. It's a miserable industry from what I hear. But they love it, they're helping people, they're saving lives, so their sacrifice *their own* life.But all the things you seem to be complaining about (minus passion) exists over in that world and then some.The grass is always greener.",

That's like... Principal SWE at least, and those roles aren't frequently hired externally. They may even be more of a fit for a Senior PM or an EM role.But a regular run of the mill Senior SWE role? They're not gonna want to touch somebody like that with a 10 foot pole. They're too expensive. That person's shooting way below their belt if they're just looking for a \"senior dev\" job that isn't extremely specialized and niche to actually *utilize* their background.If I had that experience, and I were trying to apply to \"regular\" jobs, I'd be fudging my resume to make myself look like the type of candidate that gets hired into those \"regular\" jobs. Know your audience.Their experience also confuses me, they make no mention of how much professional *SWE* experience they have. I know they were a PM for 15 years, but that's not relevant to SWE. Their 10 years as an AI/ML scientiest may or may not be relevant either. So that would leave them with... 13 years of SWE? It might be a bit telling they didn't bother to mention SWE experience at all, and focused on a bunch of qualifications and non-SWE roles in their rant. I'm just making assumptions here thoughI have 12 YOE, and I apply to Senior SWE roles and get them just fine. Even in the market of 2024, which is when I last job hopped. When I can do the job just fine... why would they try to hire someone with 38 YOE that's probably asking double or triple my salary?If I had 38 YOE, I don't think I'd be targetting the same roles I'm targetting today. Maybe I'll be eating my words when I'm up there though.",

Also depends on what he did specifically on the IBM Watson team, it might actually pigeon hole him into very specific/niche things where the only other companies doing that sorta thing would be places like OpenAI which have a lot of competition. Might not open doors in smaller companies if it's too niche.* Certification/Publications/Bachelors, OS, game engine, scripting language * Generally won't be relevant to anyone that has long term work experience like this guy, unless the publication is specifically for the role he's applying for.A large amount of his development experience also won't be relevant to today either, because he's been working for such a long time. 38 years ago is 1987. I doubt any employer really cares about his experience from '87 -> 2010 in this market, as it probably isn't that relevant.Like there's plenty of ways you can screw yourself even with a resume like this in today's market. Not saying this guy couldn't learn or like pick things up, but if you have people with the exact experience you're looking for in the exact tech stack within the last 5 years, you'd probably go for that guy right?Especially with a work history that long, he's gonna have to tailor his CV to every job he applies for to make it fit. I'd have cut all the project/program management stuff, the thought leader stuff etc and try and make relevant experience fit into a two pager, but depending on the order and timeline of his experience he might be screwed anyway.

That's not to say that you shouldn't document and do proper design, but balance and know when to prioritize a less perfect solution that solves the problem.Also FAANG tries to build everything from the ground up. Need a pipeline to load data from X place? Cool, let's build it. Orchestration? Sure, maybe we get an open source tool that requires some time to set up. Or build our own taking a quarter to do so. Or use the in-house solution that does not rely on external libraries and no one else outside of the company knows.Startups are messy and sometimes cannot wait for that clean code that only uses internal libraries, passes compliance and security requirements in all known legislations including countries where they don't even have customers and optimize for the best design and algorithmic solution at the cost of spending more time planning.Lastly if nothing works it is totally okey to change companies or to leave the startup world to go a regular employer where the pace is the right for you. Even if you don't get a fancy stock package (that might be worth 0...), your mental health is important.PS: some startups would rather hire from other other startup than FAANG precisely because FAANG tend to house in-house tools and focus on building from the ground up instead of just using a vendor.PS 2: IMO, 2.5 years at a FAANG probes you are a capable engineer. So focus on your weak areas.",

Speed isn't everything, but if you regularly take 5x what a task should take, that's going to be a problem for places. You could also just be bad at communication. Shit happens in development where something you thought would take a day takes weeks. Sometimes you're learning a new area of the code base that takes you longer. If your manager/team don't know, they're gonna just assume you're slow because you're slow. These things should be brought up in standup, or as they happen directly with your team or manager. Being proactive and vocal is the key here. Now it could be other things that are less in your control, like they could be looking to force headcount lower or your manager might just not like you or some things like that.

But then COVID hit and a bunch of tech jobs moved here, and it made the housing market go completely batshit crazy - and it was largely because a bunch of people with a bunch of money flooded the market.At the same time, that drove salaries up - because to afford working in Austin, you need to afford living in Austin. The issue was that salaries didn't increase in every sector - so teachers and government workers got completely fucked. But us in tech? Doing great.Now, Silicon Valley and NYC are a different story - those are cities where that cycle of salaries -> people -> housing has been going on for decades now. Now things are someone shifting because jobs are moving out of Silicon Valley to lower cost areas, and that implications of that are going to be complicated.Now, offshoring - yes, it's 100% tied to cost of living differences. Not just housing - it's also food, services, healthcare, etc. But the same issue above at a city level also happens at a country level - countries with great quality of life and resources can offer better pay to attract more talented people who then have more money to spend on goods and services, etc.I do agree that the US has a ton of opportunities to lower cost of living - and I think you're right that housing is a big one (with healthcare being the other one).And I think you're also right that the nimby movement is extremely damaging to our ability to deliver affordable housing. I also do think there's a more global issue of real estate investing driving prices up and making it harder for people to buy homes for personal use.",

How cheap do you actually think good offshore devs really are? Latin Americans are now being paid almost as much as Western Europeans nowadays. Talented senior devs in India are making six figures. The truth is that offshore salaries have increased a lot in the past few years because as more work gets offshored the costs go up since there are only so many quality devs out there. Also, an effect of that is that the cost of living in places like Latin America, Eastern Europe, India, etc. is increasing because now that they have more money to spend, realtors can now increase the prices of rent and houses over there. So the cost of living in different countries compared to the US is not a static thing, and I think that there is good reason to believe that the cost of living abroad is going to catch up.",

That's actually huge for your resume, even if it feels overwhelming right now.The \"solving hard problems all the time\" burnout is real though. At small startups you're constantly firefighting instead of building, which gets exhausting fast. The farm fantasy is totally normal lol. I think every developer has that moment.The fact that you have real AI/ML experience from a startup is actually pretty valuable right now. Don't underestimate that. Sometimes you just need better work-life balance and actual teammates instead of being a one-person army.My advice: don't make any big decisions while you're burned out. Maybe take some time off if you can, then think about what kind of environment would actually work for you. The skills are there, it's just about finding the right fit.",

They just don't have the support structure in place to help a junior get their footing which sets them up for either failure, burn out or both. I would use whatever PTO time you may have to take a break in the short term. Do something you like, something that will completely take you away from work. In the long term I would seriously consider switching jobs. I understand that it's easier said than done in the current market but at least with a current job it might make it easier and if you can pull it off it will be worthwhile in the long term. If you're getting burned out this early in your career, then that's a sign that something is really badly wrong as burn out rarely goes away on its own without major changes. So make the necessary change before you completely burn out.",

Notably, i think it in the current form it is likely overwhelming for juniors while at the same containing statements that would be quite concerning over-simplifications at staff-level interviews.Second ( and maybe even more important) - in my experience, when people blunder system design interviews, it's usually them doing something in a rather creative way that betrays they lack of understanding. Where by 'creative' I mean pretty much all of them I can think about still would have failed even if they had read your guide.",

For example, some of the diagrams in the guides are directly coming from the sessions I made in the mock interview sessions. Most candidates, not all, of course, were actually able to land E5/E6 roles. I feel like it is much tougher to perform as an E6 on the job rather than pass a system design interview. Regarding the 'creative' part, I can't agree more. We aren't art majors, and we shouldn't present solutions that would surprise or confuse for the interviewer. I take it to another lever by mostly advising someone to use the tech stack of the company they are interviewing for to minimize any friction in understanding.I think the resources were built with those comments in mind and do provide a lot of guidance on level expectations as well as level-separation, but I'd absolutely love to chat with you more about the feedback either here or in my discord - [https://discord.gg/njZvQnd5AJ](https://discord.gg/njZvQnd5AJ)",

Meant to be harsh to show you why you likely haven't gotten interviews.1) tech lead should be capitalized, put Technical Lead2) \"I was responsible\", not necessary. The way I was taught was that one bullet should be one line.3) How does \"responsible for making technical decisions on behalf of my team\" help market you?4) Is this anonymized? \"Making the initial design and POC for a new project\" is useless information that tells me nothing about you. 5) Created a custom virtualization engine. Ok, we're getting somewhere. What is this?6) Why is Google uncapitalized?7) api is not a word. Capitalize to API.8) Move stack to bottom. Why is there Stack on the first two experiences, but Technologies used on the 3rd one?9) Your first experience tells me nothing about you. What's a project you worked on? What was your impact? Do you know what your impact was? How could you be unemployed since April and not put anything towards this? \"Worked on a custom virtualization engine that improved performance by X% (before/after). Designed and developed API responsible for XYZ that reduced costs by X%\"10) Python, Linux, Jenkins, all should be capitalized, they're proper nouns11) \"This includes writing code, managing other people's tasks, and the bureaucracy of getting multiple teams on the same page\". This doesn't tell me anything. Did you design anything? Sounds like you were a junior engineer changing CSS colors, talking over a scrum board, and sending out emails. Am I wrong? Tell me *why*.12) First sub-bullet point is better. The only positive I see here. Make this more concise. \"Parallelized test suites and reduced run time by 80% from 10 to 2.5 hours\"13) \"As part of suite optimization. I also made a custom partitioning service\". It's a casual resume, but the grammar needs to be better. Speak in active voice and not passive voice. \"Created a custom partitioning service to optimize tests...\" 14) Why do you give such useless info? \"This role included leadership responsibilities.\" That tells me nothing about what you did. \"Mentored and helped onboard new engineers by creating a X day plan, writing documents, pair programming\"15) \"And more\". Wtaf? 16) \"Jenkins (Also jenkins api)\" lol17) Software *e*ngineer. Capitalize.18) Why is feb lowercase?19) You wasted a whole line to tell me what the italics of \"Software engineer\" told me. Useless summary in this bullet here.20) \"for internal use, for department's team use\"... ok. What did it do? One time I sent a LMGTFY link to someone at work for C# documentation, I could write \"Worked on a custom script that linked to documentation for internal team use21) \"Currently slowly taking courses in mathematics\" is just bad. Just list your courses and say they're in progress.22) cpp/c? Do you think the shift or caps lock button exists to be used when you feel like it?23) You told me you used Python... 5 times over this resume.24) Skills: \"Decision making\" leads to this type of resume?25) \"Working with vague requirements\" but made the most vague resume possible",

Absolutely not, but there's really no reason to panic.Remember, the only people who stick around this kind of subreddit are those who have been stuck trying to find their next gig for a long time and are losing hope. The people who find jobs end up leaving and only come back when they're back at square one.You can think about it kind of like incel groups. The people who stop being incels eventually move on from the community, leaving behind the people who spend all day hating.",

There’s a fix in Congress right now, but it’s included in the BBB that is struggling to get through because of bipartisan non-support.The BBB is terrible for America and bipartisan party members agree. It’s not getting the votes it needs to pass, which is good. The amendment to the tax code should be a separate issue, but it’s thrown into the omnibus BBB to try to convince others to buy into the BBB.Once that tax adjustment gets remedied, hiring will increase significantly again. They are also giving organizations back pay on their lost tax credits from 2022 - present. Expect a surge, a small plateau, a small correction, and then stabilisation.",

        "body": "The market seems to have been steadily improving since late last year. I don't have broad market-level data, but I can offer some personal anecdotes.Anecdotally, I've known well over a dozen engineers (ranging from 2 - 5+ YoE) who have either left or been laid off in the past year. Everyone has already gotten new jobs; typically within a few months and typically for more money.As another anecdote, I've also job-hopped recently and got multiple offers ranging from smaller companies to FAANG+ at 3 YoE. I\"ve also noticed an inveease in recruiter contacts since late lasy year.Also anecdotally, we've been trying to fill a position in a major tech hub and we're really struggling to find qualified candidates. Almost 20 candidates have made it to the final loop and nobody was good enough to hire. We're not even asking for a lot; just some typical Leetcode medium/OOP/system design/behaviorals.Not sure why this sub's experiences tend to be negative. But imo, if you have several YoE, then the market is pretty decent - nowhere near the absurd covid period; but not bad either.New grads do have it kinda rough; especially those without internships or networks to help them stand out. We have sent out job postings at a new grad level thay recieved thousands of applications within a day (though the vast majority were unqualified due to visa, no degree, etc).",

If it's not a recognizable name, recruiters aren't going to respect it.* You have no one to learn from. Your skill is at best similar to a junior engineer, so you're going to keep doing those bad practices that junior engineers do because of no mentorship.* If you're one of the few engineers there or the only engineer there, that's going to look fishy to future recruiters and force you to lie. They definitely care about how many engineers you worked with.* Inherently less job security because it's a startup.* If they're promising you equity, it's probably going to be worthless whether the startup succeeds or not, either because the startup fails, it gets diluted, you leave before the cliff period ends, or investors and founders take everything during the exit.Those are five good reasons to take the big tech offer but do what you want.",

Honor your end of the employment contract while they continue to honor theirs. If they lay you off, and stop your pay checks, stop giving them work, but don't stop working before then.2. Do what you can to prepare for a layoff. Start looking for other jobs. If you can get interviews, do the interviews. Try to get a financial buffer. You may not have a long time to accumulate savings, but cut back on whatever spending you can, if your financial buffer is small. Maybe have some thoughts about long term investments you can sell if you run short on money.3. Don't worry. When worry can be turned into practical action to mitigate risks, take those actions. But beyond that, worrying has no productive value, then just don't do it, or waste as little effort on unproductive worry as you can.",

But, it simply hasn't gone up at the same rate as people have been trying to enter the field.So the end result is that there are way more applicants for job openings now.You can blame companies all you want for their hiring practices, but from their perspective, they're literally drowning in applications, they can't keep up. In the last 2 years it's gotten even worse as 80% of resumes are now doctored by ChatGPT and cheating during interviews is through the roof.Why does having a connection help? Because companies are desperate for candidates who are genuinely interested and skilled. If another employee says \"yeah, I want to work with that person\" that's a huge sign.",

In fact, i would argue that there are so many people enrolled or graduated from OMSCS that even people who graduate from the in-person MSCS program at GA Tech are now mistaken for having it done online.

If you were living in California or Texas at the same time you were getting your master's from GA Tech, we know it's online.However, like I said, the education itself is fine, so if you are just concerned about the quality of the education rather than the prestige, it's still a good program.

He was also a giant prick to his employees and everyone he worked with. He would throw out these applications and make comments in front of his team, and after the acquisition his team told on him. The parent company flew HR out from a different state to fire him, and while he was still in the 20 minute meeting they grabbed all of his shit and put it in a box, changed all of the passwords he had access to (which were many), and sent him on his way. I live in a state that doesn’t have super comprehensive anti-discrimination laws but it was still Very Illegal and could have gotten the company sued.",

So I think a lot of US companies would discount that (not completely ignore) because it's a foreign university especially if your goal is in something like a regular dev role.But I think outside of top US companies (like MSFT Research) the Chinese Tsinghua University is actually pretty well respected especially within Asian countries/communities.

Even at big tech companies with rubrics and strict criteria for assessments, the human factor is still the dominant component. The overwhelming bias is to hire who we want to work with.. Now, a corporation could never admit it, but that's the basic truth: sales skills matter tremendously. People who come across as easy to get along with, humble, and earnestly interested in the companies problem carry a massive advantage.What I see in a lot of junior engineers is good tech skills, but not great public speaking or sales skills. If you want to distinguish yourself, figure out how to speak in a compelling way, and learn the basics of how to make a sale. You don't need to become an expert, but just avoiding mistakes means a huge difference.",

A big point of this was me demonstrating my actual skills and presentation, because we will always be presenting our ideas and solutions at work.During the coding portion, I felt like I semi-bombed something as simple as trying to display text to the terminal in a certain way because I was really nervous. But I think the saving grace from that was me speaking aloud my thought process and how I plan to approch the problem.Other feedback I can remember was because I had relevant skills in the tech they were using and showed a willingness to continue learning beyond college because they saw I had an AWS certification on my resume and I told them how I was self studying in the same tech stack they were using before and after graduating.",

Who their biggest competitors are. What they’ve been working on or released in the last year.Read the fucking job description and be prepared to answer any interview questions around the reqs as well as posible. If they have a “nice to have” section do some research on some of the topics. Maybe put together a small project or a larger project design doc including some of them. It will at least get you thinking about how they might be using that particular skill to solve a current issue or what they might be trying to do to improve a current problem.Think and research how they might solve some of their more technical problems. Come up with some questions around them. “How do you prioritize x’s backlog when z seems to change often and requires a lot of maintenance.” Don’t be afraid to ask the hard questions. “With Company A partnering with Company B to build a platform that allows users to do X. What strategies are being considered to compete in that space?”This is the kind of shit that’ll separate two candidates that performed equally well on the technical parts. And if they can’t give you a solid answer just know that it’s a potential red flag about the product and company.Not saying you do this for every application but if you get a recruiter callback on a company you are excited about, do more than just the minimum otherwise you won’t stand out.",

I only did less than 120 Neetcode problems because I already got interviews scheduled before I'm able to finish them. Surprising things that happened:1. My earliest resume that is not really polished and kinda embarrassing got the attention of a FAANG company, another FAANG-adjacent company, and a mid-tier but large multinational company. They are interested even though they would need to do visa sponsorship (non-US).2. I failed a lot in my initial interviews at multiple companies (including the only FAANG) since I'm really rusty with interviewing. I was so burned out by the experience, I try to not be such a tryhard anymore. I go into interviews thinking I wouldn't be able to clear it anyway, but at least I'll get free mock interviews with the best engineers in the industry. I faced a lot of unfamiliar tech questions, but I try to do bruteforce and optimize based on patterns that I know. I answered behavioral questions as transparent as possible even though it wouldn't put me in the best light. After the interviews, the recruiter will give me great feedback especially on the behavioral questions, which I thought I obviously bombed. Coding interviews and system designs are also mostly positive, only I bombed the FAANG-adjacent one due to communication issues I think.Just like you, I think luck does play a major factor in my process. I didn't get into FAANG (or adjacent), but got a few decent offers. I'll keep grinding for the future opportunities. Whoever is reading this, don't give up, I hope things will be better for you.",

They used you up and burned you out. Why are you feeling guilty? > pinged at all hoursFind a job where this isn't a requirement. You can ask them questions in interviews.Most sane places will have on-call rotation at least.> I want to leave on good terms, but I'm stuck.You don't have to flip tables or anything, just hand in your notice. You can quit for *no* reason.Most people give a generic \"oh I was looking for a change\" reason to not stir things too much.You could go with \"to focus on my studies\".If people start hassling you and guilt tripping you for your own life decisions, they're not good people.If you can, ditch at least one of the part-time jobs. Maybe take up more hours at the least-worst one if you need the pay.That should at least mean you only have to deal with a single company's way of working.Burnout can be pretty serious. Going straight into a new job without recovering is unlikely to go smoothly in all honesty.If you can, I'd say focus on finishing your studies + recovering.If you really like the incoming offers, ask them if you can join x months in the future once you're finished with current studies.Also remember: it's not your company. Turn up, do your job well, then go home. If that's not good enough to stop things imploding, that's someone further up the chain's problem. You did your bit.It's good to get on with co-workers but most people simply wouldn't be there if they didn't need to be.Don't feel like you owe them anything.A job is something you do, not something you are.",

In corporate that in to the description of your roles and projects you worked on so that the LLMs don't filter your name.Also, make it one page. Ain't nobody got time to read no 2 pages.While we're at it, meet recruiters. Go to meet ups. I've had more success with networking then applying to these faceless corporations.Lastly, contribute to open source libraries, or start a hobby project...also leetcode grind... and like take care of yourself, exercise, eat 3 meals a day, take a shower every day.",

Maybe reword it in a way that highlights growth. What were you doing with iOS apps at a Jr. level vs. Senior for those same tasks.3. I’m a fan of short summaries about a person’s general experience and what they’re looking for at the top of the resume.

The fact that you're doing full-stack work right out the gate is hugee. Most new grads get pigeonholed into one tiny piece of the system. You're getting exposure to legacy systems, modern React, cloud migrations, testing... that's honestly a pretty well rounded foundation.At Metana we see a lot of people get caught up thinking they need to learn every new framework. But honestly, the fundamentals you're building, understanding systems, debugging, working with teams, matter way more than knowing the latest JavaScript framework.For leveling up income, give it 12-18 months then start looking around. Having real experience under your belt changes everything in negotiations. The fact that you've worked in sales is actually a huge advantage most developers don't have.Your current setup sounds like a great place to build solid foundations without the pressure cooker environment of some tech companies.

Preferably, get one that uses your degree or at least requires a degree of some kind, but if you can't, then just get whatever job you can get and even a part-time one, as that will get you out of the house and start adding work experience to your resume as well as possibly get you a starting position at a company that you can use to transfer to other roles later if you work somewhere that has the types of jobs you might eventually want. If you want to start working almost immediately, consider staffing firms, as they can usually get you in somewhere the same week. It might not be the best job or the best pay for the first 90 or so days before you go permanent, but I've found that's a short amount of time in grand scheme of things. If you have no interest in that, though, then yeah, just keep applying and preparing for interviews.",

Good HR departments know that different people need different things to thrive, and what works well for one person might feel like a nightmare for another.

        "body": "You might need to think about if you hate this specific job, or if you hate \"working\".Daily standups, time tracking, etc are all pretty standard in the industry. If those things are draining to you... even if you take a year off to refresh, you're just going to immediately get drained again once you start working again after the break.That's why I always recommend *against* people wondering if they should go for the nuclear option of taking a year off in order to combat burnout. Taking a year off will feel amazing, you'll be super happy during that year, but you're going to just burnout again the moment you get back. Taking a year off will not be a magic fix. You need to try and actually fix the root cause of your issue. Taking a year off is treating the short-term symptoms, not the long-term root cause.I hate working. I only work so that I can afford to live my actual life. I have a very clear separation between my work life and my personal life. I don't like daily standups, I don't like time tracking, I don't like pointless meetings, I don't like having to be available 9-5 M-F. I don't think anybody does. But we all do it with the understanding that yeah, some of it sucks, but we do those things because we get a deposit into our bank account every other week that lets us afford the things we actually like doing.As for where you're in your career, it's also not a smart move. You have a year of experience. That puts you firmly into the \"entry level\" category, which is objectively the most difficult category to be job searching in. When you're that early into your career, everything is very fragile. Taking a year long break now, versus taking a year long break when you have 5 YOE are completely different. When you're mid-level, you have a lot more stability, and your re-entry into the industry will be *significantly* easier.All that said, it's also not a smart move financially. Early in your life is when the money you save is most important. The money you put into a mutual fund today is going to be worth *a ton* when you're older. The more money we have stashed away, the more money we make. The rich get richer. When you intentionally nuke your entire life savings to do a big year long trip, that's a decision that extends far beyond the immediate impact. Sure, immediately you lose $X. But you also are losing a very significant amount of unrealized income that would've made if you had kept that money invested.Even setting aside the income aspect, money you have saved is supposed to be your emergency fund. Sure you can afford to live for a year without income... but what if something unexpected happens, as often happens in life? What if god forbid you get into a car crash? Now you need to buy a new car, and you have 5-6 figures of medical bills. What if your sister has a destination wedding? Now you get to decide if you want to miss your sisters wedding, or shorten your vacation to be 8 months instead of 12. What if a million other things pop up? Financial planning isn't about the \"happy path\".I'm all for taking a year off, traveling, living your life, etc. But I think you need to do it for the right reasons, and you need to understand all the costs and risks associated with it. Personally, I would wait until I had at least 5+ YOE before even considering something like that. If my job sucks, I'll find another job, not take a year off. Anecdotally I have enough money saved up to live for over *a decade* without income. But I still understand it'd be a massive financial decision to actually go voluntarily unemployed. Having the money to do that, doesn't mean you *should* do that.",

There's a breakpoint around 4-5 YOE (it used to be 2) where things open up a little more.As you've noted, quitting does carry risks. Namely, being unable to re-enter the SWE workforce in a loose labor market. It depends how financially conservative you are. It also depends on exactly how bad your mental health is as a result of working. If you were about to do something drastic because of mental health issues, then of course take time off. It's a huge cost-benefit analysis and only you can really answer the question for yourself. Though I hope this gives you a place to start off.",

Or did you assume it'd be OK to wait until 8am?Obviously an expectation of after-hours responses isn't healthy, it creates a bad WLB. Your time outside of working hours belong to you. But that doesn't change the fact that if it's an expectation, then from your employer's perspective you're not meeting expectations.Another side of this in addition to employer expectations is your own professional boundaries. Did you clearly communicate your working hours? When contacted after hours did you make it clear that it was *after hours* for you and that you'd get back to them first thing in the morning?Especially in a distributed world where people may be in different timezones, and where a lot of people are setting their own hours, some people just don't realize if it's after hours for someone else. That may be insensitive to not consider that before firing off messages... but it's not uncommon.Even on teams with a good WLB though, after hours messages happe from time to time, for various reasons. Sometimes it's urgent issues, sometimes someone just fired off a message without realizing it was after hours, sometimes someone was just sending a message before they forgot and aren't expecting a response until the nxt day. I don't guarantee to be reachablea fter 5pm, but f I get a Slack/Teams message after 5 I normally just pop in a quick response: \"What's the urgency on this? I'm not at my laptop (even if I am), can this wait till the morning?\"Communication makes the dream work. which actually kinda ties into a secondary issue... are you even sure this whole after hours debacle had anything to do with your managers review? Were you having 1/1's with your manager talking about what was going well and what wasn't? Your manager not renewing your contract should not have been a surprise. Sure that's also a failure of *them* for not communicating, but communciation goes both ways.",

People move, so stay in touch, make a good impression, and show them what you can do. People respond to positive people, so try to keep that going.Now to the caveat. In my experience (in the US), interns are usually non-exempt. So I don't expect them to go past their paid hours. If you have a boss that doesn't understand that, that's not good.

If that's how you feel about them, then you need to give them that feedback during the internship so they can address it.>Also, we have a new boss (boss of my boss) and this guy totally skips my direct boss to text me always outside working hours (once it was 6 pm, another at 7 and the most recent was a message this Friday at 9pm) which I always reply at 8am in the morning, and he never replies until he just texts me days after after working hours once again, am I wrong here?There are two answers here: the practical one and the ideological one.The practical one: \"Hey big boss, is this something urgent you need done right now - and if so, by when? If not, is it ok if I get back to you tomorrow at 8am?\". You just *have* to ask. I've been doing this for 12 years and got a new VP 2 years ago and the first time he asked me to do something at 5pm on a weekday I immediately assume he meant that instant (because I've had bosses like that in the past), but I asked \"hey, do you need this right now?\" and he immediately went \"oh god no, no - do not work on this right now. This is a tomorrow thing - I just wanted to get that in front of you because I won't have time to chat about it tomorrow\".But i've had VPs that would have expected an answer that moment. And then you have to decide whether you want the job (which means you should do it), or whether you think this is BS and don't care to work for a company like that (in which case you don't).And that's the ideological answer: if you don't want to work for a company that expects you to be on call without being officially on call (i.e., getting paid more for it), then you shouldn't just go along with that stuff.",

There was a shortage of software skills for a long while. And arguably there is still one for senior roles, hence H1Bs. But when it comes down to **entry-level** positions, there is no question that companies will still prefer Americans. The cost and the risk of the visa lottery isn't worth it on the low skill level. There might be more openness to it for master program graduates with specific skill sets. But entry level + BS + need for a visa in 2025 is a pretty difficult combination. You see tons of resumes in this sub from people specifically looking for sponsorship.That said, H1Bs are not the reason that the CS market has stagnated at the lower level. I think it's easy to blame a single group or entity when things are not going well, but there are more powerful factors affecting the market including:* Offshoring* Everyone who prints \"Hello World!\" Is a \"Senior Software Engineer\".* Companies that pushed the boundaries of CS are now monopolies impending progress.

The mental health stuff is no joke and honestly sounds like you went through something really intense with that whole family situation realization.Look, the 3 year gap thing... yeah it's gonna come up in interviews but it's not the career killer you think it is. I've seen people with way bigger gaps get hired, especially in tech. The key is how you frame it. You don't need to go into all the personal details. Just say you took some time to deal with family issues and explore entrepreneurship, then pivot quickly to what you learned and why you're ready now.The fact that you were getting recruiter calls right after graduation tells me your technical foundation is solid. CS First Class from a good uni + those A-levels? That doesn't just disappear. But yeah, 3 years is long enough that you'll probably need to refresh some skills.This might be controversial but have you considered doing a bootcamp to get back up to speed quickly? I've heard Metana actually get a fair number of people who already have CS degrees that wants to update their skills or switch to a different stack. It's way faster than trying to self-study everything and the structure might help given what you've been through mentally.The business thing with your friend though even if it didn't work out, you learned something about building products and working with customers. That's actually valuable experience, don't discount it.For the immediate job hunt, maybe start with some contract work or shorter term projects? Less scrutiny on the gap, gets you back in the game, and you can build up recent references. Once you have 6-12 months of recent work under your belt the gap becomes way less of an issue.Your technical skills are still there, just need some polish. The mental health journey you went through actually shows resilience even if it doesn't feel like it right now.",

I'll have to figure out how to explain the gap without going into too much detail.I had no idea omitting the graduation year was an appropriate thing to do. If so that gives me some hope as I'm very confident with my interview performance. My fear is getting there in the first place.I don't have a very specific field in mind, though when I was applying a year and a half ago I focused on full-stack webdev. The only reason I did so at the time is because I knew I could strengthen my CV by doing projects and it's easy to make visually interesting webdev projects.That being said for a starting role I'd be open to anything. Do you think I should decide on a very specific field for the purpose of building skills relevant to said field?",

Any halfway decent dev knows switching jobs is normal not just for a pay bump, but because if I had to stare at the same walls for more than 3–4 years, I’d lose my mind. I enjoy new experiences and learning new tech and honestly, almost every dev I’ve talked to says the same.",

Modern self-driving cars were introduced about a decade ago. At the time, there was a lot of hype. There were predictions that we’d have fully autonomous vehicles within a few years. Millions of truck drivers, delivery drivers, and taxi drivers would suddenly be out of work. Progress has been made, like Waymo’s driverless taxis, has been made. But, it has much slower and the edge cases have much harder to solve than anticipated. I think we might see AI play out similarly where progress is slower and the edge cases, which are kind of infinite when talking about general use AI, are harder to overcome than the hype masters hope. Or maybe someone will release AGI tomorrow. :person_shrugging:",

Learn from your failure.> I know to check the 'authorized to work here' as yes and to check 'sponsorship needed' as no (then later explain that you're a Canadian and a TN visa is far easier)Correct.

I used to lose sleep that something random would come up in my background check and my offer would be rescinded (hasn’t happened yet…knock on wood). I don’t see anything usual in your post. In the very unlikely worst case scenario where your offer is pulled for restructuring or budget cuts, I think FAANG companies still provide a few months pay. And you cracked FAANG once, so you can probably do it again if you had to. I would try to relax as much as possible if I was in your shoes. Easier said than done, but hopefully you can find something fun to take your mind off things for a while. Good luck with your new job. I hope everything works out for you.",

That being said, it still matters. WGU is going to be pretty low regarded, it’s just too much of a box checker. And given your academic background, I can’t see why you couldn’t get into a much more prestigious online program (such as Texas, Illinois or even NC State would be much better). Texas, for example, offers 8 week terms, which means that you can spread your effort by taking one class per term and finish in 2 years. And upon finishing, you’d have a degree from Texas.

I think dev configurations are a great place to start honestly, you get a ton of instant, quick feedback, LSPs are a gateway drug into incremental compilers, and in general how a lot of open source architecture is implemented is based on unix philosophy (do one thing and do it well), and this naturally lends itself to a lot of \"distributed systems\" problems (maybe not a global fleet of millions of processes, but certainly quite a lot; what do you think those processes are doing when you type \"ps aux\"?). also if you have a CS degree you'll pick up this shit really quickly lol",

Or you don’t contribute enough during meetings? Understand their expectations, only then you can address the problem3. Most deadlines are fake, it’s better to take more time than to produce poor results, because then you’re late and people believe you lack skills.

Ive realized that it’s very safe to assume that the return offer is never guaranteed. The interns in faang in 2022 thought they had guaranteed return offers until the 2023 tech recession hit. There is no guarantee that you get a return offers even if the company usually gives them out. Your org/team might not have headcount next year.There’s 8 hours left  in a day assuming you sleep for 8 and work for 8. If maximizing  ur chance at succeeding in this unstable industry is important to you, then you can find 1 hour to leetcode and be in form for the next recruiting cycle. Especially since you seem like you want to aim for higher and higher.

        "body": "Here's what'll get you an interview:1. Network. Not like a coffee chat with someone, but like you've delivered value to them somehow already and they're willing to take a gamble on you. To get my first job out of a boot camp I took a gig stocking shelves in a warehouse at a tech company, networked my ass off for a year internally, and got hired into the next junior role they had.2. Build useful things. Not a movie rating app, build something that you could charge money for. In fact, if you can actually monetize it, that's the best case scenario. Ideally, you'd build something that confronts some of the more challenging problems in web design. An app that solves caching problems with real time interactivity across users is cool and shows something, but your movie rating app won't count for hardly anything.3. Don't go remote. Anyone in the world can compete for a remote job, so it's orders of magnitude harder to stand out. Apply for in-office jobs with local companies who can meet you face to face. It filters out the competition and let's you make the process a little less sterile.Honestly, if you're 100% self taught, you need a bangin project. Even with boot camp programs you get some kind of \"OK, they know *something*\" assurance. If you're self-taught using online resources (which is what I would consider Udemy) you're going to need to be able to show some good work.The good news is that if you *can* show good work, I think a self-taught dev that can build is always going to be viewed more favorably than a boot camp dev who can build, just because self-taught takes some grit.",
