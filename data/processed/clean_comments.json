Data Analyst typically is.> Whatever language you're using should have some kind of built-in testing capability.

SQL Server actually has columnar storage, which is useful for OLAP workloads, through using the \"columnstore indexes\".3. Extract logic: Python, could use some higher level framework like Meltano or dlt.4. Transformation logic: DBT, could be replaced with SQLMesh.5. Orchestration: Dagster.6. Git server: Gitea, could be replaced with newer fork Forgejo.7. Dashboarding: Metabase. It is much easier to use than Superset.8.

Many Microsoft shops just used SSIS, scheduled stored procedures, Powershell scheduled tasks, and/ or .NET services to do their ETL/rETL. If you weren’t in the ‘Microsoft everything’ ecosystem, it could have been a lot of different stuff. Korn/Borne shell, Java apps, VB apps, SAS, or one of the hundreds of other proprietary products sold during that time. The biggest factor was probably what connectors were available for your RDBMS, what your on-prem tech stack was, and whatever jimbob at your corp, knew how to write. So in short… there really wasn’t anything as universal as Python is today.",

Analytics focused pipelines and business logic (more advanced dbt models such as mrr models). Technical overlap with the data engineers and business logic overlap with the analysts. Not so much focused on optimal usage of compute and so on but more focused on business.Data analyst -> data modelling in dbt to the specifications of the analytics engineers and data engineers and most importantly of course: analytics. The analysts in our company also write similar models to the analytics engineers but usually with less of a focus on complex models and more of a focus on analyses. Though that can vary on a need by need basis.The data engineer never does analytics or visualisations and neither does the analytics engineer. However, all are required to work with git and dbt. We also require knowledge in these technologies for analysts but most analysts would no know how to set up a dbt project or how to structure it. That's not their focus. But they still need to understand dbt well enough to create models and run tests, for example.Data engineering is definitely still viable. Basically, they are the people that keep the data sphere clean from a technical point of view and most knowledgable when it comes to setting up infrastructure (the analysts will never set up a dockerized dagster ec2 instance to orchestrate pipelines, neither will the analytics engineers, at least no in our company). And everything downstream hinges on that technical ability. For example: I, as a data engineer, run around the dwh and pick up queries to optimise. I can often reduce runtime from something like 1 hour to 2 minutes by configuring materialisation and implementing proper requirements for partition pruning (snowflake). Analysts usually don't know how the systems work under the hood in order to effectively do this themselves.",

Like depending on your jurisdiction scraping may not be considered fair use.Even if you could win a legal battle you may not be able to afford the lawsuits that can start piling up if others feel like you are monetizing their user data via scraping.Additionally, you are building on a weak foundation. Every source can change their format, content, data structure etc. at their own pace. They don't care or want to support your scenario, so you have a dependency on something that can change at any time. This is really rough for a business.By far the best way to handle this is via data brokers or paying for access to the raw data with provided APIs etc.",

All that mattered was whether you were good. So I just worked hard to be good.It's a very different world now, though. I work in a niche industry so maybe this advice isn't as helpful for people looking for generic \"careers in tech\", but for me by far the biggest thing that enabled me to get ahead and move around the organization was domain knowledge.

I knew cloud services and python would be important in the future so I taught myself those skills over the next few years in my free time. Mostly online and creating my own projects. You always have to be learning because trends change every 2-3 years. But everything can be self taught in my opinion. I'd say about half or more of my colleagues are self taught and the rest are CS majors. DE isn't very appealing to most new CS majors though so it's a good path for smart folks who just didn't choose that degree.Edit: I should add that my title over the years has been ETL developer, BI/SQL developer, data analyst, Data engineer.

One thing that isn’t talked about enough here is that if you have on-prem it has its own costs that are slightly different from being cloud based, such as physical maintenance of the equipment as well as purchasing the equipment. I view it in the same way I do a legal capacity in a company, not every company needs to have a dedicated legal capacity available to them at all times, so they outsource that bit (in our case use a dedicated consultancy to run it all, likely cloud based for access). Over time they may bring in a singular lawyer to coordinate things and deal with the majority of the paperwork, but they’ll still need advice or capacity help (singular data person with consulting support probably still cloud based). Then you have a mix of stuff where the legal department expands all the way to a full blown department with dedicated head count and seat at the board (everything from a small data team who are cloud based to a dedicated data department who have at least one person for every role including maintenance because they’ve brought it on-prem) but even then that legal department won’t be able to cover every single base and will have to bring in external help on occasion, probably keeping someone on retainer (there’ll still be some workloads cloud based).We all look at this as a purely technical and budget problem whereas you need to take a far more holistic view of the requirements of the individual business.",

First, it has a couple of key differences:* Dataframely does not introduce a new runtime type: while `dy.DataFrame[Schema]` exists for the type checker, the runtime type remains `pl.DataFrame`. This makes it very easy to gradually adopt dataframely in a code base (and, similarly, to get rid of it again).* Dataframely natively implements the definition of schemas instead of \"dispatching\" to pydantic. This allows for much more flexibility in the schema definition.Second, dataframely provides a bunch of features that patito does not currently implement:* Support for composite primary keys* Validation across groups of rows (i.e. grouping by one or more columns, ensure that the _group_ satisfies a condition)* Validation of interdependent data frames with a common primary key (dataframely introduces the concept of a \"Collection\" here: invalid data in one data frame can then also remove rows from another data frame)* \"Soft-validation\" via `filter` which allows to partition data frames into rows that satisfy the schema and rows that don't* Structured info about failures that can be used e.g. for more debugging or advanced logging* Integration of the schema with external tools (e.g. export to SQL schemas)* Automatic data generation for unit testing, both for individual data frames and collections (in this case, dataframely takes care of generating rows with common primary keys to allow rows to be joined)",

It’s not that these “old” tools did somehow prevent you from these nice things to happen but instead the org applying and using them prevented it before you even started.I can easily build domain driven individual truths and have a flexible ops and governance model while using a traditional data warehouse approach on a single storage and compute layer (e,g. Bigquery).This whole end to end data delivery value chain mainly is blocked and attacked by organizational issue, issues of leadership ownerships beyond tech and a lack of authority of technical people over the big picture.So I am convinced that nothing about this lake house thing (1.0 or 2.0) is new or never tried before but just yet another path to fix people and organizations issues through tech",

It's built specifically for real-time data movement and supports Iceberg as a destination with minimal setup. It can run merge queries for you and soon do maintenance as well.Under the hood it handles schema evolution for you, deduplication, and exactly-once delivery.

Sure, spark sql can work as a general query engine, but it wasnt really designed for that.There’s some differences under the hood, particularly around how spark executes in stages, and uses more I/O steps than Trino.Essentially, for ad-hoc queries that change frequently, or you rerun things to change and shape results, Trino will nearly always be more performant. You can make some tweaks with a spark application (and then run it interactively to try and do the same), but tbh, Trino’s entire design, really, is for extremely fast reads on object storage datalakes.Spark is better places for wide ranging transformations, that are potentially more complex in nature. A good example here is the fault tolerance nature of spark, which matters way more in big batch pipelines, than analytical ad hoc queries. Sure, data loss and the task fails, just re fire the query. In a pipeline, you cant manually do that if its all running automated. Again, different horses for different courses in my opinion.I see it a bit like:Spark was a natural successor to Hive, for better big data transformation.Trino was a successor for something like Impala, as a faster query engine over datalakes",

        "body": "As others have explained in detail, Trino is optimized for responsiveness and thus excellent for interactive queries, whereas Spark is optimized for throughput and thus a good fit for batch workloads. In my opinion, the key differentiating feature between Trino and Spark is not the speed, but support for fault tolerance, which is required for batch workloads. As such, many organizations deploy two separate systems, despite the increase in complexity, added infrastructure costs, and the overhead.I think Starburst is well aware of this trend, and they are promoting Trino with fault tolerance suport. You can find some report that Trino with fault tolerance enabled works well in production and even saves the compute cost. From our own testing, however, Trino with fault tolerance does not work well for large queries (which it is designed for) because Trino coordinator crashes repeatedly. In any case, even Starburst recommends two separate deployments of Trino, one for interactive and another for batch. So, I think it is (and will remain) common to deploy separate systems for batch and interactive: Trino + Spark, Trino + Trino with fault tolerance, Trino + Hive-Tez, and so on.That said, we offer a solution that simplifies operations and reduces costs by eliminating the overhead of maintaining two separate systems, with a single unified system. It's based on, well, Apache Hive (with the MR3 execution engine). If you are interested, please visit our website: [www.datamonad.com](http://www.datamonad.com)",

Our primary offerings of Starburst Enterprise (you install wherever) and Starburst Galaxy (SaaS) do NOT have Apache Spark in the stack. And, of course, you can sure integrate with Spark (in its many forms) in your solution if desired.And if you want to see Apache Spark come to the full product line then ALL vendors listen to their customers.

To do this with good performance, the whole state of the database MUST be available locally on the server executing the query. NoSQL is less like a OLTP database and more like S3. You're inserting documents (usually a json object) at keys in what is basically a giant dictionary. And that dictionary must consume billions and billions of objects from all over the world. You want retrieval of a key to correspond to the data that was inserted at that key, very fast insert and read, to be able to distribute the workload over many servers (especially over large geography). You need to trade normalize data with fast updates and flexibility with regard to access patterns.If you post something on your friend's page while connected to a plane's wifi flying over Nebraska and your friend deletes their profile from a phone in Nepal at the same time, do you both need to wait for the entire state of the Facebook network to resolve to know if your transaction completed? Or could you both just have your request accepted, just resolve any inconsistencies when you request the data in the future?",

I thought I wanted to be a data scientist and a company hired me as a junior data scientist because of my clearance (not my experience haha). The data was terrible and I quickly became the lead data engineer with absolutely no experience simply because I could tell when things weren’t right and took time to research. Easy to find your real passion when a team structure allows for this type of flexibility.Edit: To more directly answer the question, ask about the role and team to see if you will be able to try new things and tools (specifically to learn/help the DEs).

You have experience, and you'll continue to build work experience,  so you have a leg up coming out 3. CS will complement your BI degree. You have experience working with data already,  but you probably have less experience writing good software. 4. DE and DS degrees are, IMO, garbage. They focus on tools, which change and are also easy to pick up. Learn the fundamentals. Even for DS, the best I've worked with have degrees in stats, physics,  OR, neuroscience,  etc.--never a degree in DS",

        "body": "If you can’t touch the source (no log access?), your best bet is the full extract + diff approach you mentioned.You can try primary key diffing: Compare today’s extract to yesterday’s and consider anything missing likely a delete. This works fine for daily batch and is reliable if PKs don’t change.To make it a bit more robust, consider soft-deletes downstream. In your warehouse, mark missing records as deleted rather than removing them. This way you keep history and avoid accidental data loss.To “optimize”a bit, you can do a hash-based comparison. If tables are huge, and full PK comparison is too slow, you can hash rows or chunks of data to detect changes and only diff those chunks.Also, some teams snapshot the full table daily and treat it like slowly changing dimensions (SCD Type 2). Storage-heavy, but you get full history without needing to touch the source.Re: tooling, Python with Pandas or even dbt (as an SQL option) can handle the diff logic but it will be kinda complex to maintain.Now, the issues with this are:1. Late-arriving data can look like a delete if yesterday’s extract was missing a row that shows up today.2. Extract gaps (like job failures) can cause false positives.3. High-churn tables can make diffing expensive or slow.So keep these in mind.That said, I definitely recommend pushing for log-based replication though. It will make your life 100x easier. If you want something more automated, [Estuary](https://estuary.dev) can do snapshot + CDC streaming with minimal setup. (Disclaimer I work at Estuary)",

In your DWH, update all the records with the deleted PKs to flag them with is_deleted or something like thatThis approach went quite well for me. Another tip, you can take a look at Fivetran's teleport sync and try it out. If your company has a budget to use it, good for you. If not, try to use the Fivetran teleport sync on a test DB where every query is shown in the log. You'll see each query that Fivetran uses to do their CDC. You can try to reverse engineer it. I tried to do that but I couldn't understand their approach. Maybe you can, or just go with the approach above. Good luck",

        "body": "They can be, but you need to use them appropriately. In data systems there's often a tradeoff between latency, throughput, and query volume. You can easily get a distributed k:v store to ingest millions of entries per second, and each write can be retrieved essentially immediately for low latency results, but it will generally struggle to handle large analytical queries.Your deltalake tables can ingest enormous volumes of data, and are great for huge analytical queries, but there are limitations on the types of write that you can do in the process. Most importantly here MERGE operations have *a lot* of overhead -- you'll be rewriting entire files for an update to a single row, and every write is going to leave behind another time travel copy of the data it just superseded.You can clean up these time travel copies. You run compaction periodically, then do a VACUUM with a custom short time with the necessary override to let it delete files less than a *week* old. You'll still have a lot of overhead processing the merges, however.What is often better with rapidly updating data when using something like deltalake is to move away from merging every single change, and instead just blind-inserting new values to an append-only log with a timestamp of when that row version becomes active. From there a window function looking for the latest timestamp for a given key lets you filter for the 'current data'.Over time the total amount of data will get pretty large, and that will get inefficient. So you can periodically create a proper merged 'current state' table that *doesn't* need the window-function-for-latest filter. Then when querying for the latest data you start with that fully merged table as your base, you anti-join the keys from the timestamp filtered append log, and union data with the window-function-for-latest filter only on the new append log data.That query will skip all the 'previously merged' data from the append log and keep the window processing to a minimum, but still lets you get the latest state from the append log where it applies.You'll want to do something like a bucketby on both tables on the key, so that they are properly organised to minimise shuffles to achieve the joins and window functions.You can tune the full merge period to whatever suits. It could be hourly, or daily, or any frequency you like. Each time you do a merge you can also compact and vacuum to clear out old data. If you partition your append-log by a time bin you can also drop old partitions to save storage space there too -- and it can help with skipping files that won't be relevant.---These sorts of 'streaming into big analysis' issues seem to come up from time to time. We had [another one last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jfwyyn/streaming_to_an_iceberg_scd2_table/) but that one went a step further to doing full SCD2 history, not just latest value.",

If you have a family, you’re definitely going to feel the pinch.Housing prices generally *suck* if you want to buy a home in one of the suburbs and don’t want to live in either a sketchy area (hi, Lewisville and Farmer’s Branch) or in a new build on the irritatingly distant periphery of the metroplex (hi there McKinney, Forney, and Midlothian), but if you can put up with either of those conditions then you can absolutely afford a home. Lewisville’s actually gentrifying swiftly, so housing there might be a good investment if you find the right area.If you want to live around more young people, your places to look at are Victory Park, Uptown/West Village, and Lower Greenville.What industry is the company in?

Append-only + latest view: Just write every change and use views or queries to pick the latest version (row_number() over pk, updated_at). It’s simple and scales ~okay.2. CoW vs. MoR: For update-heavy workloads, merge-on-read is usually more efficient with Iceberg. But frequent small writes still hurt performance (you’ll want to buffer and batch). [Here’s](https://estuary.dev/blog/apache-iceberg-cow-vs-mor/) a detailed article about the two.3. Event stream + materialized views: Send CDC to Kafka, then process and materialize into your lake in micro-batches. Works great if “near-real-time” is good enough and you have the resources to manage Kafka, Kafka Connect and Debezium yourself.If you want to stay open source, something like Debezium + Kafka + Iceberg + Flink/dbt can do the job. But it can be a LOT to manage.If you’re open to managed tools, [Estuary](https://estuary.dev) handles full load + real-time CDC into Iceberg out of the box (and runs merge queries for you!), and deals with all the tricky bits like ordering, deduping, and schema changes. Worth checking out if you want to simplify the stack. Disclaimer: I work at Estuary - happy to answer any questions!",

That's how I've learned most of my data engineering stuff after I started. However, databricks is probably overkill for most small companies. I assume other platforms offer similar training though. And of course make sure that you know SQL. Spark/pyspark is very helpful too.

I recommend sticking to the big 3 - AWS, Azure or GCP. Platform: You have Snowflake and Databricks as the major ones. Use Snowflake if you only care about data warehousing and BI. It's easy to learn and quick to get started on. Use Databricks if you also want machine learning and a few other neat features like advanced analytics and big data processing. The learning curve is a bit steeper in my opinion, but it's worth it because of better flexibility/control.Tools: look into are dbt, SQLMesh, airflow, kafka, fivetran, terraform, pyspark and the list goes on. I highly recommend dbt because it allows you to easily abstract data modelling and transformations while remaining (nearly) platform agnostic. SQLMesh is also proving itself to be quite good, outperforming dbt in certain things like write operation times and incremental models, but has a much smaller community than dbt. You can use fivetran for integrating a gazillion sources. I won't go through all of them, but I definitely recommend looking into pyspark if you're working with large data sets. It will significantly boost your pipeline performance! All in all, there are so many decisions to be made. My advice is to keep it stupid simple. Pick only what you need and nothing more. Data platforms have an uncanny way of ballooning in complexity as new teams, use cases, and business logic start piling on. Choose boring, proven tools. Build clean, modular pipelines. Scale complexity only when you absolutely need to.Good luck!",

Building these with low code tools would be a nightmare. Databricks provided us with a comparatively high code option. Databricks charges based on storage costs plus compute costs. So very low volume data isn't necessarily all that expensive. But there is a lot involved in setting it up, lots of required skills to maintain it, and plenty of other options.

For example, I’d like to get notified (e.g., via email) when a sensor value crosses a certain threshold, so I can keep an eye on whether the sensors are functioning properly.In that case, I might need to look into the data around that event, but most of the time I wouldn’t be constantly querying the live data. The system doesn’t need to be real-time either – near real-time is absolutely fine. On average, I might just visualize a handful of values per day unless there’s an issue.What is important, though, is that I’ll download each day’s data as a file for later analysis. I plan to convert the raw data into an MDF format with a daily job and then process it elsewhere. So everything I store, I will at least once download.That said, it’s really hard to estimate how often I’ll query or access the data, since that heavily depends on whether problems occur or not.",

Bigger companies will specialize you more, so expect to be working on something rather niche. Small companies let you engage in a variety of tasks. Personally I think that makes working more interesting. Big companies tend to do mass random layoffs. Small companies tend to get bought up or go out of business. Both are right in their own way. Meta should be paying considerably more considering cost of living. You'll likely take a pay cut to go to meta based on what you said here. As far as future career prospects go, Meta will send you more towards very technical DE positions. Smaller companies might allow more opportunities for management. Though this is highly variable. I'd personally stay where you're at. Maybe interview for the sake of it, but I would never move to the West coast for little to no extra money and more in office time.",

Tooling in this case is probably irrelevant - you just need careful engineering and separation of groups of tables that are being synced. Typically migrations are handled by modifying writers which temporarily write to both DBs. I'd probably stay away from Kafka/other queues because they will increase your synchronization lag. I can probably say more if you provide more details. What maximum latency are you looking for? I'm looking at a similar setup in production right now (MySQL -> PostgreSQL) and I see that under load P95 latency (time of write in destination minus time of creation of item in source) is about 850 ms.

You can read about the different types of joins spark does (shuffle, broadcast etc) and even use hints in your SQL or pyspark to force a certain one.SQL and pandas and spark have a lot of differences, but one thing that’s helped me is learning the fundamental data structures at play. SQL databases use a B-tree for its index, so if I 10x my data size, my reads are only 2x slower. Parquet uses a bloom filter so you can filter it with a WHERE clause extremely quickly. Chapter 3 of designing data intensive applications goes into this.Related to this, one neat optimizations databases do is use statistics for query optimization. For example, if you have [HyperLogLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog) statistics, the query optimizer can get more accurate cardinality estimates on your data. This can really help if you have many joins. There’s a good paper from Meta and others (including Pandas creator Wes McKinney) going into the differences between all of these systems, and it gives a good overview of what needs to happen between you submitting a query and getting data back: https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p2679-pedreira.pdf",

If I may make a suggestion, if you're not dead set on your current strategy; is record the sensor readings natively (which would usually be a KVP/time series data shape), then in a separate pipeline/application use pandas to aggregate it the way you want and store *that* data separately. (FYI this is what 'historian' applications historically do, pandas and the cheapening of digital storage just kind of made them dinosaurs).This would usually take the shape of defining integers as indices to correspond to each sensor reading, then storing the human-readable name of that sensor in a different table. Maria will have no trouble keeping up with that. I think my most taxed maria instance handles 8k inserts a second, and handles just fine performantly on query.All depends on how you want to look at it on the front end. Influx/Grafana is designed to look at time series data; PBI to look at relational (it can *technically* portray KVP data but it's distinctly terrible at it)",

What this mean is that you would have new “schemas” and “tables” in snowflake that are technically never loaded in Snowflake but only lives in S3.Reason for snowflake to do this is that they want you to use their query engine to load the data and do anything else with it. And since they will allow writes to iceberg table, someone could just use snowflake engine instead of spark for example if they don’t want to spawn a spark cluster themselves.They also all have their own catalog which will have “more” feature then the other which would lock you in a little because anytime you derive from the default opening table specification you list interoperability with other catalogs.",

The code is written and pushed into a dev branch on github from local machine of devs2. That triggers Github action workflow which creates a docker image for the code on that branch and publishes into our internal image repository. The image is tagged in a way that separates my teams images from others and also provides info about GitHub repo, branch, developer, team, etc3. Using airflow we trigger that docker image into a containers in our test environment. The image is triggered on Kubernetes using our internal api tools and airflow action.4. The code is now tested through the running container on the test environment. If there are issues, the code is fixed and the above process is triggered again5. The test environment is a mirror image of the prod environment so we monitor the behaviour of the pipeline, check logs, analyse observablity metrics on datadog to ensure that the pipeline works as per expectations6. To test the data, we have an testing module which acts as a defence layer named lighthouse. Lighthouse automates running test sql scripts on our spark dataframe. The queries are written in a way that negative issues can generate rows. If all tests pass, the dataframe is ready to be written in data lake.7. In the data lake, we do another round of adhoc testing to double check if everything works well8. Once done, a PR is raised and the code is merged into the main branch. This triggers another github action workflow that updates the production docker image of our data pipeline.9. The same image is triggered via our production airflow. Since we already have tested on test environment, it’s just the same code running on production so we are mostly sure that it would run.10. The final dataset on production as scheduled data check and alerts using collibra. This helps us getting issues beforehand and fixing it.11. For logging we use splunk and for incident management we do pagerduty. The github action also handles linting and formatting of our code. So, yeah, we do a few things for testing our pipeline.",

Developers should have a de environment in the cloud, with data striking a good balance between being:- representative (you'll develop faster if you catch problems earlier)- safe (masked/hashed, or something alike for sensitive fields, synthetic for company-sensitive data, etc)- small (for cost and performance, dev should not usually be as big as production)And it should be accessible. If that is local, partially or totally on cloud, it depends on the technologies and capacity of your machines.Then there should be a test environment - I usually refer to it as INTegration. It should have data enough to test volyme/stress, and it should cover all cases - both success and failure cases. Most companies that have this just make a snapshot of production (depending on technology, a virtual one), but that leaves security issues (may need some maskung/synthetic data as well), and really doesn't guarantee that all possible edge cases are covered, only the ones that happened in the past. This is the hardest dataset to curate and maintain.It's common for INT to not be directly accessible, just via CI/CD or by a few controlled accounts. That's mostly OK, the test results should give deva the info they need.And then there's pros.Some companies have more (an UAT Env, separated unit, integration, stress test envs, etc), but these 3 are the minimum to give devs productivity and peace of mind.",

However, the overarching point is that we can do these types of workflows because everything is designed to be composable. The composability is enabled by the expression system in Ibis and Arrow standard that we can build interfaces around. Our primary usecase is portable UDFs (backed by datafusion engine) and optimizing workloads based on the engine choice. The asof join usecase just happens to fit really nicely and has an added benefit of performance and guarantees provided by the semantics (not just functionality) that is common in ML. In ML, you may require asof joins to safeguard against data leakage, particularly useful if you deal with time series data at an organization level. Here is the duckdb blogpost on how they optimized it We currently support a handful of engines but Ibis (the expression system xorq is based on) support 20+ engines. It’s really easy for us to add support for another engine (SQL or Python) so let us know if something that may benefit your workflow is missing. We believe this work is necessary to build pipelines that can be easy to reason about and optimized without tying to a single engine/ecosystem. Also, composite workflows are super common so might as well do it right!",

        "body": "You know what advanced topics you should be studying for a career in data engineering? Everything about data. Python is just a tool. There is so much to learn and know that you don't get anywhere near enough of in school. Python programmers are a dime a dozen. (Sorry Python people.)Assuming you want to be more than a code cutter... First and foremost, study SQL. Eat it. Breath it. Drink it. Think in it. Sets and set theory are your best friends (remember 2nd grade?). After that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1iw9pe4/comment/mec9u94/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) is a previous post that covers a good start. A second, more focused on data warehousing is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1j9lyg8/comment/mheoy1h/?context=3).Understand the difference between operational data (where flows are important, the data sizes smaller and response time is critical) and analytic data (large to huge dataset sizes, storage costs become a factor). Most of the analytic data in the cloud is in 1NF(-ish) style and as such limits what can be done with it without starting over. Most cloud tools have a sweet spot that is in the operational spectrum.Sorry for all the links, but data is a huge subject. It is far bigger than the nuances of any programming language. It is very rare for screwing up in a program gets you fined or thrown in jail. Getting fired is the low end of the scale. Data screwups have the potential for all of them.",

It is definitely a skill that takes a significant amount of time to develop for most people. But, the process of learning how to write clean code helps you learn how to think about complex problems: how to break them up into self-contained modules, and make them flexible enough to accommodate the expected changes, but not so overly complex that you have a Factory to make Factories, when you're only going to end up using one instance of it anyway.Depending on what you're actually doing from day to day as a DE, you may not need to develop the ability to craft enterprise level OOP code, but being able to understand and read OOP code is a pretty important foundational skill. Maybe not the most important, but it can help you understand the data you are seeing better.",

That means that all your existing non Iceberg data, even if already parquet, has to be rewritten in Iceberg format. The data itself will end up as parquet files, but these parquet files will be located and structured according to the Iceberg spec. 2. If your new data arrives as parquet files on S3, you'll have to configure some kind of pipeline to detect new files and INSERT/MERGE them into existing Iceberg tables. I recommended to someone on here recently to use a cron or lambda in conjunction with Athena to accomplish this. There are many ways to approach this. 3. Yes! a lot of engines support reading Iceberg (and Delta Lake). Particularly if you are using AWS Glue as a catalog. You can leverage Iceberg tables in Redshift, Spark, Athena, Trino, Snowflake, Clickhouse, and a few others if you have Iceberg tables cataloged with AWS Glue. Only a subset can do write to tables.",

In order to do anything with it, you need a data engine that understands the protocol and can read/write from it. Historically, only Spark really understood this protocol (because all the logic for this protocol was written in a .jar). Nowadays, other engines are slowly catching on. 2. Yep — if a new parquet file drops somewhere, you’re going to need to run some kind of job with your data engine of choice to read that file and write the data into your iceberg table. No magic here unfortunately and different engines might do this differently :(3. Now here’s the real kicker… if you want the latest and greatest features in Iceberg I would argue (very sadly) that Spark is the only engine that can do the newest stuff. Iceberg itself is pretty much just developed against Spark, and there is even logic in Spark that doesn’t follow the Iceberg spec that other engines have had to follow because of how ubiquitous Spark-written iceberg tables are in the wild :(The problem is that the iceberg protocol itself is very complex, and all the logic for adhering to the spec was originally written for the JVM. So only JVM tools such as Spark can leverage the latest features. That being said though there is tremendous progress being made in other ecosystems such as the PyIceberg ecosystem and iceberg-rust that are promising. We leverage PyIceberg for reads/writes of metadata (but do our own data reads/writes) which so far seems to be a great compromise :)",

That way if you mess anything up in your pipeline, you don’t need to find the hard drive again. Use dd to create a disk image, and build a pipeline off of that. Parquet is a good general purpose way to store time series, and also works well for logs and images (hint: use zstd compression for large blobs, not snappy). Importantly it is fast and compact, and this data is optimal for your analytical/ML workflows. You can also set up batch reading/writing if your dataset gets bigger than available memory. Then records can be loaded from parquet to your OLTP database. Depending on how your data is stored on disk, duckdb could be a good tool here - especially if you have a larger than memory workload. It supports reading data in many formats, including raw blobs or text data (for images/logs). It can then store the data as parquet or in a .duckdb file - the export to parquet can even be batched, which is where it comes in very handy for larger than memory workloads. It supports connecting to/from some OLTP databases like Postgres, so you can insert data.",

Compression (this is especially useful for highly compressible data such as sparse sensor feeds)2. Very portable — Arrow is basically a first-class citizen from Parquet at this point, meaning that Parquet as an intermediate checkpoint maximizes portability of your data into any subsequent systems. 3. With proper partitioning, storing and accessing this data into the cloud is likely going to be extremely cheap. Any other always-on database solution is going to be really expensive :(4. For multimodal data, you can most likely get away with storing a URL pointer in Parquet, and the raw data as a file with an appropriate encoding (e.g. JPEG). These encodings work best because they’ve been honed over the years for compression ratio and compute required to decode the data. As for the engine, check out Daft (https://www.getdaft.io) which is built for multimodal data like images that you mentioned! It also handles all the bread-and-butter stuff like numerical data etc of course. Also with the added advantage of being able to go distributed if you need to (at the upper end of your data scales in the terabytes).",

If the hash key is different between the two tables, you now know which records have “updated”.Drop those customer IDs from the dataframe with current table data, then union in the “new” rows from your fresh data.Overwrite the whole table back to target.Not ideal if you have massive data, but should work.If you do have very big data, id suggest start looking into Delta etc. and go that way",

        "body": "You are working under a fallacy here. The idea that hosting sensitive workloads on-premises is more secure than in the cloud is not accurate. It's an emotional holdover. People like to think if they can touch their server or hug their storage, it is better than hosting it in the cloud. It just isn't true. There are more controls in the cloud for access control and security than I have seen in anyone's data center and I have seen many Fortune 100 companies data centers. Starting from physical security to data in flight & at rest to designs clouds are almost always able to be more secure. The issues come with knowledge and implementation. This is the same no matter the location.I have secured data in cloud providers where not even the CSP can get to them and they remain very performant. It just takes a bit of creativity on your part.From an architectural standpoint, splitting your analytic workload across a wide area network is a bad idea. The physics just work against you. The bandwidth between on-premises and cloud is never enough. Consider bouncing a 1TB table at one location against a 1TB table at a different location. Even with tricks like predicate pushdown and column reduction, you will still end up moving quite a bit of data to compare/join the tables. That has to happen over a WAN instead of an internal bus. It just doesn't fly. Like I said, the physics doesn't lie and can't be bargained with.The term \"Lakehouse\" is a Databricks marketing term and not a technical one. I try not to feed marketing monsters. The concepts behind their particular flavor of DW have been around for a long time. Don't get confused by a new coat of paint.",

Key technologies are Debezium for CDC, Kafka, Flink.The industry is moving aggressively in this direction. The operational and data worlds are getting closer and closer, and what I'm seeing happen rapidly is that a lot of data engineering work is increasingly being done by software engineers. What this means is that data engineers who are only skilled in ETL are going to be left behind rapidly. And it's not just because ETL is \"different\", it's also because traditional ETL workflows usually don't adhere to the same standards of CI/CD, testing, etc. as services written by software engineers.What I've witnessed was that a huge part of a financial platform that used to be owned by DEs, was completely replaced by services owned by SEs. The DE's had a bunch of messy scripts in all sorts of places, typically Spark jobs, that were orchestrated by airflow and run once a day. About half of all of that was replaced with near realtime Flink jobs, that were adhering to the highest CI/CD standards. The costs more than halved, and no-one was woken up in the middle of the night anymore.So this doesn't mean everything will (or can) be replaced. But it did mean that there was a hiring freeze for DEs, while more SE positions were made. The story I'm telling is from a company a friend works at. But the same is happening at mine, albeit a bit slower.Read about shift-left with an open mind.Apart from all that I'd look into Iceberg. It's gaining momentum at a rapid pace.",

If not, that is a key foundational tool any data practitioner should be familiar with as it’ll help as you are exploring data tools.Next, also, while not innovative, but also a key foundational topic is data modeling (whether you go with Kimball star schema/fact and dimension models which is more popular or Data Vault which is another valid data modeling approach). Having an understanding of data modeling can help shape how data professionals approach data applications and is what sets us apart from a Software Engineer “building a data pipeline”While those two may seem boring, gaining a mastery in each topic will be key to progressing as a Data Engineer.Lastly, just to throw out an actual newer technology is open table formats (such as Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Hudi). These frameworks allow for performing ACID transactions within an object store like AWS S3. This is big in the data world as it is a dramatic improvement over what you could do in the past with a data lake.",

Since it sounds like your data is small that could be a good option. Big query in GCP I believe is the equivalent with a similar cost structure.

        "body": "*This is long, feel free to TLDR and move on.*Here's the problem with interviewing programmers. Most of us work with a large codebase that can take quite sometime to learn and work with, partly due to its size, partly due to its organization, and partly due to knowing what the program does. Consider a tax program. How long would it take for you to learn the various tax codes used to determine how much taxes you owe? OK, maybe if the software was well-designed, that part would be isolated to areas where tax experts could work on that logic.But in many other situations, as part of building the software (or, more likely, maintaining it), the programmer becomes the de facto expert.If I'm interviewing you, I can't have you look at our production software. Let's skip past the fact that it might be proprietary. Simply put, in an hour interview, you can't learn enough to absorb even a fraction of the details (which is often why people feel completely insecure when they're hired and have to deal with software that they don't understand).In the past, sometimes the key was graduating from a top university. If you went to Stanford and could answer basic questions, then that degree could get you hired. The reputation of the university was enough. It was also common to ask people brainteasers (I'll give you one in a moment). It was thought if someone was intelligent enough to solve brainteasers, they would be good coders. Turns out, not so true. Some people love and are good at brainteasers (for example, I liked brainteasers) and this can make such people feel perfectly qualified. After a while, the so-called FAANG companies realized brainteasers didn't really help.The technical questions that were often asked in interviews were often confined to intro courses up to data structures and algorithms. That's because the typical CS major takes a bunch of optional electives in their 3rd and 4th years (in the US). You can't assume a person knows SQL or neural networks or undecidability or even NP completeness (at least, proofs of such problems).They'd ask basic coding questions, instead.But with leetcode, they can ask similar kinds of questions that rely on data structures and algorithms. These problems are self-contained, and more importantly, can be programmed without learning much and done in around 100 lines or less.This is clearly not the kind of programming most people do which is why you're not so good at it. This skill is kind of important, but it's like learning knife skills and being able to chop something quickly. Maybe a working chef needs this skill. Maybe it's nice if a home chef has this skill. But you can make a great dish without this skill. It's a nice to have that may come in useful in certain situations.You can do a simple search `how to solve leetcode problems`. There's even a leetcode subreddit /r/leetcode. There's a YouTube channel called neetcode where the guy tells you strategies to solve leetcode style questions. It's popular enough that there are lots of resources out there.These questions have become today's brainteasers. They share similar qualities, but they are also unrelated to most typical programming.Finally, I mentioned a brainteaser, so here is a common one.> You have eight seemingly identical balls. One ball out of the eight is heavier than the other seven identical balls. Your goal: find the heavier ball. Your tool: you have a scale that tells you three pieces of information: the left side is heavier than the right side; the right side is heavier than the left; the two sides have equal weight.> Next piece of information: If I put an uneven number of balls on either side, say, 2 balls on one scale and 1 ball on the other scale, then the side that has more balls is *always* heavier.> One restriction. Each time you use the scale, I will charge you money. You want to save as much money as possible. What's the fewest number of weighings you need to find the heavier ball? And, tell me how to find it?The other kind has to do with estimation or weird mental puzzles. * How many gas stations exist in the US?* If a commercial plane had its wheels on super treadmills that could go very fast, but the plane stood still (just as a runner on a treadmill doesn't go anywhere), does the plane lift off? Explain your answer.Sorry for the long reply. It was meant to show why leetcode questions are being asked and to explain that it has little to do with your ability to program, but has become this necessary evil (it's not evil, to be honest, as it's useful but not essential to know this) in programming interviews.",

Plus, there's pressure taking classes. You have to get assignments in or get penalized. You have to prepare for quizzes, exams, and finals. This means a typical CS major has to work at an accelerated level.I've always thought that you keep your plans much shorter, like a few months at most. It may feel daunting to learn as much as a CS major, but you don't have to. If you can't get past the first few months, then a 3 year plan won't matter.Some feel making the roadmap is the end of the story. You have to follow the roadmap, but it's like learning anything. It takes perseverance. For example, let's say you want to learn to skateboard. You're going to fall a lot. Some will decide that falling a lot is too painful, and if they don't see any signs of learning the trick, then they quit. The same could happen in programming.As long as a person realizes that, much like learning to skateboard, it may be painful (not in a physical way) or frustrating and that they need to be patient, then maybe they can achieve their desire to learn programming.

That said I've only \"been consistent\" since January, which is a relatively short period of time but still way longer than I've ever stayed focused on it.I had dabbled in Python in the past, played around with an Arduino, but never really went beyond following instructions, and I got bored. For me, this kind of approach meant I never really could work out what to do on my own when faced with a problem, nor could I creatively think of how to apply concepts.I know this isn't just \"programming\" but I went the other way and bought some electronic components, then worked backwards trying to understand how to get my devices to work together. That made me encounter issues with memory (as an example) and led me down the rabbit hole of all kinds of concepts - some of which would never have been a part of any of these tutorials. So now, I find myself more engaged, more ready to even experiment in my programming and with a list of things I want to try/make.I'd also note that I'm a hobbyist, so I'm not looking (at least for now) at learning programming as a way to carve out a career, which allows me to take it easy and not feel too down when things aren't working.

Rarely are there rigorous dives into the properties of the underlying enabling abstractions. If you are learning these at a university, the typical course names are calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, complex variables, nonlinear dynamics.Then there’s the math that's just about uncovering the deep underlying properties of abstractions. Everything is built from first principles, rigorously, no details overlooked. Definitions/theorems/proofs are the focus. Computation is an afterthought. Typical university course names are real analysis, abstract algebra, topology, formal logic.The former will improve your ability to program, but the latter will really improve your ability to program, come upwith algorithms, general mathematical reasoning and much more at the expense of increased difficulty.Personally, rudin’s intro to real analysis (principles of mathematical analysis, or colloquially, baby rudin) changed my life. In particular, theorem 2.40 changed how I thought about pretty much everything. Theorem 2.40 says every infinite set of circles that contains a rectangle has a finite subset that also contains the rectangle.

One day I was wondering whether there was a way in which I could predict the direction in which a stock could go and whether I could achieve this with a program. I found a tutorial online that did it with one stock, but I changed it slightly, so it worked with another stock I wanted to see.It didn’t really help at all because you can’t really predict anything in the stock market with absolute certainty, but it was still really cool to write a program that accomplished this.TLDR: Think about something you really care about/are interested in and try and find ways to write programs that help you understand more about that topic(s).",

Let me throw my opinion.You're asking yourself how a \"programmer\" thinks as in, what's the type of mentality you should be following to produce proper code.But the truth is the code and good coding practices is just one of the many tasks one actualy has to think of about because being a \"programmer\" almost never means _just coding_.The actual job involves a lot of aspects, to name a few potential examples: finding customers, understanding what they need and want, planing resources like time and money, concepting about data transfer, data quality, user experience, security aspects, documenting all of the above... and endless others.You can study all you want, do plenty of tutorials and watch a dozen YouTube videos but without a proper project this all means little, and this is the reason many people fail to find a job or gather experience to begin with.So here is what you should be doing: simulate projects. Find yourself either a friend or family member. Inform yourself about their daily tasks, their interests or hobbys and figure out where there could be need to have an application or automatization process to make their daily routine easier.Or, at last resource _pretend_ that you have a hypothetical customer, take up on different and role-play with yourself (for example, pretend that you're Person ABC, a developer, DEF, a customer, GHI, a project manager, etc, and even send emails to yourself).Now that you have a _reason_ / a project to code, research about all the steps that a project usualy requires from start to finish (GPT can help you if you don't undergo a specific training) and go through all of the steps.Yes, this will triple or quadruple the actual effort rather than just coding, but this is essential for your experience, professionalism, and ensuring you've concepted and properly planned the actual development phases and don't end up stuck in a loop of overcorrecting your implementations, because you also must set yourself time and hypothetical budget deadlines.There is only so much information I can provide here in a few sentences but I hope this helps you understand how a \"programmer\" works. Being \"just\" a programmer doesn't realy exist. You will in most cases be at least a team member, preferably also a Consultant, potentionaly even a project manager or even a freelancer. Grasping all the involved roles and being able to understand their minimum requirements will help you understand what's actualy important.Also, last tip, start very small, with little apps and \"customer expectations\". Stuff that seems easy done and implemented can add a lot of effort and grow the project exponentionaly because each part of the project needs some extra time for that specific aspect to consider. Keep it small, keep it simple. You can always add more to it when the basics are established",

All of these things you can also do from C. Many of these things you can also do from Rust and other languages that compile to native code, but not all of them.1. Call native operating system APIs directly. If you're on Windows, go to [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/) and explore the tens of thousands of APIs. The ONLY way to call these APIs directly is from a compiled language like C++. If you call them from any other language you're just calling some wrapper function that calls the function from C. That's even true for C#, even today there are some Windows APIs that you can't call from C#. Some specific examples below.2. Memory mapping. Let's say you have a 1 GB file. In C++ you can memory map that to an array of bytes with 1 billion elements. The memory map function returns almost instantly, it doesn't copy the file into RAM. When you access byte 777,000, it doesn't read the previous 700 thousand bytes, it just reads only one small chunk of the file from disk into memory at the moment you access it.3. Shared memory. You can have multiple processes on the same computer that \"share\" a chunk of memory directly. To communicate they don't need to copy huge data structures back and forth if they don't want to.4. Hardware drivers. Using C++ you can write directly to a memory address, or read directly from a memory address. Most hardware peripherals are entirely controlled this way, by communicating via nothing other than accessing special memory addresses plus hardware interrupts to let you know when something changed. On a modern operating system you can only do this if you write a kernel driver, but if you get an embedded development kit you can write bare-metal code that talks to keyboards, sound chips, push buttons, or whatever just using direct memory reads and writes.5. Hooking system functions / injecting code into other processes. For example on Windows, write a DLL that provides an alternate implementation of some common function like ShowWindow, then inject that DLL into some other process so every time they call ShowWindow, it actually calls your function instead.",

And if you look through it, you will very quickly find little \"baby projects\" that could be made that are very C++-specific. For example, let's look at the list for concurrency:> \\[2\\] Write a program with two threads: one that writes \"hello\" every second and one that writes \"world!\" every second.>\\[3\\] Time a loop. Write out the time in milliseconds. Do this for the default setting of your compiler and for a setting using an optimizer (e.g., −O2 or \"release\"). Be careful not to have the optimizer eliminate your whole loop as dead code because you did not use a result.>\\[4\\] Repeat the histogram drawing example from §5.6.3 for a normal\\_distribution and 30 rows.>\\[5\\] Use a regex to find all decimal numbers in a file. So, on that list, \\[2\\] and \\[3\\] \\*could\\* be done in Python, but they would not make sense. The issues that Mr Stroustrup is trying to teach here (e.g. how concurrency works on the OS or hardware level) is probably best observable in C++. Also for \\[3\\] this is purely a C/C++ thing. Python turns code into bytecode in a completely different way. I very doubt that Python does loop elimination or anything like that, for example. Also, to properly do all parts of \\[3\\], you will also need to look at the assembly language output of your code to see what optimizations your compiler is doing (and to really verify whether it is eliminating loops, and under what conditions it does that).Exercises \\[4\\] and \\[5\\] probably could be done in any language, of course Python would be an easy language to use for \\[5\\]. I'm not sure why Stroustrup placed these exercises in the concurrency section. Maybe he mentioned those topics in the same book chapter for some reason.",

The real time ray tracer example is a good example. Python can perform this algorithm, but does it really solve the problem if it takes so long that the screen refresh rate is unusable?

Can't run the python interpreter when you have 1MB of flash space to work with.Other option is mess around with an open source project that's already in C++ like some sort of real time DSP, emulator or create a project in Unreal Engine.",

Especially when deep learning hit and one piece after the after just became part of the neural network. And for those you at some point used tensorflow lite or later libtorch and so on to target different hardware and mobile GPUs etc.So it really became exporting python/torchscript and then a handful of lines of code to call it.Frankly meanwhile I haven't touched C++ for over 4 years anymore. It's just there just in case but that case isn't happening anymore ;)",

Having a cheat sheet is helpful.So, work with git is done locally in your local folder where you store your source code. When ready, you explicitly send your changes to the master copy on the remote git server. To open a code project (and any of its branches) locally, you need to copy it down to a folder on your local machine. That’s what git clone does. It makes a local copy of a remote repository that you will then work in. You generally use it once when you join a team working on a codebase or if you get a new laptop or something.Once you clone, you get to the second command: checkout. In every other source control system I’ve ever used, checkout means you want to edit something and want to prevent or inform other users of that. In git it means either you want to switch to a certain branch or you want to make a new branch from the current branch. Just remember that. Checkout is for local branch switching and changes nothing in the remote repository.Here are the basic commands for doing local work and explicitly communicating it to the remote master copy:Fetch - I want to update my local list of branches and their history so I can view what my coworkers did and maybe checkout someone else’s branch if needed.Pull - I want to update my current branch with the latest changes from the repo. This may prompt a merge if there are conflicts. You often do this to update your local copy of a main develop branch and rarely the one you’re actually working in.Push - I want to send my committed changes to the repo for other people to use. This may trigger build automation.Stash - I want to preserve select changes in a local side store while rolling back the files for tracking purposes. You do this to preserve a draft for future use.Merge - I want to move changes from my current branch into another (e.g. I’m done with my feature and want to merge it into the main dev branch). This is done locally. You pull dev first. Then commit and push the merge into it. That merge btw, is often done using a process called a pull request which puts a review request in front of the merge.",

It doesn't matter how simple, or whether it has been used before. The first games I wrote were: A top down racing game similar to Rally-X. A top down shooter similar to 1942. A pong game with powerups. A pong game played on an elliptical playing field where both players could move around the entire ellipse and the ball changed colour when you hit it (so you lost points if the ball went out of the ellipse when it was your colour).These were all simple games, and some of them never got finished, but it taught me a lot about how to build things, and projects like these helped me land my first job as a graphics dev.For school, make sure you pass. Go to office hours. Find other students you can study with. There were times during my university days when I locked myself in my room for 2-3 days. No computer. Just a textbook and some paper. I read the textbook and took notes by hand. Then I read the textbook again and took more notes. Then I copied my notes and cleaned them up. Then I copied them and cleaned them up again, until I was at the point where I could probably write them out again without looking at the textbook. I did whatever it took to learn the material.It will take time. Find time every day to put some effort into it, even if it is only ten minutes. After I had three kids, I wondered how I would ever be able to learn something new again. Then I realized that even ten minutes a day adds up to \\~60 hours per year. The first year I realized that, I taught myself how to play the guitar just by spending 10 minutes a day practicing. Then piano the next year, then flute the year after that.The point I'm trying to make is that it will take effort and time, but you can do it, and it will be worth it in the end. But it starts by choosing a project and building it from scratch. Then rinse and repeat as many times as it takes until things start to sink in.",

It's crazy.If youre having trouble understanding what you don't understand, to the point where asking questions at all is hard, I do have one trick to take with a massive grain of salt: explain what you can to AI and ask it to rephrase what you say or point out what areas you're leaving out the most. Honestly, the act of explaining things to someone often shows me what I'm missing, but it also helps me when my brain is mush and I can't even begin to explain my lack of understanding. I'll do my best to explain what I can, even if it's between curses and insults and self-admonishment, and it's usually able to parse through the mess and pull out a bit of self confidence. It reminds me I AM absorbing something, but it also forces me to look at what I'm missing. Don't rely on it to spoon feed you the information because it's been proven that this negatively effects your ability to find the information alone, but having it rephrase your knowledge can help with your thinking of it, and, importantly, give you keywords to help your real searching, which you should always be doing outside of AI.",

If the notes are too long, I'm not gonna end up returning to each of them 20+ times.Notes work so much better for something like language learning or philosophy. For language learning you can write word lists where you feasibly will return to every word 20+ times and reach that long term memory. And for philosophy you can do the same with 1-2 sentence long quotes.Also, (for most of us) coding is our profession and not our hobby, so in a good way we are kind of forced to get that long term exposure to CS concepts anyways through our work that will lead up to the concepts sticking in our long term memory.",

Identify something you want to create or solve using programming languages as a tool and then plan it out and develop it. You said you want to build everything you want - what’s one simple thing you can start with? Some of my earliest projects were simple things like a Spotify playlist generator, a text based RPG, a very simple image based RNG anime battling game, and this was in addition to projects I did in school for my degree.

There are two types of programmers: those who like the lower stuff (ex: people who mess with algorithms, kernels, optimizing aggressively to get even 1ms less runtime) and those who like the higher stuff (building unicorn and changing the world). You just might be the latter, since you put an emphasis on wanting to build something. Leetcode is most definitely for the former. Use AI. To learn (not to vibe code). Ask it what it needs to know, and learn what you don't know from there. Then ask it how to build what you want. But don't just copy and paste everything—read the code, understand it, and then type it out yourself. Repetition makes perfect. Also, everybody learns and understands the world differently. Find your own life. The only justice in the world is that it is unjust to all: if you really have passion, then fight for it.",

The specific choice here doesn't matter. Just pick something. You'll learn.Step 3: Start from the beginning and Google where you get stuck. First, you might need a window. Do you know how to do that? Google if not. Okay, now you need to draw something. Do you know how to do that? Google if not. Rinse and repeat. You will be doing a lot of googling. This is normal and expected. Be patient.

You usually don't use classes in Python, but you will need to structure the classes. Think of the Service Class as the class that defines the functions you use in the Application Class. The Application Class is supposed to be the one that is run and will provide the UI and functions that are built on the Service Class. 2. Learn How to Use UML Diagrams. UML Diagrams will be very useful in the long run as they tell you all the functions you need to program with. Here's an example structure: \\------------------------------------------------ | Class Name | \\------------------------------------------------ | Variables in the Constructor | \\------------------------------------------------ | Functions in the Class | \\------------------------------------------------3. Think of the Language as Python, but instead of tabs, you use curly braces {}. You also must not forget to add the include for the scanner. The scanner is like the iostream C++ library. It provides functions used to take in input. Make sure to reference the scanner by using Scanner scannerName = new Scanner(System.in); So those are my tips. If you have any questions, please reply to this message or ask ChatGPT.",

        "body": "Hello, I am a little late to the party but will chime in here... From a hiring perspective, especially for junior / entry level, \\*what\\* your project does is almost irrelevant. I do quite enjoy asking candidates \\*why\\* they worked on this particular problem because hearing about how people have scratched and itch that they have found is usually quite interesting and clue to how they think about the world. However... it's 98% about how they have structured a project and how their code looks. I'm afraid, as an apparently satanic friendly Russian has already pointed out, there is quite a lot of issue with the code itself and this, I feel, probably would work against you. When I am reviewing code I am expecting to see some consideration of 4 groups of people... 1) Your usersI don't mind that there is not a UI, there are plenty of technical, command line utility projects out there, but why are you telling me what I need to call my files? You have a CLI tool, where are my flags and options? Why do I have to accept all your hard coded values like 'chat.txt' and all the thresholds and things? Why can't I configure these on the CLI and experiment with the results? This is a CLI tool for technical users right? Who are they? What are their skills and what might they need? 2) Future developers looking to understand your codeThere are plenty of improvements to be found here. Separating the files, and not doing things like calling regular expression variables 'pattern', which can be clearly seen by the fact that you assign it a.. well... pattern. What pattern? What is it for? You had an opportunity to provide a descriptive name here, and you went for the most 'technically correct, but useless' option. This is a microcosm and applies all over your code. Go through it, and refactor giving consideration to other people who will want to understand what you are doing. 3) Future developers looking to \\*extend\\* your codeWhere are your hooks? You don't have to have a network accessible API but where are the places in your code that future developers might hook into to provide additional or improved functionality? I'd like to see that you have thought about where things might go next and left the code in such a way that somebody other than you might pick that up and run with it. 4) The reviewer This, in some sense is an extension of number 2, but if you are submitting your code for review for job applications you want to be applying number 2 here to a more elevated degree than you even might in other projects. I don't see a single comment in your codebase. Comments are a bit out of a fashion on some professional codebases right now because people have the (correct and noble) goal of writing 'self-documenting code'. Few who attempt this can do it effectively honestly and you definitely can't right now (not a dig, this might be the hardest coding skill to actually learn and takes many years). Without self-documenting code, you need to be documenting with comments. As a reviewer I don't have a huge amount of time to spend on each application (especially at junior where there are, these days, potentially hundreds), so if I don't 'get' your code within a few minutes, I will probably put your application into the 'maybe' pile to come back to if other applications are not better. I need to return to the 'maybe' pile for an applicant perhaps 5% of the time... because there is usually something better. Your energy and drive is great, and you have picked a problem and solved it. Really good for you and don't be disheartened. Many, most, juniors have \\*nothing\\* to submit, you just now need to take what you have done and think about the 4 groups I mention and consider their needs and interests and you will have something very valuable to put on your resume. Good luck.",

The larger companies will not analyze this, but instead put you through competence tests that they themselves devise, so I disagree with the reasoning behind some of the other comments here. The projects on your CV at your level are to demonstrate domain interest and active learning.For higher level roles, your current project would not count as a large project that holds the same weight as an employment entry on your CV. The closer your project is to a product then the more likely you would be to gain/pass a product-centred interview stage(s). It's perfectly fine to gain product development experience primarily through employment though. So you should really be focusing on being valuable over pretending you are a highly experienced product developer.From here, in my opinion, you've got two options to continue your active learning - develop this project into something closer to a product, or begin a new project that fits a target domain. The point being, don't spend time upgrading this project at the expense of genuine interest, by for example; appending unit tests onto it. If you want to genuinely learn about test-driven development then begin a new project. Adding unit tests onto a project after the development stage would skip some of the development process insights you could gain from doing it properly.",

Unless there's a \"library\" (someone else's code they've put in a package for you to use) that's only available in Ruby, I would stay away from it.Also, it may be worth looking into Anaconda and seeing if that doesn't do what you want to do. It may be a great place to start coding, and it also may be everything you need. Also I could be wrong about what you're working on, but you may end up finding R to be helpful at some point (it's pretty easy to pick up though, especially after learning something like Python).",

I can tell you what I'd recommend for my past self, but programming will probably never be the same.* Actually read textbooks. Nothing short of a private tutor can teach you faster (although LLMs are coming close). * You don't have to understand 100% before moving on, but try for at least 80%. * Actually try the exercises. * Read *Code* by Petzold first. Not really a textbook, but a good intro to computer architecture. * Read SICP. * Consider reading CTM. * Get a book on Algorithms and Data Structures. Read about any data structures you're actually using. You don't have to memorize all the algorithms, just skim to know what's there and use as a reference. * Ask for textbook recommendations.* Learn to use a debugger early. * Model what the computer is doing in your head. * Guess what should happen each step. When you're surprised, fix your mental model.* Make your feedback loops as tight as possible. * Do tiny experiments to fix your mental model when you're surprised. * Iteratively make incremental changes and test them as quickly as possible. (If it takes a lot of time and work to get your program into the right state to test something, you're doing it wrong. Make it more interactive or add shortcuts to get there faster.)* Try writing the tests first. * Then try mutation testing. It will teach you to write more testable code.* Learn Git. * Learn how to interactively rebase * Make small incremental commits when your tests pass. * Tests need to pass at every commit. (You can do a WIP commit to save your work and amend it later, but only one at a time per branch.) * Learn to use bisect when you forgot to test something. * Write a paragraph explaining the rationale in your commit message. * Learn how to search commit messages, blame, log, and reflog.* Learn what others consider \"code smells\" and how refactoring can fix them.* Learn to use a linter. * Try turning on one rule at a time, and drop the useless ones.* Read a style guide for your language. Stick to one style, or write your own. Automatic formatters and linters can help.* Learn to find free libraries for your language (mostly on GitHub) to help with what you're trying to do. * Try actually reading their docs. * Read the changelogs when there's a new version.",

It is way different a question with CS concepts, vocabulary and whatnot than a random question with whatever you think you are dealing with. During your junior years is ok too, to ask like that but not after 3-5 years.Start coding, face adversity and challenges, then read the manuals, then code again, look for examples in internet and then code again.I write it again **read the fucking manuals(RTFM)**, it would save you a lot of pain. You can use perplexity or this kind of forums.You really do not want to be like the senior guy who doesn’t understand the difference between standards, linking, compiling, embedded domain, application domain, OOP and many more.

While they get recommended to beginners, most experienced programmers use them as it allows you to do many complex things in a few lines of code at the cost of reduced performance and greater overhead. Python has more complex syntax as it allows you to do more complex things, which is why it’s used in machine learning.Lua has a simpler syntax as it’s expected for the developers to create a well defined API for it, which is why it’s mainly used as an interface for programs such as neovim and Roblox. This makes sense in the context of its history as it was mainly developed for clients who were engineers, not programmers, to interact with provided software.That’s why trying to rank them by how “easy” they are is a bit superficial, as the point is that they try to accomplish different things.",

Python has built in docstrings, `help()`, `dir()`, `breakpoint()`, an `inspect` module, and fairly standardized reprs so you can tell what you're working with in the REPL, and standard ways of doing that for your own code. Lua doesn't even have a built-in way to print a table out; you have to loop over it yourself. That makes Python much easier to work with than Lua.Python is mostly made of objects backed by dicts, with some primitives, so it's pretty similar to Lua that way, once you wrap your head around classes, which are not *that* much more complicated than metatables.",

This includes goddamn function arguments- despite arrays not really existing, there is still a length operator- indices starting at 1 ... but ofc. since arrays and maps, sorry *\"tables\"* are the same thing you can still *assign* to `tablename[0]`- another consequence of this absurdness is this completely valid assignment: ´arr[-42] = \"oh uh\"`- tables are also conflated with objects: `t[\"name\"]` and `t.name` both work the same. Not even Python is that stupid.- without `local`, assignments default to the nearest var of the same name. If there isn't one, they default to global. Meaning, accidentially generating or overwriting global state is really easy. Combine that with the silent nil-derefing, and you see why debugging Lua feels about as good as a papercut.- only the last arg to functions works as a vararg, but you can still put a vararg before the last...and silently get everything but the first argument dropped- general syntactic idiocy: the `:` pseudo-accessor, the `..` operator, the `#` operator. The lang has `not` as a boolean operator, but somehow `~=` (not-equal) is a thing. The `end` keyword to end blocks with. We an exponential operator `^` but no increment/decrement operators- metatables, aka. what happens when someone thinks: *\"Hey, how about we take the worst ideas from prototyping and class based OOP, and mush them together by shoehorning them into the only data structure we cared to build into our pseudo language!\"*- Since there aren't really objects (everything is a table), you can actually call an \"object\" method passing a different object as `self`- `break` exists, but `continue` does not- strings assume the unicode table ends at 255, therefore, strings are really byte arrays. meaning, handling unicode requires libs- despite tables being the only datastructure, there is no built-in way to copy a table- despite having pseudo-exceptions (`error()` and `pcall`), tons of built ins refuse to use them, returning `nil` instead",

Assume they all have a deviceA, deviceB, deviceC etc.Then you learn that the pairings are wrong. So personA should have some other device like deviceB, B==>C etc.- No person can at any point be without a device.- You can immediately swap a device for another device from warehouse (so you can not swap from person to person).- you have 1 temp device0 to work around the first rule.Your goal is to minimize the amount of swaps to as low as you can, and handle all pairing orders.Maybe a list of 350 people only needs 10 swaps. Or maybe it needs 200 swaps. Figuring out that was fun.",

The free code camp video was from 2021 and used an older version of C++ which Vs code was not liking for some reason. I'll find out why when I know C++ Please let me know if you come across any other good resources Alternatively pivot to the CS50 to learn the basics of coding.

The good news is, once you realize how one language runs with editor and the relationships of editor,IDE, library and framework. U know everything. I spent on c# for two years. The rest languages I only spent 4 months. Of course you should know how to interact with AI and recognize the error of its answer. You should know read the doc by yourself and find what's going wrong with your code. It's a long road but I hope you can insist. Day by days training is very importantFirst, insist 1 hour per day.

If it's wrong no one will tell you that it's wrong. Especially bad code which compiles/doesn't cause errors can be troublesome.Stackoverflow has humans as an error correction layer.Another factor, which has more to do with the architecture, is that a network of humans understands that this is code and what it does, while a transformer only generates one of the tokens/wordpieces which is most likely to follow.There's no understanding of the concepts, writing code works in the same way as writing a recipe, translating something or answering any other question.But at the end of the day both is bad practice and unless you're sticking to personal scripts and don't care wether you're learning how to do it you should understand what you're doing.",

That’s what makes humans so adaptable. We can kind of change our brains instantaneously to solve a problem. We can come up with solutions on the fly while LLMs are essentially just looking up the answers to things stored in a database quickly and telling you what it thinks you want to hear. Human best guesses with little information even when we’re off the mark often put us closer to the answers we’re looking for. We humans can teach ourselves by copying others 1:1 and then reproducing the steps to solve similar problems.",

I would (based on what I know) not consider it the equivalent of CS50x which is based on a Harvard course. That is, it's not aimed at a Stanford CS major (with Stanford being one of the highest regarded CS programs in the US), and therefore might be too challenging for a typical beginner. It feels like it's more beginner friendly and slower-paced.In that case, I'd probably do CS50x. CS50p you could even do along with CS50x but they have different emphasis. CS50p is more like a series of Python exercises and is not CS50x in Python. CS50x is trying to introduce computer science concepts including programming, but covers other topics (later on) beyond just programming.I would recommend CS50x. Search for `cs50x edX 2025` and you can sign up for free at any time, and go at your own pace.Because you've already had a year of programming, you should find the programming assignments (called problem sets) easier than most, but they are still fairly challenging. Most of the core material is in C though the first \"week\" is in Scratch which is a visual language aimed at beginners. Although the course is broken down in weeks, you can go at your own pace, either as fast as the course goes or much slower, depending on how much time you have available.That's my two cents.Otherwise, you can look for courses in data structures and algorithms.Many of the courses you've mentioned are aimed at beginning programmers with no experience. CS50x, admittedly, is fast-paced. The nice part is you'd learn some C on top of Python you already know, which could be useful.",

The reality is you earn college credit by paying for it, but as an admitted college student at Harvard (the yearly tuition is about 60,000 US dollars which is around 52,000 Euros). In any case, it's an introductory course at Harvard, so it's not worth a whole lot. But, as mentioned before, there are ways to get it for free once you've completed the course.There's a bunch of follow-up courses. You could even start CS50w which is by the same folks that made CS50x which is \"web programming\" in Python.

If you understand that concept, you pretty much know all that you need to to make an Application Programmer's Interface. You could take a read into Interfaces in Java, for example, to get a better sense. (Not all languages have explicit Interface constructs, but the concept still exists: a set of abstract calls that do something specific that can be used without any specification on how they are implemented (a black box)).",

        "body": "POV: I've taught CS for many years, including general programming and APIs.APIs are a specific style of data transfer, which is a variation of input and output. So what you're wanting to learn is a particular style of programming. That's a good goal, but you need to learn general programming concepts before you can comprehend a specific subset of coding. There are two distinct ways of thinking about APIs, and both depend on some knowledge of core programming ideas. First, you can write a program in any language that *consumes* an API. That is, you can write a program that uses an API to find the current weather in Barbados. This is a relatively straightforward process in most languages, but typically you learn this after you've learned more fundamental things, like how to get information from the user or from local files, how to handle looping and branching, and how to write functions.The other way to think about APIs is to *produce* an API. In that sense, you are writing a program that lives on some type of server that produces data in some kind of machine-readable format (usually JSON, but other formats are certainly viable). This is also not a difficult process, but it requires knowledge of essential programming concepts, and typically you'll also want to write a front-end package to test your API. I would say start with any good programming course. There's a good reason Python is taught as a first language in most CS courses. It's reasonably straightforward, and is excellent for a number of use cases, including working with APIs. You can read and create APIs with Python out of the box, but for creating an API, you'd probably be better off using a library like flask, bottle, or rapidAPI. I would definitely learn standard programming ideas first before digging into libraries. Express.js is fine, but it's a specialized form of JavaScript that doesn't make any sense if you don't already know how to program in vanilla JS. It seems to me that CodeAcademy has a more organized curriculum. It doesn't go straight into using APIs, but that is fine. If you can't drive yet, race cars don't matter. Learn to program in a language, then we can focus on the particular skills you want. FreeCodeCamp is great for looking up a specific skill, but it often makes a lot of assumptions about what you already know. I have some videos of my own I can send you, so DM me if you want that.",

Learn as you're doing.If you know how HTTP works, you already know how REST works. Using someone else's REST API is basically just making HTTP calls to that server, to request certain information or perform certain actions.

Where do we start and where do we end.Let's start near the top, and cover the upper level bit.When you fire up your web browser, you basically get a blank canvas.You type in the Domain Name of the website and hit go/enter.That domain name is then looked up using a name resolution system called DNS (rabbit hole one) to get it to resolve to an address. This is very similar to you looking up your friend Bob in the contacts list on your phone, since names are easier than numbers.The browser then sends a request to the server(s) residing at the address it got to download your web page. (Another rabbit hole here). This is done using the HTTP protocol (more rabbit hole), the web page is then likely to be created using HTML as the markup language (more rabbit holes). The HTML might inform the browser it needs additional bits which require additional requests to the server or even other servers. These include things like stylesheets (CSS) to make things look pretty, code (JavaScript), pictures (PNG, GIF, JPEG, etc), videos (MPEG4, etc), sound/music (MP3, WAV, etc), and others.After the first HTML page is downloaded the browser will start to render the page and all the content and the code may start to be executed. The code might do nothing until you interact with the page, or it might send a request to a server for some dynamic data, which would be another HTTP request to some server somewhere.Each HTTP request might involve a different server which we don't have the address for yet, so that would be another set of DNS requests to look up those addresses.That's the near top level of how a website works with your web browser. Your next question might be how all these abbreviations, protocols, and the like work and how they all work together and for that we have a variety of central standards that specify how these work so everyone that needs to can implement their own. The majority of these are what are called RFCs (requests for comment) managed by the IETF (internet engineering task force) and we also have the w3c (world wide web consortium) and a few other organizations/groups made up of industry specialists like IANA (they're more involved in the DNS side).We have a generic model for a lot of this called the OSI model, and that allows us to navigate the rabbit holes and find the occasional breathable pocket.Hope that helps, Wikipedia has a lot of the extra information you might want to learn about, but beware of the rabbit holes (they're everywhere).",

        "body": "You might be jumping a bit ahead of yourself here... Here's a brief rundown of how this all works:Your PC has a network card. That NIC uses some black magic to establish itself as a given IP on your local network, let's assign it as 192.168.1.20.Any traffic on your network will be able to talk to your network card using that address, and if your computer talks to anything else on your network then the recipient will see it got a package from that address.One such device on your network is a router, which is also connected to your ISP's network.When your computer tries to make a request to something not on your local network, say.... 8.8.8.8, then it asks the router if it knows how to get to 8.8.8.8. The router then asks the ISP, the ISP knows and then tells the router which tells the computer, the computer then sends the packet to the router to give to the ISP to give to 8.8.8.8.A similar process works for resolving domain names to server IPs.So when you go to google.com, your browser asks your network card to ask your router to ask your ISP if that's possible. It is, and a request is sent to whatever address that google.com resolves to, \"Give me your home page.\"Google's server receives that request and after some processing sends back an HTML file, and probably a css and a JavaScript file. So an HTML file comes from Google to your ISP to your router to your network card to your browser, and a web page renders. Then your browser also executed the JavaScript that got sent and applies the css, not necessarily in that order. The JavaScript can then phone home by asking the browser to ask the card to ask the router to ask the ISP to give a message to Google, and so the cycle continues.TL;DR: By the time you get a webpage, a connection to the server has already been made at least once. The browser handles most of the details of connecting. The JS can make subsequent requests if the programmer deems it necessary",

Setting up automatic payment and record system, setting up servers (usually a raspberry pi one is fine) for microservjces like email or use Google app script (it's basically JS), or help them find possibilities to beautify their cms website or ... whatever your heart desires :)Before you think about all the cool stuff like ML, CSec, highly optimized algorithms and so on, stuff like unit testing and automation for daily tasks is soooooo much more valuable for 95% of businesses.I would highly recommend it.",

It doesn't help for add or subtract operations. And constraining its errors is hard for multiply and divide operations.It's mostly the kinds of functions based on mathematical series (square root, cosine, that stuff) that might have a significant power or time savings from allowing reduced precision. But the processors have gotten so good at this stuff that almost nobody needs that. And memory has gotten so cheap that lookup tables are often a decent way to speed up those functions, once your code gets to the point where you're ready to use some kind of reduced-precision function evaluation.tl;dr no.",

        "body": "This is an interesting topic. But usually no they don't, because they're implemented in hardware which only supports a few precisions.Traditionally, those have been 32 bit and 64 bit. With machine learning, we're seeing a lot more interest in really, really low precision because it still works \"pretty dern good\" for big fuzzy matrix multiplies. So you'll see FP16, FP8, BFLOAT16, and other variants. But those are mostly confined to GPU tensor computing, not general purpose processing. For 99.X% of general purpose applications, the hardware is super super fast and you don't care that much about precision. If you do care, you should probably be using fixed point.A good way to think of floating point is as a fraction between powers of 2. So for numbers between 32 and 64, you get 32 \\* 1.XXXX. That [1.XXX](http://1.XXX) fraction is the \"mantissa\" and the power of two is the \"exponent\". The number of bits in the mantissa gives you your precision. It's very precise near zero, and it gets a lot less precise for really big numbers. You can simulate any arbitrary precision you want in software though by just storing all the mantissa bits and simulating the floating point operations with fixed point.Another interesting bit is that for machine learning, they do care a lot about the buildup of errors from layers and layers of floating point. They normally fix that by normalizing the output to be between 0 and 1 at each layer rather than messing with the precision of the multiplications.",

The pure side might be more concerned with the abstract side and the implications and relations between various statements, but it boils down to the same thing.For pure math encounter a definition you come up with concrete examples to get some intuition. Same for the applied mathematician, or the physicists the programmer. As a programmer you can enrich your learning by trying to implement or use some of these examples to do things you can see or touch.To that end linear algebra + calculus is great. A lot of computer graphics is based on linear algebra. If you’re interested in cryptography then some discrete maths and number theory are your friends.At the very least a good grounding in discrete maths. Focus on understanding the concepts and as much of the proofs as possible. Don’t be bummed out to not understand certain proofs. A high level idea is good enough you’re not trying to be a mathematician.Good luck my friend",

        "body": "Python is a good start and is enough to understand programming concepts.To be completely fair, the most important concepts you need to learn have nothing to do with actual programming or languages. Those are your foundations - Data Structures, Algorithms, Networking, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Databases. There’s a very good reason most universities focus on theory for the first two years of a CS degree, and not so much on coding. Learning these will make you understand programming as a whole. After that, any language will be equally valuable to you.To answer the question. I’d say, after learning Python well, you can either go useful, frontend or lower level (well every other language is lower level but that’s not the point).If you want to find a job as quickly as possible, learn Java or C#. Those languages are by far the most used in the industry and there’s never lack in demand (keep in mind that there is also a lot of supply). If you choose this option, you have to know that you’ll also most definitely need to learn their respective web frameworks - Spring and .NET, as they are pretty much required by the job market. This is a very good path to take and I can highly recommend it. Also, keep in mind that there’s a very good chance you circle around to Java/C#, even if you choose a different path now, since these are one of the most essential languages and are taught and used everywhere.Another popular route is to master JavaScript and become a capable full-stack developer. That’s also where React comes in. React is a JavaScript framework used for simplifying the way to build responsive web interfaces. I think there will be time in the future to worry about frontend, so I wouldn’t choose learning JavaScript at your current stage.Finally, the lower level route. I personally encourage any beginner to go deep into the land of pointers because you gain soo much more understanding of the way a computer works, than you do by using Python or JavaScript. For this I recommend you go with either C or C++ (personally, I’d go with C). These languages are what we call “lower level” because they don’t have fancy built in features to simplify the hard stuff and you have to think a lot more about everything. Those languages have no “garbage collection” meaning you need to allocate your own memory, and you need to free it when you don’t use it anymore. They use pointers to reference the data you use. C has no Object Oriented Programming, meaning you can only encapsulated data using a “struct”, and you can’t have methods tied to that data (procedural programming).",

It’s still requests and responses. Also make sure you understand the Ruby syntax trend of leaving off method argument brackets as well as omitting the hash brackets if the last argument is a hash. As far as networking, you can network with any developers, go to other language meets and just say you’re curious, there shouldn’t be any gate keeping.

This function is called a* ***destructor***\\*. Destructors are designed to allow a class to do any necessary clean up before an object of the class is destroyed.\\***ok, so what is a non-aggregate class?!**The web tries to help: *A class is considered an aggregate if it meets all of the following conditions:* * *It has no user-declared or inherited constructors (including defaulted or deleted constructors).** *It has no private or protected non-static data members.** *It has no virtual functions.** *It has no virtual, private, or protected base classes.**If a class does not meet all these criteria, it is considered a non-aggregate.*That is a lot to chew on as a beginner, and some of the topics are yet to come in the learncpp ordering. Their desire to be very precise makes it a little difficult to follow because a need to talk about b, and b needs to talk about a, and one of them has to come first in a study program.You can work with this version for now: *classes have another type of special member function that is called automatically when an object is destroyed. This function is called a* ***destructor***\\*. Destructors are designed to allow a class to do any necessary clean up before an object of the class is destroyed.\\*I recommend that going forward you just ask, here or elsewhere, if you run into something garbled like this. Its giving you TMI for your level, but again, the site strives to be accurate and precise so it needs the extra info for advanced readers using the site as a reference yet that precision fails the beginner in places.Destructors do tie to memory, loosely. If for some unholy reason you are allocating your own memory and releasing it, the destructor can do that for you, ensuring no memory leak. It can do the same for any allocated resource like an opened file, network port, etc. Destructors have other uses too, as you will see in their examples.",

This massively increases adoption and helps you get grants and sponsorships \\- Build it for you first; everyone else comes second otherwise you lose grasp of the visionBasically:\\- No one will use it if the documentation sucks or if the github looks dead \\- Integrating with other tools is the fastest way to grow since you are tapping into existing userbases \\- During downtime or if you get writers block, use your framework as a content creation engine...this gets you views and also helps you apply for grants etcAs for resources:\\- Look up \"Commercial Open Source Software\", even if the point isn't to make money it helps you understand how big frameworks gain momentum \\- Keep an eye out for fellowships and foundations, eg I received over $15k in grants from Processing Fellowship alone by integrating with p5.js and three.js",

For us, UML is like a schematic for an electrical engineer or a blueprint for an architect. It helps us think clearly and communicate precisely.Our motto? “If you can’t draw a simple model to show what you mean, you don’t know what you’re doing.” Had an intern once say he couldn’t show his idea in UML—meeting got pushed to the next day, and he was told to come back with diagrams.

If you come from something like react and spring it'll feel really familiar. Except every single thing you do has a Salesforce spin to it. They use lightning web components instead of just web components. They use apex classes instead of Java (they look and behave very similarly but it's not nearly as fleshed out). They use SOQL (Salesforce object query language) which is a lot like SQL but not as fleshed out. I ended up getting really frustrated by these limitations and changed roles in like 7 months. Then it may have just been my org but we used provar for testing which is cancer.

However, it is generally a slow process, maybe much slower than you think. For example, if you were a computer science major, you might not be able to take a game programming course (if it even exists) until your 3rd or 4th year (in the US).That's after you've had two years to learn a language and other topics that CS majors learn.You're probably hoping to get there much sooner, like a few months, right? There are some simple-ish games you could start with that are text based such as tic-tac-toe and Connect Four. You'd be surprised how hard it is to program such simple games. You say it's easy to play, but not so easy to code.But yeah, first get better at Python. Spend at least six months before thinking of another language. In particular, learning these other languages (if you find Python hard) won't lead to magic success. You could search for `cs50g edX` which is a game programming course offered by Harvard (for free). It has a predecessor `cs50p edX` which is a Python course. The course is Python programming and the followup, I believe, uses PyGame.",

        "body": "Big O, `O()`, is an **abstraction** to help us _estimate_ algorithm complexity, performance, and scalability. * In _theory_ there is no difference between theory and implementation. * In _implementation_ there can be a HUGE difference.Like all abstractions the devil is in the (implementation) details.The reason we DO count instruction cycles when profiling is because it gives us an absolute time that we can use to compare against. We can compare:* _actual_ **run-time** time versus the* _expected_ **theoretical** best case. That is, we can do A vs B comparisons such as A is `X%` faster or `Y%` slower to answer the question: _Is our optimization helping, hindering, or neither?_But oftentimes we want to know HOW an algorithm scales up relative to input size. `O()` is an _estimate_ of this which may, or may NOT, be accurate:If we have three algorithms that all perform the same task and have this scaling ... * O( n )* O( n^K )* O( K^n )... then the linear `O( n )` algorithm is probably going to be the fastest, by far, all things considered.However `O()` IGNORES RAM speed, RAMaccess patterns, and branch prediction -- all which MAY be factors!The _reason_ this was done was that pre-2000's CPU speed and RAM speed roughly had a 1:1 mapping. We used to store calculations in tables because the computation speed was SO slow.However by the 2000's CPU speeds became significantly faster than RAM. As CPU speeds increased and RAM didn't (as much) it became faster to calculate more, lookup less.Unfortunately Computer Science textbooks never got the memo that `O()` has COMPLETELY failed to adapt to the changing hardware and performance uplifts of modern systems. **It is an INCOMPLETE metric.**Let's take a [simple example](https://github.com/Michaelangel007/cache_line_speed) of summing up entries in an array. sum = 0; for( int col = 0; col < STRIDE; col++ ) for( int row = 0; row < SIZE; row += col ) sum = data[ row + col ];_Normally_ stride is 1, sequential acess, but what if it isn't?We can change the stride to show HOW we access data (and the data cache) plays more and more of a role the larger the data set.For example with an array of 2^30 elements (1,073,741,824) we see this falloff:| Stride | Op/s | Time ||--:|--:|--:|| 1 | 1 G/s | 00:00:00s || 2 | 1 G/s | 00:00:00s || 4 | 733 M/s | 00:00:01s || 8 | 388 M/s | 00:00:02s || 16 | 213 M/s | 00:00:04s || 32 | 141 M/s | 00:00:07s || 64| 116 M/s | 00:00:08s || 128 | 115 M/s | 00:00:08s || 256 | 115 M/s | 00:00:08s || 512 | 100 M/s | 00:00:10s | | 1024 | 66 M/s | 00:00:15s |EXACT same O(n) but HUGE differences in the Real World^TM.HOW we access this array matters! This is why ... * AoS (Array of Structs) and * SoA (Struct or Arrays) ... can have such a HUGE difference even though we are iterating over the _same_ data. **All those cache misses add up to slower performance.** This demonstrating O() IS incomplete for modern algorithms.In modern performance programming, often times we want a _branchless algorithm_ as we are _trading latency for throughput._ We want to keep the CPU pipeline saturated with work and not cause pipeline bubbles or flushes via branching.There are 3 categories of optimizations from slowest to fastest:1. **Micro-optimization** or [Bit Twiddling Hacks](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html). On older compilers and slower CPUs you would replace `MOD` with `AND` for powers of two, division with multiplication and bit shifts. i.e. Calculating `7*n` as `n + 2*n + 4*n` -- assuming your CPU even has a `MUL` instruction!2. **Algorithm.** Using a faster algorithm used to be the second step in optimization . We would use `O()` as a guideline for performance/scalability.3. **Macro-optimization** or Cache-Oriented aka Data-Oriented Design (DOD). As we deal with larger data sets optimizing for _minimizing cache misses_ becomes more important.See [CppCon 2019: Matt Godbolt “Path Tracing Three Ways: A Study of C++ Style”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG6c4Kwbv4I) where OOP, FP, and DOD is compared.",

Thing is, if you're afraid of doing that, then it's tough to get started. Chances are, you don't know what your program should look like when you're beginning.Rather than spending hours upon hours on planning something only to later change your mind(or even worse, get attached to your initial idea because you don't want the effort you put into it to go to waste), instead try things out, see what doesn't work, figure out how to make it work better, and so forth, until you arrive as a cohesive whole.Framing the early stages of your project purely as a exploratory learning experience is quite liberating. I think that you should only begin properly implementing the project when you're ready and confident with your design, and I believe that you can only get there by trying things out and figuring out everything that can give you trouble, first hand.",

        "body": "To most computer science guys, there are 3 language levels. There are more if you get into a big thesis level discussion with theorists and such, but your average coder probably thinks in terms of 3. Those are the machine's actual language: ones and zeros, the computer is wired electrically such that circuits have power or not, if they have power its a 1, if not its a zero, and these 1s and 0s represent actions and data. The next level are low level languages, which humans can work with but are extremely tedious. Most of the low level languages are considered \"assembly\" languages and that looks something like move data from memory to a cpu register, perform an action on it, and move the result back to memory, possibly with other things like jump to a different next instruction if that result was not zero. Its explicit, step by step telling the cpu what to do. High level languages are the third, and those gloss over the tiresome details by providing a way to express a bunch of those tedious actions in a simple, natural way. Instead of moving memory to a register and a result to memory, you can just say x= a+b or something akin to that. In all cases, the code you write is rendered to machine language eventually. Machine language is what you think of as a 'binary' or 'executable' program file -- you can look at those with a hex editor if you know what it means, but its largely gibberish if you are not an expert at dealing with machine language. Assembly is almost, but not quite, one to one conversion to machine language. High level code has two major approaches, compiled (turned into an executable file, a runnable program) and interpreted (turned into an executable program in memory instead of into a file on the disk, which is executed and discarded, but can be modified on the fly to some extent as it is running, and observed as it is running). This is grossly oversimplified, but maybe it gets you something about what you are asking?It seems like you are confusing the operating system and computer programming. They work together, but are totally distinct things.",

        "body": "So, basically, I've realized my issue with getting started in programming (which I've tried to multiple times) is that I've always thought in terms of my individual files in a text editor, and never beyond it; I wasn't thinking in terms of an environment, for terminals, programs, file systems, etc. I was thinking wayyyy too myopically. So my question was two fold: what is the information that a program is? from another comment, I now know the terms \"source code\", and what that information is in the computer's 1's and 0's distinct from post compilation (machine code). I ask this, because I wanted to see what the actual process it is I am doing is here. Plus, because I don't know what it is I am not knowing, this is an active attempt to organize my information into a conceptual synthesis, which is hearable in how rambly this is (I am self aware). With that, I didn't know what a developer environment is, with CLI, what commands actually are, and how this integrates across the file system of the computer, so when I get told by VS Code that something didn't work, well that's just that, because I didn't know what a command even is in terms of what's happening in the computer when I tell power shell something. So I am trying to learn each part here, and make sense out of a full picture I, in the past, didn't realize I was missing. Now I see it clearly. I am trying to understand my local environment, developing on my own laptop here, and how these different pieces are speaking to one another across my local system. So when I try and get an SDK to be knowable to Powershell and usable in VS Code terminal, now I understand that what it is I am trying to do is, across the local system, how these components get to know each other, that I know what it is Powershell is and what I am doing when I execute a command, so if something with say, Dart, doesn't work, now I can actually troubleshoot, because now I have any semblance of what it is that it is I am trying to do. I am trying to execute a command, getting windows to look for a program and do something with it (based on the command). I am attempting to learn how these pieces, miscellaneous without an understanding to structure them, actually integrate into a system, and that system is my local environment, so now knowing that, I can move fluently throughout my local environment and actually get things going here. TL;DR a lot of my trouble was outside the code I've written over time, and I never thought in terms of an 'environment' when programming, and now realizing that, I am trying to understand my environment, as that is the next step in becoming skillful in the world of computer science.",

Based on what I studied: You learn C++ to learn how to program stuff, then you learn OpenGL to learn how to work with 3D using C++. With that, you already can make a game engine. Based on Udemy courses length, in 2 months you can learn both. If you want to make it even easier, maybe learning Python before C++ could help. Because it will teach you programming logic, you can make some games (and 3D engines with it using OpenGL too) with it, and when you learn C++, you will basically already know the majority of it, will only need to learn the syntax.Also, I don't know your experience, but if you didn't made games before and/or used game engines, creating a new engine as a study projects will be complicated because you won't know exactly what does a game engine needs to have. Maybe a game engine focused on a type of game would be easier to make, and better for portfolio, because you won't be making a generic game engine\", you would be \"solving a problem\", for example, an engine specific for creating demakes and PSX style games. This is hard to make in Unreal, where everything is so realistic and modern. Or a game engine for TCG and board games. I want to make card games and play/test them. We can prototype an RPG or FPS game really fast in Unreal or Godot, but not a TCG.Those are the \"problems\" I have, so I personally would love an engine for that. There is one on Itch.io that is a pokemon-like game maker engine. If you want this project to go further, maybe conquering a niche like this would make it easier to stand out.",

The overall look and feel are on point. The way you’ve implemented functionalities, like task clearing intervals, is really smooth, and the light/dark mode toggle works flawlessly. Seriously, great work—I'm genuinely impressed!Now, just sharing some feedback and more of the approach I usually take:Once the design is finalized and everything’s working as expected, I like to take a step back and imagine I’m just a user—not the creator. I try to look at it from a fresh perspective and ask myself: *What could I do differently? What can I learn from this?*So, doing that here—on the initial “The Toh Do!” screen, I noticed the white space is quite prominent. The left side is dedicated to a vector graphic, while the right side houses the task list. If it were me, I might consider removing the vector and instead using that space for something functional—like a dashboard or a timer countdown panel, which could add value and balance out the layout.One cool thing I picked up from your code was the use of Redux Persist. I’ve typically just used localStorage directly, but seeing how you’ve integrated Redux Persist has definitely piqued my interest. I’ll be exploring that for sure—thanks for the inspiration!Keep up the awesome work—this is a solid project and you’re off to a great start!",

Commit the stable files to the repo by running `git add $FILENAME` follewed by `git commit`.Now you have a snapshot of those files saved in your repo. If you edit them from that point, you can see how they changed from the time they were committed with `git diff`, or you can revert them to how they were with `git checkout $FILENAME`.The point is, you don't need the Testing subfolder any more. You can safely modify the files in situ. More importantly still, you can back-up the repository to a remote host like GitHub, GitLab, or a self-hosted solution.I don't know if it's game changing, but I really like Fish for its programming language. I think it's much nicer to use than Bash or Sh. I also find Groff really good for producing documents",

You should be familiar with at least one of those if you're running Mac or Linux. It stands for Friendly Interactive SHell, and it's got some really nice UI features. I don't actually use it for that because I rely on some old-school features it doesn't support, and I'm too set in my ways to ditch them.However, it also has a scripting language that I find much more intuitive and consistent than Bash or Sh (which is what most people use for shell scripting on UNIX systems). It's really easy to learn and I prefer it for any shell scripts I want to write for personal use.> From git, since i have more than 10 programs i made that i use everyday, and they run locally (the production folder is literally what is being used) and cant work on testing in the production folder, cause it will repercute in the execution of the scripts locally.So I'd just keep the production folder out of the repo then. I do something similar to you, but I copy scripts to `$HOME/.local/bin` when I consider them stable. Again, this presumes that you're running Linux, but you can create any directory for your production scripts and add it to your PATH in Windows or macOS as well.

Otherwise you have to prefix them with their directory name (e.g. having to run `./my-app` rather than `my-app`).But it's just the directory you add to PATH.So for example, if I have a bunch of scripts in `~/projects` that I'm working on, I can copy them to `~/.local/bin` if I want to use them like regular commands. So if I want to change my monitor resolution, rather than typing `projects/displayresolution` at the terminal, I can just type `displayresolution` to run the command. But I can only do that if I copy the command to `~/.local/bin` first, because that directory is in my PATH.Now if I want to modify `displayresolution` for some reason, I can make the changes in the ~/projects dir, as usual; test them by running `~/projects/displayresolution`; and then copy (install) the script to ~/.local/bin when I'm happy it's stable.By the way, in the distant past, you used to be able to run a script from any directory just by typing its name at the prompt (so long as you were in that directory); but it was discovered that nefarious actors could copy a malicious script with the same name as a commonly run system command (like `ls`) to your $HOME directory (or wherever), and then, the next time you ran `ls` from your home directory, you'd run the nefarious script rather than list your directories; so they introduced the requirement that any command in a directory that doesn't belong to $PATH must be prefixed with its directory name (e.g. `./ls`). That way, the 2 commands would remain distinct, and `ls` would still run `/usr/bin/ls` like it should!",

Make each one nice and small. And then create a new branch for that issue, work on it, commit it into a PR, and then merge it into main. If you do that then you're never going to really mess up. The absolute worst case is you get your feature branch into a pickle and loose a tiny bit of work. But your core main branch should never be lost. And should just be a series of merges from the feature branches as you go. If you're planning on making the project a more long-term thing that you want to publish you might even want to add a dev / prod branch too. So you start at dev, create a new branch off it for your feature (or bug fix), do your work in that new branch, PR it back into dev when it is ready, and then merge dev into your prod branch which is moved onto your live server.",

The few products that exist are only possible through some really clever tricks, I'd be surprised if there are any standard libraries out there.Could you consider making a desktop app instead? While still hard, that's at least doable for an intermediate programmer.There are a lot of extra challenges with doing it as a web app:Video takes up a LOT of space. Video editors normally operate on uncompressed video, which uses up around a Gigabyte every few seconds for 1080p.So even a short video doesn't fit entirely in RAM, so you store it on disk. Are you trying to store it locally on the client side? Web browsers don't let you do that, there are limits to how much disk space you can use on the client device.So that means you'd probably need to store the video and do all of the processing on the server side. That way someone with an average PC can use it.But you can't stream multiple gigabytes to them every time they press Play. So that means that every time they make an edit, you'll have to recompress the video on the server, and stream it to the user. Your server bill will be enormous with all of that disk space and cpu.I'm not trying to say it's impossible. Of course it's possible, people have done it. But they've done it by (1) using expensive server resources, and (2) with clever tricks.Tricks might include:* Limiting editing operations to ones that they can do efficiently* Using tricks to preview the final edit on the client side without actually showing the full thing.* Operating on a low-res version during editing, then reapplying all of the edits to the full version when you're doneAt a bare minimum, it requires a lot of tricky frontend AND backend software working very closely together, running on powerful servers.",

As others have pointed out, Intel has not innovated in a while.Back in the 1990s, the thoughts that Motorola would stop producing processors and innovating was absurd. The 68k CPUs drove entire generations of home consoles, not to mention oodles of commercial applications.The fact is, they couldn't keep up with Intel. That's what buried them. Now, if anything, they build ARM designs, no need to innovate. But that's also why you don't find them so prevalent in modern markets. They still do stuff, but the Motorola of the 1990s has been subdivided and chopped up more times than a tin of tomatoes. It never really recovered it's prominence in the processor world, it just makes low key devices, that's why you only sometimes see the Motorola logo gracing various products. They license a lot of it's IP. The question is, what's burying Intel? In the home markets, maybe AMD? Samsung certainly has a major edge against either company's offerings with most of Samsung's fabric being manufactured and designed with far cheaper labour than what the Americans can do. I don't doubt that in 15 years, when we want to build a new home PC, we'll be looking at NVidia and Samsung processors instead of Intel. The current gen of home consoles are sporting AMD and NVidia fabric these days, Intel doesn't even have a shoe in.",

It's everywhere.At any for-profit company, every role is either tied to revenue or is an operating cost.If your work is tied to revenue generation and the company is growing, they will happily invest more. This gives plenty of opportunity for growth and higher pay. The downside of this role type is that when revenue falls or growth stalls, this is where the first layoffs occur.If your work is not tied to revenue generation, it's seen as an operating cost and companies are always looking at finding ways to reduce operating cost. This role only exists because they can't fire you...yet. The upside here is that these roles are more protected from layoffs since your work is required for continued operation.If you want work-life balance, stability and security, publicly funded work or unionized/protected work is (or was) your only option.If you think things are different in other fields of work, think again. The only difference is that current market conditions make some fields more stable than tech is today.",

When the market is overall doing well and people agree spending money, that Cascades down to every segment of the economy - if you spend more money at restaurants, waiters make more money, so they spend up on Hulu without ads, so SWEs at Hulu get paid more, so they buy a bigger house, and their realtor makes more money, etc.I feel like that's the logical side of the answer.Then there's seemingly just.... vibes.For like 5-10 years, every tech company got into this arms race of spending as much as possible on DS, ML, etc. Like, you couldn't be a tech company and not have an answer when the board of directors asked \"what are we doing in ML?\".I was working at a dino Fortune 500 company - not tech. And I had to put together an entire deck for my boss to tell the board what our ML strategy was. The point is, you couldn't get left behind. Even though the ROI was trash, you had to throw money at it. Most companies had no idea what they were gonna get out of it.And I feel like at some point, that broke. I think Twitter under Elon opened the floodgates - he went the opposite way (let's get rid of bloat) and to a degree it allowed every company to reset. And sure enough, every company immediately took that as an opportunity to pivot into cost savings mode - even though most of these companies are still doing great financially.So when will the job market improve?One answer is when the overall economy starts doing better. Another answer is whenever some sunset of tech companies decide they want to play offense and start spending again to try to separate themselves from the rest",

That increases the number of people looking for jobs.The AI boogeyman is around. I personally think the biggest issue with AI is that people are investing in it more, hoping for big returns. That means companies/people are not investing in other areas. The economy generally does poorly when things are not stable. In the US, we're in a very unstable time.

Everyone flaunts about how being a generalist is the way to go when in reality, big tech are the only companies who dont care about what tech stack you use or experience. Every other company that is not big tech wants someone well versed in the stack they use.Its not about the market being good or bad, its always been like this. No one wants to hire a front end dev with 5 YOE to work backend unless its node.js if their backend is in java they will just hire a java dev.Its the similar principle to people who say they have 6 years of experience but in reality its a 2 2 2 model where they have 2 years of experience in different stacks and then all of the sudden you aren't qualified for a senior role because they want someone in that particular stack with the experience to match. I will die on the hill that specialization is the way to thrive in this field if you are not targeting big tech.",

There are still a lot of issues with communication and collaboration. Teams there feel left out and can end up disengaged.It's much easier for Mexicans to work in the US on TN (NAFTA/USMCA) visas, which means the strongest potential hires are already working in the US and not interested in taking a pay cut to work back in Mexico. Unlike India, there aren't as many graduates produced either, so the hirable market is probably even smaller than in Canada even though there are more people there overall.",

A doctor can talk to NurseGPT all day, but something has to put in an IV and hang a drip line. A lot of robotics actually being used are incredibly simple, flat boxes that lift up 3cm and move pallets around for example. Robotics that can stand in one spot plugged into a wall and do the same thing over and over like on an assembly line, sure, but the power usage and overheating problems need to be worked out for autonomous units. And they need to do something about LLMs confidently giving you the wrong answer before anyone will trust them.But let’s say they iron out all the kinks; I’ve heard upwards of 60-70% of jobs could be replaced. Our systems are not setup to handle such massive unemployment. All these giant tech firms are not going to give up their earnings to contribute to any form of UBI, the line must go up! There are too few politicians that aren’t bought and paid for that will actually stand up and do something. In the long run this is all just another big tech bait-n-switch. They can run at giant losses for years, maybe even decades as they continue to subsidize everything with the parts of the business that make money. They will sell a restaurant a waiter bot with the latest wAIter model installed, but it can only stand at the hostess podium, and tries to seat people at already occupied tables 30% of the time. Human Robotics promises it will replace your entire wait staff in 5 years so a few people lose their jobs. But turns out the wAIter model was just a chatGPT wrapper making API calls the entire time. Human Robotics is running out of seed money, so now before the robot will seat your customers they must watch a 30 second unskipable ad for the McDonalds across the street.It just seems like if everything works out the way the big tech companies want it’s the worst possible outcome for humanity.",

The number of times I've seen a team work for eight hours on the wrong task, or a solution that's completely unviable, is nearly equal to the number of days I've worked with Indian engineers.And there's another reason that outsourcing to India sucks: The best developers in India don't want to work under those conditions, and they don't work for $20/hour or whatever you're paying your outsourcing team members. I'm told that many of the junior developers who get hired by outsourcing companies are making $10/day, and it's blatantly obvious that they do just enough work to keep the contact live for as long as possible. None of this is even remotely racism. Put a billion people in an area that has insufficient employment opportunities and you'll find millions who are willing to learn just enough software development to be able to do a crap job in outsourcing as part of a scam to extract money from richer countries. It's human nature. It has nothing to do with their culture or the color of their skin or their accent (though extra strong accents can impede communication, and that's a real problem).Not only that, but scammers running consulting companies run them in the US as well. Several of such companies are well known as defense contractors. Remember the debacle of the Obamacare web site that had something like 50 different consulting companies working on various parts? I'd have a hard time assigning that work to fifty people much less fifty teams. And the result was a disaster.That said, at the low end of developer skill? It may very well be permanent. For the last 30 years it's been bad for lower skill developers more often than it's been good. Higher skill developers are still doing OK even now, at least if we're willing to accept lower salaries. So the question to ask yourself is what your relative skill level is. If you have always been in the bottom of your class or the slowest employee wherever you have worked, it might be best to try for a pivot.(Edits: Fixed auto complete fails)",

India has plenty of amazing engineers, but those engineers are actually getting their money's worth and companies won't be saving by going with them as much as the other picks.The cheaper ones that are tantalizing to companies consist of higher amounts of self-taught and bootcamp coders. They are incentivized to focus on passing the interview rather than long-term transferable skills. I'm sure some of them are good enough for the position, but that isn't always the case.With AI and vibe coding, it's never been easier for mediocre developers to pose as a higher skilled one, especially when you only work remotely. Once the companies start to smell the shit pilings of AI generated code as it starts to cost them in maintenance, we might see a recovery. Until then, just be irreplaceable.",

The 2008 crash we probably didnt fully recover until like 2012 or so. The argument i always make (and i have little actual numbers or data) is that covid made everything ridiculously high. Government was giving out money like candy to any independent worker or business. People were getting money that they didnt deserve to get (some did need it). I didnt deserve a stimulus check tbh, and i got one. In 2020 everybody stayed put to their jobs because they didnt know how the future would look like so it was best to stay put. Then things open up in 2021, companies all have the money to use for hiring so companies of all shapes and sizes ar hiring. Jobs become remote and it looks like remote is the future. But what i think happened was that companies didnt realize how hard it was to hire remote workers and have them quickly learn their codebases. Jr engineers didnt have any camaraderie with their older engineers. Then the free money is gone, people arent spending as much as they did in the high time of covid, and many projects get acwd because small companies can no longer keep up after the government help ended. Bigger companies realize that they can either get a similar engineer for less money or that they overhired in 2021-22 and can fire PIPd employees quicker without having to give severance. Companies have still paused hiring for some time and because of that many people have stayed without a job. I also think potential candidates are too in love with the idea of remote work that anything less than that they are avoiding. But i applied to many jobs and sooke with many recruiters. The consensus i get is that, it’s not fully recovered but it is slowly getting better.",

If we had developed a union or some type of organization to represent us then we would be better prepared for these boom and bust cycles.

        "body": "From what I can see, yes. I started my career in RF tech. I was told I had a super long and amazing career ahead of me by my management; my peers were taking off left and right for other industries, telling me RF was finished in this country. This was about 2006 or so. I believed the managers and company I worked for, boy was I wrong. Six months later, doors were shuttered, severances were pitiful, nobody but nobody needed anyone in that field whatsoever. I have never seen anyone advertising in earnest for RF roles since. Most were outsourced a long time ago.I went from that to embedded systems, C, C++, etc. I still see some roles, but it was in no way as strong as it was in 2010. Again, another thing that got outsourced largely to European countries, anyone but the UK. I went from that to straight software in the Microsoft/Java worlds. Here's the thing about your run of the mill standard C#'ers. Dot net is a fairly well maintained ecosystem. I don't believe you need to have oodles of experience to be dangerous, you certainly do not need to be degree calibre. And as a good 80% (pure guess) of software being made for businesses today is CRUD work, with anything fancy being punted out to another organisation's WSDL/API/whatever, then does it matter if your engineers are a little less savvy?I have seen a good few projects punted out to Indian code farms before. To disagree with you slightly, though I am positive that there are individual exceptions, the grand majority of what I have seen back is pitiful in terms of code quality. A lot of it doesn't even work well, another lot of it is straight copy pasta. But, it \"works\" insofar as users can still CRUD to their hearts' content. Who cares if it's lower quality CRUD'ing behind the scenes? So to answer your question, I still see the odd roles for the higher-end work, so if you know your algorithmic theory, largely likely driven from either a very long career or university teaching, you are in with a chance. If you're a C# CRUD'er, I think your days are numbered and you need to go looking at a different career.It is now cheaper for my company to buy the equivalent of ten man-days in India than it is the UK. And they can scale that resource up or down where needed. They likely retain one or two UK developers to fix what India ballses up, sort of like having AI, but it doesn't mean Artificial Intelligence, just Actually Indian. I don't really care where things are made, but frankly the scenario that you and I are facing is this career option is gone. It's done. And no, I don't think it's coming back from this one. When the Government announced it's NI increase, my company froze hiring and salaries, kicked three teams to redundancy to outsource their work and haven't hired a single developer since. I have maintained a social network of a lot of engineers and people I have worked with over the years via Facebook. So I have some insight to how they are doing. The amount of random messages I have had from people I knew maybe ten years ago looking for any leads on jobs is amazing. My response is, we're not hiring, but if you hear of anything or get somewhere with a refer a friend policy, let me know! I have no idea how long I have left in my job. All I know is I'm mid 40s, despite my 25 years experience and a masters in the subject, I've had a total of four interviews this year, all of which were a waste of time. They had no intention of hiring anyone.Right now, I'm putting my strengths into figuring out what to cross train into, what can I pick up that will weather this incoming UK recession. It is a concern, my first kid is due in June. It's either that, or we move country. I've not figured out where too, anywhere that's still hiring basically. I did raise this concern at a management meeting at one point. The reaction I got was a knowing and mocking laugh, followed with \"Move to Bangalore, hu huh!\"So in my view, this is over. If you are 20 and wondering what to do for university, go do something medical. Become a dentist, an MRI dude, a surgeon, I don't know. Something medical that, sure, you'll have to spend ten years doing the donkey work after you graduate, but then, who's buying the Audi and fancy house? You. Can't outsource dentistry, can they?",

Or they think coding is just like excel. Executives? Whole different breed. To them, all work is menial. The only thing they get to see is results. PowerPoint decks. And I think when you do that long enough, you start to very quickly forget that people need to actually do the work.So when the work is not getting done - deadlines are missed, the product isn't good enough, whatever - your first thought isn't \"I need to get in there and figure out what's going on\". Your first thought is \"I need someone to get this department's ass in gear\".A lot of people hate on middle management, but that is literally the role of middle management - to both be close enough to the work to understand what is and isn't getting done and why, while also being above the work enough to be able to tell executives what they need to know (and what they want to hear).",

We interviewed 10 people.If there are 200 people willing to apply to an underpaid position imagine how many apply at private sector jobs that actually pay decently. The entry level market is just flooded with people trying to get their foot in the door. Oh and our jobs aren't even posted on aggregators like Indeed. So this was 200 local people who know to check our site for postings.",

Why do you think the average tenure (when excluding new hires) is only 1-2 years?***As someone who’s worked at Meta, Amazon, and Google, and who knows hundreds of engineers across FAANG, let me just say this: those jobs are not what people think they are from the outside. Sure, the comp is good, but the cost is insane.I’ve watched people burn out in real time. I lost chunks of my hair during a particularly brutal Q4 at Meta and gained nearly 30 pounds at Amazon just from stress eating and never having time to work out. There’s a constant pressure to perform, outshine, and ship faster. And if you're on a team with a toxic manager or PM, which is incredibly common, things get even worse.Work-life balance is a joke. You’re expected to work late, respond to Slack at all hours, and constantly prep for performance reviews that feel more like a survival game than a real evaluation. Even when people take PTO, there’s pressure to stay connected. I've seen people nod and smile through meetings while they’re falling apart inside. I’ve seen tears in soundproof phone booths. I’ve seen people start to disappear socially, piece by piece, until there's nothing left of them outside of work.The environment breeds fear and anxiety. Every cycle feels like another test to prove your worth, and the moment you slip, you can feel the ground start to shift. People step on each other just to stay afloat. Information gets hoarded. Credit is stolen. Blame is passed around like a hot potato. You learn not to trust too easily.Toxic personalities get protected if they’re productive. Engineers who belittle others in code reviews or hijack meetings with arrogance are tolerated, even celebrated. It crushes morale. I’ve watched smart, capable people lose their confidence entirely. They go from being curious and excited to withdrawn and exhausted.This isn't just about long hours or a tough boss. It's about the erosion of self-worth. People develop anxiety disorders. They burn out. Some leave tech altogether just to protect their mental health. The dream of working at a top tech company comes with a reality that drains the joy out of building things.And nobody talks about it honestly while they’re still in it. Most just try to hang on, quietly hoping for something better.",

You get started on 401k faster/earlier in your career, employee stock plan, the best health insurance in the country fully paid, they have education reimbursement (when I was there it was 5250$ a year they just pay you out, literally free NON-TAXED money) for going to school that you are already doing, you can work in sales and not have to deal with as many angry people as the Genius Bar, even busy stores have very flexible schedules to work with your class schedule, and there are no sales quotas for you as an individual (this doesn't mean don't work hard but you won't feel pressure when you go to work).

        "body": "It's pretty common in all forms of Comp Sci IMO. I think Game Dev has such a bad rep because its seen from the outside as a \"Fun\" coding job. There's a lot of people willing to take a pay cut, or work longer hours to be part of something they are passionate about. So people get into it thinking it's going to be a fun job. Then the reality hits - a lot of the time, you might be on a huge team, just working on a very small part of a game without a lot of say in how the game is put together. It becomes the kind of work you'd do anywhere else, it just gets plugged into a game at the end. Ultimately, I think the gaming industry is kind of past it's prime. There was a time when a team of 1-10 people could build a ground breaking AAA game. Rollercoaster Tycoon was built by one dude, for instance. Now, AAA games are made by teams of 100+ people. But the games don't cost 10-100 times more just because they required an investment of 10-100x what they used to. Game Studios are much less likely to take risks, it's just like games like \"Call of Duty 153, Ultra Future War\" or whatever, there's not as much innovation which I think is why a lot of people are drawn to the work. So people who love gaming get into the industry. They are smart enough to make 50-100% more doing any other corporate job, but the game companies know they can get top talent for a fraction of the price, and in fact, need to, because of how expensive development has gotten. Then they work there for a while, and find that while the work and team structure is similar to any other corporate job, they are being under paid/over worked, while their peers who went to work at some boring fortune 500 company are walking out the doors after 40-50 hour weeks, making more money, enjoying other things in life. They are stuck grinding it out while thier passion slowly leaves them, and they not only don't like their job, but they also don't like video games anymore.",

Companies know full well that the people working for them are doing so because they have a passion for it. These people aren't going to quit because of a bad culture because they have a \"passion\" for what they're doing.There's a very powerful power dynamic there. For a SWE that isn't tied to an industry, they can just find another job if they're ever unhappy. When you've tied your entire career to a specific industry, you don't have those options. You get to go to another company that also has a terrible culture. You have no bargaining power. Companies are very aware of this.I'd argue most passion careers suffer from this same issue.

Well, I did once when we were getting wiped out by L1 visa abuse. Have job stress if you aren't creating it.Everyone got problems. A bad day at a restaurant is being stiffed on tips or being too sick to come in and getting paid nothing. You can have a better life than most people if you buckle down and keep applying and interview well. Selling yourself is a skill.

If your boundaries clash with the company, it may be time to move on. Your health is going to be important to you long after the company goes out of business or gets bought by another company.Every startup is 6 months from shutting down. You are one heartbeat away from dying every moment of every day. As long as your heart keeps beating, you're alive to wait for the next beat, and life goes on. It's the same way for startups. Instead of heartbeats, it's customers and funding rounds.Don't let the startup drama sink you. In the end, it's just a job.

It sounds like your team isn't taking ownership and that they are happy being dependent on you. It could be that you just didn't hire strong candidates, or it could be that something in the company or team dynamics isn't helping people flourish. It sounds like you are pushing to upskill others, rather than others being the driver of their own growth. This means management needs to get to work. It's their responsibility to create a healthy team dynamic, where everyone is pushing to be better every day, actively trying to upskill themselves. But fixing this situation isn't your job - it's the job of management. So my question for you: what is management doing about this? Do they see the same issues? Do they have a plan? Do you have confidence in their plan? If the answer to the questions above is \"no\" then I'd start looking around for other opportunities, because the situation is likely to persist until some crisis happens that forces management's hand.",

If you’re applying and getting some interviews, but not getting offers, your roadblock isn’t qualifications but interviewing. You’re going to want to figure out what kind of job you want first, the skills they want, the tech stacks, then just practice for those. Practice answering behavioral questions like time management, communication, etc. Also practice programming puzzles because that’s generally apart of most technical interviews. If you get confident with these things, you’re massively increasing your chances. That said, a masters could reel in more interviews and renew your new grad status so you can apply for graduate roles.",

You got a B.S. degree in computer science, and the job market is trash in general right now. I don't think switching career paths will help much right now, but at least you will be able to pay off student debt if you are one of the lucky bastards who can land even a fast food job right now without having internal connections.Edit2: Another option is to leverage your degree to find roles outside of software engineering/development (even though IT in general right now is also fucked unless you know people).TLDR: The job market is fucked.

However you're getting interviews so I guess they don't care that much about the specific degree. Your issue is interviewing. Have you asked for feedback from every rejection? You don't have to be a good coder to get a decent job, you have to be a good interviewer though. Leetcode til your hands and brain hurt. Actually do and learn the blind 75. Use Blind as a resource, you can find posts about interviews at specific companies and tips on what they're looking for in interviews. Leetcode also has tagged questions that are similar to what you'll be asked in company interviews. Read grokking system design. As a new grad the focus will be on coding and some minor system design. If you know system design super well that will really make you stand out. Read tips on behavioral interview questions. Learn from recruiter feedback from failed interviews.Do practice interviews. It's especially useful for new grads. If you have friends in the industry ask them do mock interview you. There's also pay mock interview services -- never done that personally but ymmv. Research the company before you interview, have good questions about the technical aspects of the company-- read their engineering blogs and core values. Be excited about the company and job when interviewing.Don't lie in your resume about tech skills -- a good interviewer is going to discover it and rail you. Don't be afraid to say you don't know during an interview. If they ask a question and have no idea, tell them you're not 100% on it but \"this is how I would approach \" solving the problem. Think aloud, they want to see your thought process about how you approach the problem.Target swe jobs at non-tech companies (like banks, healthcare) -- the interviews tech to be easier. Good luck!

In the meantime, work on your own projects that you can showcase (if that’s applicable for the type of roles you are aiming for). I work in tech myself and my bf is a senior lecturer at a university - he can never put enough emphasis on the fact that his students needs to do whatever it takes to stand out from the rest. The job market is rough and 60 applications aren’t that many. However - not having received a single interview from one of those 60 applications could simply mean that you need to optimize your CV more or your skills.",

I typically look for more signals than just whether the candidate answered the question \"correctly\", e.g. I look at how they communicate about technical details, I ask them about testing and code reviews, and I ask follow up questions that require refactoring and/or open ended black hat curve balls like \"what if a user did [thing that breaks the code in some non obvious way]\"Of those areas, communication is a big one, I find that it's pretty much impossible to fake",

Many times, I'll ask the time and space complexity, why they chose DFS over BFS, what changes if you switch, how they'd handle a graph with 1B rows and columns, how they'd implement with a stack/queue/in-line, etc. When the person has a blank stare and can no longer answer, I know they've memorised the solution or they've cheated. If they can answer these questions logically, they're usually a strong hire.People have been cheating for DECADES. Back in the 2000's I heard stories of people aceing the complex Google interview process, turning up on their first day, and someone being confused because they swore the guy they interviewed was Asian. It also wasn't uncommon for some CS classes in some countries to dedicate months towards drill-based repetition of thousands of LC questions, alongside recitals of behavioural answers - over actually learning CS. AI cheating makes it easy, but let's not pretend the interview process that was apparently \"good\" before is suddenly incredibly broken.",

        "body": "Never take Glassdoor reviews as truth. The one and only thing you should use them for is to help you formulate questions to ask during the reverse interview process, and so you know what you keep an eye out for. Then based on the reverse interview you need to form *your own* opinion on if the company sounds like it has any of those negative traits you read about.The obvious reason why you shouldn't take those reviews as truth is they're often by disgruntled employees, or employees pressured into leaving good reviews by HR while they're working there. Neither end of that spectrum is reliable. Rarely does a content employee just think unprompted to themselves \"You know what would be fun? Let's go write a fair, unbiased review about my very average employer!\"But beyond that, companies change over time. A review that was accurate even last month, might not be accurate today. All it takes is a single change in management, and a team's culture can shift literally overnight. So just because someone said they worked long hours, doesn't mean people are still working long hours. The reverse is also true, just because someone said the WLB is great, doesn't mean it's still great.Teams within companies also vary drastically. Even at small companies. I worked for a startup once that had \\~30 engineers, spread across a few teams. The team I worked on was super laid back, modern stack, essentially no red tape so we moved very quickly, etc. Even pre-pandemic, we'd only come into the office once or twice a week, and nobody was watching us so sometimes we'd just WFH all 5 days and it wasn't a big deal because we got results. But another team was the polar opposite of us. Their stack was older, they had a *ton* of red tape, they moved very slowly, produced very little, and they were straight up told by the CTO that they need to be in the office strictly 3 days a week because they needed to get their shit together.So if you read a bad review about Team A, it doesn't mean Team B will share those traits. You need to talk to *your* hiring manager about *your* future-team to figure out what that team is like.The startup I mentioned earlier had a fair amount of negative reviews on Glassdoor talking about nepotism, and it being a boys club, and that if you're not buddy buddy with the CEO you'll never have any career growth. When I interviewed with my hiring manager and the CTO I didn't get those vibes at all. The culture seemed amazing, which is why I decided to ignore those reviews and join them. Lo and behold, the culture was great. I was absolutely *not* buddy buddy with the CEO, or anyone for that matter, and my career skyrocketed at that place. I've gotten the biggest raises I've ever seen there. It was a great place to work. The person complaining about nepotism probably just sucked at their job and got fired, and decided it'd be an easier pill to swallow to blame nepotism instead of themselves. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯",

If you become a SWE, you'll probably end up as a people or project manager later in your career anyway. You are very young and have plenty of time. Here's what I would recommend:1. Get a BS in computer science. Any accredited program is sufficient. You don't need to go to an ivy league. 2. Apply for internships, your sophomore and junior years. They don't need to be a top-tier companies, but it helps a lot if they are reputable, household names. Doesn't have to be a tech company, but that certainly helps. (I've recently seen FAANG hires who interned at IBM, FedEx, Walmart, Uber, etc).3. Build s***ty software in your free time. It doesn't need to be elegant perfect code. Just think of a very simple idea and write a solution in code. Then add simple features to it. Refactor and improve your code as you go. This is the foundation of every SWE job. A lot of University students over index on solving LeetCode Hard problems. Then struggle on the job because they've never built an app or system before. You need both skills to get into FAANG.Regarding your IT career, those skills will help you navigate the workplace more efficiently than a new grad.

Companies *used to* have an educational budget so you could keep your skills relevant on company time. But now, a lot of companies want near 24/7 availability and demand our prime hours, and a bunch of non-prime hours, too. Anyone working their monthly rotation knows this feeling right now. So fuck 'em. If you have a job which is chill enough where you have a few hours of slack a day or week, build during that. It can be difficult to do that stuff after hours on your own, but is considerably more compelling if you have to sit at your computer anyway during the day and pretend to be busy. You're inherently going to get slanted answers here, though. 1.5 years ago everyone would've told you to just job hop. Now most are saying \"hang onto your boring job for the love of God, please!\" We also used to have a lot more people aiming for extremely competitive FAANG-level jobs so their answers will/would reflect that. But if you want a career you can live with? And one which isn't going away after years of stagnation? I say enjoy your job as much as you can especially in this market, and work on things in your downtime.",

On that last point, it really drives me crazy, but when you have managers/stakeholders in the room, you need to speak to them with a language they understand, about concerns they care about, and at a granularity level that matters to them.I have one guy on my team, great developer, who spec'd out an EPIC level feature set, and wanted to present that to a manager. The only problem with his presentation is that it was way to granular, and talked about tickets in progress, focusing on the details of the how, and not the what/why. That's going to confuse the shit out of any manager whose trying to make sure the high level plan of the team is aligned to what they believe should get done.That's one thing, another is example is someone on my team shipping a feature without good product rationale, like the feature was just sort of garbage and we couldn't tell either way, and not backing down or and providing weak evidence that the feature was useful. What they said was basically: \"since we don't have data it's not good, we should keep it released and just observe\". Lol, I don't have data that my Greyhound can't drive a car, you think I'm letting him drive?Finally, the last thing which drives me completely crazy, is when people don't understand the purpose of meetings, and use the time in the meeting for something else. This just happened, where I was trying to run a planning session with the team, and an engineer goes: \"oh one more thing, u/justUseAnSvm can you navigate to the dashboard so I can show u/\" No brother, if you want a meeting to discuss this, schedule. Anyway, these are just some examples of things I notice in ambitious and competent engineers, that will otherwise be leadership material someday. I'm a real stickler for keeping things on track and not wasting peoples time. Your approach, listen, observe, and write it done, is a good one. Next step is to just ask for larger feature work. Don't forget, these skills take years and years to develop, so don't compare yourself wit any one else, just focus on making progress!",

That probably doesn't help you right now at the moment you need a job, but medium/long term, I would definitely look at lateral moves to other functions. I think being early in your career actually helps you here because you'll be on the junior side for whatever you do. Do some dev work in your spare time if that interests you at all. Actually, even if it doesn't interest you, it's probably a good idea.There are two kinds of SDET jobs I see these days:One, what we used to call \"white box\" - someone who has dev-level skills and has written source code or close to it. These people can stand up a test framework from scratch and pipeline infrastructure for tests to run and report. These have a little more staying power and tend to have the opportunity to become other kinds of software engineering roles - devs, devops, release eng, etc. - when the business outgrows the need for dedicated QA.Two, jobs that are basically QA and mostly manual testing, but for companies that know they need to step up their testing game and need a stopgap while they either scale up their automated CI/CD efforts or offshore manual efforts. You can tell by the way I've described it that I don't think these roles have a bright future, but you might get to hang on for a while at a company that's struggling through that process.Observability, monitoring, and deployment tools have come a long way in reducing risk in software delivery since I started my career. Issues can be seen early and fixed quickly. Unit tests are fast and cover a lot of ground. There's still some use for end to end testing, but I see a drastically reduced need to have a specialized function for it that introduces additional process and the overhead of handing work off to different people along the way.",

I put the accurate dates of when I was employed but kept the reasons why I had a gap to myself unless someone asked me. 2. Prepared a rehearsed answer to why do you have this gap? Something along the lines of:“I had a great experience in my previous role, it allowed me to grow a lot as a developer and accomplish xyz (keep it brief) however I had some personal circumstances that forced me to make the very difficult decision to step away from my job to take care of my personal life. I’ve used the last x amount of time to fully take care of everything and now I’m ready and excited to start my next adventure.” You can just run your own circumstances through ChatGPT and make it better for your specific situation. What I would NOT do? 1. Give any specifics about why you took the break (you should not be sharing medical information with a prospective employer to avoid putting yourself in a position you could be discriminated against due to health reasons). 2. Make it sound like you’re not ready to get back to work (it’s okay if you need accommodations later on, but for the initial conversations you want to give the impression that you’re ready and excited to get back to work). 3. Don’t sabotage yourself by offering any of this information unless explicitly asked. In my recent job search I spoke to almost 20 companies. Out of all of those only 3 actually asked me about the gap. I gave my scripted answer and they seemed satisfied enough with the answer to not bring it up again. Only 1 recruiter was kind of rude about it (Amazon) but he still moved me forward in the process so it didn’t hurt my chances at all. Don’t believe them if they try to neg you for having a gap. It’s not your fault, you’re doing your best and you WILL get back on your feet soon.I was open in my language about my “previous experience” and “in my previous role” but for most interviews nobody even brought it up and they have your resume so they know when you were employed it’s not up to you to over explain and if anything I think that would hurt you because you want to focus on what you bring to the company now, not what’s set you back before. One last thing, if you do have negative experiences with any company due to your break, you want to make sure you take that into consideration before accepting any offer from them. If they’re rude to you based on a gap on your resume, I can only imagine they’ll be worse if you ever have issues in the future and if your problem is something like ibs you want to make sure your next company is fair and understanding about medical accommodations. So take all that into consideration before accepting any offers. Best of luck! It was thought getting back into the industry as a mid level engineer with a gap, but everything worked itself out and it was so worth it to focus on my health first and foremost. Everything’s going to be okay!",

The one ***big*** warning to watch out, is that you do have relatively little control over your life once you're in the military. It's not just the downsides of being asigned to perhaps say Fort Polk , Fort Irwin, Fort Wainwright, Naval Base Guam, Naval Station Diego Garcia, or *whatever*, but it's also the risks of finding yourself put into a career dead end (especially from a civilian perspective, how useful are those skills outside the military??)Keep in mind that whatever they verbally promise you is only worth the paper it's written on (i.e. ***nothing***, because a verbal promise isn't written on anything.

You don't even have to like or enjoy tech.What I mean is when you're working with a system, technology, or even code snippet from Stack Overflow you actually care enough to understand how it works. You don't just consider it black box you can't peer inside and must take as a given. And you don't do this because you love it, but because you recognize this is part of your job.When you're more experienced this gets easier because you have a larger body of knowledge to fall back on. It's most painful when you're new, and to be honest a lot of people never get over the hump. This is because it's possible to get by for a while without this curiosity at lower levels. You have to actually choose to put in more work than you necessarily have to at some point.However you reach limits of what you can do without it because at a certain point your job is no longer about doing well defined widget-adjusting tasks, and furthermore this comes more suddenly than you'd think.Most of the times I've seen people flame out in this industry is because they precisely fell into this trap. They got comfortable doing simple things at lower level that didn't require curiosity and ended up digging themselves into a point where it was either psychologically or practically impossible to get up to being a \"grown up\" eng in the timeframe they needed to, because so much of what they were doing was just learning to invoke what may as well have been magic spells by rote.",

Nobody's policing where the line actually is, and yes, frontend SWE is a thing that people hire for.Personally, I find the labeling thing a bit silly given that the tone is usually along the lines of \"you can't call yourself X because you can't do [insert hard thing] (and I am better than you because I can)\", but that makes no sense because junior SWE who don't know how to do [most hard things] obviously exist and are, well, SWEs.",

Like similarweb, harmonic.ai, geoip, etc, but for a category of business that existing data would be useful for but isn't useful out of the box for.As an example, harmonic is basically just an aggregator for data you could go find and buy in a variety of other places, but they charge $5k/month per client for having dealt with that for you. And they pay happily because they dont want to deal with the mess underneath.You only need like 5 clients for a service like that before you're doing really well, and the rest is gravy. And the other nice thing is that these are recurring contracts and they aren't venture backable businesses by US standards, so they're less competitive.Alternatively, find a cofounder who you have a strong rapport with, maybe an American landing contracts on American terms directly who wants a trustworthy partner in figuring out oursourcing and is willing to split the arbitrage with you.Outside of this and relocating, the reality is that outsourcing in general is already only pursued precisely because they can pay less, and Nigeria isn't even one of the main hubs (India, Ukraine, Argentina, etc) because it has a pretty sketchy reputation from scams (even though Nigerians in general are undoubtedly smart, industrious, and well educated). So its going to be rough there.And both immigration and the tech labor market overall are a bit of a mess at the moment. Hence, entrepreneurship looks better than usual right now.FWIW I don't know people in Nigeria proper, but the people I know in South Africa who do the best built a business where they earn directly in dollars like that, often with a cofounder in America/UK, but not always.",

If he's a team-lead he should be giving kt sessions to the new guys to get them up to speed instead of berating them. If he's not a developer he needs to be more hands off with the team and try to provide you resources for success.Other people might think he's a good manager if they've been at the company longer than him. From my experience the dynamic between manager/employee is different if the employee worked at the company longer than their manager.",

I'm just responding to the tone of the post so this may or may not be relevant - your veteran status counted as general career experience but is otherwise worthless in tech - almost none of the experience is tangibly relevant for a newbie software engineer.I'm not saying that is what you are doing, but reflect on yourself if you're overplaying the veteran card. If you are being cringey with your veteran status (I wish I could go tell 25-year-old-fresh-out-of-service me to shut his fucking mouth) it might be pushing people off - especially your manager.EDIT: fixed typo",

Some companies apply a flat percentage for promotions; companies I’ve worked at, for example, used a flat 10%.Other companies have set salary ranges and will use comp ratios to determine the increase. They also consider your current compensation. Generally, managers and the comp/HR team aim to bring employees close to a 1.0 comp ratio. For high performers, they may go higher. However, some managers or comp/HR folks might think that bringing someone straight to a 1.0 is too large of a bump, so they might offer a lower comp ratio instead. They may also feel a candidate needs ramp-up time or isn’t fully qualified, which can also justify a lower comp ratio—though there’s usually a floor, such as 0.9.Comp ratio, short for comparative ratio, is a measure used in compensation management to compare an employee’s current salary to the midpoint of a given salary range for their position. It’s calculated by dividing the employee’s salary by the midpoint of the range and is usually expressed as a percentage. A comp ratio of 100% means the employee is paid exactly at the market or target rate. Below 100% may indicate they’re underpaid relative to the range, while above 100% suggests they’re paid more than the midpoint—possibly due to experience, tenure, or performance. It’s a useful tool for ensuring pay equity and making informed salary decisions.",

The criteria in the tech org was extremely coarse and must have been decided 4+ levels up. I've anecdotally pieced together some criteria of what got you axed: 1. Working on non-critical or internal-facing initiatives **right now** (doesn't matter if you had been with the company for years performing amazingly and recently switched teams)2. High TC (especially if combined with #1) think Architects/Staffs/Sr. Staffs3. If you were on leave (maternity/paternity/medical/sabbatical). Apparently they're allowed to do this if they set your termination date + severance payout *after* you come back from leave4. An actual low-performing team/group that could have its responsibilities absorbed by peer teamsThat last one (performance-related) was the exception and not the rule. I would have hoped there was far more consideration of performance/contribution, but for big cuts like this my guess is it's just too much to evaluate and they can't let the information leak outside of executive level for fear of \"spoiling the surprise.\"",

So worst case, 80%+ of employees are fine after a layoff.Reasons are usually structural, e.g. department doesn't have money making prospects or are redundant (yes, this actually happens). So, yes, you could get canned despite being a high performer, if the thing you're working on isn't deemed to have a healthy future. And, yes, you can \"coast\" in one of the many KTLO corners of a company.Thing is, some of these companies have larger populations than some cities do, so in reality there's a lot of variance in terms of people's experiences. What you hear on the internet is largely echo chambers from the outlier groups.

Don't have impressive projects? Well, do something about that. Make something. All the tools are free at this point. The only thing holding you back is you. Don't know how to do something? Learn it and then use it.2. The job market is rough, but if you keep at it, make a reasonable plan that lets you have a roof over your head and food in your belly while you search, you will be OK in the long term.

And that might not be something that your program has necessarily taught, unfortunately, because I was built the same deck of cards, but downturns will happen and life will go on. Things are a little tough right now, but your job is not to do a job right now. Your job is to learn and to pick up as much experience as possible. So figure out how you can do that, and find something that you really enjoy, and you're going to be fine.",

It's analogous to civil vs electrical, they have some surface level commonalities early on but you have to fully commit to one in order to achieve a minimally employable skillset (and then commit to some amount of effort again if you're going to switch).Within SWE, there's a lot of variance, from the super-competitive big techs of the world to startups that are hungry for scrappy go-getters to \"boring\" F500 industries to the consulting world. Some don't even do DSA questions. Some don't even have recruiters. If you're worried about employability, it's going to be less about which tech field you decide to pivot to and more about how well you can conduct your job search; that in itself is a whole skillset on its own",

I don’t see much talk about people attaining CS degrees with the intention of getting into IT. I wish I could more clearly express my thoughts, but I’m basically asking if I can take time to up-skill after graduation while working in IT and still be considered for a dev job in the future, or if getting into IT is a death sentence.",

For me a standing desk has helped the most, it allowed me to fidget, move, and adjust. I have tried those desk treadmills, those were awful for me personally. I have tried the mini bike pedals that you can do while sitting in a chair, even worse than the treadmill, lol. I have tried sitting on an exercise ball and I enjoyed it but it did kill my productivity because I just allowed myself to bounce which was fun but I got side tracked.I've settled on a good, high quality ergo chair. My main chair is a [Herman Miller Aeron](https://store.hermanmiller.com/office-chairs-aeron/aeron-chair/2195348.html?lang=en_US&sku=100073872) and my secondary chair is an [Automous Ergochair Pro Mesh](https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-chair). I am big on mesh seats, lol. The support and comfort they give does feel like it calms my anxiety a bit. The Aeron also has different size options, I'm a bigger guy so I have the biggest size. The seat is big enough that I can do the good ol' crisscross-applesauce, lol. I can ever so slightly sway side to side which also calms me down and allows me to stay focused for longer.I'll be the first to admit the Aeron is at a pretty high price-point but you can often find them used for a solid deal, but that heavily depends on the area you're in.If you'd prefer to go new and don't quite have the budget for the Aeron the Ergochair is also a decent option, they also have the padded seat option if you're not into the ALL Mesh like I have.",

The brutal truth is that most other roles have been reduced the last few years to \"Configure a tool -> Make sure it works -> keep tweaking that tool until it works\" rinse and repeat. Pentesting is in not too different state as the \"real\" advanced pentestig work is done by a very, very small number of companies, while the majority of them rely on automated tests and reporting, which can be very boring, and if anyone tells you otherwise they either live in a bubble or have watched too many YouTube videos hyping the job.",

Just need to sharpen up on some security fundamentals, OWASP top 10, some light hacking skills and you'll be gold. But to answer your question, most of those places don't check degrees anyway, so you can put any other degree if you really want to. On your resume you can put freelance software developer, and just highlight other side hustles you did that align better. Warehouses and places like that hire anybody lol. But I truly believe you can get a job in tech, if you just target a little better. AppSec Is something you can definitely do if you love looking at code.

Experience that really matters in SWE is making products that people use and coding in a collaborative environment. That's why internships and open source projects are most valuable. Also for this reason I strongly recommend open source projects over personal projects. To get an internship and eventually a job, you will also need to be good at leetcode. If you're math-inclined it will probably be tempting to go down the competitive programming rabit hole, but they have bad coding habits (bad variable names, code gimmicks, etc) and lose sight of building real products. It also helps to be strong at a low-level language like C in case you never learned it. If you have the discipline to read classic textbooks over online tutorials you will learn the fundamentals better than most other self-taught candidates. You can \"stay in touch with the industry\" while in school by reading SWE/ML blogs from respected people.It's my impression that even if you are more interested in ML than SWE, you will need to have the skills of an SWE to get the job.",

You'll have a choice between a dissertation and 3 mini modules (cloud, data analysis, ux design). Sounds like that would be a good option for you - data analysis is a ballache though. On this course you'll also finish java in year one, which is well taught, and move on to other stuff where the lecture quality basically gets progressively worse. I'd forgotten a bunch of java by the time I finished and I did it full time. I'd more focus on getting a distinction in the msc vs 1000 hours of whatever study plan. c# / .net stack be pretty useful for the Belfast market (which is a bit of a bubble with more jobs but worse pay than England). You could build a website with an API and connect it to a database, then containerise and deploy it on GCP, upgrade the frontend with some UX design - that would hit the stuff you'll cover pretty well. I dunno, I see where you're coming from wanting to make a big study plan, but when you're actually in a masters just spend the 1,000 hours on it lol.",
