Here recently the offshore teams don't want to do anything but until like 10am CST and then they are gone. There are a handful of really good technical people, but the rest of the team HAS to be led by those individuals or it all falls apart.This recent trend of limited overlap, still having all the business partners onshore in the US, and companies having most of the technical resources offshore are really hurting productivity and sanity.",

Offshoring always ticks up when the business starts dealing with uncertainty in the market or some sort of economic downturn. Many of my previous companies used at least a small cohort of offshore resources and some even had entire teams that were offshored. Eventually the result becomes the same. Either the offshore quality drops due to conditions in their own country deteriorating or individual resource quality drops enough that something triggers a management 5-Alarm fire drill trying to fix offshores output. It’s a boom and bust cycle.The weirdest situation a company of mine dealt with (at least that I was privy to) was we had a group of offshore resources that worked at a shared office location in their country. The main analyst freaked out, suddenly quit, formed his own company, and poached the entire staff of his original team leaving only the “manager” for that team. The guy pretended everything was fine for 2 weeks and told nobody that he was soloing all this work. During that two weeks, he fucked up some report for management that made the corporate metrics look absolutely dogshit which triggered an analytics all hands meeting to figure out what was happening. Offshore “manager” joined remotely and when leadership asked to see the rest of the team, he just said,” what team? They all quit. It’s just me.” The next month or so the analysts across the company were helping do interviews to get more onshore talent.",

I’m still on that journey of learning, but now I’m doing data platform work for a different, smaller company on AWS. Just keeping going and learning, you can’t magically know everything you need to know at once, like Neo in the Matrix (though that would be nice… opens eyes, “I know Kubernetes”). Do spend the time to learn git though. That is life changing. And always keep an eye out for what best practices are in any given situation, but balance it with real world pragmatism. That’s an art, and really hard to figure out. So anyway, best of luck, and you’re not a fraud :)",

Your bosses don’t want to see you fail - if for no other reason than because that makes them look dumb. Use that to your advantage. If you are not interested in the subject and don’t want to do it, then figure out what pieces you are interested in and lean into those. Then highlight the importance of those and tell your boss that you’re more interested in the other X stuff (figure out a way to make it seem higher value) and you’d like to find a way to step back from the other stuff you’re being asked to take on.

The real win is productivity and business outcomes, not tech for tech’s sake.Refactoring usually gives better ROI in workers productivity than starting from scratch. Exceptions exist when you’ve got a highly talented team, strong communication, and a big budget, but most companies can’t afford that luxury.If you’re not in banking or another high-risk industry, it’s worth lowering expectations.

No PRs should be accepted unless the owner of the data (preferably a senior/experienced dev) approves it.* Idempotency, idempotency, idempotency. Probably the most crucial part of any data warehouse pipeline. It is really not that hard to implement these days (most modern pipelines and warehouses have multiple ways to enforce it). Prevents 95%+ of data inconsistency issues in production.* Backwards/forwards compatible transfer protocol. My current favorite is Protobuf (or proto-adjacent forks) for its 'data-contract'-iness behavior, but Avro + schema registry works too (though I personally hate having to manage yet one more cog in the flow)* Monorepo your schemas. Slightly controversial take, but this helps definitions/migrations fail at *compilation time*, which in my experience reduces runtime problems by orders of magnitude.* Pick a database that can be locally initialized via a container, and keep an append-only log of all migrations in git. This makes testing so much more reproducible, and makes it quite rare to have unexpected issues in production you didn't find at the test phase.In my experience following most/all of these makes everything else follow naturally in place.",

Even if you come to the table with a plan, you are competing with execs who either want more data for their initiatives and maybe IT management that is more interested in delivering new features that will give them cred. Refactoring generally doesn't have much ROI either unless it establishes cost savings or development velocity. If you have to manually massage some process all the time, they don't care unless it's blocking you from releasing new stuff. They also wonder why you didn't \"do it right the first time\". They also don't want to invest more money to rebuild a platform that they already paid for, so you often get stuck with the crap they paid some consulting firm to build and have to slowly fix it over time.TBH this isn't a data warehouse thing, this is a general IT thing where you sort of wait around for some lull in requests to do that kind of stuff. My company has a billing platform that they implemented 15 years ago and over time implemented every new significant product line differently, such that the processes were all unique. That's a core system to our revenue cycle and has had several customer impacting deficiencies, but they are only now really able to go back and do it right because there isn't a huge backlog.",

They will know all the fashionable buzzwords and all the topics that are triggers for LinkedIn surfers.You are now doomed to 2 years of work to replace a perfectly working system whose only requirements seem to be embellishments on \"Don't break anything we gave in the 'legacy' system\" and \"I'd like my dashboards downloadable to Excel\".At the end of it you'll have a sytem that, at best, has 80% of the functionality you had before, costs many multiples of its predecessor and is less reliable.The only people to benefit are those who milk it for their LinkedIn profile so they can continue to fail upwards in a more lucrative role",

The secret is lead analytical engineers with lengthy and deep business knowledge. 20+ years tenure, and in positions they are telling every department in the company how to use their data to reduce cost and increase revenue (meaning these folks know every business process as well as the department that performs it). They are unicorns, yes, which is one reason most warehouses fail. You can’t let the. Business lead. They simply don’t know how to build a data warehouse correctly. Honestly, this is just one area in the company where tribal knowledge, Business knowledge, and tenure are absolutely critical. You just cannot have turn over here and “reset”.Your key issue, that you sited, is that without these key individuals - your team will build a data warehouse that doesn’t provide sufficient value for the cost.Edit: the other secrets are more well known.

I don’t code much these days, but it’s still an extremely valuable notch in the toolbelt.  If you’re sticking around in the SAP world, do understand the data that’s there depending on what modules you have. The concepts of Kimball modeling don’t go away, even if you go somewhere that’s not an SAP shop. But also look into SAP BDC, as it potentially gives you some flexibility into working with the Databricks interface as well.",

If it's just implementation details for ongoing sprint, then it can be done asynchronously via slack or Jira.So it's not impossible to have \"Self aggrandizing meetings with the higher-ups\", but more likely, it's to vehicle the right decisions at critical times.

I was given 3 days from the time they sent it, and the test was quite standard DE stuff (data modeling and SQL, create a batch processing job, design Architecture for a data streaming platform). In this case though, I think you did dodge a bullet, because I have not heard of anyone hiring based on their ability to 'learn new domain', at least not as a DE. Data scientists/researcher maybe.

A former US employer had dabbled in Palantir then moved away from it quite rapidly once they understood what they were getting into.Here's a link to some more information about the NHS Federated Data Platform, that gives some insight into what exactly it is from a technical perspective. https://www.england.nhs.uk/digitaltechnology/nhs-federated-data-platform/how-does-the-nhs-federated-data-platform-work/My main reaction is that lock in is nothing new for the NHS. It's obviously not ideal, but equally, NHS trusts and the central NHS bodies are very used to fighting their way out from locked-in information systems. And when you're one of the ten largest employers in the world, you do have a fair bit of clout for getting past lock in. I can't speak to whether Foundry is a good choice here technically speaking, but IF it is, it's probably better for the NHS to have a good technical solution with lock in, than a worse technical solution without lock in.",

They can continue to work as normal if you don't \"drop in\".4) We've also had similar success with \"co-working\" hours a couple times a week which is just a zoom that anyone can drop into and chat or just sit and work but be available for others to ping. If the manager is smart they will ask their Seniors/Tech leaders/wannabe Seniors to make themselves available during this time as part of their demonstration of leadership.Both 3 and 4 are intended to help with avoiding constant interruptions for go-to folks so they can get into their flow state, while still helping those who need it by setting aside time to make themselves available for technical help / mentoring / problem solving / etc",

It's in python, so not the fastest, but I did benchmark it with billion row files. I think it took about 15 minutes, but don't recall of the top of my head.With data in a relational database(-ish), I'd probably create the diff using SQL, write the output to tables (except for the Sames), then generate the ids while appending/updating to the original input table.

You get to see a successful production implementation and understand what it takes to maintain one* On-prem isn't sexy, but the tooling otherwise seems pretty modern* WLB matters a lot to most people's long-term careers. You have to be disciplined about \"coasting,\" but most of us need to spend time operating well below capacity to avoid burnout* Data teams functioning as support can struggle for visibility, which means career opportunities can be limitedStartup thoughts:* Product data roles are relatively rare. I've turned down a few product-based roles and work with product engineers. My impression is that your incentives are very different from internal-facing work* It's probably going to be sink-or-swim. They wouldn't have extended an offer if they didn't think you could hack it, but if you like more support, it's probably not a good fit* There's likely very little structure around teams, advancement, and growth. It's very common for everyone to believe in \"the mission,\" and your major target is less about titles and salary and more about driving the company to IPO / acquisition, so your equity is worth something* If you actually get to work on streaming / near-realtime, that experience is very valuable to a smaller number of employers. Data warehousing / batch processing is much more widely applicableHow I'd think about the decision:* Are you OK with being tossed in the deep end and figuring things out? That's likely the expectation at the startup* Are you comfortable with more than just doing heads-down work? Startups generally require you to be more cross-functional / collaborative since you may not have mature processes (product management, team leads, etc.)* Are you capable of managing burnout? This can be a problem at both places, but your manager at the corpo probably has more experience identifying and heading it off (lowering workload, encouraging vacation / holiday, etc.)* Is working on the latest tech really important to you? If it is, the startup is a no brainer. If you're OK with learning more enduring patterns on an older stack, this is less of a differentiating factor",

I get why Company A feels safe—it’s stable, has nice people, and you’d be in a predictable environment—but if your goal is long-term career growth and building skills that transfer globally, B is where it’s at.Here’s why:1. **Modern, cloud-native stack:** Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift + Spark + Python/Scala + real-time streaming is what the market is moving toward. Hadoop/Spark/Hive experience is still okay, but it’s much more “legacy enterprise” skillset. If you want options in NA or EU in a few years, cloud-native experience will open way more doors.2. **Customer-facing product experience:** Working on something that thousands of companies actually use is huge. It shows you can handle scale, real-time systems, and impact—stuff recruiters notice. Internal ETL for business ops at a big company looks nice on a resume but doesn’t scream “can build product-grade systems.”3. **Fast-paced, growth environment:** Yes, it’s stressful and work-life balance might suck a bit, but that’s exactly where you learn the most. You’ll get exposure to data validation, lineage tracking, fraud detection pipelines—these are highly in-demand skills.4. **International opportunities:** The tech stack + product experience will make moving abroad far easier than internal enterprise ops work. People hiring in NA or EU will instantly recognize those skills.If you want a chill ride and don’t care about moving internationally or building the “modern data engineer” skillset, A is fine. But for leveling up, B is the one that actually sets you up for the future.Basically: stress now → way more options later. That’s how I see it.",

Most GenAI tools will either hit token limits or lose important context when processing documents that large. What you really need is proper document chunking with semantic understanding so when someone asks about a specific rule, the AI gets the right section plus relevant context from other parts of the document. We built Docstrange by Nanonets specifically for this kind of challenge because traditional PDF processing just dumps everything as flat text and loses the logical flow that's crucial for regulatory documents. You might want to consider breaking those massive PDFs into smaller, logically structured sections while maintaining cross references, that way AI tools can actually give accurate answers instead of getting lost in 300 pages of text.",

Like I said, I was dealing with tens of thousands of simulation files regularly on hardware that would make you cry. This volume is nothing for current systems.Second. You'll probably have to deal with files regardless. Most simulation software (I'm assuming it's a simulation, Markov chain analysis, probably?) dumps to files, though maybe yours can dump to a db. Doesn't matter.What I would do is let them save everything to a bucket/blob/network drive/whatever then have your warehouse pick it up from there and stuff into a database. You can easily add the filename and other metadata during ingest and then you can serve it up to them nicely from the database. Everyone is happy.As for executing over 30 days, that's a single Python/bash/CLI of your choice script. Since it's an optimisation problem, I'm guessing you're setting up hyper parameters for each run. You can do that with a CSV and a short script to pick up the values for each run.Don't over complicate it. This is a pretty simple exercise.",

That way, your composite key, which maybe a load of different strings, all get mapped to a fixed size int/guid which can be used efficiently. Otherwise, you could just stringify and concatenate them and they'd be human readable. This isn't a question about why compound keys are used it's about why they are hashed.",

Most big BI products (like Power BI) can't use composite keys and want you to turn them into strings and concatenate them instead and join on those, which is terribly bad for performance and resource usage, so hashing to a number and joining on those is preferred.Another hopefully rarer case, for columns where it contains PII and they want to hash it to get it out of the dataset. You'd think, \"who stores fucking PII in a key column?!\", but in PICK and other old databases (which might still feed newer databases) it totally did. SSNs? SURNAME F? Phone number?

        "body": "I've been designing DW solutions for 30 years. Up until recently, surrogate keys were always defined as int or bigint and to generate them you used a sequential number generator or similar. This meant a couple things. You almost always had to process your dimension before facts (because the dimension table contained the mapping of the business keys to the dw surrogate key assigned). When processing fact tables, for every fk, you would need to lookup the associated surrogate key in the corresponding dimension table. In the old days when we were all using OLTP based database systems like Oracle and SQL Server (on-prem because that is all we had), using integer based surrogates added in performance at query time). Later Dan L came up with Data Vault methodolgy. That is a very different way of modelling with one of the often listed benefits of being able to process in parallel entities that would be come dimensions from those that were facts. To do this, he used hashing (of some sort) so that you didn't necessarily have to process data in a certain order (apologies if I have some of this wrong....I only worked on 1 DV project 14 years ago). The other thing which occurred was columnar database solutions, the cloud and elastic and ultra scalable dbms solutions like Snowflake (and before that Terradata and Netezza). These systems reduce/eliminate the need to worry about defining surrogate keys as integers and using a hash methodology works fine so hence, you now see many practitioners use a fixed length deterministic hash column as the surrogate.BTW: one of the lesser known reasons for using a surrogate (based on a sequential number generator) was that you build in some isolation from the source system. While not common, systems of record have been known to change the key of a source record (probably seldom happens now) so using a surrogate key meant that it was possible to only need to change the relationship of the dimensional business key to the existing surrogate (no need to update the FK in all related fact tables where it occurred. By using a hash, that won't work anymore since the source key fields which might change, will result in a different hash. But since these new systems are so much faster, probably not a big deal (I don't recall ever running into that situation but I recall Ralph Kimball mentioning this in one of his books...I think)apologies for rambling on.",

There are a few advantages:* Independent processing: You can generate foreign key without needing to do a lookup. So you could create fact records without needing to join to already loaded dimensions, or satellite and link records without joining to hubs. This allows parallel processing that isn't dependent on load order (warning: it can also lead to including a foreign key that doesn't actually exist)* Prevent having to do multi-column joins. For example when you have to do a diff or merge for incremental load, you can join on the hash key. * Records from the same source data will have the same key in all environments. This can help in some testing scenarios. There are some disadvantages such as increasing storage of the key, risk of collisions, and being less human-readable.",

Advantages of using hash function to generate a surrogate key over creating surrogate key from sequence 1. During table load into distributed system, generating sequence could become a bottleneck where as if we use hash function based on business keys, they could be loaded independently parallel much faster. 2. Anonymization: Hashing protects sensitive data by creating a oneway, non reversible key. By using hash keys, you ensure that the vast majority of your data warehouse users—who are simply analyzing metrics—can't even see the sensitive data because it's not present in the tables they access. Usually dimensional tables hold sensitive info like ssn, credit card etc. 3. Efficiency while doing data lookups and data integration. Use of hash keyed surrogates avoid the need for what they call pre-join. Using a sequential key requires a lookup against the dimension table to find the correct key for a given business key. But if we are using hashed surrogates, we can derive this directly from the business keys and avoid pre-join. I think what they mean is an application querying with business keys does not need to go to the dimension tables first to find the sequence number foreign key and then use that to fetch fact table details. Instead, the application querying can directly generate a hash from the business keys that the user entered and query the fact table directly. 4. If data is sourced from different source systems, the hashed key approach ensures the same key will be generated for say the same customer whereas if we use sequence, that will end up creating multiple records for the same customer causing data integrity issues.",

You can always take your model to the cloud later if you wanted to with minimal changes. There is not a ton of value IMO of the paid version. A few other things to consider are that rumors are that Fivetran might be buying dbt, which could affect the future of the OSS option. If dbt continues independently there might be more divergence from their commercial product and OSS, so features you won't have access to (but like I said you switch later).",

It's made of infrastructure and DE engineers. This centralization is useful to avoid duplicated data infrastructures, for examples having 2 DE teams developing their own ETL framework can be wasteful.2. A data person (potentially more than one) within a business team who is fully aligned with the business objectives but has enough technicality to interact with the data infrastructure team.

They get looked at for a few minutes every month and are used for strategic decisions where a few hundred dollars isn’t going to change any strategy. Yet we must focus on those minor discrepancies.I disagree with a centralized data infrastructure team. What I have learned is that ”Centralized” is just gatekeeping and creating a new bottleneck.Do you know what operations does when IT can’t build an app fast enough, or it takes months to build a data model and report?They just do it all outside the authorized structure and build it in excel and create a bunch of shadow processes and tech debt and single points of failure.The corporate dream is executive reporting then driving operational reporting. Except that takes a long time to build, is inefficient and costly to maintain.In reality, we should focus on the operational reporting and push all our resources into helping them be more accurate and automate as many processes there as possible.",

You can do incremental append loads and then even emulate dropped/deleted rows by scraping only the PKs of tables and doing an inner join to themThe probably with the dynamics tables is some of that are wide as hell and absolutely brutalize data integration tools.",

Hive is 'simpler' than iceberg, which is both good and bad: **Good** because there is less involved management of the objects (no snapshots TTLs for example) and it is simpler to reason about the partitions and buckets (to some extent) but **bad** because you lack access to operations such as MERGE, DELETE, UPDATE that simplify the logic of the pipelines. In hive if you want to create a SCD2 you have to do it in more steps and always with the mindset that you have to move data to another temp or staging table in order to do a final insert with the data you want to 'update'. In iceberg you can just MERGE/UPSERT.2. Iceberg has more functionalities that enable you to write efficient tables and queries to access their data: z-order, bloom filters (supported to some extent in hive table format) and hidden partitions are a few of them, but now that I think about it not a lot of people used them to get the most out of the hardware. You can achieve great results while optimizing large tables if you use them in the right way (good sorting to improve compression, adding bloom filters for columns often used in equi-wheres, use the right type of merge (CoW/MoR) depending on how the data lands in the table and is queried, etc)I would prefer iceberg because of the extra functionalities to manipulate data, but without snapshots or at least a very simplified version of it.",

I’d do this:\\- Freeze the big query now and define a field-level contract for what each column means.\\- Decompose into modular models/views with tests and canonical dims/metrics; keep a library of approved functions.\\- Kill manual CSVs: schedule ingestion and render HTML from JSON via templates (Jinja), not whatever AI spits out.\\- Run a side-by-side diff: legacy vs new per client, track tolerances, fix gaps, then sunset the legacy path.\\- If they need offline short-term, ship a locked-down CLI that calls validated endpoints and renders approved templates.Fivetran for ingestion and dbt for tested models worked well for me, and DreamFactory added a simple API layer so product could pull only vetted endpoints into the app.Bottom line: keep AI for design, but keep source-of-truth logic in the app with small, tested pieces.",

I started evangelizing Snowflake as the “single source of truth” which helped with adoption. Now we have a dedicated snowflake schema for each external integration so permissions are handled at the schema level rather than table level and all I have to do is create secure views when they request more. Another benefit that I have seen is that when you share via snowflake you tend to have more data that can augment the raw platform data. Imagine something like hubspot customer data being joined with product sales numbers. You suddenly have much more valuable context which leads to better insight signals.",

A lot of companies have several databases, BI tools, and ways the analysts are going after the data. AtScale plays in the realm of Trino, Denodo, and other virtualization layers that aim to provide a single entry point to the company data. That way BI teams and analysts are able to query data that could reside across many systems. They then add on additional benefits like governance, optimization, cataloging, and the like. In my opinion their current downside is the number of integrations they support compared to their competitors. Semantic layers really only work if they are the sole entry point, which is only possible if they can sit on top of all the company’s data sources.",

Write each user into SEPARATE ordered extents into S3.Step 3: Run a single historical spark job to rewrite the data into historical logs for each user in the order the tables were designed in. Select where id > 0 && id < step1.table_id_seq. Upload those to each users extents.All queries are now embarrassingly parallel, and you control the data, not Snowflake.If you are under 100TB you can do this in under a week with a handful of spot instances, S3 and just one engineer (yourself).These cloud vendors are literally selling shuffle debt as a service due to SQL destroying physical locality at ingest. Your cost will balloon and you will never get true real time unless you fix the locality problem at ingest.DM me if you want help (free of charge, I have nothing to sell you unlike these cloud vendors :thumbs_down:).",

When working with larger datasets both tools are expecting you to maintain near real time replicas in your SQL Server DBs.For your 3 SF Orgs with DBAmp you'll be using sf\\_Refresh and with SQL-Sales ss\\_Delta to maintain (for example):* ReplicaDB\\_Org1.dbo.Account* ReplicaDB\\_Org1.dbo.Account* ReplicaDB\\_Org3.dbo.Accountwhich will only pull the last delta (insert/update/delete) based off of SystemModStamp of a given object. When run frequently either sproc call runs quickly and has always been \"quick enough\" for what I need the data for (or just to define a nightly snapshot, but run quickly and not hours as it could do on larger objects). You have two additional options with SQL-Sales, which may help in your situation - (1) to work within the same DB with schema isolation so for example* ReplicaDB.org1.Account* ReplicaDB.org2.Account* ReplicaDB.org3.AccountWhen working with multiple SF sources (Orgs), it's quite handy sometimes to be working in just the one replicas DB Or (2) you can define a custom replica table name so for example:* ReplicaDB.dbo.Account\\_Org1 (Account from Org1)* ReplicaDB.dbo.Account\\_Org2 (Account from Org2)* ReplicaDB.dbo.Account\\_Org3 (Account from Org3)I've only used this feature when I've needed to have different column scope tables for the same SF Object in the same DB - but for your use case, you could go down this route I guess.To make the delta pulls more efficient (i.e. quicker) both tools allow you to filter the column scope of your replicas but personally I rarely bother doing that and just go with both tool's default all column option - unless you have some crazy wide SF object or huge textarea columns you want to avoid. That all said this would keep you in SQL Server by maintaining (SQL Server) replicas yourself but this may give you some alternative options in the short term while you plan this out.",

If you’ve locked things into fixed columns, you’ll eventually have to deal with schema drift and painful backfills.That’s why I prefer keeping the materialized layer in JSON. It’s still stored columnar in BigQuery, so you don’t lose efficiency, but you gain flexibility for evolving event structures. Then, if you need “wide” representations for certain use cases, you can always build views on top of the JSON (and even automate those views from your parameters table if you want).One other thing: I’d avoid using a dedicated “parameters table” as the system of record for what keys exist. That approach tends to push business logic into data tables instead of code, and since tables aren’t version-controlled like your dbt models, it makes changes harder to track or roll back.So in short: \\- JSON gives you resilience against schema changes and type mismatches. \\- Views let you expose wide tables when needed, without locking into a brittle schema. \\- Keeping the logic in dbt models (instead of a parameters table) makes it easier to track history and review changes.This way you’re balancing efficiency with long-term maintainability.",

I’d document exactly how you pin model versions, cache outputs, and trigger selective recompute when a dependency updates. Also spell out on-disk format (Parquet? chunking for video/audio), partitioning strategy, and how concurrency works with multiple writers. If you can export materialized columns to a lake format and register them in Glue/Unity, folks can still hit them with Trino/DuckDB/Spark without lock-in. Cost guardrails matter: per-function rate limits, daily budgets, and backpressure when queues spike. Finally, surface lineage and metrics (per-function latency, token/cost) so backfills don’t become guesswork.In past projects we combined Dagster for orchestration and LakeFS for data versioning, while DreamFactory exposed the final tables as secure REST APIs for app teams.Nail those details and this can replace a lot of brittle glue.",

There are two main challenges in migrating it to modern systems:* First - modern systems do not speak the language of structured datasets - so you will have to break it down into two parts - ingestion and transformation, and* Second - that typically there are a ton of infa mappings that companies have created over a period of time that becomes a pain to catalog and go through one by one - so bulk migration almost seems like the only way out.Thankfully there is a system that is fully capable of taking on Informatica mapping style pipelines - it is called tabsdata and is an on-prem system that you can run on bare metal or on k8s clusters on the cloud. Bottom line you own it and and run it. This system offers the pub/sub for tables model for ETL. Here is how you use it to migrate infa pipelines:* Step 1: for every input port in the infa pipeline, you create a publisher that reads the input table and creates a tabs data table.* Step 2: for every transform in the infa mapping, you can create a transformer in tabsdata that will take one or more tables within tabsdata and do your join/aggregate/filter etc.* Step 3: once you have created the curated dataset, you add subscribers to it so that they can be loaded into the target platform.While this sounds like more work than one-to-one migration of infa mappings, you will be surprised at the ease and reusability that this approach produces and that itself could cut the pipeline complexity and count significantly.

So we may have lookup values for some data points, perform further calcs required for systems. Recently I’ve worked on teams, which tend to not store raw data. When I look for frontend or Postgres articles I tend to find a lot of helpful design, architecturs articles. For ETL this seems to be more difficult to find So I figured I had some time today and would post on here to see if I could learn some new stuff from others or find helpful resources.",

We do very little with raw blockchain data, and when we do it is usually for ad hoc requests. Most of my time is spent on pipelines that help analysts understand user behavior, generate regulatory reports, or improve the exchange and app.Strong domain knowledge will help you stand out. Understanding concepts like order books, makers and takers, wallets, and slippage shows you can apply your skills in context. Solid data engineering fundamentals remain the core of the role. In terms of targets, I would look at exchanges (Coinbase, Kraken), payment gateways (MoonPay), and wallet manufacturers (Ledger).If you want to work directly on blockchain protocols, that is more of a blockchain developer path, which often means joining smaller startups with less structure and support.",

Use Influx Tasks to downsample 30s raw into 1m and 5m buckets, plus materialized views (per building/sensor groups) that your dashboard queries by default. Only hit raw for drilldowns. For tags, keep low-cardinality: orgid/buildingid, beamid, heightlevel, sensor\\_id; store temp/humidity/battery/rssi as fields. Avoid tags for anything that changes often.Live view: Durable Object broadcasts websocket updates from the latest aggregate point (not raw) at a fixed tick (e.g., 5s) to cap reads. Alerts: compute thresholds in Tasks and persist open/closed state in Cloudflare D1 or KV; you likely don’t need Redis. Long retention: dump raw to R2 daily as Parquet for cheap storage; analyze later with DuckDB/Spark if needed. Exports: precompute daily highs/lows via Tasks and serve from a tiny Postgres/D1 service.I’ve used Grafana and InfluxDB Tasks for rollups; DreamFactory helped expose REST endpoints over Postgres to manage alert state and exports without building a custom API.Bottom line: keep the pipeline lean with Queues, Tasks, and sane tags; precompute what dashboards need and costs stay under control.",

        "body": "Dataflow doesn’t auto-magically handle schema drift, you have to design for it. Additive changes are easiest: BigQuery accepts new columns if you enable schema updates, and in Beam you can represent rows as maps or generic `Row` objects instead of hard typed classes. If a column disappears, guard against nulls and missing fields in your transforms. Renames or type changes are trickier, treat them as add + drop and keep a mapping or schema registry to track versions.For API ingestion a simple GCP pattern is: Cloud Scheduler or Cloud Functions to fetch data, push raw payloads into Pub/Sub, run Dataflow for parsing and transforms, and land in BigQuery or GCS. That decouples ingestion from processing and gives you autoscaling and retries.Dataproc is worth using only if you already have Spark/Hadoop jobs or need complex iterative workloads. For most ingestion + transform pipelines, Dataflow is simpler.Schema drift across sources follows the same patterns. For APIs, expect variable JSON and parse dynamically. For files, prefer schema-aware formats like Avro or Parquet, or read CSV headers dynamically. For RDBMS, use CDC tools like Datastream and evolve schemas downstream when columns change.How often do you expect schema changes, and do you need real-time ingestion or is batch good enough? That helps decide how strict to be on schema validation. I work at Estuary, and we handle schema evolution in pipelines without the extra glue code if you want a cleaner option.",

If drift is occasional and daily batch is fine: run Dataflow batch, use Beam Row/generic records, enable BigQuery schema updates for additions, treat renames as add+drop and surface a compatibility view, and do type changes via new column + backfill. Always land raw payloads in GCS (Avro/Parquet) for replay. If drift is frequent and you need low latency: use CDC (Datastream or Debezium) to Pub/Sub, a streaming Dataflow job with a mapping table/versioned schema, dead-letter unknowns, and alerts. For APIs: Cloud Run/Workflows pulls -> Pub/Sub -> Dataflow -> BigQuery with idempotent MERGE and throttling. Dataproc only if you already have Spark jobs or need libraries Beam can’t handle well. I’ve used Fivetran and Datastream for CDC, and DreamFactory helped when we needed quick REST APIs over legacy DBs without custom glue. Pick strictness and tooling by drift frequency and latency.",

It gives you a clean way to organize pipelines (nodes + catalog + config), great for teams that want testable, modular data workflows. The data catalog abstraction is nice since it supports a bunch of backends, and tools like Kedro-Viz make it easier to reason about your DAGs.The tradeoff is you don’t get connectors or managed ingestion out of the box. You’ll be writing Python to pull from sources, handle schema drift, and deal with APIs or CDC. It’s more of a framework than a platform. For batch work it’s nice, but for streaming or dynamic schemas you’ll end up adding boilerplate. You also need something external like Airflow, Argo, or Prefect for scheduling and monitoring.So it’s great if your team is comfortable with Python and wants long-term maintainability, but not ideal if you’re hoping for plug-and-play ingestion. Do you want more control in code, or are you looking for a managed connector-style setup? That’s the real fork in the road.I work at Estuary, and we’ve focused on the managed ingestion side with schema evolution baked in, so if the Airbyte pain keeps getting worse that could be an easier alternative.",

The first push tends to be implementing the documentation and catalogging best practices, which allows teams to get the early benefits of a catalog. The challenge comes post-implementation where all of these stuff need to be maintained. This means that after every change to the tables, every new column, every change in team/domain structures, the governance steps need to be kept up-to-date. Someone needs to update lineage manually, change data quality rules, and make this a part of their development process.My suggestion after implementing a couple of these types of solutions would be to either have a very clear post-implementation maintanence process mapped out, or to look for solutions that would already integrate the governance within the rest of the development lifecycle.",

We felt it was at risk of becoming \"shelfware\" if we couldn't automate the upkeep.We then evaluated a few opensource catalogs, including Amundsen and DataHub, but ultimately, our specific needs took us in another direction. A huge chunk of our data is unstructured and lives in on prem resources. The challenge wasn't just cataloging a cloud data warehouse, but getting a handle on this massive, distributed file environment.We ended up using the integrated catalog that comes with our storage platform, DeepSpace storage. It was a good fit because its core job is to manage all of our on prem file storage. Since DeepSpace is already tracking every file for its tiering and archival purposes. There's no drift between the catalog and the storage because the catalog is the storage's metadata. Our resources lean onprom though, we may have gone a different way if we were primarily in the cloud.",

Wire alerts to Slack/PagerDuty via Airflow/Prefect and report weekly on incidents, MTTD/MTTR, and business impact avoided.For scraping, don’t just test pipeline health-test the data-generating process. Track price volatility bands by route/date, compare against third-party references (e.g., Google Flights/Skyscanner snapshots), segment by IP pool, user agent, and session length to detect “shadow pricing.” Keep a control feed (residential IPs, clean browser profile) and diff against production. Log lineage and sample rows daily for manual spot checks.For AI transforms, keep a golden dataset, define guardrail metrics, and do statistical sampling with clear accept/fail criteria; escalate drift beyond thresholds.We used Monte Carlo for anomaly/lineage, Datafold for diff testing during releases, and DreamFactory to expose stable REST APIs over source DBs so contracts stayed consistent across teams.In short: yes, make it fractional, start small, prove savings, then expand.",

Thank you!From an engineering management perspective, the issue with QA is that if you assign a dedicated person to it, there is an idea that data quality would take a hit, as there is a person now entirely responsible for managing the quality of the data. Engineers just write code; they are not responsible for anything beyond that. But from a management point of view, there is an idea that the person who writes the code is actually responsible for the quality of the results. So, even though I understand SWEs/DEs have a long list of things to focus on and things might slip, having a person dedicated to QA reduces the idea of ownership.Also, the idea about AI is true as well.

If I didn’t have a handful of structured courses to follow that explained programming concepts and language fundamentals through some simple projects, I would have given up. Not everyone learns best through code-along projects but they do have value for me. Obviously the quality of the instructor and code they write can lead you to good practices or bad practices so that’s important to keep in mind. If I jumped right into an idea I would’ve absolutely gotten overwhelmed, lost, confused, and put together a shitty project. It’s important to note that you’re early projects aren’t going to be great but you can save yourself a lot of time by knowing what a project structure should actually look like. I’ve been working for a few years now but I owe a lot of my knowledge to educators that took the time to explain concepts clearly. Building a few code along projects taught me a lot about how things are wired together and that was the most effective method of learning for me personally. I regularly reference old code from past projects when trying to do something I know I’ve done before. Having a couple of big project that follow good coding practices at the beginning helped a lot.",

It is like trying to do calculus when you can barely add two numbers. If someone wants to make a game without the foundation then they will most likely flounder about cause they are trying to start on step 10 where instead they need to start at step 1 (what language do you know, downloading an IDE etc...)But with the prevalence of AI, the barrier has been reduced down considerably. I condone the idea of 'vibe' coding ie copy/pasting what you see and not digesting (reading what the AI spit out doesnt count). But I do recommend asking thoughtful questions that are small queries to AI (how to do print statement, why is ('hello' + d) not working etc...). And when you get the response back, think about why it is telling you the error is happening. So if ('I said hello' + 10 + 'times') threw an error then the AI might respond you cant add a str to an int. Now think about why that is ie you are adding two incompatible data types (string, int) which should lead you to asking what kind of data types are there and why data formatting is important etc...Work on the proof of concepts, small building blocks first. Even if it is stupid like learning how to add two numbers literally on some scratchpad of your coding IDE that will help you on your journey. It builds momentum, confidence and skill so you know what to employ .Your first iteration will suck ass. The first 1000 line of legitimate code will suck ass. Don't try to be perfect. It is better to have something that can be recorded as progress and going from there",

It's way more fun, and you learn more as well.My general approach is: using online materials or books, read far enough to learn A Thing, then spend like a week mucking about with that Thing. For instance, you pick up your first book and learn how to do variable assignment, and print, input, and if statements in some language. I would then spend a month writing text games in Python using only those components. And then I would learn about loops and arrays and write a bunch of better games. And then I would learn about writing my own functions and make it better again.",

Like I had tons of friends in college who liked the idea of making software, working from home or making good money, but few of them liked reading docs, trial and error, and learning DSAs. Not saying you 100% have to like all these things, but if you are lacking, you better do them like you love them. Here’s what you need to do, even if you don’t like it.Leetcode is a terrible assessment of ability, but I do believe you could get up to speed in about a month of regular study, at least enough for interviews. Go to neetcode, learn the algorithms first for the section you are about to try, then go do them. 30 mins is your max timer, if you get there, look up the answer, and move on. At the end of your session go back and do the ones you missed. It took me about 2 weeks to get up to speed. Pick a language, and “master it”. What I mean by this is find a language you actually enjoy, who cares if it’s the most practical. Learn the basics, tips and tricks, become familiar with the standard library, build a pair with it, connect to a database with it, etc etc. roadmaps.sh is a good resource for what order to learn things. Being very capable in one language does help as you are aware of what is possible, then you can go translate it into another language. You like frontend? Pick 3 popular websites, and remake them. For each use a different frontend stack if you don’t know what you like. I’ll choose them for you, tailwindcss with svelte, bulma with React, and plain CSS with vanilla JS. Don’t stop until you have a working homepage and links. Add to GitHub and repeat. Obviously go expand on this as you go but these are starting points. Along the way take the time to explore and learn. Since it seems you’re still in school, get a tutor, join clubs, make friends to program with, go to hackathons, go to game jams, job fairs, etc etc. If you really want to do this, write down a plan that would make it seem silly if you didn’t make it and then go execute. Stop saying you like the idea and go become one. Cheers, if you want more specific advice regarding what to do let me know. Best of luck.",

Knowing how to open the file, write text to it, and then close the file.At a senior level, you know how to do all of that second nature and you've learned a few things, so now you also know that your string probably should have been converted to bytes because of project requirements and that depending on the language, you may have needed to flush the buffer before closing the file.You learn the patterns. You learn what the OPERATING SYSTEM requires and therefore you know that the language has to implement it in some manner, it's just a matter of finding the syntax.Yes it gets easier, but it's not because you're familiar with the languages, but you're familiar with what they MUST be capable of if you just know what to look for.",

I love and admire people who are so hard code programming—but based on my 30 years of experience—we programmers, software engineers, developers, (insert your favorite term here)forget several critical things: 1. coding and programming have absolutely $0.00 of value2. Nobody (paying client or end user) cares what language you use or how clever your code is (or pretty) 3. The only value of code and programming is ultimately what benefit or service it provides Now… there are good reasons why many people would argue with me about those three points—and they’d be wrong :) There a great reasons, from certain points of view, that all of the three things above matter—but please go into all of this keeping in mind that the result (of what you code) have value (usefulness) the code, by itself never does",

It's only considered bad to include excessive technical details that the end user either doesn't need to know (and won't understand) or shouldn't know because of a security concern. Beyond that, errors should be surfaced in the UI with a helpful user-facing message for the reason you state, so that the user can tell someone which error they're seeing. Codes are great, but often an error string will appear only once or twice in a codebase or error log, and we text search both to investigate the issue, so codes are often not strictly necessary.If it's expected that the user research the error themselves, possibly with reference to a certain resource, you should probably be outputting an error code.",

I personally was not interested in the steep learning curve required to draw digital assets, animations etc and so I build my games with a mix of free assets and some paid ones (cheap, like $20 for a bundle).

Start from a completely blank slate (not a half-blank slate), and do the problem again. Then, do it again, then again in an hour, then in a few hours, then in another day. Each time, you might get tripped up on something different, but you'll find that the problem gradually becomes more and more natural, and your understanding of the tools that you are connecting together to solve the problem, will increase.",

They don't explain that!\" Your goal is to say, \"How do I use this specific tool the best of it's ability and how do I know this tool's limits.\"In many cases courses are hiding aspects you don't yet understand specfically because they are not tied directly to the thing that course is tying to teach.A course on data structures won't be teaching you any hardware hacks, because \"data structures\" are the meta of how to store and manipulate data and while certain choices might work better on certain hardware, the course is about teaching the differences between data structures. Why a programmer might chose a linked list, or double linked list over say a binary tree.It's also about showing you ways to store data that are \"Worse\" or bad enough no one would do it so that you are learning the pitfalls about why we don't store data in an unsorted list. Instead when we add an element to the data we insert it in the sorted position to make searching in the future faster.* How to get out of tutorial hell? You just have to enough tutorials to cover: * How to select the correct pancake mix * Shipping it to your home. * How to mix batter * Errors that arise from licking the wisk * How to pour * How to use a spatula without flicking wet batter everywhere. * How to adjust heat on flame or electric stoves.* Once you have all the pieces learned you are leaving tutorial hell. The problem is that when you are in one tutorial, e.g. our spatula example, you aren't even aware of all the other steps that are being \"glossed over\" to teach you just that one aspect. * So you might learn spatula, and then heat, and think Why can't I make pancakes on my own yet! Not realizing there are like 20 more basic tutorial type deals you have to get through just to do that task.* In short I think tutorial hell is a by product of not having a good road map. If you are taking MIT's (Free) Open course-ware. You can look and see how many other courses you have to take to \"Get to the end\" the end being a certain level of education. * But even 4-year degree-ed under grads don't feel like they can step in and do everything. Because they can't. But hopefully they have the tools to lay out and study on their own and create a new plan to teach themselves what they need to accomplish some tasks. * But most of the time they are paired with a \"mentor\" at work that has struggled through the same things. What tools does the company use etc. And that person can give them the roadmap.",

So, I’ll answer from the perspective of being proficient.My experience is that becoming proficient in c++ takes longer than it does in Python. A lot of this is that c++ is a lower level language. You need to understand concepts that simply don’t exist in Python. You need to understand pointers and pointer arithmetic. You need a better understanding of memory management. Stack vs heap. Call by reference vs value. So many more. Sure, Python has its own things like decorators, descriptors, etc, but you can be proficient without a full understanding of them.Expect learning C++ to involve some core concepts, not just language semantics and common libraries. I wouldn’t say it’s “hard”, but it’s not a weekend project.",

A class bundles data and functions together in a container which starts to matter a lot when you have programs that do many different things​Like if you’re programming a game, you don't want 100 separate sets of data that you have to manually pass into enemy_attack() or enemy_take_damage() functions. It would be a nightmare to track. Instead, you make an enemy class and then you can create 100 independent enemy objects and each one will manage its own health and behavior.",

In fact, the guy who wrote the book on design patterns has since shifted into appreciating functional programming implementations. But remember the principles of OOP: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism. When you are writing code you know everything about what you’ve written, but you gotta think on the next person who might have to extend or use your code in some way. E.g.: I am implementing some logic where the variable “car_speed” should ONLY change when the operation “accelerate()” is executed. If I had them exposed then an ill advised user (coworker extending my code) might change car_speed directly and break my logic. OOP lets me abstract and encapsulate the logic and values. You have a class. It’s very explicit the values that it is concerned with and it exposes only the things others should be concerned. Then you have inheritance and polymorphism, those have to do with how blocks of logic usually repeat. Ideally you don’t want to copy and paste the same code many times, so it’s nice to have a framework on how the same logic can be repeated slightly differently many times",

It takes user input and then creates read/write text inputs based on the user input, and then puts them on the page so the user can then interact with them. A class made the most sense here because I could create a new instance of the class for every submission from the user, sanitize all input, build all the HTML, and do many other tasks, all very easily. If I were to accomplish that without using a class, it would probably involve a lot of spaghetti code and be difficult to understand. And I don't have to worry about keeping track of global variables, everything is encapsulated within the class. Getting and updating info is also really easy with a class.",

Write automated tests to interact with the ui and simulate what a user would do. Forget the stuff like devops and webhooks and whatever. Just focus on replicating what you do now. Doing this will help you build basic JavaScript skills. That right now should be your focus - just being able to do stuff in the language, it’s a run before you can walk kind of thing. Then you can start going deeper. There’s plenty of courses out there on every subject so I’d say pick a small area and focus on that. As a QA you probably don’t need to know more than the basics about docker and kubernetes, but things like APIs and webhooks could help you test more. So pick like a small subject area then expand. As an example you want to learn about APIs so break that down, let’s say you have a JSON rest api. Ok first look at the definition of rest. Then at api endpoints, each has a http verb and a route and will return a http response code. You don’t need to know it by heart but look at what response codes could be returned, look at which verb each route uses and understand why - then you can build test cases to hit each one, like what data gets you a 200 ok response vs a 400 error response and how can you make each happen. Keep a notebook with everything you hear that you’re not sure about and Google. And ask your team too, a good team will be happy to help you learn more.",

APIs are how systems are made to be interacted with, think the buttons on the remote of your TV. *A Philosophy of Software Design* makes some interesting points about API design, but I think you'll need to progress a bit more before going into it.Webhooks are just a call back address for inter-service communication, the only trip up here is how more complex ones are implemented in code, but I don't think this should worry you at this point - the gist of it is \"Here's what I want, call me back on this number when you have it\".For the rest, there's no specific order you have to learn things in, nor is there an expectation that you will instantly develop a deep understanding of any of these topics, as long as you understand how they fit together. Might as well focus on learning things that will help you be better at automation and save the deep dives for later1. TCP/IP, REST + others, if working in web2. Database basics, lock contention, ACID (if your work has you interacting/testing databases in any way)3. What does it mean to actually deploy something, what's going on behind the scenes (ssh, cp, configs, env vars)4. The basics of your language of choice, most common data structures (arrays, lists, maps)5. Once you're comfortable writing some code in the language you'll be using, go into whatever testing framework you'll be using (selenium?)No one knows everything, so I suggest focusing on things directly related to what you want to do and then slowly expand your knowledge out of professional curiosity and/or to upskill.",

Postman is perfect to start withIgnore Kubernetes, Docker, all that DevOps stuff for now.

Alongside that, learn core concepts like how the web works (HTTP, APIs) and a bit of Git for version control. Docker/Kubernetes can wait until you’re comfortable with programming.

There are so many technologies of different kinds.

Then, again 100% yes> Is learning how to code these Algorithms from scratch important? Then, the answer is rather \"no\" but not a 100% no, maybe a 50% one.It is generally helpful to learn to implement those algorithms yourself as it will deepen your understanding of them and give you programming practice.> Will you directly use this skill in professional work?Again a rather \"no\"You will most likely resort to the built in Data Structures and Algorithms of the language/libraries you are using and rarely have to implement your own versions, but there still can be cases where you need to.> Will you need Algorithms for Interviews?Unfortunately, yes. As currently LeetCode style questions are dominating the interview process, you will absolutely need solid DSA skills to even pass the interview to potentially get your foot in the door for a job.One thing to not forget is: programming is generally all about DSA. Knowing what to use when to use it and its advantages and disadvantages is absolutely essential.Knowing how to write your own implementation of standard DSA, however, isn't essential.",

Though, some interviewers seem to be looking for that skill for whatever reason.But in an interview situation, it's really hard to tell. Who knows, if I'm the interviewer and I have a fishy feeling that you're not \"up to snuff\" as it were, maybe I'll throw you a random algorithm question and see how you respond. And if you don't get the job, who knows, maybe you'll go off to Twitter or X or something and whine about how company Y wants people to memorize algorithms or something. Really? I don't think it's that simple in an interview situation.Personally I think you should be able to program an implementation of something, given a description of an algorithm. All non-trivial programs that we are making nowadays are essentially algorithms to solve problems for which we (almost never) have a truly complete specification. The \"Algorithms\" in algorithms books are simply smaller problems which have been studied thoroughly, for which complete specifications exist.For example, we know 100% what we mean to say whether a sequence is sorted or not, so it's easy to specify that a sorting algorithm takes a sequence for which that property may or may not be true and produces a sequence for which that property is true. Though even in that problem there are sometimes overlooked edge cases. For example, occasionally the difference between stable sort and unstable sort crops up naturally. If you have never studied algorithms, how likely is it that you would even understand the difference between a stable sort and a non-stable sort. Also how likely is it that you would know which algorithms guarantee stability and which ones don't?",

Intuition is knowledge you don't actively think about. It's implied. It's inherent to your thinking. It silently informs you and influences you. If you watch a master of his craft, any craft, you will see they make it look so easy. They don't \"just know\" better, it's not merely muscle memory, it's a career of lessons learned, and decisions made, and fundamental concepts wholly and completely understood.So a master developer can get cracking at code in an instant, whereas you might have to spend a lot more time trying to understand the problem and design a solution. The master can do it because all that understanding and design work? Yeah, they already did that - same as you, even for this very problem today, they just did the work 20 years ago...So you learn this stuff not because anyone gives a shit whether you can actually implement a binary tree in an interview. RARELY do we implement primitive and fundamental data structures ourselves.

If your URL contained a space, your `os.system` call wouldn't work correctly because URL would be split into two arguments. It'll also need to pop open a command prompt window if you're using pythonw.Stick with one of either `Popen` or `subprocess.run`. Preferably `subprocess.run` with `check=True` so that any errors that occur will get raised into exceptions. Using `Popen` directly is useful if you don't want the function to block while the program is running, so it's useful for opening a program for the user that will stay open for some indeterminate amount of time, like opening a text editor, the calculator, etc. (if this is your intention, do NOT use Popen in a with statement, just call it directly.) `subprocess.run` is probably what you usually want for command line utilities because you'll actually be able to see the results. There is also `subprocess.call` and `subprocess.check_call`, these are okay but the docs describe them as an \"older API\" meant for use by \"existing code,\" so I'd probably just stick to `subprocess.run` for anything new*also, `Popen` and `subprocess.run` will let you pass strings as the first argument like you can with `os.system`. Don't do this, because then you're back to that same problem you get with `os.system`. Stick to passing them sequences like tuples or lists, and don't use them with `shell=True`.If you feel like you have to hit the shell, you probably can work around it. One time I thought I had to hit the shell was for a cross platform way to run the \"default program\" for a file, via `start` on Windows, `open` on Mac, or `xdg-open` on Linux. However, the latter two are actual binaries and not shell commands so they can be opened via `Popen`, while the former has a dedicated Python function, `os.startfile`, so in all cases it is possible to avoid hitting the shell.",

IMHO good for training problem solving and debugging skills, as well as some logic (AND, OR, etc.).TIS-100 - Somewhat like Shenzen, but more simplistic. Has you program the fictional TIS-100 chip for various purposes. Uses an Assembly-like language.While true: Learn(); - Primarily visual programming, teaches AI and neural networking concepts.Grey Hack - Very nice hacking game where you can build your own exploits and helper programs. Uses its own scripting language, but does teach you problem solving and how to help yourself with code.Then there's the real kicker - try to program simple games in C# yourself while learning. One of my firsts was a simple hangman/wheel of fortune game that I made as a console app. Trying to render simple console stuff and text graphics is a good way to start out learning the fundamentals of graphics programming.Another good start could be making a simple 2D engine for a shoot-em-up, which can teach you how to manipulate graphics, make sprites and move stuff around. My first one back in the day ran inside a C# form using GDI - it was a b\\*tch to program, but included a very simple AI, parallax scrolling and some other neat stuff.Back in CS class, I had a semester project (actually two), that consisted of a tile engine running a sort of educational RPG. It was written in C# and ran on the now-dead XNA framework...It's probably the harder way to go about things, but it's something you can do as side projects while learning the basics of C# before moving on to Unity.",

This helps you learn how to use json objects and use list data structures. If you’re going to learn JavaScript I recommend learning TypeScript right after you feel confident enough with JavaScript. When working with JavaScript the compiler sees less and less due to no typing which can make runtime errors incredibly annoying to debug on larger projects.Other languages I think are great starts is C or C++ if you want to be forced to understand more about memory, or Java if that’s too difficult and you want to learn about OOP (Object Oriented Programming). It doesn’t really matter much where you start really as long as you don’t stop there, don’t just learn one language, any industry level programmer knows at least 4-5 different languages. Once you’ve made some projects in a language and feel confident with that language, move on, and then once you’ve learned a few languages if you plan to go into software engineering learn some popular tech stacks like MEAN or MERN.I know I said a lot more than you really asked for, but this is what I did and I can confidently say it works well.",

So the declarations `int x;` and `float y;` will both allocate 4 bytes of memory.But the *interpretation* of those bits/bytes is different depending on the type. So the compiler generates different code to work with them.For instance, the 32- bit pattern `00111110000000000000000000000000` represents the numeric value 0.125 when interpreted as a float, or the integer value 1040187392 when interpreted as an int. And if you want to do something like add the bit patterns representing two numbers, the logic for doing that will be totally different depending on whether they're ints or floats.So if you write the statement `x += 1;`, the compiler generates code to load the value of `x`, perform an *integer* addition, and store the value back into `x`. But if you do `y += 1;`, a *floating-point* addition is performed instead. (And the compiler is smart enough to automatically convert the integer constant `1` into the floating-point constant `1.0` so that the types are compatible.)So in general, the purpose of data types is to help the programmer (and the compiler) keep track of how any given chunk of memory is \"supposed\" to be interpreted.",

Every variable in c has an address in memory, and a single address can only hold 8 bits, or 1 byte - so when you declare a variable to be a `char`, the compiler knows that the address for that variable contains all 8 bits of the value, but when you declare a variable to be an `int`, the compiler needs to know that the address only contains one quarter of the 32 bits of the value, and that the remaining 24 bits are stored in the following three addresses.When you create an array of `chars` and try to get the seventh value with `array[6]` the compiler knows that is needs to add 6 to the base-address of the array to get the address of the value, but if the array contained `ints` the compiler would need to add 6\\*4 to the base-address to get the address of the value.If you are up for it, I'd recommend taking a look at the generated assembly code from your C program - for instance with Compiler Explorer at https://godbolt.org/. Try to write small C-programs using different datatypes, and see how the compiled code changes, taking note of the addresses (written as \\[rbp-4\\] or a different number, if you are compiling to x86) - it isn't easy to understand assembly, but you might like it :)",

Your view is very \"C influenced\", and C has a quite impoverished type system -- so you miss an important part of the picture.The type certainly determines how the compiler translates your code into machine code: how much stack space it allocates for the values, which registers it uses for them, which instructions it has to use, ... all these things.And at the level of assembly languages the types are \\*usually\\* (certainly with C in its current form) indeed for the most part erased (there are typed assembly languages and there still are some differences between certain data on common architectures, but generally speaking \"it's all just bytes\").That said: the principal purpose of types is to ensure the \\*correctness\\* of your code. Type systems are essentially logical calculi (in fact typed programs are in a very real sense equivalent to logical proofs), and in writing your code (with types) you build up a logical formula that the compiler then can reason about to some extent (which is ultimately what results in it reserving enough space for your data, using the right instructions etc). There's drastic differences in the \"power\" of those logical systems: with C you're very much on the weak side of things, which means types really are rather \"stupid\". Other languages go far further here, allowing you to encode way more intricate properties via types -- which then for example results in dealing with types that don't have \\*any\\* possible values, or that have values that have no size in memory at all \\[and contrary to what you might initally expect these types turn out to be \\*very\\* useful in practice\\]. (An issue with what you wrote is that `int` is not generally guaranteed to be 4 bytes, but that's more of an issue with C and many introductory resources.

They're binary values to the hardware, but they're whatever you interpret them to be (numbers, characters, something denoting true/false etc.) in your program.At the compiler level they're the primitive building blocks that language creators wanted to provide to users of their programming language, and they have the interface and semantics they define and build into them (e.g. String in Java appears quite different than char \\* in C, despite there being an array of character values somewhere in Java's String implementation).At the language user's level, whatever the language says you have. If it says that int will give you a 4 byte number (for example) then it will.So data types are basically a compiler/interpreter level construct that allows you to represent, store, retrieve, and often mutate, data in your programs. Beyond that it's up to the compiler implementer to define what you write, what you can do with each, what you can't. Often it's not specified how a type is stored underneath, because a programmer may not need to know in certain environments (e.g. browsers).",

Doing something is better than doing nothing.I don't know how much work you want to put into learning - but I've found that learning how computers work is by far the most important thing that makes everything make infinitely more sense. When I say \"how computers work\" - I mean things like the different components in your CPU, how the ALU works, how instructions are executed, how memory is allocated, how processes are managed by your OS - all those kinds of lower-level plumbing things. The problem isn't that you are not talented / smart enough - the problem is that computers are a giant clusterfuck of abstractions upon abstractions, and understanding what the hell is going on down to the electrical level takes a lot of time and a lot of learning, hence why coding might look & feel like \"magic\".TL;DR - If you want to *actually* become proficient, then start teaching yourself more about how computers work. Also I'd recommend just starting with Python and using something like PyGame to make a simple game. You will most likely never run into Godot in your life ever again.",

Learning a language is easy but learning how to program is hard the same way learning to use a saw is easy but being a great wood worker takes time. The language is your tool. Being a competent programmer is to change how you think. Which is something anyone can learn. You just have to be patient and be open minded and it will eventually start clicking. Break every problem down to tiny micro steps and tackle each one. Want to move a character? Well how do i read what button to input? How do I set the velocity of the character? How do I animate it? Three little problems from one problem that sounded small in the first place. Don't let perfection be the enemy of progress as a professional programmer i still look at my code and think I can do better. Body builders are never entirely happy with their figure and still want more muscle growth. The same thing happens in our brain with code. Even very successful games have had a history of terrible code. Pokémon sun and moon is a very famous example of poor project organization and I'm pretty sure eve online had to rewrite their engine before because of how much spaghetti was in it. It happens and you will learn with experience. Just keep making your games and more will clickAlso, I do want to address the anxiety here. If you go in to every hobby and skill wondering if it's for you and get analysis paralysis then you will never truly enjoy anything new and give it a chance. If you have a hard time addressing this i do recommend seeking help and learning to be more comfortable in your own head and getting some confidence",

But later idk what happened, i decided to learn c++ to. And then i watched some video and then I came to know that learning much languages isn't the real deal. But mastering any one of them is. But since I'm already in a half way . I have decided that lemme finish this. And will decide what I should to do further.",

While those areas may be growing, they're still a small niche. The idea of adding AI into literally everything is a fad that will probably disappear.Shitty 2025 AI toasters and ice makers are a fad. 2075 AI toasters and ice makers are absolutely a potentially legitimate product with staying power.The underlying tech is not going anywhere. It will normalize over time and disappear into the infrastructure. Same way microchips went from novelty, to places they had no right to be given their limited capabilities, to fully useful and effectively invisible infrastructure.In my view, AI and machine learning should be requisite courses for a CS degree, at least up to basics like minimax and neural networks. You’d be wise to take them as electorates for your understanding, if nothing else, even if you never directly use a neural network in all of your career.> The absolute most important thing you should do is not use AI to help with your coursework. There's been an epidemic of CS grads cheating their way through school using AI and they are ending up with a degree and no skills. Companies have no interest in someone with a degree who can't code without the help of AI. Don't let that happen to you.While this is all accurate, this advice is better framed as “don’t cheat yourself.” Using AI to help with your homework is fine. The problem comes when you pack it up and start playing video games after the computer did your homework for you, and you didn’t take the time to learn how to solve it on your own. It’s not the fault of the AI that you didn’t bother to actually learn anything. That’s on you.And the problem I have with blanket advice like “don’t use AI” is that **you’re missing out massively if you are not using AI for the purpose of self-learning.** Use AI as your personal tutor who clears up your misunderstandings, answers your “stupid” questions, and helps you understand complex topics, not a nerd that you bully into doing your homework. It can even help you with your homework, but your goal needs to be to obtain knowledge and understanding. You will progress much faster with AI than without it, if you’re using it competently.",

        "body": "Massively simplified analogy: You need to find the email of Professor Dan to beg him to let you into his full class next semester. There are a number of ways you can go about getting that:1. Ask your current CS teacher what Dan's email is. He says \"I don't know, Professor Smith might know though.\" So you go ask Professor Smith what his email is and she says \"I don't know, but Professor Stevens might know.\" You go ask Professor Stevens and she says \"I don't know, try Professor Jones.\" You keep going down the chain, each person telling you to go talk to someone else, until you reach someone who knows what the email is, and who knows how many people you're going to have to talk to and you just don't want to do that.2. So you realize that oh wait, you can just look him up in the staff directory and find the email that belongs to him. You know he's a CS professor so you can just start with the CS directory instead of scanning down from Dr. Aarons in Academic Advising, and you already know the guy's name is Professor Dan so you can just jump to D.That's basically the difference between finding something in a linked list vs. hash table In reality it's a bit more complicated:3. Suppose you go to the staff directory and it's not in alphabetical or department order -- it seems totally random. Also, it's split into 20,000 pages. So you have no idea where Dan is and you're thinking you've got to just work your way down, and you really don't want to do that. But then you see that the directory is maintained by the department weirdo Dr. Bryant. You go ask Dr. Bryant, who tells you almost immediately \"Dan? He's on page 56.\" You ask, astonished: \"You just memorized that???\" Dr. Bryant: \"Nah, I just multiplied the letters of DAN, so 4 \\* 1 \\* 14 is 56.\"4. You go to page 56, and sure enough there's Dan's bio and email. Problem solved! But then the next day you have a realization and go back to Dr. Bryant: \"Wait a minute, what if you hire another guy named Dan? Only one of them can be on page 56, your system won't work anymore.\" Bryant goes \"Uh..... wait, I know, his employee ID is 4LBA8F, and his ID is unique so I can just use that instead!\"5. Satisfied, you leave his office, then 2 minutes later turn around and go back in. \"But that's not gonna work either, what if you have employee 222 and 22B? Or 2BB? What about 6666, 666F, 66FF?\" Dr. Bryant says he needs to think about that.This is also massively simplified and obviously the actual calculations are more complicated, but that's the general idea: since your data is probably not going to be perfectly ordered, you need to come up with a function to map each item to a numerical value, and that value will be the index to the \"bucket\" of memory that data will go into. You don't want that function to come up with different values because that makes things complicated, but unless you have an infinite amount of space, it's impossible to prevent that completely. All you can do is try to limit how often it happens; there's mathematical theory for the best ways to limit that and various implementations for how to handle whatever collisions do happen.\"OK, why not make it ordered then?\" You could do that, but then you'll have to continually fix the order every time you insert new data, instead of just crunching a number for where to insert it. So if you're doing a lot of insertions compared to lookups, that may not be ideal.",

So a hash table is faster than a linked list only when there are enough entries that looking outside the cache will be slower. On a cpu, that’s about 100 to 1000 items. Tye point is that a linked list gets slower the more items you have. So, for that matter, does a binary tree. A hash table takes the same amount of time no matter how many items you have. So if you need to process or look up a few million items, hash tables are hard to beat. Plus, who cares about performance when you’ve only got a few hundred item?

A modern CPU will get through 1000 additions much, much faster than 10 levels of pointer chasing.The reason is that if you're waiting for one pointer to load you can't even start following the next pointer. Very sophisticated CPU caches do have the ability to notice that you're chasing pointers (they correlate values previously loaded with the addresses fetched) but that's most helpful if you repeatedly access shallow data structures.There just isn't much that can be done to hide memory latency when the data structure is really deep.If a linked list is the best choice it's probably because you need a LIFO or FIFO queue and search is rare.Other points in favor of linked lists* concurrent LLs (multiple threads will access at the same time) are easier than concurrent hash tables and compete with concurrent ring buffers* The objects you intend to link are members of some other data structure and the LL acts as an alternate way to access them. It's difficult to get these chimera data structures to work correctly, the simplicity of LLs helps* sometimes you really need O(1) worst case insertion time (if so you also need to prevent page faults)",

It's short hand for '\\*(pointer).item'But tbh, this doesn't look like a pointer issue on your part. Like, the code wouldn't change much if this were C++ code using a class or something. This code is pretty clear, so this is a comprehension issue, and I'm hoping you at least got told how a queue works before you got the slides.If you know what a Queue is, what's going on here is that your prof has defined a few functions that take a Queue pointer as input, and didn't tell you how they work yet. The prof has also defined a Queue struct, and hasn't told you how that was implemented either. Odds are, your prof intended you to read this and interpret it kinda like pseudo code. Or you didn't read far enough in his lecture slides to find the rest of the info. Either way, read the whole set of slides before jumping to conclusions.The Queue struct would seem to be implemented using an array. My guess is it probably looks something like this: typedef struct { int back = 0; // index of the last item in the array 'Datatype' val[CAPACITY]; // where we store everything in the queue. Can be of any type. } Queue;Then there's the functions he defined. In order:* int length(Queue q\\*) : Tells you how many things are stored in the array. Likely derived from Queue.back's index. * int isEmpty(Queue q\\*) : Tells you if length is 0. Either way, point remains: Ask your prof. This is what office hours are for. Or e-mail them.",

        "body": "At the root of pointers is understanding how a computer actually works. When a program is running, it has access to its segment of program memory, with each unit of memory (byte, word, dword whatever depending on architecture) having an address.The point of data structures is to store the program's data in memory in a cohesive structure that is fast for your usecase and lets you access it later. Data structures (and pointers) are the tools by which you manage memory for your program.You know that a pointer is an address to a piece of memory. Getting the value of the memory at that address is called *dereferencing* the pointer. Dereferencing uses the \\* operator. \\*ptr will give the value at pointer ptr.Your queue has an offset to the current last element (called back). This holds the offset of the address of the first free address of the queue. The function enqueue also takes in a queue pointer called q. To access the value of back, you would first have to dereference the queue pointer \"q\", then access its instance variable \"back\". Because dereferencing a pointer to an object to access one of its attributes is such a common occurrence, there is a special operator -> that does exactly that. If q was not a pointer to a queue object but rather the queue object itself, you would access back by doing q.back. but because q is a pointer, you do q->back.Pointers can also be *indexed into* meaning to take the address referenced by pointer p and adding the number in brackets to that address. For example if pointer p had the address 0x00001, then you could reference the value at address 0x00002 by doing p\\[1\\].To trace your code with all of this understanding is pretty simple. The function first checks if the queue is full (meaning a new element cannot be added) and simply returns in this case.If the queue is empty, set the first element in the queue to newData. The variable val is an instance pointer to the start of the queue. q->val\\[0\\] refers to the data value at the address at the start of the queue.back, as previously established is the offset from the base of the queue (val) to the next free address in the queue. To add a value to a non-empty queue, the code stores back in a temporary value, idx. The code then stores newData in that address (val\\[idx\\] is the same thing as saying val\\[q->back\\]), then increments back by one, ensuring that it continues to be the offset of a free address.",

As a tip for comments: Use docstrings [https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) In many IDEs docstrings show up when you hover over a function, do quickly tell you what it does. 4. In line 150, I would suggest using an object, or a dictionary to store the data, since it's closely related to each other. There will never be a case, where you want to keep the vitals of the old patient, but generate a new name for example. This could be done like this: class Patient(): \"\"\" represents Patient data\"\"\" def __init__(self, name, id, status, vitals, dialogue, is_expected): self.name = name self.id = id [...] [...] type_out(f\"Patient Name: {patient.name}\") You already seem to use a smaller version of this as a dictionary in `generate_expected_patient_list()`, so I think unifying both datastructure would be a good idea, especially if you want to develop this game further. 4.5: You also seem to use the exact same line of code `type_out(f\"Name: {p['name']}, ID: {p['id']}\")`quite a few times. This could be rolled into the class I suggested above, giving Patient a method to type\\_out their name and id. You would then use it in code as `patient.type_out()` for example. All in all your code is structured okay, but for better readability you could thinnk about moving the actions and the new\\_day part of your loop into their own functions. This might not look like a benefit in your codebase right now, but if your game logic gets bigger, like a few thousand lines of code bigger, your game loop really should look roughly like this: while True: new_patient = get_new_patient() action = get_player_action() handle_action(action) check_game_over(strikes) check_new_day(expected_patients)Anyways, good job for a beginner :) Keep it up!",

Many high-performance ECS systems represent entities as an Integer and map that to the set of components.I’m not sure if this is incidental or an intentional feature, but ECS can have components added and removed on the fly at runtime, and there’s not a huge amount of scenarios where that’s a requirement(plugin systems), and there are at least some where it’s an anti-pattern.

Keep components as plain data and systems as stateless functions. Batch adds/removes, avoid per-entity allocation, and use versioned IDs to prevent stale references. Start small: convert projectiles or NPC vision to an ECS-style loop and measure. For engines: archetype ECS (DOTS, Bevy, Flecs) is great for dense queries; sparse-set (EnTT) tolerates high churn. On “render-bound” games: servers and complex sims are often CPU-bound, so ECS helps there.AWS GameLift and Redis handled sessions and state for me, and DreamFactory generated REST APIs over Postgres for ops dashboards and tooling without me hand-rolling controllers.Bottom line: use ECS where data-parallel hotspots justify it, mix simpler patterns everywhere else.",

But before you even begin, you have a brief from your course on what needs to be included for you to pass and get the top marks.So what do you do? You break your brief down. You plan each section, you translate it all to what you need and now officially have a plan of action to tackle it.So why the absolute feck do you think coding isn't the same? Why aren't you planning? Why aren't you googling and using official documentation as reference? Why are you using memory!!!???? Like I said quit now. Because you understand nothing!!!

A few followups if that’s alright; First note: some of my questions may seem irritatingly dumb and I apologize for that as I’ve just begun my journey into learning programming and computer architecture:>It's not really a \"flaw\" in Logisim, it's just that doing a low-level simulation of logic gates is inherently more expensive than a high-level emulation of the same architecture. They're just doing different things.Q1) When speaking of “higher level emulation” vs “low level”, what do these terms imply?>For example: take a look at what a \"full adder\" logic gate circuit looks like. You need quite a few gates just to add two 1-bit numbers. To add 32-bit numbers, you would need an array of 32 full adders.>If you were to simulate this 32-bit adder in software, you would need to iterate over each of those logic gates, Q2)What do you mean by “iterate over each of these logic gates” (I know what iterate means but not exactly sure what it mean to iterate over a single logic gate)?>fetch its inputs, compute its output, and then pass that output to the next gate(s). Your simulation would need hundreds or thousands of CPU instructions to accurately simulate the behavior of the logic circuit.>But if all you care about is the result of the addition, you could get that with a single ADD instruction that's executed directly by your CPU, which would be hundreds or thousands of times faster.Q3)So the emulator he uses is emulating the logism circuit right? So doesn’t that mean the emulator at some level and up moving thru the same amount of logic gates?>In other words, if you're designing a CPU out of logic gates, and you want to make sure that your hardware design will actually behave the way you expect, then you need to use a slow, expensive simulation at the logic gate level. If you just want to model the desired behavior of your CPU, you can just write code that emulates what each CPU instruction is supposed to do, and that emulation can be much faster. But the emulator won't tell you whether or not your logic-gate-level design actually works properly.Q4) Ah ok sort of understanding like 1/3rd of the way now…so both are emulators - one is on logism, one is a “higher level”, but why does this emulator get to skip over all of the logic gates that logism musnt? Q5) And why does the guy’s actual processor itself get to skip over all of those logic gates that logism can’t?Q6) a final conceptual question if it’s OK; when does an emulator no longer get to be considered an emulator if it’s not actually proving your system “works” since it’s skipping tons of steps that actually need to be tested to be able to say your original circuit works? Are some emulators so far removed that we shouldn’t call them emulators? Like this one? Apparently the guy used the emulator to make it 1000x faster!!! There is no way the emulator acts at all like the logism right?Thank you so so much kind genius.",

Just to clarify, I'm not some kind of genius, this is all pretty standard stuff that would be covered in digital logic and computer architecture courses in a typical CS curriculum.To thoroughly answer your questions I would basically have to teach one of those courses, and I'm not going to try to do that. Instead I'll just try to clarify my previous comment a bit.You have to distinguish between the *simulated* CPU (the custom 16-bit design that the Youtuber you linked came up with) and the *real* CPU that is being used to run the simulation.A real CPU is made out of many millions of physical logic gates. All of those logic gates operate simultaneously. But they work together so that the real CPU executes one \"instruction\" at a time. (This is a massive oversimplification, but it's good enough for this discussion.)Let's say that the simulated CPU needs a few hundred logic gates to make a 32-bit adder. If you write a gate-level software simulation on the real CPU, the simulation will have to process each of those logic gates one at a time. So like I said, it will take many hundreds or thousands of real CPU instructions to *simulate* a single addition operation on the simulated CPU. That's what I meant by \"iterate\". The simulator has to go through each logic gate one at a time to compute its result.If instead, you write an emulator that runs on the real CPU, then when it needs to add two numbers, it can execute a single `ADD` instruction. Now, *physically*, that `ADD` instruction is still implemented within the CPU by many logic gates. But because those gates are real physical things, all operating simultaneously, they don't have to be simulated one at a time. They all happen in parallel. So the execution is much faster. (But the physical arrangement of the CPU's logic gates is fixed in hardware. You can't customize it the way you could customize a gate-level simulation that's performed in software.)I'm just using addition as an example, but the same principle applies to other things too. The 16-bit CPU has lots of other control circuitry that decides *what* instruction to execute at any given time. That control circuitry is made up of many logic gates. But the work that is done by a large number of logic gates can alternatively be implemented by a smaller number of CPU instructions on the real physical CPU, doing the same work directly, without simulating the behavior of all the individual gates.> And why does the guy’s actual processor itself get to skip over all of those logic gates that logism can’t?They're not \"skipped over\". But when you take the logic design that was being simulated in Logisim, and build it out of real physical logic gates, then those gates are all operating in parallel. So you don't have to wait for a software simulation to process them one at a time.----If you want to learn more about this topic, I would suggest going through the free self-guided [Nand2Tetris course.](https://www.nand2tetris.org/)",

My recommendation would be the *Godot* game engine (100% free) with *GDScript* as programming language. Plenty documentation, plenty tutorials, and a very welcoming community.If you want to venture outside game development, look into *Python* as it is a great starter language, high in demand, very versatile, multi purpose. In that case, start with the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki.\"Hard\" is debatable. Programming *languages* by themselves aren't \"hard\" or \"easy\". *Programming* is hard - but by creating things with Scratch you've basically already covered that base. Even though Scratch appears as childish, block based system, it is still real programming. It has every single fundamental concept of programming, only that it is presented in a graphical manner. If you are competent programming in Scratch, you have the programming *logic* down. Now, you only need to learn the vocabulary and grammar of textual programming languages (which is actually the easier part of learning programming).",

I think the hard part learning C++ is that it’s a huge language that, as I said, have changed a lot during its lifetime so it’s programming style have changed every 5 years or so, so it’s a moving target and will take time to catch up and keep up (Even Scott Meyers gave up).",

Why *specifically* do you want to learn programing? Is it to make video games? Or is it to automate business processes at your accounting firm? Or is it to hack your smart-fridge? Those are all vastly different skill sets, with different paths you'll need to take in your learning. Knowing what you want to do is so so important to making sure you're learning the right things.Once you've figured out (1) step (2) is a lot easier (still hard though!). Usually, step (2) starts with following one comprehensive course on the relevant programming language / framework / environment. Make sure it's a high quality, modern course on the topic. As you go, make sure you're doing exercises, and writing code independently to test that you're following along. **Once you've finished this course, you should have the \"vernacular\"** that you're talking about in your post. At that point, you can start building (small) projects.Oftentimes where people get stuck on (2) is that they jump around between too many different tutorials, they don't learn things on their own, or they don't focus on the learning that will actively help them achieve their goals. But doing a single, high quality course is definitely not \"tutorial hell\".People who suggest doing projects are right that the true, deep learning comes after you've taken the training wheels of a course or tutorial off. There's a lot of important and valuable struggle that comes from putting the pieces together yourself. But you really want to go into your first projects with a decent understanding of the fundamentals, otherwise it will be hard to see the forest for the trees.",

You get 80% of the benefit from just picking up heavy shit and putting it back down, and 18% of the remaining 20% from doing the easiest optimizations (alternating which muscle groups are worked + watching your calories).The obvious thing everyone can agree on but gets lost in the argument is that it's pointless to focus on your diet, get perfect sleep, and buy the right supplements... but never actually go to the gym.We can (and do!) argue on and on about if it's optimal to build projects, watch presentations from industry professionals, focus on languages versus abstract CS ideas, learn through integration or building from scratch, if you should focus on learning functional and declarative paradigms, philosophies of state management, keeping up with industry standards...... and the advice of \"go *practice*\" gets lost.Go. Try to build something. It'll be bad. You'll probably get completely stuck at some point. Research how other people solved the problem. Watch some tech talks or YouTubers, read a blog, whatever. Find a library that does the thing. Try again. It'll be better. Still bad. Rinse and repeat. Once you're in the swing of learning, building, iterating, *then* you can worry about branching out to new languages, picking up modern frameworks, etc...",

I come from a background with less STEM guidance that my peers so since 14yrs old to currently I have mainly bounced between \"intro to c++ programming\" \"intro to python programming\" etc courses, then jumped straight into projects as people usually advice, am completely lost on how to write a single line of code, watch a comprehensive clone tutorial such as \"make a 2d game in c++ from scratch\", of which I try to google each part of the code but end up reading documentation I don't fully understand or eventually encountering a bug I do not know how to address because I had just copied 4 hours worth of code without being given the underlying software architecture knowledge to dissect it. This continuously happens. Programming doesn't quite feel like a 1-1 injective mapping of learning basic syntax, basic computer science logic to making projects. I don't know how to find the in-between of software architecture, at the very least for specific fields such as data science or game programming. game design wasn't quite the word, and when I tried to google 'software architecture in 2d games' and ended up overwhelmed with the concepts of solid state machines and other topics that still didn't quite meet me halfway. I thought it was enough to just try to define an idea, break it down into specific pseudocode steps as much as I could then begin googling, but without underlying software design principles my pseudocode steps are often still gibberish, at least to the extent of googling, and asking specific questions for a project is a faux pas because I should be able to find analogous questions asked prior, but if I had the vocabulary to do that I would not be asking my niche, amateurish question.",

I find though after a year or 18 months at a new place you start getting the hang of things and improve even if you don’t see it yourself!I think you should give yourself time & try rest a bit more as with a burnout you struggle with focusing and thinking straight , I know I have that currently and struggle with basic tasks resulting in loss of confidence! If you can take like a semester break I would say take it or even two and rest for one completely and maybe do your own study in the second. Evaluate after that when you had time to rest rather than making rash decisions, I wish I could go back and do that! I’m currently learning basics of coding/css so can’t give you advice on that but I know if you did an undergrad you are more than capable !!!",

That's super normal.There's actually nothing wrong with doing that in code either - it's just that experienced programmers have learned that tight coupling of the classes in the source code tends to limit you and make future changes to the code harder.As one simple example, it becomes harder to write tests for class A or class B in isolation if they're tightly coupled. As another, it becomes harder to reuse class A in some other project without also pulling in class B, even if the new project doesn't need it.That's why it's considered a good practice to try to use interfaces to avoid direct dependencies.",

Using interfaces to obscure the dependency doesn't change the fact that you do have this dependecy. Purists will maybe tell you that such a tight coupling between classes is a problem with your architecture, but it's hard to judge without seeing the actual code. And in any case, we have functions calling themselves too, and there is even a pattern for such interdependence in low level languages: [Coroutines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine).",

As far as understanding code bases, is there no one left with knowledge of the code? That is a bad situation and I urge you while you are learning to code base to create some documentation on what you find. It’s obviously going to be some sort of living document since you are figuring it out but maybe it will help the next person assuming you don’t reach your goals. Unfortunately context around why things are the way they are is some of the most important stuff, if there is a commit history you should be able to start there to see feature additions, which can give you a good idea of what does what.

Since you have an Arduino, you could start with a simple programme that uses the Arduino to control an LED.Here are some things you can try in order:- Make the LED switch on after a second (a basic \"Hello World\")- Make the LED flash on and off (teaches loops)- Add a push switch to the circuit and have the switch cycle the LED between on and off states every time you push it. (teaches you events)- Use the push switch to turn a flashing LED on and off (combines events with loops)- Add multiple LEDs and build a binary counter from 0 to `n` (teaches `for` loops specifically)- Pushing the button resets the counter.- Add a second button that changes the behaviour of the LED (e.g. switches between flashing and counting; teaches functions/separation of behaviours).Everything you do with the LED, you can do with a servo, relay, transistor, or anything else that can be connected to a circuit.Once you've worked out how to control output with a button, you can think about using different kinds of input, like using a thermistor to react to a temperature change, or an LDR to react to light levels.",

It's kind of hard to track what is actually running in production with your current setup. You don't have any kind of versioning, immutable artifacts. You can't really roll back since you can't really be sure the build is reproducible. Your server is doing multiple things, not running stable artifacts. So obviously your setup isn't really something that would be used in production/professional settings. But if it's enough for you that let's say once a day your server might be updated with new code assuming there is something new in the repo, the cronjob doesn't fail etc. then cronjob keeps it simple, so why not if some or none of the concerns with the setup really matter to you. I'd probably at least consider doing it properly, for experience and learning purposes if nothing else. But if that's not something you are interested in, do it quick and dirty with cron.",

That said, if this is a production project, it will eventually be a good idea to run tests before deploying and proper workflows will scale to that more easily than an ad-hoc script.I would not recommend the cron approach, because it bundles multiple changes together into a single unmonitored deploy. Usually people will either do continuous deployment, where every merged commit is automatically verified and then deployed immediately, or they will do manual deployments where post-release validation can be performed. Opinions differ, but I’m in the camp that says continuous deployment is better if you have the level of automated testing and monitoring needed to make it safe. Deploying one change at a time makes it easier to determine what caused breakage when it occurs.With a cron job deployment you’d get the worst of both worlds. A bunch of changes would bet bundled together, making error tracing harder. You probably won’t be verifying the deployment after it occurs, because it’s on a schedule. And it won’t be immediately clear what changes are deployed or not at any given point in time, which can be very frustrating in practice.",

I might have been misreading a lot of articles assuming that artifacts were things like logs or intermediate files, things produced by production instead of the production code itself.But if I should be deploying the images themselves, then Github having its own VM to do that building makes more sense.

I spend easily over 50% of my time programming over pens and papers, not the computer. And the rest of that 50% isn't even all spent typing. If you really want to optimize typing speed though, I would forego both layouts and go for a programming-specific one. There are layouts that put all important characters on the home row with modifiers (brackets, semicolons, etc.) It's even more comfortable to type than the US layout. I never did more than play around with that though, because IMO, it's really not that big a deal.",

WebKit gets around 40 commits a day currently, so if you start working on WebKit and it takes you a month to get something working, by the time you're done WebKit will have had 1000 commits and you'll probably have to fix a bunch of things to catch up.I just saw that you're aware of the WinCairo fork that provides MiniBrowser. I'm afraid that's all you're going to find. I thought you wanted to build your own browser? If so, MiniBrowser is a perfect place to start - a working bare-bones browser with a clean slate so you can build whatever you want on top of it.If you want a complete browser with modern features to extend and modify, that doesn't exist on Windows based on WebKit right now, as far as I know.",

Pretty much every problem you'll have as a programmer starts with \"I have no idea how to solve this,\" so it's really important to get used to that feeling and develop strategies for what to do next.Usually, the first thing to do is to make sure you understand what the problem is asking you to do, and then every step after that is \"break down the problem into smaller problems until you know what to do.\" This is the big skill your assignments are trying to help you develop.Don't feel bad if it's tricky now. It's supposed to be. You're learning a skill.",

        "body": "This question is so extremely common nowadays that a simple search through the subreddit would have given you more than plenty answers.When you get an assignment, don't directly start programming. **Plan** before program. Sit down with pencil and paper and work over the assignment. Analyze it, break it down into steps. Solve each of the steps **your** way, don't even think about programming at that stage. Track the steps. Once you have a working solution, test it. Then, when the solution is confirmed, start *implementing* it in code. Ideally, when you've done the breakdown right, the code should come naturally. Use whatever you can think of: bulleted lists, flow charts, pseudo code, anything to write down what the program has to perform.Code is the end, not the beginning. Analysis, breaking down, planning, solving are the beginning. Code comes later.Just *reading* completed code will not help you building the ability to solve problems. Reading code is like looking at a complete car in order to learn to design a new car. You miss everything important: analysis, decisions, considerations, compromises. You might get an understanding of the *immediate* solution, but not the skills to apply this to even slightly different situations.Build your own projects starting from something as small and simple as Tic-Tac-Toe and working your way gradually up to larger and more complex. Yes, this will take time, effort, determination, discipline, and patience, but that's the way to go. Not the easy road to use google, AI or tutorials for everything.Programming is lifelong learning. It takes months to build up basic competence, years to obtain some proficiency and a lifetime for expertise.-----About your task:> i had to create a license plate checker which would output valid or invalid.Well, not much information you give here, but still:What do you need for your program?+ You need some form of getting the license plate - user input+ you need a place to store the license plate - variable+ There are some rules that you need to follow (which you haven't told - so, I'm blind guessing) + most likely, you will need to extract each character from the license plate - you will need a way to split the entered data and a store for it - maybe an array - could just as well be that you only need to loop over each character + you need to perform some action with the character - maybe some summing, multiplication, etc. + At the end, you will get some checksum or some indication+ you will need to verify that indication (conditional)+ you need to output valid or invalidThat's the way to break down a problem. The more detailed you do it, the easier it will be to implement the code.-----I'll leave some comment from a [former, similar post](https://redd.it/1mhcd21) here:Honestly, most of it is down to practice. Use sites like [Exercism](https://exercism.org) for ample practice exercises.There are several books commonly recommended:+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles PetzoldAnd finally, I'll leave some of my comments to previous, similar posts, as this is a very frequently discussed topic:+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j9ezmx/getting_better_at_coding/mhdna2e/+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1iz7wv3/how_to_become_a_better_engineer/mf10qbg/+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j3w7x9/how_to_actually_learn_problem_solving_skills/mg3q9ya/+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ioehwa/struggling_to_put_together_my_own_code/mcirhxq/+ https://redd.it/1jyd36k",

I've seen scenarios where junior engineers see code that's organized into many classes and think it's convoluted, but when they actually try to simplify it, they realize that the devil is in the detail and simplifying isn't as easy as they think - separating responsibilities so it's easier to test, handling edge cases specific to hardware that is a bit easier to read by spreading it out into a class rather than tons of nested if-else, etc. I've also seen code bases where people tried to anticipate too much early on and try to build in a ton of flexibility through interfaces and such, but that after a year or two, a lot of it becomes obvious that it's unnecessary because of now-known product direction. Not sure which camp of \"this is too complicated\" what you're seeing falls into.",

All the work has moved up an abstraction layer, so to speak.- There is a huge skill differential between programmers, and people were erroneously claiming that anyone who could fizzbuzz or write a select statement could get a job, even though this hasn't been true for years.

By the time I started AI wasn't out just yet and I was learning Python, C++ and Java. Let me just tell you how disheartening it is now that most of my simple ideas and projects are capable of being done by a prompt rather than the hours it takes to study, understand the material, research libraries and cross reference other methods in order to create some code. I fear that the kind of jobs I wanted to have won't exist by the time I get out there. I enjoy trucking but there is no industry that AI will not touch. My employer has implemented a camera in our trucks that already use AI and it's capable of detecting our eye movement to know if we are distracted, drowsy, and tracks our following distance, speed, braking, turning and any other metric you could imagine to gauge the competency of a truck driver. Then gives us a score and compares us to other drivers in the fleet. I dislike it but it's the future. I hope you find the job you are looking for but this is the end of an era and the birth of something we cannot stop nor fathom the implications and what will be on the other side of this.

The not-so-clever jerks end up being a jerk to the wrong person and their career soon goes down in flames. For example, I saw one get fired in the last few months. Another ended up getting his career stalled out and leaving: key people didn't want to work with him, and so he couldn't get assistance when he needed it. Eventually even the clever jerks will pick the wrong time and place, and see their career stall out. What you *don't* see is how much further they would go if they *weren't* a jerk. That Staff Engineer might be a Principal Engineer if they were more enjoyable to collaborate with. The Senior SWE might be a Staff or Lead SWE.

The fear of the online and offline world judging your every parenting skills and then having the fear of being lambasted because you make 1 mistake out of a million times when your kids usually don't \"misbehave\", its tough.All I can say is, yes being a good developer who can code and everything is fantastic to have. Have you had one to ones with your seniors or bosses recently? One thing that came out of a meeting I had with my boss, when I said I was shocked at how good the new hires were compared to me (3-4 yoe) and my boss remarked that if I felt that way, what the company saw was that I am a really good person to have in meetings, in projects, who could understand the scope needed for a project, who could bridge communication between stakeholders and developers, and people just felt knew that I was like a go to person when there was help needed etc.If you can, do your best and find ways and opportunities to develop your coding skills.

Many people are afraid to ask dumb questions too often as it can make you seem too dependent on the other engineers. But these days honestly you can try talking to an AI about technical details. Most software design and architecture is very well understood and the AI can easily walk you through design questions and help you understand any parts that don't make sense so the next time you have a discussion you are more clear about what is happening.Just a month back there was a discussion at work explaining a mesh network setup for one of our products. And my networking is super rusty. An hour conversation with the AI and I was following their mesh design much more clearly and asking their team good questions, not the dumb ones where I was unaware of basics or some lingo. Most designs in software aren't super novel or deviant from knowledge the AI has.The AIs can still lie so I do recommend double checking it's statements if you are going to put your reputation on the line defending a claim it made. But I feel like there has never been a better tool to help drill down on some \"dumb\" questions we all have.I will say I am generally perceived as very good at my job and I love software and design discussions. I am totally not immune to feeling stupid or inadequate. Especially on newer projects. Imposter syndrome creeps up on most people unless you have a godly ego. So it's hard to say how you feel really equals no hope of reaching senior in your current role. Also I don't do side projects. Clearly they are great if you can. But software is just a job and I love my kids more than I love my work. Most people I work with take this stance. I put in extra time to make sure stuff works during crunch time. And I do occasionally enjoy software arch videos on YouTube. But otherwise I enjoy my family and my personal free time. Don't let people make you think you have to give up a decent work life balance.",

Things with my classes worked out weird to where I had to either graduate early or wait a year for a class so I opted to finish early by taking a few extra classes. I had to stay at my job at the time for 6 months after I graduated to get my pension and I figured I’d be fine since the market was decent. I graduated right when the market started getting rough of course as that’s how things usually go. After that I waited 6 months for my vesting and then started looking. What I did do however is stay current with things, I went out and got some certs and made a home lab. No one seemed to care about when I graduated and after I got my first job it really didn’t matter",

It's difficult to tell the difference between early career and experienced commenters, and good advice is often counter intuitive. There are two pieces of bad advice I am constantly trying to correct. First is learning more skills won't lead you to being overworked. People complain about the rising popularity of full stack development. They say they refuse to learn frontend or backend because that will just lead to your employer expecting you to do two jobs. That's not true. Learning more skills will make you more efficient at your job, saving you time. It will also make you more competitive on the job market, meaning it will be easier for you to find a job with good WLB. There's more than enough dedicated frontend or backend work. If an employer is going to overwork you, they're going to do it regardless if you know full stack or not.Second is becoming more senior destroys your WLB. That's again not true. The things that destroy your WLB are getting a senior title before your ready and getting a senior title at a mismanaged company. Some people get thrust into a tech lead role 3 years into their career. These people are usually stressed AF because they don't have the experience to do it effectively, and the fact that they were promoted means the average level of experience is lower then theirs. That means they're going to be even more stressed trying to bail out all of the people on their team, because they also don't have the experience to do their jobs effectively. Don't try to avoid promotions. Avoid premature promotions and take on a senior/tech lead title when you feel comfortable you can do the job in <40 hours per week.",

In a case such as this, yes, the H1B worker is paid less. 2. Non-contract worker: Many companies in the US, including all the FAANGs, directly employ foreign workers.

        "body": "Hi, I work with a bunch of H1bs at a reputable software engineering company. Keep in mind that my answers are going to be based on visas from a company that does follow the spirit and letter of the law. There is not a direct pay gap between H1bs and regular employees who are hired at the same level of experience. However, H1bs have much less _leverage_ to negotiate their position particularly as the years go by. This doesn't necessarily lead to them getting underpaid relative to other employees, but it means that they're more likely to accept worse conditions or volunteer (or be voluntold) for work that they might not have to. This is especially bad for people who have to wait a long time to get a green card.Additionally, if you've worked in tech for a while, you'll know that usually the best way to increase your salary is to job hop, and staying at the same company is not typically rewarded- I will get a 7% payrise this year, but I know that if I could switch to another company I'd likely get a 20-30% payrise. It's harder to switch companies as a H1b, so their wages will grow slower than peers in their industry.Companies are required to go through certain steps in order to sponsor a H1b to prevent harming the local economy that a worker is being hired into, the LCA. The LCA effectively requires paying the potential employee the higher of the prevailing wage for the area for the job of that employee, or what that employer would pay other employees with similar experience. Some H1bs do get paid less (but not where I work) because they are a H1b. There are some companies out there that essentially offer you relocation to the US as a job perk and may not pay you well - WITCH companies, mostly. These companies don't have much interest in fair working conditions and will offer relocation to the US to people who I would consider vulnerable, mostly Indians, and will preferentially hire Indians, especially from similar castes as the hiring manager.And, obviously, when you have more people competing for the same position that nominally drives down wages. However, the companies that abuse this system - WITCH companies, again - never intended to hire an American to do the job. An American job is not being displaced by a WITCH company hiring an Indian (although it _is_ still abuse of the H1b system).Simplistic gut-feeling analyses on \"increasing supply\" affecting wages fall short because they don't take into account a whole bunch of things, not least that a more productive economy with more workers generally leads to more job opportunities in the economy as a whole. As an extremely simplified example, a software shop being set up in a city might prompt a starbucks branch being built nearby to capture the market of higher paid engineers, that might otherwise not exist, which means that the hiring of some engineers (of which some might be H1bs) leads to more tax revenue for the locality as well as more job opportunities, just not _the same_ job opportunities. This is why, in general, immigration is viewed as a positive for the economy",

I was paid fairly, but since getting a Green Card took quite the wait, I couldn't just change jobs as I wished without some danger between the time I got PERM vs the time I became an \"applicant for adjustment of status\" (ie, my priority date was due). It was a long time ago, when there was a huge backlog for all countries, not just India and China. So after my green card arrived, i started being able to climb the ladder towards top companies 1-2 years at a time, getting significant raises every time. I was making double in 4 years.Also note that when you are applying for permanent residency, you get labor certification for a certain job description. Moving that job description upwards is kind of risky, as you would not be doing the task you got the certification for. So it might slow down your growth anyway.None of this would actually be relevant if the path from H1B to permanent residency was remotely reasonable. But it isn't, and I can't imagine congress actually wanting to change it.",

This isn't a big deal if you're actually an expert with in demand skills because there will likely be other openings. However, if you're just a general software engineer in the current job market, you're going to work more hours or take on extra responsibility to avoid having a 60 day count down to going home.The whole premise of the H1B program is to help with situations where we don't have enough qualified people to fill a certain role. When it's used in those situations, it doesn't hurt anybody because H1B holders have enough career mobility to avoid getting underpaid or overworked and US residents won't get pushed out because visa holders are filling a gap, not competing with US workers. If we grant 2000 H1B visas to MDs who want to work in the US, that's fine because we have a shortage of doctors and those visas will benefit the H1B workers without negatively impacting US workers. If we grant 40000 H1B visas to entry level tech workers, which already face high unemployment rates, that not only goes against the goals of the H1B program, it makes the job market worse for all workers involved. Some H1B holders will earn less, some H1B holders will be forced to work under unfair conditions to keep their visa status, supply will exceed demand causing wages to drop, and US workers will have to either accept the unfair conditions or get replaced by an H1B holder who will.Under paying H1B visa holders happens at some consulting companies, but even at companies that pay them the same wage as US workers, it's a problem when the system is abused.",

I lack formal education and am in a rural LCOL area. Especially reading this sub I have developed even more extreme imposter syndrome and anxiety about losing the job and never finding another tech job bc of competition and industry trends. who knows I could get exited from the industry before I’m fully ready to leave anyway, so I need prepare and plan accordinglyI have personal traits that lead me to burn out, and that’s in any job I will ever have so I need to address that if I’m going to last doing anything. My current plan is to stick it out another 7-10 years in tech. If I can do that, without lifestyle creep, I will pay my house off and be 100% debt free and will have been able to sock away a decent bit of cash toward retirement and toward investments I could potentially draw some interest off of. THEN, I can work literally whatever job I want. I will need to bring in some nominal standard income but I could certainly stand to lose my tech level wage. It’s the plan that feels most plausible and future proof both from an industry perspective and just how long I can put up with this career field. Im pretty tired of it My advice to fellow burnouts, make a goal and an exit plan. Having the goal for me has been extremely motivating in the short term, and you can always continue working in it after if you have a change of heart. Just know if you exit, weigh the re-entry cost if you think it’s at ALL possible you’d ever want to come back.",

However, many of the people I know in tech also seem happy, and I caution people in the field against assuming the grass will always be greener on the other side. For example, a lot of the complaints people on this Reddit often echo—annoying/incompetent managers, unreasonable deadlines, leadership with no vision, etc.—are present in virtually every industry; I got lucky with the partners and senior associated I worked under in law, but others at my law firm would routinely get screamed at by partners for minor issues.",

        "body": "I live in LES ( a neighborhood in NYC). 120k sounds good very good entry level and fintech is a good space to be. Almost every major fintech has an office here and its the 2nd largest tech hub. It also is the largeast finance hub. Also NYC the sky is the limit so you can really use this as an oppurtunity to spring board.Its very likely you will be making double to tripple what you are currently making within 5 to 8 years.What life style is like in NYC at that salary? 120k in NYC is around a 6500 month net salary (due to city taxes).1. If you want to live somewhere fun for singles in their 20s, you would need to eitehr pick between living alone, living somewhere nice with roomates. You'd qualify a miximum of 3k a budget rent and at that price you can live alone. But you have to choose between living in a nice apartment in jersey/outer areas or in a pre-war shoe box in the nice trendy neighborhood. Nice in NYC is 'mid' in other cities. Its usually means you have a building with some amenities like laundry room or laundry in unit (rarer) and a dishwasher. NYC is a story of under consturction. Most apartments here are 100 years old (prewar) and lack modern conveniences like laundry, dishwasher and central AC. I picked the shoe box, its more fun to be in a good neighborhood if you like to go out and party.2. A lot of people your age would choose to live with roomates in order to be in a nicer apartment in a good location. Generally apartments are a lot mroe cost effective in a 4 bed 2 bath or 3 bed 1 bath situation. If a studio in an apartment building is renting for 4000$, there is a good chance the 3 bed is only 8000$ and the 4 bed is 10,000$. So a very common strategy for young professionals is to just have roomates to live in a nicer apartment in a fun location.3. You can afford to live alone and somewher nice, but it would generally be in outer neighborhoods that are either gentrifying or in places like jersey city, a part of New Jersey that is connected by Manhattan via a subway called path.The biggest cost in NYC is rent. Almost all of the cost of living is real estate. That effects things like entertainment and other stuff, because bars/coffee shops/ restaurants and gyms are paying even more per sq feet than you are. But outside of that the cost is the same its not like Amazon charges more here when they are deliving goods to you. Groceries can be all over the map, but trader joes generally is cost effective as they use national priceTo give oyu some idea what prices are like. Manhattan (you can take off 20 percent for other areas1. Hair cuts 40 to 75$2. Gym depends on which but 50 to 300$. 125 would be mid-tier3. Fast Casual lunch 15 to 20$4. Street food from a take out only operation 8 to 12$.5. Specialty Coffee from a cafe (6$ - 7$ before tax)6. Dinner at sit down casual restaurant with a waiter 40 to 80$ per person. You can easily spend 150$ per person at more upscale. This is assuming no alcohol.7. Alcohol 6 to 10$ for beer, 10-20$ for wine, 16 to 25$ cocktails. Non-alcoholic options will be offered at most bars. NYC has a BIG drinking culture. Tech community in particular has a lot of happy hour networking and social events that they host through apps like Luma, Posh VIP, Super Momos, Partiful. So even if you don't drink a whole lot, its in your interest to go to bars and get some non-alocholic drinks.8. Ubers 20$ per mile in Manhattan south of 96th street, 10$ per mile in Brooklyn/Queens/Bronx without manhattan entry.The other thing thats nice about NYC, because the city is so expensive you won't have pressure to be extravagent which happens in middle cost of living cities. This is a place where people who make 300k a year might live like college students and no one would bat an eye.TLDR: 120k is a great salary for someone your age in NYC in the fin-tech space. You will ahve enough money to go out quite a bit, save adequately for retirment and you can essentially pick where you want to live. It is a place where you will need to budget some and not be extravagent, but you can enjoy some luxuries. From a career perspective its also great, the only city that is better for Tech is SF and NYC is good at multiple industries. Fin-Tech space there is always the option of just transitioning into tech roles in finance and NYC is the capital of finance. You can basically live your best life.",

The work I do is already algorithmic in nature so studying leetcode isn’t really worthwhile since I’m basically doing it at work. If you don’t have a job (and therefore no one to pay you to learn) then I would say work on open source projects or start your own project that is related to your field/industry of interest and try to build something meaningful and interesting.",

Obviously as a SWE, you deal with all those on a daily basis, but confidently answering 101 + 201 questions are very important in setting the tone for the interview. went through my resume bullet points and wrote down about 2 pages per bullet point going deeper in to depth, answering questions like \"how was this metric you put defined?\" \"go a little deeper in the hardest parts of this problem\" \"give a 30 second pitch on how it was implemented\" etc. Had 1 page written per sample behavior question - \"how do you handle technical disputes - any examples?\" \"how do you normally approach a new technology\". Stuff like that -- not to memorize, just to kind of find the rhythm of your own answer. Find something non-work related but technical and have it in your back pocket for when someone asks \"and how do you stay on top of technical trends?\" - i found in my interview process there is a big difference between \"I try to find ways to learn on the job\" and \"yeah I'm interested in learning about WASM, I have a couple of data-visualization projects I mess around with when I have time, etc\" and have actually put a few hours in to so you have made at least 1 technical decision you can talk about on it. It doesn't have to be something crazy - just something that shows you aren't a \"in tech for the paycheck\" type of person (which I personally find completely acceptable - but some hiring managers don't) I have found in my experience that, at least at this midlevel in career, most interviews are just a \"remix\" of stuff you've done in the past -- there is probably enough stuff in your career to mine for experience to be able to handle a system design interview without too much prep -- you just have to sit down before hand and think about all the problems you have done from a bunch of different angles.",

Then I go back and implement the solution, try to do it from memory from the video and then come back to the same problem the next day. System design questions I paid for hellointerview premium, and used the guided practice. I’d go through the practice first and obviously it wouldn’t be perfect, but afterwards I’d read the solution to see where I went wrong and why. The why here is important since tradeoffs is a big talking point in SD interviews. I think I ended up doing around 75-80 leetcode questions before stopping since i got some offers. I know it’s not a lot but I think going through neetcode courses gave me a solid enough base to figure out questions during interviews, although I only ended up doing like 3 interviews. Luckily only was asked one or two hard questions",

Though a lot of people don't even make it to the conversation/interview stage.The projects one is tricky because I am seeing a lot of interviewers say they don't look at projects/github, while others saying that it's vital. To me, if I was checking through tons of applications, being able to quickly skim someone's portfolio and see some projects they have made would be helpful to quickly filter applications. So perhaps it's important for getting past that initial stage so that you can get an interview.I come primarily from game dev where it's absolutely vital to see projects you've worked on if you want to get an interview.",

Everyone feels like they have a good handle on the requirements and tasks that need to be done. You have a clear map of what needs to happen, and the dimensions the code needs to be flexible in. Maybe you've even been around on enough projects to know that if you invest time upfront, you'll be set up for success later when it's a time crunch, so you might work a little more to keep everything nice and clean and documented. Then, the inevitable comes. Either some requirement changes, or maybe there was a miscommunication - but whatever the case, that nice timeline and architecture you had in your head gets absolutely wrecked. All the time you spent making sure the code was flexible in X, Y, Z directions ends up just being more refactoring, and undoing to get the code into the state it needs to be in to pass unit tests, or meet requirements. Now, it's not about writing good code, you have like X time to do an assignment that should take 2-4x time. You just need to get it done ASAP and ship it. Sometimes you get things cleaned up, but the code looks inflexible, and like it's just duct taped together, which it usually is. Sometimes you don't even get everything cleaned up from what you thought the project was going to be. You do stuff in weird, unintuitive ways, because when you built the framework/foundation, you thought it was going in a different direction, but it's too much effort to rebuild the foundational code from scratch 70% of the way into a project without having to start from scratch. But anyway - that's usually how it happens in my experience. It's just that when you start out on a project, especially with a lot of people/teams involved what you think the project is going to be, and what it ends up being can look very different.",

I did not really practice LC - I did a few problems for fun, but in no way would I consider would I did \"grinding\", nor did I make any attempt to memorize the solutions. The 3 LC interviews that I did get were all mediums where I was able to work out non-optimal but reasonable solutions, and I passed the interviews despite my non-optimal solutions.Probably worth mentioning that the non-LC coding interviews I received by and large still required a strong grasp of CS fundamentals like recursion and proper use of data structures. So if you're not solid with that kind of thing, then practicing LC may still help. I would also not say that the non-LC coding interviews are necessarily easier than LC - just that their difficulty is more about turning complex requirements into code than about figuring out \"this one neat trick\", which I do think is a more fair type of difficulty and more reflective of job skills. Also I did not interview with any FAANG companies, and I think they are more notorious for having LC interviews.The vast majority of my interview prep time was spent on practicing systems design and fleshing out my behavioral interview stories, and personally I thought that was a much better use of my time than grinding LC (as a senior candidate).",

Was also a shitty Amazon org to a premium goog org, so the upgrade is all round, benefits, WLB, tech stack, people, pay.I also moved from east coast to Bay Area.I basically rely on Goog benefits to survive in the Bay Area, my monthly bill outside of rent is $200 per month. Goog food is also both healthy and varied. Is that enough? I would say a big yes literally 3 months ago.But now that I get to Bay Area, I get to see those people actually making FU money and eventually, I can’t help putting myself into the chase as well.There’s people with 2 YOE making 900k a year and works 20 hours a week.There’s people simply joined at the right time and now I would call swimming in money. I ask them why they still work. Their base pay is less than their capital gain.So you see, there’s always a greener field. You decide when is enough. In terms of family, I’m also an immigrant, and I miss my family as well. I think at least I have to secure all 6 years of H1B money. If I stack all of them and go back to my home town, that’s still FU money.I try to learn ML concepts so I can potentially become a research scientist. I do envy those lab jobs alright. But when I’m done, I just indulge myself in video games and guitar.",

You make a decision and realize a year later it was the wrong one for XYZ reason that you hadn't considered. You see how something evolves over time. You miss out on all of that when you switch jobs so frequently. You're constantly onboarding and getting up to speed and not doing real deep work. I'd figure out what is actually motivating you to try to switch jobs, do you need the fast pace of being new? Are you in over your head and can hide it better as a newbie, and then you bolt as soon as you might be exposed? Figure that out and fix whatever it is. From what you've described, doing this 5 times in 3 years, there's no reason to think the next one will be any different.",

I don't need (or want) to live in a big, spacious, luxurious condo, I'd be comfortable and content in a 1br place that's in a location I really like.I do expect to make more at each successive job in my future but I don't have a target in mind for salary, I just want an opportunity that'll let me live comfortably in a place I really like and enjoy all that with a good work life balance.I'm 25, and I get that in this job market you have to work a lot harder even during your undergrad. I worked hard for my internships and all the work I did afterward to get to where I am, but I don't want to dedicate my entire life to just working and grinding.

Are you expecting them to be around to have lots of time to talk with you? Assign you tasks first-hand? Daily interactions? Answer your questions about the business? Stuff like that?I'm pretty self-reliant, I don't need my manager around for that kind of stuff. I can figure out business logic on my own, I can talk to other engineers, I've always worked at places that had good processes in-place so asking my manager for a Jira ticket would be unheard of.What I expect from my managers is to handle politics, handle cross-team dependencies/conversations, planning, negotiating between product and engineering, etc. I want them operating at a level above me, above the individual. They're there to protect us from external stakeholders, and unblock us from external dependencies.So that's why I'm curious what exactly you mean by \"ghost manager\". If I don't *see* or *speak* to my manager in weeks, not a big deal. They're still doing the job I expect of them behind the scenes. But if they're literally doing nothing for several weeks, that's another story entirely.I'd still much rather have that than a micromanager though. A Senior / Staff / Architect can step up to cover that kind of a role in the event of an absent manager. Otherwise your team's at risk of the Mack Truck Theory. You don't want the absence of a single person to bring your whole team to a grinding halt.",

Notably that paper wasn't about money, it was about me wanting to go into CS, and all the really cool things I can do with a CS degree. I wasn't thinking about the money.One big difference about my approach, and the approach I see a lot of people on this subreddit taking is I chose the degree *first*, not my job.A lot of people here decide they want to be a SWE first, and then work backwards to a CS degree. This hyper-focuses their career path and job search, which can make it significantly more difficult. Especially early career where they may not land their ideal role right away, and because they worked backwards from their ideal role, they view it as a failure and get depressed, and give up.Whereas with me, I would've been happy with *any* job remotely in technology. I would've been *totally fine* with help desk. When I was in college I was applying to every internship under the sun. IT, Help Desk, PM, SysAdmin, QA, whatever. If it was tech-related, I applied. Since I didn't have tunnel-vision on any specific role, this gave me flexibility. I couldn't get a SWE internship after my sophomore year, but I did get an offer for a PM internship. As a new grad, I only had 1 SWE offer, and that came pretty late. But I *did* have backups. A return offer from my PM internship, other IT offers, etc. If that late SWE offer never came, I was totally prepared to take one of those other offers, and been completely content with it. I got my CS degree, and I got a job out of it. Goal met. It's much easier to meet a goal like that than it is \"SWE at FAANG\".",

That means your résumé was flagged as a potential match for one of the positions they’re actively trying to fill. In other words, this isn’t random. Take the 15 minutes.It’s also important to clear up a common misconception: a job being posted on a careers site does not *always* mean it’s actively open for hire. Likewise, a role can be open and available to fill even if it isn’t posted publicly.Think of a job posting like a flyer on a bulletin board. If someone was already hired but the recruiter forgot to take the flyer down, it can look like “there was never a real job.” On the flip side, if the recruiter is hiring but chooses not to hang a flyer, it doesn’t mean they aren’t hiring—it just means the posting isn’t public. What truly matters is whether the *requisition* is open and approved as a **headcount**. That’s what determines if someone can be hired.P.S. Internal recruiters for Microsoft are not paid on commission. They are salaried full time employees, or hourly contractors. Their comp is not determined by number of candidates, though they do have metrics to adhere to.",

I guess that was a combination of luck, dedication, and solid foundations.Now, a couple of years ago I figured there were humongous knowledge gaps between me and my peers, so I enrolled in a masters program at the Abertay university.  I passed the first three modules,  and slowly realised that what I really needed is not taught in school,  but as others pointed out in this comment section,  you absorb on the job. I've been asking questions to my colleagues ever since. I take advantage of code review and meetings to ask and challenge my opinions. Everything else you can teach yourself.",

Some companies have started to test on material more relevant to the job including things like knowledge of API’s, emphasis on design patterns, possible take-home projects, etc. They may also require you to explain how you came about your solutions during the interview to weed out folks who vibe coded their way to an answer without understanding what they wrote. Others are still using LC style questions, so you’ll need to do research on the company to find out what their process is like. Personally I welcome this change. I never felt that LC was a great indicator of on the job performance more than it was an indicator of who was willing to grind problems and memorize how they were solved. That being said, I’d always make sure that you have strong fundamentals. This includes a basic understanding of computer organization, basic networking (TCP, UDP, sockets), concurrency and patterns (threads, IPC, locks, mutexes), standard design patterns (mentioned in Gang of four book), and basic data structures & algorithms (hash map, stack/queue, linked list, binary trees, etc.)",

That’s not to say it would necessarily hurt your career to go with Grainger, though—you’ve shown that you can get multiple offers already! Visa’s ladder is pretty strict from what I experienced in that most people follow similar promotion timelines regardless of performance.The savings from living with your parents would definitely put a decent dent over the comp at Visa (rent would probably be anywhere from $12,000-30,000 post tax depending on roommates, quality of apartment, etc.)",

West coast means more and better tech opportunities. It's possible you'd have better quality of life in Chicago, especially if you prefer city living (and eventually move out). I don't really consider Chicago to be much of a tech city. If it was, housing would be considerably more expensive. Most of the tech work in the area is tied to finance, consulting, pharma and other corporate flavors. While some tech companies have a presence, it's noticeably smaller. A 1.5 hour commute will be brutal. I worked at a company that did consulting work for Grainger, but I never worked on a project for them. I got the impression their tech was kind of weak. A lot of other companies in that area (far north suburbs, I believe) are dominated by Indian dev teams and management - both local and offshore. The horror stories you read on this sub where an Indian manager comes in and the entire tech team becomes Indian is a big problem with a lot of companies in that area. I can't speak to Grainger, specifically, so you should ask around and try to find more info. I suppose the possibilities of this will be pretty high at Visa, too.",

They do this because SWE roles usually impact the whole product, and they want to lower the risk of a bad hire. The downside is it makes the process exhausting and slow for candidates even when you’re already experienced. For UI/UX, employers judge more by portfolios and past projects. If someone can show 10 years of design work, it’s easier for hiring managers to quickly see their value. Their work speaks for itself, and companies don’t always add as many hoops for design roles. It’s not really that one career is easier than the other, it’s just that the hiring culture is different. SWE interviews have become standardized around heavy testing, and design and other fields lean more on proof of work and interviews that focus on collaboration and problem solving.",

Then it linked leetcode study guides that included practice questions to better udnerstand how to code it. Honestly was a great study guide, not sure why they took it out. The videos are still there write in youtube \"hacker rank data structures\". Here is one of them: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njTh\\_OwMljA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njTh_OwMljA) In my opinion do not fall into the \"grind leetcode for 200 hours\". You might get a job that way, but i have found many interviewers can tell when you dont understand the problem and are just copying what similar leetcode problems did. Because they dont mind changing up the problem halfway through if they noticed you got there too quickly. They'll change one little thing in the problem and ask you to re-do it and the way you did it wont work. So there is a lot of having to understand DSA to get the job. Learn how to think outloud because that's what most of them expect. They dont care if you get it right, just how you think. Ive gotten jobs and havent gottent their questions right. Also, tackle problems piece by piece. I have found that once i write one line of code, i am less stressed and tackle the problem better. So usually the first thing i do is tackle the base cases. Let's say I have to re-arrange an array. First line i write is \"if(array.empty())\". Then i tackle the next base case and i ahve found that once you go through it the asnwer kind of starts resolving itself as you tackle the base cases.",

Very different experience from u/[IAmBoredAsHell](https://www.reddit.com/user/IAmBoredAsHell/)Keep in mind I have an Ivy League undergrad degree (Columbia Univ) so that might have helped.Applied for jobs. Heard back from many places. LinkedIn claims I applied 28 places (many of which are the same companies like 6 on Roblox, etc). So 15 different companies for the 28 positions. + outside LinkedIn like DataDog, Coinbase.Out of the 15+2 companies, had recruiter calls from 13 companies. The 4 companies that did not reply were Roblox (sucks cause I got interview there before), Affirm (sucks cause I got interview there before), ~~MongoDB (my experience is completely irrelevant to work there)~~, Pinterest (sucks cause I got interview there before), DataDog (my experience is completely irrelevant to work there).In my inbox, have many dozens of recruiters requesting to do an interview. Many well paying desperate firms like Carta, Decagon, Vanta, Valon, TikTok, Meta, DE Shaw, Stubhub, Lyft, Anduril, DoorDash, Ramp, Amazon, etc. And crap ton of AI grift startups/firms which constantly clog up my inbox daily.I got rejected from OpenAI at phone screen this time but I blame the interviewer. System design question was infra side when I have zero understanding of infra. Sucks because I was able to get an offer almost 2 years ago there but thought non-profit + Scam Altman == shares are worth nothing + don't want to deal with insane work hours. Who knew valuations would explode and non-profits become for-profits so easily. I thought Elon Musk would have done something there.It's honestly very difficult from the start to even apply as senior because most jobs are not going to be on the field I work in.In the fields I work in, I get basically 100% response rate. Since I work in the financial side, so jobs like Uber for Financial team, trading firms (absolutely 0 thoughts), etc all respond quick. Pigeonhole life :/. Honestly not interested in the WLB and have no thoughts moving to NYC when I have made my life here right now (maybe in the future).I'm sure if I spray and prayed full stack, infra, databases, etc. roles then my response rate would be garbage as well. But then again, I'm sure if I applied mid level roles for those I would get calls left and right but then why would I?And no. I don't bother with referrals, connections, etc. Not my thing. Never needed to. I was able to get interviews at Netflix, Google, OpenAI, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Snap, Databricks, Citadel, etc in the past without any problems anyway. Ivy League degree helps.Definitely worse than covid era. During covid era, I essentially had 90% response rate at tech firms and near 100% response rate at non tech firms. But then again, I'm not applying for mid level roles so to be expected. Plus, I am a lazy individual who has no thoughts min-maxing my career so that plays a part as well. I've let my experience rot my skills for job market but I don't care. I value life outside work a lot.>Curious if there are any suggestions or comments on day to day learning and interview prep?Just take life chill. Don't overthink. Life is too short to stress these stuff too much.That said, be good at Leetcode. Try to aim for 95% pass rate on coding interviews.And spend time on studying System Design. That's the most important once you are out of new grad.\\-Update: MongoDB just replied to start process. Perfect timing. LOL. But I won't be starting the process anyways.",

Thinking mostly Leetcode for a bit, Learning about new trends etc, maybe some project time.",

Any manual, repetitive work or something which just required copying existing code while the effort was focused around testing for regression. Meanwhile, I worked almost twice as much on another team, but because the work I was doing was interesting, made real impact, and I actually found myself being challenged by the tasks I was getting while also learning a whole lot, I didn't even come close to burnout.

Yes, when they list AngularJS, write down AngularJS even if you know they should have said Angular instead.If at some point someone calls you for an interview for a company X, you open your folder with your CVs and you read the technoes you bullshitted into this version of the CV (obviously put X in the file name).The goal is to land the real interview process, and you gotta go through the automatic blacklisting and the non-tech recruiters filters.Absolutely no one cares about someone having 3 months of dedicated non-professional experience in a techno or just one week half-assed.If they are ready to hire someone that hasn’t worked professionally with a techno, they wouldn’t make the difference between having committed a lot of efforts or not. They wouldn’t actually be able to tell honestly.Multiplying the \"amorced\" interview processes by being open-minded is way more efficient than restricting to a different backend language.Of course feel free to learn dotnet, I love dotnet. Tons of companies use dotnet. But it’s just one of the many different backend technologies and its marketshare isn’t even that big.

You're not just writing one application so on paper you're more than one person others are competing for that position. Let's take a hypothetical scenario where there are 50 people looking for a job and there are 50 positions open. Everyone applied to every position. On paper this means you are competing with 49 other people but just because you aren't the best in those 50 people doesn't mean there is no job for you. Of course this is a scenario where demand and supply is equal but even if you are the exact median, the demand would have to be more than twice the supply for you to be left out. Do your best, write a lot of applications, learn in demand skills and you'll probably be fine. Right now the market is tough but it'll (hopefully) get better soon.",

If you get an interview, just take it, it means you have a chance of getting the job. If the company doesn't want you at all, it wouldn't waste the time interviewing you. I got my first job because other two guys couldn't take the offer, one got a better offer and went for it, the other one didn't complete his cs degree. I was the worst among the three, they had no choice but to hire me becuase the department freezes the head count by the end of the week and no time for another interview.",

Stop chasing “best overall” and build a spike - pick a stack or domain, then create proof you can ship and own outcomes. Ship a small real project that solves a niche pain, deploy it, add metrics, and write a short postmortem; get even a handful of users or a clear dataset and show measurable impact. Turn resume bullets into results with numbers, keep it clean and scannable, link to a live demo and PRs. That’s what pulls you out of the pile. You’re not trying to be perfect for everyone, just undeniable for a few.For interviews, aim for above-bar consistency, not brilliance. Do 45-60 minutes a day on a tight set of patterns until mediums feel routine, and talk through problems with a simple loop - clarify constraints, propose baseline, optimize, test - recording yourself to fix pacing and signal. For systems design, use a repeatable template and practice one scenario a day. Ditch spray-and-pray: send concise, specific cold emails to engineers and hiring managers at focused targets, reference a pain they have, share a tiny artifact or plan, ask for a quick chat, then the referral; say yes to contract-to-hire or smaller teams to get momentum. If you want real-time prompts and example answers during live interviews to navigate tricky questions and keep your delivery steady, [interview assistant AI](http://interviews.chat) can help - I’m on the team that built it.",

Tech can be crazy like that.A few points:1) Knowing your shit matters vastly more than a piece of paper pretending to attest to that.2) Personality matters, a *lot*. People like to work with people they like to work with. This is where a *lot* of tech folks get tripped up: They vastly overweight the importance of their tech skills and all but completely dismiss interpersonal relationship skills. No one cares if you're the best coder on the team if you're an asshole. It's often shorthanded as \"networking\" or \"soft\" skills, but really it's just about being that likable guy at the party. You don't have to be the life of the party (probably not even a good idea), but you do need to at least be getting invited to the parties.3) Integrity matters, a *lot.* Sell your accomplishments sure, but experienced IT folks have a very attuned bullshit meter. Be forthright, accurate, specific, *humble.* If you did X and Jack handled Y, don't try and BS when interviewing about how X was all you. When you screw up, as we *all* do, step up and take responsibility before anyone even thinks to ask. How you *respond* to failures is vastly more important than your rate of failure. -Some of my most engaging stories to pull out for interviews focus around what I did to recover from mistakes.Remember that anyone hiring you is agreeing to spending *almost half their waking hours* with you for the foreseeable future. Would you say yes to hanging out with someone for 40+ hours a week that you don't think you'd get along with, don't feel you can trust, etc? Of course not. Teams are hiring *new friends* as much as they're hiring a new coworker and if you don't believe that then you *absolutely* aren't the sort of person they're looking for.",

I’m at a similar position in terms of experience, and early in my career I FELT the lack of advanced degree holding me back every day from the opportunities and jobs I wanted to pursue, especially trying to break into Data Science. After 8 years, I don’t feel like it matters nearly as much. There’s definitely still jobs that won’t even look at my resume without an advanced degree. But tbh, those jobs probably still wouldn’t look at me with a Masters, they pay super well and can afford to hire just PhD’s.I think if you want to get into management or entrepreneurship, something like an MBA at a good school where you can network with people who have similar goals or mindsets could be worth it. But if you still want to be on the technical path, Idk I just feel like the time and money you’d have to spend getting the Masters could be spent doing other stuff that might have a bigger impact on career trajectory. Like, for maybe 1/10th the time and money, could you make a point of going to 1 or 2 meetups or conferences related to the jobs you want, and just aggressively network, and get to know everyone in the field so when opportunities pop up, you’ll know people who can help you get those jobs/opportunities?EDIT: I forgot to mention, I think the AI wave/hype is largely dying out. I don’t see the Data Science jobs paying any more than software/data/architecture jobs. In fact a trend I’ve seen recently is, a lot of times the Data Engineering positions are paying more money than the DS positions. I think if you want to switch careers for fulfillment or job satisfaction, getting a Masters could put you in a good spot to secure a job like that, which would otherwise be hard to land without job experience. But I wouldn’t expect it to pay more than you are making now, maybe even a pay cut. But that’s just my two cents.",

FEED, as I understand it, is simply a very thorough form of project planning done prior to beginning implementation/providing a quote. It's not *specific* to those things you listed. Those were just examples. \"Project Scope\" is the important bit of that section, along with timeline, quotes, project organization, etc.Especially if the company you applied to builds things for customers, and bids on projects, rather than building/running their own product, it seems pretty reasonable that they would be legitimately doing FEED, and the SWE's would be heavily involved since it's a software project they're planning/selling.I have 12 YOE, and I don't recall ever hearing that acronym before... but there's lots of acronyms I haven't heard of. There is a ton of variety in the industry. After looking up what FEED is, I can safely say I've never been involved in such a rigid and thorough project planning stage. I've worked mostly in agile shops where we're fast and loose with timelines, planning, and costs. Joining a company where their planning stage can potentially last months, *or years*, would certainly be a new experience to me. So it's good that they made it clear on the job posting that that's the project planning methodology they follow, because that's a pretty major culture indicator.",

Say, you get an increase becase of an external job offer. How will the company trust you are not going to look again externally to use as leverage? it just doesn't look good on you and doesn't scale.2. Your manager's reasoning for lack of promotion *\"it just doesn't happen after 1 year\"* is very poor. Each individual performs uniquely. They have to advocate for you when trying to promote you, so if their logic just falls into \"it's not usually how it's done here\", there's no spine. What could you have done better? What's the company state wrt promotions right now? Is there something you're missing? That would be helpful feedback. FYI, sure you need a great relationship with your manager, but also consider skip manager, you want leadership visibility and to have them on your side.I don't think it's a good idea to \"negotiate\" annual rise. If your goal is to get promoted, you need to hunt it down, advocate for your, and convince with results to leadership/team that you deserve it. If your goal is salary increase, jump to another company.",

Your brain is not as \"plastic\" as it once was, so you will need time to get this stuff locked in (and that is OK).The way I'd go about it is to seriously try the Leetcode Easy. Why Easy? Because a lot of the Mediums are generalizations of Easy problems, and the Easy problems give you a good foundation of key techniques.Once you find a solution to an Easy, take around 10-15 minutes and think if you can find a faster solution. On Leetcode it is usually to tell if there is a faster solution by the speed/memory distribution.Once you get the hang of Easys, then start doing Mediums that are semi-related to the Easys you've done. (For example, if you did an Easy in strings, do some Mediums in strings. If you did Easies in arrays, do some Mediums in arrays.) Your mind will be somewhat attuned to possible patterns and techniques.WRT AI... please don't. People will find out. If they don't find out then, they will find out at the interview when they make you code in front of them. And once recruiters find out, they tell other recruiters privately that this candidate used AI. Even if you somehow make it, you'll be miserable. You will have a case of impostor syndrome that you've never believed can exist. You will know inside that you're way above where you are, because the work will be assigned based on the AI version of you, not you. And if you think you can use AI at work... sure, I'm sure people will not mind as much, but you will NOT be happy in that role.EDIT: A lot of ppl have some flavor of what I said. I wanted to add. Please make sure you know basic Data structures (Arrays, Lists, Linked Lists, Queues, Stacks, Hash tables) and Algorithms (Sorting, Binary search, divide and conquer, BFS, DFS, Binary Search Trees and Tree Traversals, etc).",

Stop testing yourself on stuff you haven't practiced yet.Learn the concepts and ideas behind \"algorithms and data structures\". Actually make sure you understand what it is about, how things work in principle. Then start practicing. Do not try to solve as many questions as you can, but look at a question, understand it, and work your way not just to a solution, but to understanding what it does, and why, and how, and explain why that is better than sub-optimal alternatives.Once you're good at that, you should have very few problems with leetcode anymore.There are problems that you'll absolutely have to memorize. Dijkstra's algorithm is named after the dude because it is nothing short of brilliant. I know I am not that clever, so I won't come up with that solution to that problem. but i don't have to memorize how to scan an array for the largest value, because I actually understand what is going on, any way, and can rebuild the solution when it is needed.\\*: Fun fact, chicken sexing is one weird exception that nobody has an explanation for yet.

In interviews, I’ll admit ignorance on a topic and then ask the interviewer to tell me more about it. This happened on a recent interview with some real low-level .NET CLR shit. You get the interviewer talking, because half the time they want to show YOU how smart they are, and then you figure out a “oh, so it’s similar to (some other angle / topic that shows you know what you are talking about AND can synthesize new information).” Tech interviewers will hit you with obscure shit for a variety of reasons, and sometimes it’s to see how you handle being uncertain or rattled. Sometimes they’re just dicks.Also, if an interviewer is rude or offensive, you are within your rights to terminate the interview at any time, and let the recruiter know why.",

The power to be calm and cool and collected under pressure isn’t a ‘Hey, just think about them in underwear’ kind of a thing. It’s a skill that takes years to develop. By interviewing, and learning from the experience and finding reasonable ways to frame things, you are building that up right now. But it’s going to take a long time to feel like you made progress. Just like how you can’t go to the gym once, and come home super sore, and get 24” biceps the next day, even though it was hard, and it hurt. You just gotta work on it.

Practice explaining your reasoning even when you're unsure, because interviewers want to see how you think through problems, not just whether you get the perfect answer. Most good interviewers will actually guide you toward the solution if you're communicating well and showing logical thinking.I'm on the team that built [AI interview assistant](http://interviews.chat), and we created it specifically to help people navigate these kinds of tricky interview situations and build confidence for technical rounds.",

        "body": "It takes as long as it takes. Some folks land another job fairly quickly, others it'll take months.The biggest thing you're up against at the moment is the calendar. Lots of places slow down hiring as the year draws to a close. I was laid off in mid-October last year and told my wife if I didn't land something by Thanksgiving then it likely dry up until mid- to late January. Fortunately I landed something in November.It sucks losing your job, and if I recall from your previous post this is your first time going through this. I experienced being laid off at my first job after graduating, only being there about six months. Felt like an absolute failure, especially to my parents because I was still living at home. They were very understanding and mainly just felt bad for me, but we're happy to let me live with them as long as I was hunting for another job. Lots of folks will be more understanding than you realize, and for the ones who don't or seem to pull away I'd say you'll learn the \"value\" of those relationships.The best advice I can give you would be:1) Realize it's very likely not your fault and simply a business decision. This is not a reflection on you as a person or on your skills as much as you may think it is. You now know that most employers don't really value you or others as much as you may have thought.2) If there are local user groups for your field of study, attend those and network as much as possible. I've been able to keep my recent stints with layoffs fairly short due to the network I've built over the years. Talking with folks and getting their help in applying for open positions is gonna do more for you than online submissions where you're a name among hundreds or thousands of others. I landed my current position by going to a local user group and connecting with a staff engineer of the company hosting it, who was willing to submit my resume directly to HR for an open position.3) In the current market, you may need to be more open to both returning to an office to work and even taking short term contract gigs. Fully in office positions will likely have fewer applicants compared to hybrid, and both will have fewer applicants compared to fully remote. Taking contract work can also be an option, as most times those interview loops are one or two rounds and often not that involved. Part of this is because they can cut you loose at any moment and owe you nothing, because you likely won't have paid time off (you can take time off, just not paid). Benefits, if offered, can usually be stupid expensive depending on your needs, but contract work will almost always pay far better than unemployment, and keeps long gaps off your resume. It may lead to a permanent position, and if not then at least you avoid dipping into your savings for a while. You can absolutely keep interviewing for better gigs in the meantime.4) If needed, take part-time work somewhere or work in something adjacent to your field of study if possible. I floated by on support and sys admin type roles for about three years, from 2009 to 2012, because I was a new grad with minimal experience losing out on jobs to folks who had that experience. I managed to stay close to the industry and make decent money from it while waiting for my time to get back into SWE jobs in full.I get it man, losing a job sucks and is a big hit to your mental. Know that you're not the first to experience this, you won't be the last, and this may not be your last time experiencing it. There's gonna be aspects of paranoia about it happening again going forward and you just gotta learn how to deal with it. The best way to deal with it is to build both a solid amount of savings, along with a solid network of folks you can reach out to if it ever happens again.You'll get through this, and you'll be stronger for it.",

With data Analysis / data Strategy you don’t have to be a hardcore data scientist. Analysts use tools like SQL, Excel, and visualization software, which are less about coding and more about insights. Since you already touched enterprise architecture / IT strategy role a bit, this could be a way to stay close to tech decisions without being the one coding. Cybersecurity / Cloud Operations has lots of problem solving, and you can pick areas that don’t require daily coding.

Companies in those countries still want to see proof you can do the work so your best bet is to keep building strong projects, maybe earn one or two big cloud/devops certs (like AWS or Azure), and make your LinkedIn/GitHub shine. When you graduate, you’ll stand out to employers. Studying abroad is also expensive, and if you don’t land a job in that window, it can feel like wasted money. But tech roles are still in demand in those countries, especially cloud, backend, and DevOps. If you’re serious and willing to network, apply early, and show your skills, you have a very real shot. So studying abroad can be a good path if you see it as both education and a bridge into that country’s job market.

        "body": "The Computer Science MSc is usually seen as the more prestigious option because it’s broad and shows you’ve done advanced work in algorithms, systems, and AI. Employers in tech and finance especially recognize it. Since it already has stats and machine learning modules, it gives you a good mix of theory and practical skills that you could apply to data science later. The downside is that you might feel like you’re spending a lot of time on modules you’re not passionate about if they aren’t data focused.The Statistics & Data Science MSc is more specialized. It shows that you’re committed to a career in data and analytics. This can help you stand out if you’re going straight for data scientist, data analyst, or data consultant roles. But data science is competitive as many people enter with a PhD or years of experience. So, with just a master’s, you’d want to build a strong portfolio of projects, maybe internships, and show you can apply your learning to real world problems.If you want maximum flexibility and aren’t 100% sure whether you’ll go into pure data or something adjacent, stick with Computer Science. If you’re confident you want data focused roles and want your degree title to reflect that directly, then go with Statistics & Data Science. Since you’re also open to more human facing roles like data consultant, either degree could work. Employers will usually care less about the exact title and more about your ability to explain data clearly, work with stakeholders, and use tools like Python, SQL, and visualization platforms.

What kind of status updates are you giving?If someone's *asking* me for my status, whether that be asking me if I'm done yet, or if I need help, or if I'm killing it, or if I'm stuck, or if the deadline is still on target, etc.... that's a failure of communication on my part. People shouldn't need to pull my status out of me.If my task is dragging on for one reason or another, I don't necessarily need help, but that is something I'll communicate to the team so they can react accordingly. Sometimes a delayed ticket can have a ripple affect and threaten bigger deadlines. And if I do need help, I don't hesitate to ask. 12 YOE here as well. I ask from time to time, but when I'm past the 6 month mark at a company, I don't generally need much help, but I'm also not dragging tickets.But if you *need* help, *ask for it*.

Your projects should mimic what you would do at a company (designing, architecting, testing, deploying, etc).You need to show employers that you are a low-risk hire that can easily jump on task without much hand-holding. Right now, your resume doesn't give me that confidence because it's mostly game dev focused. If I were a hiring manager and I needed to quickly find someone to fix my shit, I would immediately toss your resume because you sell yourself as a game dev, not a creative well-rounded problem-solver.Also, it seems you're located in Turkey. I've heard the SWE job market terrible there. Are you only looking for remote positions?",

I would say after you have a good resume (hopefully after this recent change taking his advice along with formatting it to be 1 page) it may take a while to get an opportunity but just keep applying, eventually stuff stacks up fast especially if your highlight your language specific experience for a role that it’s critical for.

The big downside is the low pay for the Boston area, and unless growth picks up internally, it may not help you reach your long term goals as quickly.The Navy civilian defense role could pay more (especially with the LCOL adjustment), and the clearance is a big deal. Having an active clearance opens doors to a ton of roles, often with better pay. But the tradeoff is real as slower pace, older languages (Fortran/Lua aren’t exactly hot), and the move could impact your wife’s job situation. It’s not bad for your resume, but it doesn’t point you directly at robotics or big tech.Staying put for now, but leveraging your active clearance while applying to cleared SWE jobs in Boston might be your best balance. You keep building real coding experience, keep your wife in a better job market, and also line yourself up for higher paying cleared roles without locking into Fortran work you don’t love. It could give you more modern stacks and the security benefit of the clearance.From a career growth standpoint, if robotics or big tech are the long-term targets, you’ll want solid coding experience (modern languages like Python, C++, Java). Projects closer to systems/AI/robotics (your hardware adjacent pharma work helps). Optional clearance leverage (keeps your options wide open if you want defense/contracting).",

        "body": "I work as a Sr SWE at a big tech company and live around Boston, the best place to look for jobs is builtinboston \\[dot\\] com and start applying there.If you want to get to big tech, there are a few skill trees you can climb, but it's basically frontned, backend, SWE, or machine learning. Overwhelming, big tech companies focus on web application development in the cloud. They do a little bit of embedded programming, but that's a discipline that's a big outside of their use cases, however they do have cleared positions. As for what helps your career, it's very hard to say, since it will come down to the quality of experience you are getting, like being on a team with good mentors, and an environment where you can push your skills. You're also very light on experience, 3 months is basically nothing. My preference would be to stay in Boston, get yourself more involved in programming communities and meetups, and gun for a job doing something on the web, as there's a ton of companies within the Rt 128 beltway and start ups in boston, as that's a generally higher paying (more scalable) discipline.It's really hard to say, though. If you want to do cleared embedded work, and you think that's a viable option for you, go for it. My path to big tech was different (data science/SWE in start ups, moved up to team leadership, then big tech), but that's not to say what you're talking about isn't a viable path, I just don't know!",

Few things: you get a sign on bonus of 20% usually, you will be over 100k at your 2 year mark, and after a year you’re eligible for the smart program. It’s normally really competitive but with the hiring freeze every single person I work with that applied got in. You can get a masters basically for free and get paid that salary, accrue leave, and get promotions during this 1-2 year mark time period. My base also has Flex Time where you work OT up to 24h that bank and can be used as normal leave. I’d highly recommend this route Oh and you have the security of clearance if you want to go private.",

The US side is tiny compared to EU but I think I’ve made a really good impression here so far so I think it’s a fairly safe bet.The cleared job is directly working for the government so.. given the current climate, I’d say decidedly unstable. It is dealing with submarines, so I think less likely to be cut than other areas but still, a government shutdown would mean working without pay, and I’d be probationary for a year and last-in-first-out if something did happen.We do have a GMP lab here, and the equipment is used in there as well as at other labs.. still getting acquainted with all the acronyms though.",
