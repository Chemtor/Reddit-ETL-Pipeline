Overall we were spending the same amount for etl.Might look into if airbyte self hosted is the way to go but I feel like it’ll be more faff vs going with fivetran/airbyte-clpud and in small data teams where saving 30k matters … it probably means that we’re limited on time and taking time out to fix and build connectors would be counter productive.I’ve also found fivetran’s connectors to be better than what airbyte cloud gave us right out of the box.",

Deploy your code, setting up the parameters to hit your new postgres server, you'll grab access during setup. You won't *need* any other tool, but can use it depending on your code. Personally I'd just use python and psql to scrape the redditextractor data. Deploy website - lots of ways depending on your VPS provider. Namecheap is like a 2 click process to spin up a new site, and then you can design as needed. If your site is going to get a fair amount of traffic, then configure a load balancer, like Nginx for the website.",

I've seen/known firefighters and paramedics who report zero stress in _their_ emergency response work, and this is the only way I can explain that. Of course, many emergency responders would also report much higher stress levels. Those folks are probably doing just as good a job as the no-stress folks, but they're thinking about their work differently. Something has clicked in the heads of the no-stress folks, and they can get on and deal with terrible situations effectively without it affecting their internal state. They presumably have healthy mental hygiene outside of work: hobbies, practices etc that keep them on an even keel.I think this applies to all office/corporate/white collar jobs just as much. DE and anything else. I haven't attained no-stress nirvana but I have noticed in the past I react differently (much _less_ stress) to the same situations that cause visible stress in some colleagues: colleagues that I know have the same training and similar skill levels to me. For example, having a huge pile of work doesn't stress me. There are only so many working hours; I just make sure I know what's the #1 priority and focus on that, and make sure stakeholders know what I'm doing (and not doing).",

You can define columns without reference to dataframes, so you can make a list of column expressions *before* you work with the dataframes.edit: I shouldn't do this at 2am. ~~Your slice [] of the map column based on a key means spark is creating a column expressions mapping every key:value in mapping, then throwing it all away to pick a single key from the map.~~All of this requires communication between spark and pyspark, which takes time. When you do it 600 times it takes a while.Every time you chain dataframe defining functions pyspark calls out to spark to build a plan. Time spent on the plan increases exponentially as you have more steps as each step takes longer as it builds on the last. 600 dataframe definitions is a lot.Do the `json.loads` once for each mapping, not for each variable for each model. edit: I shouldn't do this at 2am. ~~Don't create a full map column just to select one key out of it, just get the value from the original mappings dict. Don't chain withColumn, generate all the column definitions into a list then do `df.select(\"*\",*listofcols)`~~ edit: fixing 2am mistakes...Even though the key you pull from the map is the value in column 'v', you are parsing and defining the same map dtype column multiple times -- 150 times if it is the 10 models and 15 variables looping over the same 4 mappings. Think of the size and complexity of this query as it gets built out, where spark is generating 600 chained 'views' with hundreds of mapping objects, and every mapping gets used so cannot be discarded before processing.In pandas you don't have this because the mapping object is available in the same process directly and doesn't need to be duplicated data per row. It also processes the dataframe in full at each step, so it can discard any previously used map as it goes. Whereas spark can't access your dict directly and has lazy evaluation, so it has to 'remember' every single generation of every map field all at once when it finally runs, and will be duplicating the data into each row in its behind-the-scenes rdd.You want to only parse each model once, and only generate its map once, and reuse that. You also want to make a list of your output columns then use `.select()` on them all at once. To make the reuse explicit you can split it into two selects. df = some_input m = model original_colnames [c for c in df.columns] # parse the mappings once mapping_dicts = [json.loads(mp) for mp in mappings) # generate the mapping cols once mapping_cols = [ F.create_map([F.lit(k_or_v) for kv in mapping_dict.items()]).alias(f\"map_{i}\") for i,mapping_dict in enumerate(mapping_dicts) ] # define all variable redirections through the map all together mapped_cols = [ F.col(\"map_{i}\")[F.col(f\"some_var_{v}\")].alias(f\"new_{m}\") # something seems off here for v in variables for i in range(len(mapping_cols)) ] # generate new dataframe new_df = ( # define a dataframe with the mappings in a first step # (so you can easily view this df if you cut the code up) df.select( *original_colnames, *mapping_cols ) # use the defined maps to generate the output columns .select( *original_colnames, *mapped_cols ) ) return dfNote that you don't *have* to do this in two selects if you reuse the actual column objects, but then you can't as easily check the intermediate state with just the mappings available.",

You can easily get a distributed k:v store to ingest millions of entries per second, and each write can be retrieved essentially immediately for low latency results, but it will generally struggle to handle large analytical queries.Your deltalake tables can ingest enormous volumes of data, and are great for huge analytical queries, but there are limitations on the types of write that you can do in the process. Most importantly here MERGE operations have *a lot* of overhead -- you'll be rewriting entire files for an update to a single row, and every write is going to leave behind another time travel copy of the data it just superseded.You can clean up these time travel copies. You run compaction periodically, then do a VACUUM with a custom short time with the necessary override to let it delete files less than a *week* old. You'll still have a lot of overhead processing the merges, however.What is often better with rapidly updating data when using something like deltalake is to move away from merging every single change, and instead just blind-inserting new values to an append-only log with a timestamp of when that row version becomes active. From there a window function looking for the latest timestamp for a given key lets you filter for the 'current data'.Over time the total amount of data will get pretty large, and that will get inefficient. So you can periodically create a proper merged 'current state' table that *doesn't* need the window-function-for-latest filter. Then when querying for the latest data you start with that fully merged table as your base, you anti-join the keys from the timestamp filtered append log, and union data with the window-function-for-latest filter only on the new append log data.That query will skip all the 'previously merged' data from the append log and keep the window processing to a minimum, but still lets you get the latest state from the append log where it applies.You'll want to do something like a bucketby on both tables on the key, so that they are properly organised to minimise shuffles to achieve the joins and window functions.You can tune the full merge period to whatever suits. It could be hourly, or daily, or any frequency you like. Each time you do a merge you can also compact and vacuum to clear out old data. If you partition your append-log by a time bin you can also drop old partitions to save storage space there too -- and it can help with skipping files that won't be relevant.---These sorts of 'streaming into big analysis' issues seem to come up from time to time. We had [another one last month](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1jfwyyn/streaming_to_an_iceberg_scd2_table/) but that one went a step further to doing full SCD2 history, not just latest value.",

Every few hours the updates are paused for a min while files are optimised. Total table size 2TB. Adding about 45m rows per day. One table is append only and requires a tiny amount of compute. The other is merged to avoid duplicates (same data). The merged table is partitioned, and merges are optimised for those partitions. This has a substantial impact on compute required and latency. The tables have over 100 columns with some complex data types. For a smaller table, I think you could go much faster.",

I *think* duckdb will do the same thing. Athena pretty sure also does predicate pushdown.If you’re just experimenting on your own, polars/duckdb on your local is probably the simplest.

It's quite efficient at reading just the data needed in parquet. But there is still room for improvement on making better use of page-level stats, and improved push-down predicates from the iceberg side. Contributions are most welcome!It works with surprisingly large datasets in my experience. But there are obviously worst-case scenarios like tables with a large volume of frequently-changing data will be hard to efficiently pull into the browser.The only other real way to do this until now would be duckdb-wasm as you mentioned. Duckdb is awesome! But it is very heavyweight in the browser. Nearly 40mb of WASM. And bundling wasm files is always a pain. Whereas hyparquet is 10kb and trivial to deploy. Icebird is 85kb minzipped. This is by FAR the most lightweight stack for accessing iceberg data in existence.",

Writing the mysql integration won't necessarily make it all that much less work to write the postgres one, et cetera (sure, the 10th is easier than the 5th, but I suspect the 101st is about as much work as the 100th - but maybe I'm wrong, I haven't worked on Purview).And there's an almost unimaginable number of tools and products and services out there.

For example:- Many companies have critical warehouses and marts running on PostgreSQL or MySQL.

        "body": "I was very successful on my project with customer matching, exactly what you are talking about. We wound up buying a tool. Biggest single take away is that it’s not “can you do this” but rather “how accurately can you do this”. There are so many tools/techniques that can do this - but the accuracy levels vary. As you pay more, or get more sophisticated, your match accuracy and speed goes up. For example, on the easy end would be to compare address line 1, city, state, and zip from multiple data sources against each other and make the match. There are so many problems with this, so it’s not very accurate. Examples of higher end algorithms include:- Typo detection with various string compare/character distance algorithms- Phonetic representation (matching on how words are spoken not spelled to account for typos)- Address tokenization (not matching 123 4th ave. To 4 123rd ave, because you parse an address into what it represents (house number and street)- Nickname substitution (Tom matches Thomas)- Abbreviation matching (CIA matches Central Intelligence Agency)- Address validation - comparing an address to the US Postal Service to see if it’s real (don’t try matching fictitious addresses)- Understanding name titles - (Mrs, Miss, Sir, Jr, III, II, etc. John Thomas can match Mr. John Thomas, or John Thomas II is different from John Thomas III)Etc…. You get the point…Ultimately, there are two big things: match accuracy and match speed. Accuracy evaluates two records against each other using all the different rules, scores each one, and then this is where you come in — you set weights on the different rules to “tune” the algorithm. Essentially, you are optimizing either overmatching or undermatching — you will never be perfect. In some cases you want to overmatch (say you are sending direct mail promotions and are fine accidentally grouping father and son as same person). In some cases you prefer to undermatch (say you are grouping medial records/data and don’t want to give a child the medication his father is prescribed because you incorrectly linked the two as the same entity). Second big thing is speed. Ultimately, you are comparing each record against each record - do the math…. It’s too long to actually compute. So, these tools take short cuts - they actually only compare subsets of data against each other (important- this means some rows will never be evaluated for a potential match). For example if record 1 is “123 1st St, NM USA” I don’t actually need to compare this one against any data that isn’t from the state of New Mexico (NM). HOWEVER, what if I’m wrong about the original record being in NM? If I am, then I have no hope of making a match (let’s say it’s actually in MN - typo) so my accuracy is compromised because of my speed algorithm. So, again, this is why you pay more as features go up. Can you have speed and accuracy - sure, but it will cost you.NOTE: As an interesting aside, I was also on a Material Matching project. Materials are very different from customers, it’s actually not a data problem but an image recognition problem. Our first approach was to treat it like customer and look at attributes we stored in data (length, width, etc.) and perform the match. It was terrible. Poor data quality, and you can’t capture enough data - for example, you might have same H,W,D and weight, but you don’t capture “right hand” or “left hand” part (which makes them different). The answer is software that matches visually looking at the CAD drawings in 3d. Very cool, and very expensive. Really isn’t a BI problem at this point, but an Engineering problem since it’s in the CAD world.EDIT: you will need a manual method to override matches, and fix them. In my project our software matched 95% of the data correctly!!!! The business had to use 5 full time head count for 1 year to perform the additional 5% match. So - this should tell you how valuable the software is, and how difficult it is to manually match millions of rows of data. EDIT: I didn’t state this, but the process is to create “groups” of data (entities). So, your target data is [group id or entity id], [record id], [attribute columns: name, address 1, city, state…]. The group id/entity id field is just the master record, record id. This can be set as the first record that forms the group/entity (group id=record id) or you can use logic to ensure this is your “golden record”. You have many matching rules, each rule matches rows using the various match algorithms above (think of it as sub-matching) - we had 3 big ones. Highest weight rule was where all attributes matched between two records (name + address), rule 2: name + zip matched, rule 3 - address only matched. First step of the process was a data quality phase - ensure all records have these fields populated - ie: if zip is blank or wrong, we look up address to populate the zip. EDIT: What exactly is a “entity”? You’ll find really interesting situations in your data. For example, for us an entity was a customer/account. We found situations where a customer has multiple buildings, each on different roads (close to each other on their property) which made the addresses very different, requiring manual matching override. Think of a large corporate campus, university, or government facility (military base). All those buildings are on different roads, with different addresses - but are the same entity. It’s very unlikely the tool will match them, since it matches addresses.. so manual overrides are needed (unless you can work in reference data and additional rules about all the various streets on the campus…)EDIT: you’ll also get matching logical problems where record A matches record B, and record B matches record C, so that means A=C. But it shouldn’t…so you have this huge blob of over matched records you need to manually split up. The incorrect matching is coming from data quality problems. Essentially, you have 1 bad address row causing two entities to be incorrectly linked. This can happen when businesses use central billing locations - like a corporate headquarters, or a state/city office. For example, the city cemetery and the city water treatment, and the city transportation service all get linked because their data comes to you via the cities single administrative building with a single address.EDIT: I really liked this book. Data Matching, by Peter ChristenEDIT: Think about what you are going to do with the data. If it’s data warehousing only, you might want to build a “reference style Master Data Management database”. This essentially is only used for data warehouse/analytics, and consumes data from systems but does not push data to source systems (or claim to own customer). But if you need to create the enterprise definition of the truth, and your job is to “own” the definition of customer for the enterprise — then you need to catch customer data being entered in various source systems, master it quickly, and push it back to those systems. There are different styles of MDM architecture/tools. Same matching principles - but speed and integration becomes a more important requirement.",

But normally, I wouldn't say a data engineer needs to understand EA or TOGAF at all. I mean, it doesn't hurt but really shouldn’t be a requirement. In your case, it may help you liase more effectively with your EA function. Personally, as an enterprise architect, I don't think the rest of the organization should be exposed to framework jargon. Who outside the EA function cares about TOGAF and all that anyway? Most sane people cares about outcomes, not frameworks.",

If you have a family, you’re definitely going to feel the pinch.Housing prices generally *suck* if you want to buy a home in one of the suburbs and don’t want to live in either a sketchy area (hi, Lewisville and Farmer’s Branch) or in a new build on the irritatingly distant periphery of the metroplex (hi there McKinney, Forney, and Midlothian), but if you can put up with either of those conditions then you can absolutely afford a home. Lewisville’s actually gentrifying swiftly, so housing there might be a good investment if you find the right area.If you want to live around more young people, your places to look at are Victory Park, Uptown/West Village, and Lower Greenville.What industry is the company in?

So for your current use case, sure. I would however advise you to consider that what your stakeholders consider to be current data and what you consider to be current data may not be the same thing. So, for example, if you're doing dimensional modeling and you're choosing to only use current data in your dim tables, you're missing out on what could be critical information for each fact line in the time that it was loaded. For example, if they want to track customer activations and deactivations, you would use a historical dim customer table for that. So as long as you have this in mind and are prepared to shift to historical dim tables when these requests come up, you should be fine. Regardless, because you are retaining that history at the raw source layer, you'll be fine. It just might be extra work later on.I think I've said you'll be fine enough times here :)",

Now that you mention it, adapting those \"micro-optimizations\" ideas into ETL runtime behavior makes a lot of sense.Would love to brainstorm further, especially how to better \"normalize\" feedback signals over time despite different ingestion profiles.

Be careful with blasting too much. Get help from an LLM and tailor your CV for each post so that you hit a good amount of keywords (this seems to be the best advice atm - in the past, spraying and praying was more than fine, but it seems to be losing effectiveness)",

Before I list my comments, please note I DO NOT work for Coalesce, my comments are strictly from a person that loves Coalesce and has demonstrated high ROI in the last 3 years with the product. Coalesce is built for tech and non-tech users that want to quickly build data transformation, machine learning, and/or Cortex pipelines by means of an intuitive point & click interface. Documentation is automatically generated in Coalesce as you create nodes. There are so many other features about Coalesce that I love. But your question is about version control, so I'll stop rambling about my love for Coalesce. Within Coalesce, each project is assigned a Git repo and branch. Every single change can be committed or rolled back. There is also a nifty AI commit message generator that saves several seconds when checking in changes. The change control window in Coalesce is similar to Git - it has two panels that show your modifications vs the last committed version and the changes are highlighted. As for committing all changes or line item, it really depends on how frequently you commit. In my experience, I typically commit every time I make a considerable change to a node (dimension, stage, fact, etc.). I don't commit if I change a single column because that is a bunch of overhead in my opinion.",

I think if these were my only two choices, I would go with dbt given it has a very large community and therefore finding resources would be easier.

Honestly with data stacks maturing line between data analyst and data engineers will keep getting fuzzier so it is good that you have background in data analysis and experience in data engineering.From an interview perspective:1. Doing a job and demonstrating that you can do a job are two different things. Interviews test the later skill so specifically prepare for that.2. Prepare well for interviews from concepts as well as experience perspective. If the entire team got impacted see if there are good peer interviewers so you folks can practice interviews.3. Do self mock interviews and apply for roles that are data related.It will take time but you will eventually get a job.All the best!",

You can read about the different types of joins spark does (shuffle, broadcast etc) and even use hints in your SQL or pyspark to force a certain one.SQL and pandas and spark have a lot of differences, but one thing that’s helped me is learning the fundamental data structures at play. SQL databases use a B-tree for its index, so if I 10x my data size, my reads are only 2x slower. Parquet uses a bloom filter so you can filter it with a WHERE clause extremely quickly. Chapter 3 of designing data intensive applications goes into this.Related to this, one neat optimizations databases do is use statistics for query optimization. For example, if you have [HyperLogLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperLogLog) statistics, the query optimizer can get more accurate cardinality estimates on your data. This can really help if you have many joins. There’s a good paper from Meta and others (including Pandas creator Wes McKinney) going into the differences between all of these systems, and it gives a good overview of what needs to happen between you submitting a query and getting data back: https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p2679-pedreira.pdf",

What data products you support require real time. This can usually reduce the scope of the streaming data you need to manage in real time.2. For your data products that don’t require real time, you can instead land the streaming data in an object store like s3 and point ClickHouse at that. If you efficiently partition the data, you could easily maybe run hourly (or however frequent you need to add data to your historical analytics) batches to bring in new data.",

That means that all your existing non Iceberg data, even if already parquet, has to be rewritten in Iceberg format. The data itself will end up as parquet files, but these parquet files will be located and structured according to the Iceberg spec. 2. If your new data arrives as parquet files on S3, you'll have to configure some kind of pipeline to detect new files and INSERT/MERGE them into existing Iceberg tables. I recommended to someone on here recently to use a cron or lambda in conjunction with Athena to accomplish this. There are many ways to approach this. 3. Yes! a lot of engines support reading Iceberg (and Delta Lake). Particularly if you are using AWS Glue as a catalog. You can leverage Iceberg tables in Redshift, Spark, Athena, Trino, Snowflake, Clickhouse, and a few others if you have Iceberg tables cataloged with AWS Glue. Only a subset can do write to tables.",

In order to do anything with it, you need a data engine that understands the protocol and can read/write from it. Historically, only Spark really understood this protocol (because all the logic for this protocol was written in a .jar). Nowadays, other engines are slowly catching on. 2. Yep — if a new parquet file drops somewhere, you’re going to need to run some kind of job with your data engine of choice to read that file and write the data into your iceberg table. No magic here unfortunately and different engines might do this differently :(3. Now here’s the real kicker… if you want the latest and greatest features in Iceberg I would argue (very sadly) that Spark is the only engine that can do the newest stuff. Iceberg itself is pretty much just developed against Spark, and there is even logic in Spark that doesn’t follow the Iceberg spec that other engines have had to follow because of how ubiquitous Spark-written iceberg tables are in the wild :(The problem is that the iceberg protocol itself is very complex, and all the logic for adhering to the spec was originally written for the JVM. So only JVM tools such as Spark can leverage the latest features. That being said though there is tremendous progress being made in other ecosystems such as the PyIceberg ecosystem and iceberg-rust that are promising. We leverage PyIceberg for reads/writes of metadata (but do our own data reads/writes) which so far seems to be a great compromise :)",

Your data science major is already aligned well, and adding that stats minor would definitely be beneficial - DE roles often require understanding the statistical needs of the data scientists you'll support.A Master's isn't necessary right away - your current experience + degree should be enough to land entry-level DE roles. I'd take that guaranteed offer as a backup but still apply for 2026 internships at companies with strong DE teams.

        "body": "The short answer is clustering can be beneficial when inserting records if implemented correctly. The long answer:Columnar storage in general (not just BigQuery) is usually stored as read-only files that have built in metadata describing what data is in each column. This allows for more efficient filtering at the file level. It is slightly more complex than this when it comes to a Data Warehouse like BigQuery, but generally when you “merge” a record into columnar storage, you can think about the operation like this:1. Search for the file your data is potentially in based on file metadata2. If the record could be in a file based on the metadata, read the existing data in to memory3. Find the matching rows in each column4. Update them if they exist5. Overwrite the existing file in storage and update the file metadata if a record was insertedClustering improves look up speed in this process by making it more efficient to find the right file to operate on. For instance, let’s say you have a table of product purchases with a reference to the customer who made the purchase. This table has mutable attributes like product delivery date (NULL until it has been delivered) that need to be updated on delivery of the product. An appropriate clustering field for this table might be customer_id, which would logically group all purchases by the associated customer_id when writing to a file. This way, instead of needing to read potentially every file in the table in to memory to try and find a purchase to update, it is able to read in only a select file or two. In order to take advantage of this, you would need to use the customer_id in the merge predicate.",

I don't know how Duck is as a cache compared to Redis. In this case you're storing whatever local chart data which I'm guessing are just rows local to a chart as the value and then the key is the chart instance or something? What's the lookup speed for that?Edit:[https://flask-caching.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#custom-cache-backends](https://flask-caching.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#custom-cache-backends)Looking at the docs I guess someone with more experience with flask backends could comment",

You'll learn a lot more actually writing code rather than learning concepts.In my opinion, programming is an inverted university learning experience. Traditionally, you have a lot of barriers when it comes to actually \"doing\" at university and you spend a lot of time learning theory instead e.g. I studied chemistry so had very limited time in a lab because I can't really do lab chemistry in my room although not much could stop me from picking up a book and practicing understanding reaction mechanisms. Similarly, I couldn't spend 12 hours a day running reactions or practicing using instruments because materials cost money, there's limited space, you need supervision etc.Conversely, you could learn none of the things you've mentioned and begin practicing writing and running code right now. The only barrier programming has to the practical component is yourself and your imagination.",

Understanding key concepts like data granularity and aggregation, joins, data structures, modeling, etc is all use case agnostic. Which tool you use depends on how your data is structured.

A second, more focused on data warehousing is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1j9lyg8/comment/mheoy1h/?context=3).Understand the difference between operational data (where flows are important, the data sizes smaller and response time is critical) and analytic data (large to huge dataset sizes, storage costs become a factor). Most of the analytic data in the cloud is in 1NF(-ish) style and as such limits what can be done with it without starting over. Most cloud tools have a sweet spot that is in the operational spectrum.Sorry for all the links, but data is a huge subject. It is far bigger than the nuances of any programming language. It is very rare for screwing up in a program gets you fined or thrown in jail. Getting fired is the low end of the scale. Data screwups have the potential for all of them.",

But, the process of learning how to write clean code helps you learn how to think about complex problems: how to break them up into self-contained modules, and make them flexible enough to accommodate the expected changes, but not so overly complex that you have a Factory to make Factories, when you're only going to end up using one instance of it anyway.Depending on what you're actually doing from day to day as a DE, you may not need to develop the ability to craft enterprise level OOP code, but being able to understand and read OOP code is a pretty important foundational skill.

If the hash key is different between the two tables, you now know which records have “updated”.Drop those customer IDs from the dataframe with current table data, then union in the “new” rows from your fresh data.Overwrite the whole table back to target.Not ideal if you have massive data, but should work.If you do have very big data, id suggest start looking into Delta etc. and go that way",

I feel the advice is pretty straightforward here. You just need to plough on and actually back yourself. If you can't even be confident of your own skills or at least hungry enough to understand that you need to fake confidence in the application stage, it's not going to be very fun in the interview.",

Then when you’ve worked at the same firm for 3-5 years across a variety of domains, you’ll be well equipped to move onto another consultancy (with new domains again), or a ‘regular’ job. Many/most people become consultants, work across some different domains, then go regular or do their own thing. The consultancy world is often seen as an education phase of a career.Consultancies also put you in a good position to use your network down the road because you know so many people. It all depends on what you want, though. Being bored is unfortunately a part of every job. Do you want to be bored for 10% of the time? Or 100% (which gets worse)?Keep in mind that being a consultant is though for many people and you never work with bleeding edge stuff :)This is all just my opinion and from my experience.",

Your company's approach of separating regular and sensitive data into different data lakes makes a lot of sense. Having a dedicated sensitive development environment with controlled access to that sensitive data lake is a solid practice many organizations follow.For employee data, workers comp, and other sensitive non-health information, there are different regulatory considerations than HIPAA (like GDPR, CCPA, or industry-specific regulations depending on your sector). The separation approach you described is similar to what I've seen at companies with mature data governance. It balances the need for developers to work with realistic data while maintaining appropriate controls around sensitive information.",

We need to develop code on data that actually represents prod because prod is so locked down no individual user can test, everything in prod is set up with service accounts and would require several acts of God to run a test in prod.This all ends with us having some paper exceptions written out and we get prod data in dev to test or read only prod accounts.

By tethering that mart to something downstream you lose the flexibility to make changes to support a business process without breaking another. From a technical side, a frakenmodel like that will be susceptible to performance issues and should likely be written for the exact intended purpose. If what was the mart becomes a new int model that is useful for the new mart model being made fine. Reducing redundant code is never a bad idea but marts should be redundant in terms of data delivered not data transformed.The only time I have ever joined marts into a new mart is when all of them aim to serve the same business process (maybe a dashboard that has a few pages for each of the mart models and one page involved too complicated logic that I didn’t want DA’s fooling with so I made another mart)",

Though there are a good amount of 3rd party tools which have some nifty methods.Native to Snowflake, I'd lean heavily on \\`INFER\\_SCHEMA\\` here. [https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/infer\\_schema](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/functions/infer_schema) but please try to understand the limitations.This assumes you are staging your data from its raw store, which may be incorrect. However, if this is true you can have a single task managing scd's: SELECT * FROM TABLE ( INFER_SCHEMA ( LOCATION => '@your_stage/path_to_files/', FILE_FORMAT => 'my_csv_format' ) );Better yet you can create a table from stage with: CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE your_table USING TEMPLATE ( SELECT ARRAY_AGG(OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(*)) FROM TABLE ( INFER_SCHEMA( LOCATION => '@your_stage/path_to_files/', FILE_FORMAT => 'my_csv_format' ) ) );This will essentially automatically add the fields for the table -- see documentation above. You can also do something like: ALTER TABLE your_existing_table SET ENABLE_SCHEMA_EVOLUTION = TRUE;On an existing table and then any \\`COPY INTO\\` would automatically track and gracefully handle schema changes. **\\*There are limitations, so please read the docs carefully\\*.** This should dramatically reduce your dynamic SQL needs to the point where only your mart/dwh layers should have to alter their SQL, but it would depend highly on any unknown complexities.If your data is being ingested directly to a raw table and not a stage -- your options become a bit more limited to probably what you are already doing without any 3rd party tooling or some large SP / Task doing the bulk of the work.The greater answer to your overall post is likely -- tasks aren't the wrong choice, but there are probably better options.

Languages are tools, concepts translate between them. If you master one, then you'll stand out vs. others who mastered none, and you'll pick up any language required of you on the job in weeks.- DSA classes & Leetcode. Most important part of CS due to how interviews are structured. Do 250 most common LC problems and focus on easy/medium unless targetting FAANG for first job.- Build practical projects. Initially start simple, like that easy react page you created. You learn by doing 10x faster than tutorial hell. You need to learn how to structure your own projects and build something from A to Z, from having an idea to breaking it down in small parts and building it out (without guidance provided in tutorials).- Project structure for bigger applications, everything has its own place and the quicker you start modulating projects the way they do in production the faster you'll grow.- Find a specialization and focus on it. Try simple projects: react frontend page you did, then try building a backend API with CRUD, try building a simple ETL pipeline for data, then try a simple github CI/CD with github actions and dockerize one of the apps. Nothing complex. Cover basics of each, build them in a few days, and then ask yourself: which one seems most interesting to you, which one seems like something you'd like to pursue?Specialization matters heavily. Everyone spreads themselves thin, and if your goal is to achieve what CS grads do in 4 years, you should pick something early on and master one area. Become employable in it asap, enter the field and learn rest on the job.I went for full-stack Python+TypeScript React. Docker & Github Actions. Learning Next.js and Kubernetes now.",

Rarely are there rigorous dives into the properties of the underlying enabling abstractions. If you are learning these at a university, the typical course names are calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, complex variables, nonlinear dynamics.Then there’s the math that's just about uncovering the deep underlying properties of abstractions. Everything is built from first principles, rigorously, no details overlooked. Definitions/theorems/proofs are the focus. Computation is an afterthought. Typical university course names are real analysis, abstract algebra, topology, formal logic.The former will improve your ability to program, but the latter will really improve your ability to program, come upwith algorithms, general mathematical reasoning and much more at the expense of increased difficulty.Personally, rudin’s intro to real analysis (principles of mathematical analysis, or colloquially, baby rudin) changed my life. In particular, theorem 2.40 changed how I thought about pretty much everything. Theorem 2.40 says every infinite set of circles that contains a rectangle has a finite subset that also contains the rectangle. It turns out this truth eventually leads to the fundamental theorem of calculus.",

These days automatic transmissions are faster than humans can shift and nearly as reliable with less and less horsepower loss as the years go by. What your instructors are getting at is similar. C and Rust are cars with manual transmissions or in computer terms manual memory management. C#, Java, and the node.js platform are automated memory management languages. Manually controlling gears, downshifting into a corner, clutch kicking when you want the ass end of your car to slide, and dumping the clutch for a nasty burnout are things you can only do in a stickshift. Similarly, manually allocating heap (and stack) memory, directly accessing processor register information, running online assembly and other features are only possible in systems languages like C and Rust. Most people just want to get to work and back safely which is why most cars these days are automatic. Business software (and jobs) are the exact same. Businesses don't want to hire you to write a compiler or window manager. They probably want a crud app that is fast enough and doesnt look awful. You can do a lot, these days most, types of serious software development in memory managed languages (automatic) like c# and Java. If you don't believe me ask Microsoft who uses one of the most hated languages of all time (javascript) to power their most important communications app (Teams).Build things with the tools you have and know and then if you actually can't build something you need using the tools you already have then you pickup and learn a new tool.",

All of these things you can also do from C. Many of these things you can also do from Rust and other languages that compile to native code, but not all of them.1. Call native operating system APIs directly. If you're on Windows, go to [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/) and explore the tens of thousands of APIs. The ONLY way to call these APIs directly is from a compiled language like C++. If you call them from any other language you're just calling some wrapper function that calls the function from C. That's even true for C#, even today there are some Windows APIs that you can't call from C#. Some specific examples below.2. Memory mapping. Let's say you have a 1 GB file. In C++ you can memory map that to an array of bytes with 1 billion elements. The memory map function returns almost instantly, it doesn't copy the file into RAM. When you access byte 777,000, it doesn't read the previous 700 thousand bytes, it just reads only one small chunk of the file from disk into memory at the moment you access it.3. Shared memory. You can have multiple processes on the same computer that \"share\" a chunk of memory directly. To communicate they don't need to copy huge data structures back and forth if they don't want to.4. Hardware drivers. Using C++ you can write directly to a memory address, or read directly from a memory address. Most hardware peripherals are entirely controlled this way, by communicating via nothing other than accessing special memory addresses plus hardware interrupts to let you know when something changed. On a modern operating system you can only do this if you write a kernel driver, but if you get an embedded development kit you can write bare-metal code that talks to keyboards, sound chips, push buttons, or whatever just using direct memory reads and writes.5. Hooking system functions / injecting code into other processes. For example on Windows, write a DLL that provides an alternate implementation of some common function like ShowWindow, then inject that DLL into some other process so every time they call ShowWindow, it actually calls your function instead.",

And if you look through it, you will very quickly find little \"baby projects\" that could be made that are very C++-specific. For example, let's look at the list for concurrency:> \\[2\\] Write a program with two threads: one that writes \"hello\" every second and one that writes \"world!\" every second.>\\[3\\] Time a loop. Write out the time in milliseconds. Do this for the default setting of your compiler and for a setting using an optimizer (e.g., −O2 or \"release\"). Be careful not to have the optimizer eliminate your whole loop as dead code because you did not use a result.>\\[4\\] Repeat the histogram drawing example from §5.6.3 for a normal\\_distribution and 30 rows.>\\[5\\] Use a regex to find all decimal numbers in a file. So, on that list, \\[2\\] and \\[3\\] \\*could\\* be done in Python, but they would not make sense. The issues that Mr Stroustrup is trying to teach here (e.g. how concurrency works on the OS or hardware level) is probably best observable in C++. Also for \\[3\\] this is purely a C/C++ thing. Python turns code into bytecode in a completely different way. I very doubt that Python does loop elimination or anything like that, for example. Also, to properly do all parts of \\[3\\], you will also need to look at the assembly language output of your code to see what optimizations your compiler is doing (and to really verify whether it is eliminating loops, and under what conditions it does that).Exercises \\[4\\] and \\[5\\] probably could be done in any language, of course Python would be an easy language to use for \\[5\\]. I'm not sure why Stroustrup placed these exercises in the concurrency section. Maybe he mentioned those topics in the same book chapter for some reason.",

        "body": "I've won hackathons before. Best tip is to practice with an existing team, as a team, and do mock hackathons. If you know react, and what packages to download, you can build something in less than 12 hours. First 4 hours might be planning and reading the docs, 4 hours of sleep, 4 hours to clean up and submit. 12 hours of productive coding. We can break down the 12 hours even further if you want, but assume also each team member knows what they are doing and we can do it in parallel. Initialize the git repo, frontend, backend and database on local host with a decided framework. Database can be hosted on the cloud. Frontend is probably react, or vue, with tailwind css or bootstrap as the UI framework or use another one with copy and paste components. Backend can be flask or django, or if you want, ignore backend completely and just connect frontend to the database directly. (don't do this with real production code). (takes around 1-2 hours) Your team of four starts splitting up work. One or two guys start working on frontend with the UI framework. One guy working on util libraries and business logic as well as api and webhooks. Another guy working on the database. You may have a floater or a guy that finished early to do merges and resolving merge conflicts. (3-6 hours)Working in parallel will require constantly preplanning what tasks are important that have a lot of other tasks dependent on it and which tasks have a lot of dependencies itself. (but at this point you should be polishing up) (3-6 hours) Cloud hosting is quick and easy nowadays, should only take 1-2 hours. It might take a while to figure out the dockerfile and which cloud hosting platform will help the most.If you know what you are doing, and use existing open source frameworks and solutions, you can cut down the time spent writing boilerplate code and just focus on connecting API calls and endpoints. ----# Just a few tips 1. Already find your team of four and practice with them before the competition. Treat it like a war game if you want. Go into what if scenarios and try and build real projects together. 2. Look into the hackathons previous winners and losers from previous hackathons. Try and figure out how the judges pick the winners. Do the judges really care about ML technologies? or do they just care about fancy UI? Some judges care about how many microservices you used and/or how big your techstack us. Do a lot of preplanning to figure out what the judges like. 3. As the competition gets near, usually company names start appearing, judges names start appearing, as well as the challenge names. Do a lot of research on the companies and judges. If you wanna score points from a company, look into what API libraries they might want you to use. If you want to score points with a judges, and they are industry or professor, do a challenge that they can relate to. 4. Never rebuild the wheel. Use other people's code. Use open source frameworks and code from github.No hackathon winner will ever build their entire stack. The use frameworks and existing solutions. The only thing they will build themselves are the connections between the frontend and the backend as well as the business logic. 5. Add as much techstack and bloat as you can. Host it on a bunch of microservices, use OAuth, host it on the cloud. Add infinite horizontal scaling. Judges for some reason like that, even if it does nothing for your app. 6. The app doesn't even have to work. It only needs to seem like it works. --- Winning hackathons is a specific skill, and only some of it is transferable to actual industry. Over representing your app to judges probably isn't something you will do in industry, and hard coding stuff is probably something you won't do. But the best tip is to just practice and get good at using other people's code.",

Shadcn seems to be quite popular and praised by many people. Bootstrap has forever been amazing for creating a quick frontend without knowing anything about CSS.I personally have never attended one, and have no real clue what types of software people usually develop during them, but I honestly can’t imagine how making a website in 48 hours is impressive in any way (apart from beautiful design, which I don’t count as technical skills).",

Without those skills, you can't get any experience, so it's a necessary part of the puzzle! But the tech boom of the last decade or so has meant a **lot** of people have learnt some coding skills, so jobs increasingly require both skills **and** experience.>how the heck does programming even work? What the hell is happening?Think about a simple circuit, with a battery, a push button and a lightbulb: you press the button, the lightbulb switches on; you unpress the button, it switches off.Now imagine you have a 7-segment LCD display (like the ones on digital clocks that display numbers): that's just 7 versions of the same thing, so in order to display the number \"5\" on your screen, you need to press and unpress the right combinations of 7 buttons. But that's really annoying, so instead, you create a mega-button labelled \"5\", and just wire it so that when you press the \"5\" button, it press and unpresses all the right buttons for you. Congratulations: you have abstracted away the electronics, and now you have a simpler interface.Programming is just that: abstractions upon abstractions. You can't write a \"hello world\" program by interfacing with the monitor directly - mapping each key on your keyboard to the setting and unsetting of individual pixels - primarily because that would be insane. It would be like my 7-button example above, but trillions of buttons. Computers would be utterly unusable without abstractions to handle all that for us.>I know I could probably just import a GUI library and use it, but I don't want to just use a library, I want to understand how this technical stuff (that my school didn't teach) works.Firstly, don't blame your school for not teaching you how to build a computer from scratch out of transistors and diodes. That's like complaining that your school allowed you to buy pens and notebooks, rather than teaching you how to grind your own ink, whittle your own quill, fell your own tree and process it into paper. If you're really, deeply interested in that, then you **can** work towards it: it's not a bad thing to do, it's just a very niche thing to do. For most people, as they transition from school to work, they should really be focusing on what they need to do / learn / practise to make their skills **productive**. That means learn to use common, widely-supported, easy libraries, and delve behind the scenes when they stop being able to do what you need them to do.",

I'd done a lot of professional programming before I got my degree (decades ago, when one could more easily get work without a degree). I didn't start on my degree until I was 30. To me, nearly every class-required programming project until my senior year looked like a toy project to me.*(The one project that wasn't a toy project was insanely big and complex, most people dropped out of the class doing that project, myself included, and the three people who did finish the class had to spend an extra semester beyond the one semester the class was supposed to take to get the classwork done.)*Not to brag (okay, yes, very clearly to brag) I graduated at the top of my class in Computer Science. I couldn't help but feel my classmates were in for a rude shock when they had to do real-world coding projects.What helped me feel more prepared is that programming had been a hobby of mine since high school. Even before I got my first programming job I had already, just for fun, done stuff much more complicated than I had to do to get a Bachelor's degree in college.This is not to say I didn't learn anything useful in college. I most certainly did. I gained a lot more discipline and perspective on coding than I had hacking away on my own.It helps if you actually enjoy creating software and aren't just after a degree because it seems like a good way to make money. If you've got that kind of interest, I'd suggest jumping in to help on some open-source project that interests you, or just come up with your own projects that pique your interest. Challenge yourself. Find things that keep pushing the edge of what you know how to do so you're always learning something new as you go along.This is not to say you won't be able to get a job and work your way up while learning on the job. Clearly many people with your same educational background get jobs at companies prepared to train fresh graduates. Then again, if AI starts to take over some of the more basic, routine work, those opportunities might begin to shrink.I retired just a couple of years ago, but I'm still coding away. I'm writing this response right now while taking a break from an open-source project that I'm hoping to contribute to.",

Generating code is easy, maintaining and extending it is the hard part.I got a bachelor of computer science in my earlier 30s, so it's not too late. However, your impression of how great it can be might not vary as much as you anticipate unless you are lucky.I use the word lucky depending on where you live. Depending on the area you live, country etc. it can be quite difficult get in the *right* job. In many ways I have been lucky due to my autonomy at work, but the actual coding part is like 10% of the time many cases. Tasks won't be well defined. Communication is extra overall including meetings. You'll work on code made by others that is weird. You'll work with people that might not share your views on coding standards. My worry is that you don't know anywhere near what a developer job would encompass and it wouldn't be nowhere near as fun as personal projects. What I would possible do in your case is to extend and improve your current work by automation with code, and not just no-code tools, but actual coding as well. Python would be great for this for example. When you have some real-world coding projects and experience, maybe then you can go further.I'd hesitate making the jump before you have done a side-gig of coding, or getting to know it much more than what you know now.

With modern frameworks and development methodologies, and especially the advancements PHP itself has made over the years, it has improved, and it's definitely possible to write perfectly fine programs with it, no doubt about it. But it still remains a mess at its core. I'm saying this as someone who has worked with it for decades, wrote articles defending it, and who's still the top answerer of all time in the Stack Overflow PHP tag.If you compare it to properly designed languages which are internally consistent and not full of pitfalls, everything in PHP just feels like a dirty hack. Again, while you _can_ build perfectly fine stuff with it… why not use a better language?IMO, the only thing PHP does better than any other language is the seamless integration into HTML pages. Which is how it got started anyway, and why it's so easy to pick up, and why it's become so popular. Because the progression from dicking around with HTML to adding some programming to said HTML is seamless and easy and likely a natural gateway drug for many. But even modern PHP frameworks don't use this strength of PHP anymore, they use separate template engines like any other language does too. So I see little reason to choose PHP for any new project; except if it's the only language you know.",

You can push to a stack and then do another loop to pop everything from the stack, or you can write backwards to memory locations.But the most elegant solution imho is to use recursion. Divide, recurse if remainder is not 0, then print the current char. This will automatically get the order right.The code is for my own forth-like language, so not sure if it's readable for anyone except me (\".\" Is \"print current signed stack value as ascii string\"; \"u.\" is afaik not a standard function, but an often used internal helper function to print an unsigned number. \"divmod\" is a thin wrapper around the x86 div instruction, which calculates both division and remainder)```: u.10divmoddupifu.elsedropthen'0'+emit;```",

In every discipline, It's often necessary to write down your thoughts in order to keep track of them. This is why societies transitioned from having oral traditions to having a wealth of literature, which then grew into diverse disciplines. Thinking is harder than intuition, so it's necessary to use tools to help you keep track of  everything you think of before its garbage collected by forgetfulness.",

        "body": "\\> I'll just memorise the syntaxThe reason you're struggling is because memorising has nothing to do with programming. Now programmers do indirectly memorise syntax, but it's only because this is a byproduct of understand the syntax.This would be my suggestion:1. Take an example of some C++ code from the internet.2. Open a text editor and type in the code. Don't copy and paste the code. The typing will help you to remember things.3. Run the code through a compiler making sure it compiles and runs. Understand what the running code is doing.4. Now go back to the editor and write one or more lines of comment for every line code in the file. Tie some of the comments back to the behaviour you saw when you ran the code.5. Now go back to step 1 and repeat this for another dozen or so different examples.Those 12 examples could easily be a day's work, only because you will need to research each and every line of code so that you can write the line of comment for code that makes sense and is accurate. But what you should also find; as you loop through more examples that process of adding a comment get easier; you should also find the typing gets easier and is more accurate.Now if you repeat this for two or three weeks, you'll find your way on the way to being a programmer.And using this approach you can actually measure your progress. If after one week you're still struggling to write a line of comment for each line of code, then you really have not learned much. Over those many examples there will be many common lines of code, meaning the comments will also be common. It is the details found in those comments that you are trying to memorise, not the code.PS: For context, here are some examples typical line comments. But in general, these comments should also span more than one line.// import the iostream. This defines the standard input/output stream objects\\#include // write the hello world string to standard output using the cout object and don't forget the end of line characterstd::cout << \"Hello World!\" << std::endl;",

This notion is borderline absurd, obviously. I have to assume that either (a) a jar is defined by \"what java will accept\" - which would not be entirely unexpected, or (b) the distinction is hidden inside that word \"essentially\", which would also not be unexpected.But yeah, a jar is a zip file, yes you can put anything in a zip file, and no, I don't expect that all zip files will count valid jars under any reasonable definition.> Any drawbacks to that instead of just using a .zip then?

So for example if a project builds with gcc, clang, and MSVC they might wait until all three support all of the syntax, but if the project only needs to run on one platform with one toolchain they might upgrade sooner.Allowing features from a newer C++ rarely means updating all existing code. Parts of the code that are stable and haven't changed in a while might still be written in an older style, including a pre-C++11 style.So if you joined a company today and got put on a C++ project, my expectation would be that it supports and allows C++20 (which has been stable in all compilers for a while), does not support C++23 (most compilers have incomplete support, the average project doesn't want to be bleeding-edge), but that lots of the code doesn't take advantage of newer features where it could because nobody has bothered to rewrite it.Newer versions of C++ standardize things like networking and threading that were previously only available from third-party libraries. I think use of those in existing projects is low, because most existing projects already use a different library that works fine, so why change something that works?",

C++20 sees a pretty even spit into thirds of \"Allowed,\" \"Partially Allowed,\" and \"Not Allowed.\" And C++23 is mostly Not Allowed.For what it's worth, even if you *wanted* to use C++20 or later, there's a good chance that your compiler doesn't even support its full feature set, the compiler version available to you is out of date and doesn't support the full feature set, your build system (generator) doesn't support the full feature set, or the build system (generator) version available to you is out of date and doesn't support the full feature set.",

It works until it doesn’t. What I generally advise is to learn how to debug into vendor code when you need to and favor stacks that provide tooling and vendors who provide symbols for doing that instead of closed source obfuscated everything. A good team can trace and work around bugs in things they did not create. I’ll mention that .net tooling tends to do this very well. So do some js framework projects that provide original, documented source for debugging. That’s really all you can do.",

Then try and find it online, many universities still have old lectures on YouTube from the pandemic days. edx is also a great source, for a lot of the courses you only pay if you want to take the exam, but enrolling and access to lectures is free. Also, if there is a university near to where you live and the class groups are big, you can probably just walk in and listen in the lectures without anyone noticing. If you want to specifically choose a stack/language, make a list of the companies that you see yourself applying to and see what they are using. Try and build your own project, if you have the chance, attend hackathons and similar events. Companies that sponsor them have a booth usually, and you can introduce yourself, leave contact information. The important thing is participating and talking to people, do your best on the project, but don't worry if you don't have a winning idea.

But true learning happens when you plan a product yourself:Think deeply about what you’re building.Decide which technologies are feasible for your project (for example, whether to use a relational or non-relational database).Don't just pick technologies (frameworks, languages, libraries, tools) because they’re trendy or in demand.Question everything — ask yourself, \"Is using technology X really necessary for my project?\"Also, don't just copy GPT's code without understanding what's actually happening.I’m not against using GPT — it's an amazing tool to work efficiently nowadays — but make sure it doesn't compromise your concepts and fundamentals, especially when you're still in the learning stage.As for understanding how a web application works:Make sure your fundamentals are strong:DBMS (Database Management Systems)Computer NetworksOOPS (Object-Oriented Programming Concepts)Basic programming principlesDon't waste time binge-watching endless tutorials.

When it comes to bioinformatics, a lot of people have put their projects into a Python library that you can use. It will let you stand on the shoulders of giants in order to do what you want to do, and save you a LOT of time.C is great, but you'll have to deal with memory management. C could be a great second language to learn low-level programming, but not to start with. Ruby would be great for things like web development, but it's also getting up there in age. Unless there's a \"library\" (someone else's code they've put in a package for you to use) that's only available in Ruby, I would stay away from it.Also, it may be worth looking into Anaconda and seeing if that doesn't do what you want to do. It may be a great place to start coding, and it also may be everything you need. Also I could be wrong about what you're working on, but you may end up finding R to be helpful at some point (it's pretty easy to pick up though, especially after learning something like Python).",

Also consider your definition of a \"project\".A project does not have to be large. And if you do have a larger project in mind, you can probably break it down into smaller ones. When I was writing file parsers as part of an automated test tool (it took in a file describing expected values and various data recording files), I studied parsing techniques. I wrote a variety of one-off programs that parsed the various input file formats and then turned them into libraries that could be used by the actual target program. Each one of these took me 1-5 days (some formats were simple, others were not, by the end I was able to reuse code as well for similar formats), then I integrated them into my main program and glued it all together and had a beta version for my colleagues.What I didn't do was try to implement all the parsers all at once (context switching between each task) or only write them as part of the main program with no way to evaluate my partially working system. By setting them up as these one-offs I was able to stay focused, generate some tests, and figure out if I really was parsing the data correctly (mostly taking the parsed data and regenerating the original files and comparing the two).If you have multiple projects that you want to complete, set deadlines. Decide that \"By 15 May I want project X to have features A, B, and C.\" Then do it. If there's no external driver of priority (no work or school objective, all personal) you declare your priorities. Otherwise everything is the same priority and no progress is ever made. Even for work I do this. If I have a 12-month project with no one deciding which features needed to be done by a particular date, I just set them myself. If the customer/user didn't like my ordering I'd ask for their priorities and if they still didn't give them (or everything was #1) then I stuck to my plan. Having deadlines and desired partial states for the project work very well to keep things moving along.",

That means every single language your company uses, every single tool, framework, or library - all of it needs to be secure, and the security team is ultimately responsible for it.Now, if you work on a security team then you might specialize. One person might focus on web security, another on SQL injections, and another on mobile. But in my experience that's not very common unless you have a very large company. At most smaller companies, everyone in security has to know a little bit about everything.Remember, security is only as strong as its weakest link. Let's say your company has a mobile app, a web app, and a backend running in AWS with a Postgres database. All of them need to be secure. If just a single one is insecure and can be hacked, that brings the whole company down and it doesn't matter how secure everything else was.Honestly that's one of the things that makes security fun. You don't stay in your small lane, you get to work on literally everything. Your job is to catch any potential vulnerabilities wherever they might be, before hackers do first.",

Python has built in docstrings, `help()`, `dir()`, `breakpoint()`, an `inspect` module, and fairly standardized reprs so you can tell what you're working with in the REPL, and standard ways of doing that for your own code. Lua doesn't even have a built-in way to print a table out; you have to loop over it yourself. That makes Python much easier to work with than Lua.Python is mostly made of objects backed by dicts, with some primitives, so it's pretty similar to Lua that way, once you wrap your head around classes, which are not *that* much more complicated than metatables.",

This includes goddamn function arguments- despite arrays not really existing, there is still a length operator- indices starting at 1 ... but ofc. since arrays and maps, sorry *\"tables\"* are the same thing you can still *assign* to `tablename[0]`- another consequence of this absurdness is this completely valid assignment: ´arr[-42] = \"oh uh\"`- tables are also conflated with objects: `t[\"name\"]` and `t.name` both work the same. Not even Python is that stupid.- without `local`, assignments default to the nearest var of the same name. If there isn't one, they default to global. Meaning, accidentially generating or overwriting global state is really easy. Combine that with the silent nil-derefing, and you see why debugging Lua feels about as good as a papercut.- only the last arg to functions works as a vararg, but you can still put a vararg before the last...and silently get everything but the first argument dropped- general syntactic idiocy: the `:` pseudo-accessor, the `..` operator, the `#` operator. The lang has `not` as a boolean operator, but somehow `~=` (not-equal) is a thing. The `end` keyword to end blocks with. We an exponential operator `^` but no increment/decrement operators- metatables, aka. what happens when someone thinks: *\"Hey, how about we take the worst ideas from prototyping and class based OOP, and mush them together by shoehorning them into the only data structure we cared to build into our pseudo language!\"*- Since there aren't really objects (everything is a table), you can actually call an \"object\" method passing a different object as `self`- `break` exists, but `continue` does not- strings assume the unicode table ends at 255, therefore, strings are really byte arrays. meaning, handling unicode requires libs- despite tables being the only datastructure, there is no built-in way to copy a table- despite having pseudo-exceptions (`error()` and `pcall`), tons of built ins refuse to use them, returning `nil` instead",

Unless your goal is to research new algorithms, then those are indeed all of the steps - and yet there's an enormous amount of nuance and complexity hidden there.1. Bring in the data - this part is easy if someone else has already done the hard work of collecting the data, but in many real-world scenarios the data hasn't been collected yet, so this might involve building apps, sites, custom tools, scrapers, whatever is necessary to collect the data for your particular application.2. Clean and prepare - this can be quite subtle and nuanced. If you accidentally bring in any features that are biased or correlated with the class you're trying to predict, your model will overfit and you might not realize it until months later when it fails to work in production.3. Call the class of algorithm and fit - this seems easy when all of your data fits in RAM, but once you start trying to train on hundreds of terabytes worth of data, this is no longer simple. Also, when you have to wait days to train instead of minutes or hours, it becomes far more important to figure out how to validate your approach on smaller subsets first before trying to train on everything.4. Predict - in most real-world scenarios you're not just calling predict once, you're trying to take that model and embed it into an app so that it can do real-time predictions. This means figuring out how to take a lot of the cleaning and preparing steps from training and recreating them in some other environment, plus dealing with all sorts of other error cases.",

For databases it’s either SQL or MongoDB mostly. Also if you haven’t already for APIs look into REST and GraphQL. For mobile I’ve seen a lot of Kotlin/Java. And if you want to do graphics or game programming C++ and C# are common. More niche languages might be Haskell for finance for example.",

The free code camp video was from 2021 and used an older version of C++ which Vs code was not liking for some reason. I'll find out why when I know C++ Please let me know if you come across any other good resources Alternatively pivot to the CS50 to learn the basics of coding.

The good news is, once you realize how one language runs with editor and the relationships of editor,IDE, library and framework. U know everything. I spent on c# for two years. The rest languages I only spent 4 months. Of course you should know how to interact with AI and recognize the error of its answer. You should know read the doc by yourself and find what's going wrong with your code. It's a long road but I hope you can insist. Day by days training is very importantFirst, insist 1 hour per day.

It makes the actual changes hard to trace due to all the noise, though I think it may be configured to ignore the formatting changes your repo and admin may not be up to dealing with that.My advice is to have the conversation... tell them you want to apply THIS style (pick a standard one you like) to the code as you are working, and that you will do TWO check ins -- the first one will be format fixing the files you are working with, and the second one the changes to the code. See if they are open to this sort of thing... a blanket \"THIS UPDATE ONLY CHANGES CODE FORMATTING\" on the check-in merge should prevent anyone from needing to look at that entire commit, and your code changes can be evaluated without fuss. Show them a sample of the code formatted and unformatted, the worst piece you have worked on and can lay to hand, and walk them through why formatting helps you work on it easier. Let them know that the reformatting is done by a tool in seconds and won't cut into your productivity at all (if possible, demonstrate it). Make the hard sell, defend it, convince them.",

The one we use also doesn't have any built in precompiler so you have to be really careful when you code or use an external ide and copy it over. And errors in the code can really break flows and strategies for handling them have a lot of nuanceThe thing I'm worried about is I'm not sure how many of their quirks translate from platform to platform - and as they are considered low code or no code, employers often don't put huge emphasis on having experience with the tools (though at least with the BPMN tool we're using it would be wise)",

That being said, low code environs can be massively helpful in niche fields like computational geometry where having visual feedback for geometry manipulation is - I'd say - almost mandatory.From what I've seen so far - no-code or low code tech seems to thrive in cases where (a) the majority of the users aren't programmers, and (b) outputs from these technologies aren't the deliverables in and of themselves.By deliverables I mean the end product being shipped/deployed/put into production.For example, in the construction industry - architects and engineers will frequently use no-code solutions to build quick and dirty prototypes for their projects. But these prototypes aren't the deliverable, the drawings and 3d models are. They'll use the prototypes as seeds/base for building mode complex models sure, but the direct output from a no-code or low code solution is rarely ever passed on as the actual deliverable.To sum it all up - For a typical career in programming, I feel you don't really need it (outside of cases where using them speeds up the feedback loop). But if you go into niche fields like game development and/or 3d modelling, then you'll encounter them sooner or later, but you don't need to know them beforehand to get used to them.",

        "body": "POV: I've taught CS for many years, including general programming and APIs.APIs are a specific style of data transfer, which is a variation of input and output. So what you're wanting to learn is a particular style of programming. That's a good goal, but you need to learn general programming concepts before you can comprehend a specific subset of coding. There are two distinct ways of thinking about APIs, and both depend on some knowledge of core programming ideas. First, you can write a program in any language that *consumes* an API. That is, you can write a program that uses an API to find the current weather in Barbados. This is a relatively straightforward process in most languages, but typically you learn this after you've learned more fundamental things, like how to get information from the user or from local files, how to handle looping and branching, and how to write functions.The other way to think about APIs is to *produce* an API. In that sense, you are writing a program that lives on some type of server that produces data in some kind of machine-readable format (usually JSON, but other formats are certainly viable). This is also not a difficult process, but it requires knowledge of essential programming concepts, and typically you'll also want to write a front-end package to test your API. I would say start with any good programming course. There's a good reason Python is taught as a first language in most CS courses. It's reasonably straightforward, and is excellent for a number of use cases, including working with APIs. You can read and create APIs with Python out of the box, but for creating an API, you'd probably be better off using a library like flask, bottle, or rapidAPI. I would definitely learn standard programming ideas first before digging into libraries. Express.js is fine, but it's a specialized form of JavaScript that doesn't make any sense if you don't already know how to program in vanilla JS. It seems to me that CodeAcademy has a more organized curriculum. It doesn't go straight into using APIs, but that is fine. If you can't drive yet, race cars don't matter. Learn to program in a language, then we can focus on the particular skills you want. FreeCodeCamp is great for looking up a specific skill, but it often makes a lot of assumptions about what you already know. I have some videos of my own I can send you, so DM me if you want that.",

And finally another reason to write a function is because you have a sort of generalized object but the way that it specializes to your case it uses a lambda function, if you haven't learned them yet they are very useful.",

I do think it'd be good for you to bookmark this question and check back in on yourself in several years once you start working a real software development job because this might be an interesting question to find yourself laughing at. *Depending* on what kind of work you land, there's a high chance that you'll *very rarely* look at a `main` function very often at all. *But*... the same concept of what you're asking about exists. And I'll tell you, I'm pretty sure there are just two different kinds of programmers and I don't think there's a major problem with either approach *as long as* the people with your approach are making sure to clean it up as they go. *Personally*, I find myself thinking contract-first. Regardless of *specific* guts any given function (or class or anything) needs, what is the contract it makes with the outside world. If I want to calculate the distance between two sets of latitude & longitude coordinates... I may not yet know exactly how to correctly calculate that... but figuring out the exact contract I want for handing that work off to a function is pretty trivial: func calculateDistance(from: Coordinate, to: Coordinate) -> Distance { return 0 }(for whatever syntax you need for your language) If I chunk my application up in this way, I can write the main flow of `main` or whatever into this smaller bites and start with an organized structure of code that I just need to go back and fill in little chunks bit by bit.If it's easier for you to implement all the logic first *then* slice chunks off to move into functions, I think that's *also* fine.... but it also means the contracts, the interface, becomes kind of an afterthought *and* it means your first pass likely has you non-obviously duplicating some code.",

This massively increases adoption and helps you get grants and sponsorships \\- Build it for you first; everyone else comes second otherwise you lose grasp of the visionBasically:\\- No one will use it if the documentation sucks or if the github looks dead \\- Integrating with other tools is the fastest way to grow since you are tapping into existing userbases \\- During downtime or if you get writers block, use your framework as a content creation engine...this gets you views and also helps you apply for grants etcAs for resources:\\- Look up \"Commercial Open Source Software\", even if the point isn't to make money it helps you understand how big frameworks gain momentum \\- Keep an eye out for fellowships and foundations, eg I received over $15k in grants from Processing Fellowship alone by integrating with p5.js and three.js",

Because people think that \"longer is better\" for books, movies, games and, of course, online courses, so if you are going to spend 9.99 in a 10 hour course and 9.99 in a 100 hour course you instinctively buy the longer one because it's \"more bang for your buck\". However, most of the time it's not really worth it, many times they are hours of watching someone type something endlessly, or repeating the same stuff again and again.On the other hand, YouTube creators want to keep you interested, and the one way they find is to remove all the \"boring stuff\" from courses. For example, by the end of the first lesson you probably can already write a web page even if you don't even know the basics of programming, but it's important for them to give the viewer a sense of accomplishment. These courses skip most of the \"boring\" but \"fundamental\" stuff so that you don't get bored, so that you can feel you are advancing even if, instead of becoming a programmer, you are becoming a specific language user.",

A lot of programmers still neckbeard their way through epic Jedi v. Sith, Star Wars v.

For the daily love message: You would GET a daily message from a file, use a bool to check if it has been used already, and if FALSE: display the message and SET it to TRUE (used). If TRUE, skip it and GET the next message.This is probably the most simple of your ideas. It's a great way to learn, and the steepest learning curve is at the beginning. Break the problem into small chunks and solve them one at a time.If you don't mind the messages repeating themselves, you could just store the strings in an array and select one at random every day to display. No file is needed here, just your compiled program.Best of luck! Google is your best friend.",

The hard thing would be the last project, purely because of what the goal is (I am assuming one a day without needing to interact with the program)The Java API is very well documented and organized, you will probably want to look into notification windows or other UI elements to display the message. The other thing would be to run the program in the background, ask for help to set it up so it doesn’t use too much memory, or can periodically do resets, and start up when the pc reboots. This way the messages are still given to him without having to be reminded. Anything beyond using the built in UI library I would say is not beginner friendly, but general enough you can ask for help or copy existing stuff from examples like calendars or task trackers. Using the UI(user interface) would be a challenge but nothing unfriendly for Java and is good practice for using the API.As for Java friendly, I’d say using Java for the first two is good for learning Java, but the last one is very much Java friendly because of Java’s tools and usability , at least compared to the other languages I know.(Java was my first language, so I am very biased and probably sentimental)",

It helps us think clearly and communicate precisely.Our motto? “If you can’t draw a simple model to show what you mean, you don’t know what you’re doing.” Had an intern once say he couldn’t show his idea in UML—meeting got pushed to the next day, and he was told to come back with diagrams.

        "body": "Python is a good start and is enough to understand programming concepts.To be completely fair, the most important concepts you need to learn have nothing to do with actual programming or languages. Those are your foundations - Data Structures, Algorithms, Networking, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems, Databases. There’s a very good reason most universities focus on theory for the first two years of a CS degree, and not so much on coding. Learning these will make you understand programming as a whole. After that, any language will be equally valuable to you.To answer the question. I’d say, after learning Python well, you can either go useful, frontend or lower level (well every other language is lower level but that’s not the point).If you want to find a job as quickly as possible, learn Java or C#. Those languages are by far the most used in the industry and there’s never lack in demand (keep in mind that there is also a lot of supply). If you choose this option, you have to know that you’ll also most definitely need to learn their respective web frameworks - Spring and .NET, as they are pretty much required by the job market. This is a very good path to take and I can highly recommend it. Also, keep in mind that there’s a very good chance you circle around to Java/C#, even if you choose a different path now, since these are one of the most essential languages and are taught and used everywhere.Another popular route is to master JavaScript and become a capable full-stack developer. That’s also where React comes in. React is a JavaScript framework used for simplifying the way to build responsive web interfaces. I think there will be time in the future to worry about frontend, so I wouldn’t choose learning JavaScript at your current stage.Finally, the lower level route. I personally encourage any beginner to go deep into the land of pointers because you gain soo much more understanding of the way a computer works, than you do by using Python or JavaScript. For this I recommend you go with either C or C++ (personally, I’d go with C). These languages are what we call “lower level” because they don’t have fancy built in features to simplify the hard stuff and you have to think a lot more about everything. Those languages have no “garbage collection” meaning you need to allocate your own memory, and you need to free it when you don’t use it anymore. They use pointers to reference the data you use. C has no Object Oriented Programming, meaning you can only encapsulated data using a “struct”, and you can’t have methods tied to that data (procedural programming).",

What happens if you try to open something that isn't an image?What happens if you try to save the changes to a location that doesn't exist?What happens if you mark a file as readonly (via the operating system) and then try to save using your application? You might look at writing a simple text editor as well, that allows doing the basics of formatting (font families, colours, sizes, etc). These seem like simple concepts, but if you really sit down to write them, you'll find you need to analyze issues and work out solutions.Good luck.",

You are stepping into a global market where you will be competing with people who have years of experience, full portfolios, and plenty of client reviews. Platforms like Upwork are crowded, and getting your first job there can take a long time unless you already have something that makes you stand out.In your case, it might be smarter to focus on getting a regular full-time developer job first. That gives you some structure, experience, and something real to put on your resume. And if your long-term goal is to work remotely, you can still work toward that in parallel.That is the path I ended up taking. I spent months applying to \"remote\" jobs that seemed like a perfect fit, only to find out they were limited to one country, or I got automatically rejected because of my location. Eventually, I realized I had to take a different approach and decided to get an on-site job first. Then, I started researching companies that actually hire globally. After over 200 hours of research and trying to apply to hundreds of jobs, I ended up building a list of 300 truly remote-first companies. In a nutshell, it sounds like you are taking a smart approach already, and just getting started with real experience is most likely the best first step.",

FizzBuzz is just an easy, dumb problem [to see if a candidate knows enough to at least solve an easy, dumb problem](https://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/). We all have our favorite little solutions, but if you can write a function with a loop and a few \\`if\\` statements, you're done.>However, the above link doesn't explain why the hashmap solution is more efficient.Hashmaps trade space for time. They offer O(1) time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions, which is to say that you can find, add, or remove an element in constant time regardless of whether it contains 5 elements, 5 thousand, or 5 million. But they get that speed by using enough space to avoid collisions (where different keys hash to the same location) most of the time, so they're very efficient in time, much less so in space.>I've heard that in technical job interview problems, if you can use a hashmap, then you should. Would you agree with this?Certainly not. Use the right data structure for the job. Hashmaps are often a great choice, because if you can get constant-time access to every element, that's pretty appealing. But hashmaps are unordered, so a poor choice if you want to access elements in order. They use a ton of space, so not great if there's a space constraint or if the number of elements is huge. And they don't handle multiple values for a single key. Maybe those are reasons that you \"can't\" use a hashmap, but I'd still turn it around and say that if you *need* what a hashmap offers, then you should use it; if a different structure offers a better combination of features, you should use that instead.",

In that case, just using hashmaps everywhere is probably better than not knowing what to do at all. In the end, you'll probably do better by learning some basic data structures and writing programs with them, then using your own brain to decide what is easier, nicer, and more efficient.",

It is truly a misunderstanding of epic proportions that everyone thinks they should \"learn\" how to solve FizzBuzz to prepare for an interview ...Anyways, the third solution with the hashmap, is **NOT a solution for the FizzBuzz problem**, but a generic \"engine\" that can solve any kind of similar problems where you have some specific value, and if a number is divisible by that value, it should print a specific word instead - combining all the words to one compound word, if the number is divisible by all of them. None of the code will change if you add Jazz for divisible by 7, only the datastructure (the hashmap).*And it is poorly written, violates the \"single source of truth\" and ironically makes the code harder to maintain, which was the exact point of using a hashmap in the first place.*Please don't write ultra-generic code in your interview or in your professional life - I had a colleague once, that wrote some code to handle which days of the week some system should be active. He made it flexible enough to handle if a week ever had more than 7 days, or if there were by chance two Thursdays ...Also, don't trust Geeksforgeeks - their code and article-text often don't match, in this example the text mentions Jazz for 7, but none of the code examples implement it.

        "body": "Big O, `O()`, is an **abstraction** to help us _estimate_ algorithm complexity, performance, and scalability. * In _theory_ there is no difference between theory and implementation. * In _implementation_ there can be a HUGE difference.Like all abstractions the devil is in the (implementation) details.The reason we DO count instruction cycles when profiling is because it gives us an absolute time that we can use to compare against. We can compare:* _actual_ **run-time** time versus the* _expected_ **theoretical** best case. That is, we can do A vs B comparisons such as A is `X%` faster or `Y%` slower to answer the question: _Is our optimization helping, hindering, or neither?_But oftentimes we want to know HOW an algorithm scales up relative to input size. `O()` is an _estimate_ of this which may, or may NOT, be accurate:If we have three algorithms that all perform the same task and have this scaling ... * O( n )* O( n^K )* O( K^n )... then the linear `O( n )` algorithm is probably going to be the fastest, by far, all things considered.However `O()` IGNORES RAM speed, RAMaccess patterns, and branch prediction -- all which MAY be factors!The _reason_ this was done was that pre-2000's CPU speed and RAM speed roughly had a 1:1 mapping. We used to store calculations in tables because the computation speed was SO slow.However by the 2000's CPU speeds became significantly faster than RAM. As CPU speeds increased and RAM didn't (as much) it became faster to calculate more, lookup less.Unfortunately Computer Science textbooks never got the memo that `O()` has COMPLETELY failed to adapt to the changing hardware and performance uplifts of modern systems. **It is an INCOMPLETE metric.**Let's take a [simple example](https://github.com/Michaelangel007/cache_line_speed) of summing up entries in an array. sum = 0; for( int col = 0; col < STRIDE; col++ ) for( int row = 0; row < SIZE; row += col ) sum = data[ row + col ];_Normally_ stride is 1, sequential acess, but what if it isn't?We can change the stride to show HOW we access data (and the data cache) plays more and more of a role the larger the data set.For example with an array of 2^30 elements (1,073,741,824) we see this falloff:| Stride | Op/s | Time ||--:|--:|--:|| 1 | 1 G/s | 00:00:00s || 2 | 1 G/s | 00:00:00s || 4 | 733 M/s | 00:00:01s || 8 | 388 M/s | 00:00:02s || 16 | 213 M/s | 00:00:04s || 32 | 141 M/s | 00:00:07s || 64| 116 M/s | 00:00:08s || 128 | 115 M/s | 00:00:08s || 256 | 115 M/s | 00:00:08s || 512 | 100 M/s | 00:00:10s | | 1024 | 66 M/s | 00:00:15s |EXACT same O(n) but HUGE differences in the Real World^TM.HOW we access this array matters! This is why ... * AoS (Array of Structs) and * SoA (Struct or Arrays) ... can have such a HUGE difference even though we are iterating over the _same_ data. **All those cache misses add up to slower performance.** This demonstrating O() IS incomplete for modern algorithms.In modern performance programming, often times we want a _branchless algorithm_ as we are _trading latency for throughput._ We want to keep the CPU pipeline saturated with work and not cause pipeline bubbles or flushes via branching.There are 3 categories of optimizations from slowest to fastest:1. **Micro-optimization** or [Bit Twiddling Hacks](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html). On older compilers and slower CPUs you would replace `MOD` with `AND` for powers of two, division with multiplication and bit shifts. i.e. Calculating `7*n` as `n + 2*n + 4*n` -- assuming your CPU even has a `MUL` instruction!2. **Algorithm.** Using a faster algorithm used to be the second step in optimization . We would use `O()` as a guideline for performance/scalability.3. **Macro-optimization** or Cache-Oriented aka Data-Oriented Design (DOD). As we deal with larger data sets optimizing for _minimizing cache misses_ becomes more important.See [CppCon 2019: Matt Godbolt “Path Tracing Three Ways: A Study of C++ Style”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG6c4Kwbv4I) where OOP, FP, and DOD is compared.",

If you come from something like react and spring it'll feel really familiar. Except every single thing you do has a Salesforce spin to it. They use lightning web components instead of just web components. They use apex classes instead of Java (they look and behave very similarly but it's not nearly as fleshed out). They use SOQL (Salesforce object query language) which is a lot like SQL but not as fleshed out. I ended up getting really frustrated by these limitations and changed roles in like 7 months. Then it may have just been my org but we used provar for testing which is cancer.

Don't ever think you will know everything about a language either. It is constantly changing and it is quite vast. You also don't need to be a full on python wizard to get into AI. Learn a few basic ideas about AI concepts like models, tokenization, how AI reasons and plug them into what you are learning from Python. Remember that much of the AI landscape is built with the idea that it will work with Python and all you lack right now is the practice to merge the two. Find a free online course for AI for beginners and make sure it is paired up with some project work using Python and you will be well on your way.",

        "body": "It's just syntax.`var` isn't a pointer, it's a label. `[var]` isn't a value nor a deceleration, it's a dereference of `var`'s pointer. Assembly expects you to be explicit, and it's impossible to IMAGINE all the things that would break if you changed it.It's not that - theoretically - assembly couldn't have been written so `var` always explicitly references the pointer and `[var]` always explicitly references the value, but that's not how it played out and it's not how assembly functions under the hood.This is pretty common in every language and language-syntax. There's always things that seem like they should work, that don't seem to conflict with anything else, that simply don't work.For example, in JS we have what's called \"optional chaining\". We can use optional chaining to access an existing property's value, but we can't use it to assign values to an existing property, nor to create properties w/ assignments (if the property doesn't already exist). Why not? Seems like it'd work.But it doesn't, it isn't that simple, and making it work would short-circuit all sorts of other things JS does. However, I do believe there are some JS proposals to add \"optional chaining for assignment\" to the spec. But assembly is way lower-level; it's nearly raw processor instructions. There's no public, ever-changing spec, where proposals are made like with JS.",

        "body": "I'm not really satisfied with other posters' answers. There are two important facts they seem to be missing:- Not accepting \"MOV AX, var\" is a quirk of your assembler. \"MOV AX, var\" works fine in my preferred assembler, [NASM](https://www.nasm.us/).- \"LEA AX, [var]\" is semantically equivalent [1] to \"MOV AX, var\" but they are actually different instructions! [2]You can prove LEA and MOV are different by looking at their binary representation (for example if you use a disassembler, or check into your assembler's command-line syntax to discover how to make a listing file). The bytes for each instruction are: 8D063412 LEA AX,[0x1234] B83412 MOV AX,0x1234My personal opinion is that your assembler sucks. If you're doing this for a class, you probably have to live with the professor's choice of tooling. For your own projects, I recommend looking into NASM. (I hear the cool people are using [yasm](https://github.com/yasm/yasm) these days, but I've never used it so I have no personal opinion on it.)Out of curiosity, what assembler are you using?[1] By \"semantically equivalent\" I mean they have the same effects on the registers and flags.[2] The reason LEA exists is to let programmers use indexed addressing modes for calculations instead of memory access. `LEA AX,[0x1234]` and `LEA AX,[BX]` are functionally equivalent to MOV instructions, but `LEA AX,[BX+DI+0x1234]` does a calculation that can't be accomplished with any other single instruction.Experimenting with LEA can be maddening if you don't understand it. That's because 16-bit LEA will only let you use certain register combinations, you can only combine one of {BX, BP} with one of {SI, DI}. (This was a hardware decision of the chip designers, and applies to all address arguments.) With 32-bit assembly in the [386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386), they added a whole extra byte to the encoding of indexed addressing modes (SIB, scale-index-base). So in 32-bit 386 assembly you can use any registers, and they even added the ability to multiply one of the registers by a constant factor of 2, 4, or 8. So the 32-bit instruction `LEA EAX,[ECX+4*EDX+0x1234]` is legal, but its 16-bit equivalent `LEA AX,[CX+4*DX+0x1234]` is not.",

Could be as simple as a comment, or renaming a variable, or as complex as adding a [README.md](http://README.md) or shooting a short Loom to capture some knowledge.",

It'll quickly become very obvious which parts of the docs work and which parts need work. Do this a few times (as new employees join) and the docs will get better with each pass.Of course, the code itself may have comments, but docs also encompass much more than that -- e.g. how do you set up the dev environment? How do deployments work? How do you use source control? Is there a glossary of terms that are used by the codebase? Are there links to auxiliary tools like a bug tracker, wiki, etc?You can also look at popular open source projects to see what kind of docs other projects write, although some projects have bad documentation (but maybe they can still serve as examples of what not to do).",

Opinions vary on whether or not using \"interfaces\" is a good way to go, both sides have good arguments IMO.Stepping back, *why* do you need runtime polymorphism? Is there a design that doesn't require it? In this case, you can probably get away with instantiating each importer you want, and selecting a concrete implementation to be used based on file type, something like this:```// No virtualclass AssimpImporter { void importByFile(); };class StbImporter { void importByFile(); };// Top-level \"importer\" facadeclass Importer { public: void importByFile() { if (assimp_importer_.supports(file_type)) assimp_importer_.importByFile(); else if (stb_importer_.supports(file_type)) stb_importer_.importByFile(); // ... } private: AssimpImporter assimp_importer_; StbImporter stb_importer_;};```If you need some compile-time polymorphism, C++ concepts are a sort of weird duck-type-y tool you can use too:```templateconcept MeshImporter = requires(T a){ { a.importByFile() } -> std::same_as;};class AssimpImporter { public: void importByFile() {}};static_assert(MeshImporter);templatevoid doFancyMeshImportThings(T* importer, File file) { importer.importByFile();}```",

There are ways to do \"polymorphism\" without doing real polymorphism, I implemented a worker class, and I can use it to spin up what I call workers and lazy workers, all the worker class does is manage thread state, but the worker class implements both of these workers just using different static functions, the lazy worker has a std::thread::yield call in there to yield cpu time to other threads of higher importance, I mostly use lazy workers for jobs that I need started at some point in the next few milliseconds but not exactly right away.",

What did you not consider? How is the solution interpreting the problem? These are questions you have to ask when looking at a solution.

If your memory is a bit weak, the code it up when you see the solution. The next day, code it up again, without looking at the solution. If you can't recall, then that solution isn't helpful to the next one.This should be used for fairly simple situations. If you have to do tons of configuration and the setup is complicated, I'd have a cheatsheet that I can refer to later on.It's hard to figure out stuff you didn't even know could happen.

It is equivalent to asking lawyers \"Is there a way to see that all my arguments are correct and I'll never lose a case at trial?\"You absolutely will learn over time ways to design better (if you have not looked into the concept of \"design patterns\" that's probably a good starting point), and while experienced developers won't make the same dumb mistakes beginners make, they'll still have to go back and redo things pretty frequently. And that's not even including the times it is completely beyond your control, like a client making a dramatic swerve on their requirements after your team has already completed a lot of work!A chief skill you'll have to develop is the mental toughness to keep plugging away even when it gets frustrating.",

I like to write unit tests alongside the code so it’s easier to maintain and I can catch gotchas early on. Other than that, make your functions as simple as possible so any changes you have to make later on can be easily integrated. You’ll find a lot of functions can actually be split up into two or three smaller functions, which in turn make unit testing them easier. This all takes practice and you’re not going to get it right on your first few apps. You will get incrementally better and notice later on how much better you’ve approached a problem than you would have before. Don’t be too hard on yourself. You’ll get there.",

However, I don't consider this a wasted effort, as it all enhances the final product, which will end up becoming far stronger than if I instead made it out of some patched-up frankenstein code base.In the beginning, I think it's important to be willing to start from scratch, or at least completely re-implement large portions of your code. Thing is, if you're afraid of doing that, then it's tough to get started. Chances are, you don't know what your program should look like when you're beginning.Rather than spending hours upon hours on planning something only to later change your mind(or even worse, get attached to your initial idea because you don't want the effort you put into it to go to waste), instead try things out, see what doesn't work, figure out how to make it work better, and so forth, until you arrive as a cohesive whole.Framing the early stages of your project purely as a exploratory learning experience is quite liberating. I think that you should only begin properly implementing the project when you're ready and confident with your design, and I believe that you can only get there by trying things out and figuring out everything that can give you trouble, first hand.",

It helped, and pointed me in the directions I needed, but if someone like my boss, who doesn't know SQL beyond \"SELECT * FROM {table}\", used it he wouldn't have gotten it done without me.A nail gun helps roofers save time over hammering by hand.

And since companies don't like to spend money, they would rather make their senior engineers prompt AI to complete the easy, low-hanging fruit tasks instead of paying me to do them. But unfortunately for aspiring juniors like me, those are the only types of tasks I can actually do from day one with no training. Which puts me in a bind because companies don't want to train juniors, and they also refuse to wait for us to get up to speed on our own so we can eventually make valuable contributions.\"So they're right that AI will replace software engineers. Just... would-be *junior* software engineers, mostly.Their fears are valid.",

What I believe will happen is first people will realise prompts are complex, so we will start to develop standards of how to request things. It will need to be completely unambiguous and understandable so it will essentially just become another high level programming language. The people writing the prompts will still need to understand the software that’s generated so you’ll still need CS knowledge. But that’s not close at all. In the meantime AI is not going to be able to just be thrown at every legacy codebase and understand it by being fed the shitty documentation nobody has maintained in the last 20 years.

As others have pointed out, Intel has not innovated in a while.Back in the 1990s, the thoughts that Motorola would stop producing processors and innovating was absurd. The 68k CPUs drove entire generations of home consoles, not to mention oodles of commercial applications.The fact is, they couldn't keep up with Intel. That's what buried them. Now, if anything, they build ARM designs, no need to innovate. But that's also why you don't find them so prevalent in modern markets. They still do stuff, but the Motorola of the 1990s has been subdivided and chopped up more times than a tin of tomatoes. It never really recovered it's prominence in the processor world, it just makes low key devices, that's why you only sometimes see the Motorola logo gracing various products. They license a lot of it's IP. The question is, what's burying Intel? In the home markets, maybe AMD? Samsung certainly has a major edge against either company's offerings with most of Samsung's fabric being manufactured and designed with far cheaper labour than what the Americans can do. I don't doubt that in 15 years, when we want to build a new home PC, we'll be looking at NVidia and Samsung processors instead of Intel. The current gen of home consoles are sporting AMD and NVidia fabric these days, Intel doesn't even have a shoe in.",

Even though the tool absolutely was tracking stats at the individual-level, they just said they weren't gonna use it.Everyone knew they were gonna use it. We're not stupid.That company used to have an amazing WLB, and then there were a couple C-suite changes and a bunch of upper management changes and not long after those changes this tool was introduced, and the culture went to shit.I found another job by mid-2024.It's nothing inherently wrong with my previous company, or with Microsoft. It's just a culture shift. They went from chill, to micromanagey-PIP-culture. Different strokes, I'm not gonna demand they keep a culture that I like.I always say culture shifts are the *only* inevitable thing in this industry. It's why I recommend if you're at a good employer, you hold onto that employer for as long as they stay good. They *will* change at some point, so cash in while you can. Then when they change, you jump ship, and your salary gets re-adjusted to market rate.I found another company with a great culture/WLB in 2024, and it's still great now. I'm praying it stays good for the long-run. If the culture/WLB stays like it is now I will happily stay here the rest of my career. I'm just not naive enough to think that's very likely.All that's to say.... I'm just not surprised.",

Step two was to disable `@channel` and `@here` notifications in channels where people like to abuse that. Even a channel that you need to pay attention to, you can often treat it more like email and check in every hour or two instead of getting instant notifications.> ...unexpected urgent meetings...If it's an actual production emergency, sure. Short of that, most of this urgency is false. Having to constantly push back is exhausting, but you can, for example, start scheduling blocks of no-meeting time, and start actively declining surprise meetings, until people get the message.> ...late-night pings...Go into Slack and set a notification schedule. If your employer has a separate work phone, give it a Do Not Disturb schedule. If it's your personal phone, you may still have options -- I know on Android, I've had work apps be confined to a \"Work Profile\" where you can push one button to *turn off* all work apps, such that you need a password to turn them back on.If you're oncall, the *only* exception is PagerDuty (or whatever paging app you're using). If it's not enough of an emergency to page you, it can wait. Encourage people to page you if they really need you -- if you need to highlight this as a problem, it'll help to have stats on how much you got paged for non-emergencies.Again, YMMV, but FAANG and FAANG-adjacent shops ultimately care about how you show up when you are working, and how much you actually get done, not how many late-night pings you responded to.That said, I see the appeal of working in a place where the norms *already* value WLB, instead of a place where you have to define and defend it for yourself.",

Talent is seen as less important, both in number and quality. The key to winning is to cut costs and don't do anything to threaten existing revenue streams.Plus, on the talent supply side, my understanding is that CS is hugely popular in colleges. When I was in school CS was seen as an uninteresting little corner that only nerds paid attention to.

When the market is overall doing well and people agree spending money, that Cascades down to every segment of the economy - if you spend more money at restaurants, waiters make more money, so they spend up on Hulu without ads, so SWEs at Hulu get paid more, so they buy a bigger house, and their realtor makes more money, etc.I feel like that's the logical side of the answer.Then there's seemingly just.... vibes.For like 5-10 years, every tech company got into this arms race of spending as much as possible on DS, ML, etc. Like, you couldn't be a tech company and not have an answer when the board of directors asked \"what are we doing in ML?\".I was working at a dino Fortune 500 company - not tech. And I had to put together an entire deck for my boss to tell the board what our ML strategy was. The point is, you couldn't get left behind. Even though the ROI was trash, you had to throw money at it. Most companies had no idea what they were gonna get out of it.And I feel like at some point, that broke. I think Twitter under Elon opened the floodgates - he went the opposite way (let's get rid of bloat) and to a degree it allowed every company to reset. And sure enough, every company immediately took that as an opportunity to pivot into cost savings mode - even though most of these companies are still doing great financially.So when will the job market improve?One answer is when the overall economy starts doing better. Another answer is whenever some sunset of tech companies decide they want to play offense and start spending again to try to separate themselves from the rest",

That increases the number of people looking for jobs.The AI boogeyman is around. I personally think the biggest issue with AI is that people are investing in it more, hoping for big returns. That means companies/people are not investing in other areas. The economy generally does poorly when things are not stable. In the US, we're in a very unstable time.

Follow a consistent problem solving process (you can google around).2. Practice speaking out load through that process when you practice.3. Don't underestimate easy and medium problems, don't skip too far ahead to hard ones.",

I've only ever gotten two questions that completely stumped me (not including the first two coding interviews I completely bombed), and I do NOT consider myself to be particularly good at DSA.My main advice is to work through neetcode.io/practice, and primarily focus on \"replicating his thought process\" as well as verbalizing it. Focus on the video explanations, and really try to replicate how he works through / talks about a problem (but tweak and adjust things if it helps / makes more sense to you).If you feel too pressured, that's a separate and much more personal issue. For me, I treat my coding interviews like teaching / learning opportunities (depending on how much I understand the problem).

Candidates have gotten so good at algorithms that you are expected memorize roughly 40 types of questions and solve several hundred similar algos. This is where the practice comes in. Memorize those base problems and become an algo ninja at it to the point that you can do the breadth, depth, immediately without mistakes on recall in any situation. Room too cold, room too hot, chair too high, mouse not working, with an editor, without an editor etc etc etc...the constraints of what is allowed can always change or the question itself might constrain the approached available to candidate.

People like FAANG because it once you’re in, you have high pay and a well defined trajectory, and you get sheltered from what it means to have a business succeed. The average Google engineer isn’t going to worry about budget, competitors, head count, etc. That’s not normal, because businesses are in constant competition and don’t have unlimited money like Apple, Google, or Meta. You can find jobs at other companies that pay quite well and these companies don’t have LeetCode interviews. Go on Blind or Glassdoor to find these. In theory nothing is wrong with LeetCode. But it’s because the questions you get are random when you interview. It would be more fair if it was like: “you’ll get one tree problem, one sorting problem, and one path finding problem”. But that’s not the case, you can be given literally any problem and be expected to solve it. A very stupid test simply meant to fail most candidates, because you’re expected to know literally every algorithm and data structure. The study has 0 application to your actual job, unless you are studying for some hardcore algorithms or low latency engineer. In which case you’d be told ahead of time which algorithms they expect you to know, etc. Now we have Cursor and other AI IDEs too, these skills are less and less needed.I get contacted by Google and Meta recruiters regularly.

Say something like \"Hey, our company really sucks, you're getting 2%, wish I could've gotten you more but that's not a thing here\"?Probably not a statement that's gonna fly at any large organization.So he does what he can. You're a good performer, he was told good performers get 2%, so he thanked you for your hard work and gave you the exact amount his overlords said he could give you.Don't blame your EM. Blame the corporation. Your EM is just playing the cards they've been dealt.",

The number of times I've seen a team work for eight hours on the wrong task, or a solution that's completely unviable, is nearly equal to the number of days I've worked with Indian engineers.And there's another reason that outsourcing to India sucks: The best developers in India don't want to work under those conditions, and they don't work for $20/hour or whatever you're paying your outsourcing team members. I'm told that many of the junior developers who get hired by outsourcing companies are making $10/day, and it's blatantly obvious that they do just enough work to keep the contact live for as long as possible. None of this is even remotely racism. Put a billion people in an area that has insufficient employment opportunities and you'll find millions who are willing to learn just enough software development to be able to do a crap job in outsourcing as part of a scam to extract money from richer countries. It's human nature. It has nothing to do with their culture or the color of their skin or their accent (though extra strong accents can impede communication, and that's a real problem).Not only that, but scammers running consulting companies run them in the US as well. Several of such companies are well known as defense contractors. Remember the debacle of the Obamacare web site that had something like 50 different consulting companies working on various parts? I'd have a hard time assigning that work to fifty people much less fifty teams. And the result was a disaster.That said, at the low end of developer skill? It may very well be permanent. For the last 30 years it's been bad for lower skill developers more often than it's been good. Higher skill developers are still doing OK even now, at least if we're willing to accept lower salaries. So the question to ask yourself is what your relative skill level is. If you have always been in the bottom of your class or the slowest employee wherever you have worked, it might be best to try for a pivot.(Edits: Fixed auto complete fails)",

They are incentivized to focus on passing the interview rather than long-term transferable skills. I'm sure some of them are good enough for the position, but that isn't always the case.With AI and vibe coding, it's never been easier for mediocre developers to pose as a higher skilled one, especially when you only work remotely. Once the companies start to smell the shit pilings of AI generated code as it starts to cost them in maintenance, we might see a recovery. Until then, just be irreplaceable.",

The 2008 crash we probably didnt fully recover until like 2012 or so. The argument i always make (and i have little actual numbers or data) is that covid made everything ridiculously high. Government was giving out money like candy to any independent worker or business. People were getting money that they didnt deserve to get (some did need it). I didnt deserve a stimulus check tbh, and i got one. In 2020 everybody stayed put to their jobs because they didnt know how the future would look like so it was best to stay put. Then things open up in 2021, companies all have the money to use for hiring so companies of all shapes and sizes ar hiring. Jobs become remote and it looks like remote is the future. But what i think happened was that companies didnt realize how hard it was to hire remote workers and have them quickly learn their codebases. Jr engineers didnt have any camaraderie with their older engineers. Then the free money is gone, people arent spending as much as they did in the high time of covid, and many projects get acwd because small companies can no longer keep up after the government help ended. Bigger companies realize that they can either get a similar engineer for less money or that they overhired in 2021-22 and can fire PIPd employees quicker without having to give severance. Companies have still paused hiring for some time and because of that many people have stayed without a job. I also think potential candidates are too in love with the idea of remote work that anything less than that they are avoiding. But i applied to many jobs and sooke with many recruiters. The consensus i get is that, it’s not fully recovered but it is slowly getting better.",

If we had developed a union or some type of organization to represent us then we would be better prepared for these boom and bust cycles. Unfortunately, the term \"union\" is anathema to most programmers in the United States (who think that'll it'll harm their precious bottom lines). They'd rather blame Indians than blame the ruling class who actually put us in this situation. Engineers in general could shut down the economy overnight if they wanted to. The ruling class of this country knows this, hence they've done everything in their power to keep us divided.

No on-call, and no worries if something broke. They also sent me traveling every month or two, usually to conferences, sometimes to just attend and sometimes to present. As part of the traveling, I went to a bunch of fun events like going to Universal after they closed and go on a bunch of rides with no lines, watching horse races from box seats somewhere in New York, and visiting our Edinburg office for no real reason other than to drink with the locals.It was the life. The pay wasn't great though, and with some management changes I chose to switch to another company that was super stressful :(",

You should be a missionary when you're an owner.This same thing happened to me when I tried to join a recycling start up. Idgaf about recycling, and the CEO asked me directly, \"so tell me how recycling and climate are important to you\". I basically told him I'm interested in doing great engineering work. Jokes on him, now I make 3x the salary they were offering me!These small companies tend to go way too far with hiring on \"alignment\", and think they aren't employers, but facilitating employees to fufil a higher level calling to service that is exactly the same as their. It's such BS. Trust me, you dodged a huge bullet: these guys have no idea what they are doing, and nothing is worse than working with a bunch of incompetents whose biggest credential is \"they care\". It sounds like you care about software, care about leading, and care about building things. If that's not enough, fuck 'em!",

I had enough cash savings to last another 4 months before I’d have to dip into retirement funds or sell anything. That was more than enough time to get another job offer. I’ve also structured my expenses so they are easy to cut out in times of need. I have a lower mortgage, and only one cheap car payment. If I need money I can cancel my gym membership or whatever.Other people struggle because they get laid off, and they can’t lower their expenses much. They already cook most meals at home and most of their spending is high rent/mortgage and a high car payment. Most people also just don’t have emergency funds, which in our field is ridiculous. An old coworker of money got laid off recently and got a new job offer, but due to it being slightly less money and him missing one month of pay he had to immediately sell his house.

It's the corporate equivalent of living paycheck to paycheck, always racing against the clock with no margin for error.While everyone's circumstances differ, in your shoes, I'd slightly dial back efforts to create space for interview prep and resume updates. That way, you can continue saving money while employed and position yourself for a smoother transition. Even if the next job is just as stressful, knowing you're not one deadline away from a sinking ship will buy you more time to look for a more \"relaxed\" job.

Many times, I'll ask the time and space complexity, why they chose DFS over BFS, what changes if you switch, how they'd handle a graph with 1B rows and columns, how they'd implement with a stack/queue/in-line, etc. When the person has a blank stare and can no longer answer, I know they've memorised the solution or they've cheated. If they can answer these questions logically, they're usually a strong hire.People have been cheating for DECADES. Back in the 2000's I heard stories of people aceing the complex Google interview process, turning up on their first day, and someone being confused because they swore the guy they interviewed was Asian. It also wasn't uncommon for some CS classes in some countries to dedicate months towards drill-based repetition of thousands of LC questions, alongside recitals of behavioural answers - over actually learning CS. AI cheating makes it easy, but let's not pretend the interview process that was apparently \"good\" before is suddenly incredibly broken.",

Maybe it's just me, but those kinds of problems they have me do are also things I'd never do in a real world scenario.I would try some \"this or that\" scenarios, providing a situation with 2 or more choices. Make the choice and why.Try a \"fill in the blank\", what's missing from this implementation and \"how would you finish this\" kind of exercise with partial code completed.I'd do some live PR reviews. Show them a PR and ask them to review it.Those things seem much more reflective of daily work activities.",

There's more and more university graduates majoring in CS, on top of all those who did bootcamps or are entering the field with other degrees/backgrounds.At the same time, it's a field prone to periodic off-shoring/outsourcing attempts. The remote work trend only accelerated the current drive of some companies to replace domestic devs/engineers with foreign ones.Understandably, there is a lot of doom and gloom surrounding CS. Some of it warranted. Gone are the times where you apply to 5 companies and get 3 offers. Not that it was ever the rule. But it's certainly more difficult to land *attractive* offers straight from uni.On the flip side, computers are the backbone of practically any modern endeavor. Every year there are more and more CS/IT jobs and the demand steadily rises.I'd recommend doing some research about the field, what kind of jobs are in demand, what kind of jobs attract thousands of applicants vs just a handful, what kind of technologies/languages/CS-adjacent aspects you find interesting.There's also value in subject-matter expertise in combination with CS. And each domain & industry has their own preferred technologies. So keep your eyes open and if so inclined, don't be afraid to look for projects at the intersection of CS and other fields, or focusing on niche domains.",

We came out of a huge hiring spree in 2021-22 and when things normalized it forced the market to produce mass layoffs and slowly reduce hiring. In CS there are a few types of people. There are the ones who love it with a passion, will spend 50-60 hours working each week and creating new tasks for themselves. These are the overachievers who likely will end up working st faang or will dominate their mid-level company because they are the one employee everybody goes to. There are the types who like it but dont want to spend more than 40 hours unless it’s crunch time to finish their stuff. They do what their asked and sometimes they will look for things to do to show some motivation. They will do what the role entails. Then there are the types who also kind of like it but it’s clear it’s mostly for the money. They wont overacheive but theyll try to not underperform. They wont be front and center. There is nothing wrong with being either of the 3. But id say the 3rd person should never be in a job thats too demanding because this person wont have the motivation to do it. Now what i tell people about to start college is that if it’s bad now, the likely hood of it still being this bad in 4 years is low. I dont know how it will look like but is put my money on in that 4 yesrs hiring eill be back, the market will have regulsted and this wont be a big issue in that time. I could be wishful thinking but usually when this has hapoened it tskes a few yesrs to bounce back. I dont think we will be in pre- covid days but we will be on our way back there.",

Update your LinkedIn and resume to highlight the technical skills and projects you've worked on in these 4 months. Focus on what you've learned and built, not the timeline.2. Have a straightforward explanation ready for interviews: \"I joined eager to contribute, but the expectation of 70+ hour weeks without compensation adjustment isn't sustainable long-term.\" Most reasonable hiring managers will understand.3. Target companies known for better work-life balance. Look at Glassdoor reviews and ask direct questions about typical hours during interviews.The market is tough but not impossible. You can use a service like Applyre to do a passive job search. Your experience is valid, and you've already proven you can handle extreme pressure (though you shouldn't have to).",

One productivity mechanism I really rely on is checklists for my TODO items. That said, there's always more work to do than I have time for. If you haven't heard about it, The Eisenhow Matrix is a good tool. Keeping the larger goals and capacity in mind, I'll try to plan my day around a few high impact things I can work on or hopefully get done.Due to the nature of our project, the most important thing in the afternoon is sometimes not what I think is most important in the morning. These are sort of rare days, but I've had maybe 3 or 4 recently where the priorities of the team need to shift, and I'm responsible for getting that done. There's another mental model, the OODA loop that's pretty helpful. For software, that's often means hearing some news or getting more information (observe), putting that in context of the team and the rest of the metrics (orient), deciding and building an action plan to address the issue in the context of what we are currently working on (Decide), and brining it to the team (act). I like the eisenhower/OODA stuff becuase it's both a framework for planning/doing, and a way to respond when those assumptions and priorities which determine the plan change.",

After I noticed physical manifestations of my working habits I decided I needed to change.I started strictly enforcing my professional boundaries from that point on. WLB became my #1 priority in my career. That, and I started forming a very thick barrier between work and my personal life. Work stress stayed at work. After 5pm, I stopped letting my brain think about anything career/work-related. Aftetr 5pm is me time.And you know what happened at work after I started sticking to a strictly 40 hours or less schedule? After I stopped letting deadlines, prod issues, etc follow me into my personal life?Absolutely nothing. I kept getting great performance reviews, and kept getting good raises.That was a very formative moment for me. It happened probably around 6-12 months into my career. And that lesson has been a vital point of the rest of my life. It's *why* WLB is my #1 priority. Seeing how a very simple change in behavior can take me from awful headaches and an inability to sleep, to feeling great outside of work, was a wake up call.So I got there eventually, but 6-12 months of my life could've been a lot better if someone had just told me that lesson versus having to learn it myself. Honestly me back then probably wouldn't have believed the advice anyways. I had to feel the intense negative effects of my behavior.",

I've interviewed many FAANG intern and FTE candidates.People change their career in their 20s, 30s, and beyond all the time. If you become a SWE, you'll probably end up as a people or project manager later in your career anyway. You are very young and have plenty of time. Here's what I would recommend:1. Get a BS in computer science. Any accredited program is sufficient. You don't need to go to an ivy league. 2. Apply for internships, your sophomore and junior years. They don't need to be a top-tier companies, but it helps a lot if they are reputable, household names. Doesn't have to be a tech company, but that certainly helps. (I've recently seen FAANG hires who interned at IBM, FedEx, Walmart, Uber, etc).3. Build s***ty software in your free time. It doesn't need to be elegant perfect code. Just think of a very simple idea and write a solution in code. Then add simple features to it. Refactor and improve your code as you go. This is the foundation of every SWE job. A lot of University students over index on solving LeetCode Hard problems. Then struggle on the job because they've never built an app or system before. You need both skills to get into FAANG.Regarding your IT career, those skills will help you navigate the workplace more efficiently than a new grad. However, it may not give you a leg up in the interview process.",

        "body": "I've worked at a smaller defense contractor (in comparison to Lockheed Martin, for example) and then moved to big tech. I'd say there are two primary advantages of working in defense. One is that you have better WLB as you can't really work at home with a laptop since most of your work has to be done on a clearance computer, so after your 8 hours you just check out which you can't really do at big tech because your laptop is basically expected to be always with you. The second is your job can't be outsourced and you won't be H1B'd either.The disadvantage is that your pay reflects that. Another disadvantage, although this is team based, is that the work we were doing also reflected that - we were using JavaFX in 2022. Like what. IMO, if you have on call or if your WLB is ever compromised in defense, flat out no, definitely not worth it. If you don't, it depends on what you prioritize - do you prefer better job security, but lower pay, or do you prefer less job security, higher pay? I will say that defense as a stepping stone is very good. Getting a clearance is super helpful because it's possible to leverage that into a high tech job which requires a clearance, so you have the higher pay and higher job security.",

Don't try to focus on the product you're working on being dumb or low-impact. A good manager should want to work with you to retain you as talent. Try to formalize exactly what it is you're looking for. If they're unable to satisfy your vision for your future it's fair game to start looking for a new job. But I guess it does sound like the emphasis is the trivialness of the product itself, so if they don't have many options of products to work against then you're probably out of luck and need to find a new employer.",

People meme a lot about bad code/vibe coding and while I do laugh, the same tools that generate the code can also interpret Semgrep or other SAST findings and remediate way faster than you. People who get pwned the hardest don't understand some aspect of system design that ended up being the design flaw AI didn't account for. I do a lot of Appsec and/or cloud security automations and rely heavily on AI to do a lot of the grunt work. I'm spending less time now having to double check work with higher context windows + default OCR capability to analyze diagrams. I can get through a 3500 file three tier web app, build a CI/CD pipeline and use agentic AI to conduct thousands of checks and parse SAST results and do it in hours instead of weeks. Especially in Risk management/compliance (think HIPAA, NIST, etc.) which leans heavy towards documentation and spreadsheets which an agentic workflow rips through. If I had to do it all over again I would have aimed towards Full Stack development. But a pentesting skillset + builder + compliance mix has paid dividends for me. What interests you the most? Careers don't last forever and if you're min/maxing growth you'll need to put in hours outside of work to grow.",

You don't just consider it black box you can't peer inside and must take as a given. And you don't do this because you love it, but because you recognize this is part of your job.When you're more experienced this gets easier because you have a larger body of knowledge to fall back on. It's most painful when you're new, and to be honest a lot of people never get over the hump. This is because it's possible to get by for a while without this curiosity at lower levels. You have to actually choose to put in more work than you necessarily have to at some point.However you reach limits of what you can do without it because at a certain point your job is no longer about doing well defined widget-adjusting tasks, and furthermore this comes more suddenly than you'd think.Most of the times I've seen people flame out in this industry is because they precisely fell into this trap. They got comfortable doing simple things at lower level that didn't require curiosity and ended up digging themselves into a point where it was either psychologically or practically impossible to get up to being a \"grown up\" eng in the timeframe they needed to, because so much of what they were doing was just learning to invoke what may as well have been magic spells by rote.",

This is maybe the middle ground option for you.The obvious downside to rolling your own protocol is that, sooner or later, you probably have to support something other than Dart, and now you have to maintain libraries for both.

Going from the former to the latter is much easier in my experience than the reverse. You at least have a standard base to go off of when implementing proprietary solutions. With the reverse youll find yourself fighting with the standard, trying to translate the proprietary logic properly.> Am I the only one to be unhappy with Protobuf and do I get something wrong about it?There is a github issue complaining about the lack of inheritance in protobuf so you're definitely not the only one unhappy in this regard. The suggestion there was to use composition over inheritance but I don't think that will solve your code size issue. --Overall I think what's happening here is a case of premature optimization. You're worrying about code size and performance too soon without seeing the performance impact here. It's normal for performance for applications to be tested. You shouldn't waste time reinventing the wheel when it's unnecessary. There's a couple factors you should consider. How much time will it take to implement, onboard, and document your protocol? What if you need to change tech stacks? How much does the code size affect your performance? What is the ACTUAL performance? Take into account what I said before. It's easier to go from off the shelf to proprietary than the reverse. Start with off-the-shelf, evaluate the performance, and THEN shift.",

While those big tech names used to be automatic door-openers, now some mid-sized companies seem almost suspicious of candidates with that background. From what I've seen, there's this perception that ex-FAANG folks are either 1) only specialized in narrow areas despite the big company name, 2) will want too much money, or 3) won't adapt well to a smaller company's scrappier environment. The \"So you just wrote some Java?\" comment seems like classic insecurity from the interviewer.Don't remove it from your resume though - that would create weird gaps and honestly most places still see it as valuable. Maybe try addressing these concerns proactively in your cover letters or early interviews by emphasizing why you're specifically interested in their company size/culture. Interview Query has a section on interview guides specific to transitioning between company sizes that might help frame your answers better. The mock interviews there could also help identify if you're accidentally giving off \"big tech\" vibes that are turning off smaller companies.",

The interview was to make some CRUD functionality.If you've worked at FAANG, this is not surprising, but my colleagues who put FAANG on a pedestal got a reality check and probably went too far in the \"everyone at FAANG is bad\" direction.There are a huge number of engineers at FAANG who are very smart and went to very good schools, but are terrible programers.

The expectation is that if you’re from FAANG you’ll blow the interviewers out of the water. Reality is actually different, I have seen hiring managers tank candidates who otherwise passed because they did too much “architecture” and too little coding (in spite of passing the technical rounds”). We tend to have hired Amazon folks mostly from FAANG. I suspect because Amazon has a true high performance culture where it’s sink or swim, so those engineers have real grit and are not afraid to grind or get dirty, but they are looking for new opportunities in a less crowded space (why are 20+ SWEs all working on the same problem, etc.).",

        "body": "I don't have a CS degree, but I do work in tech. You don't need an internship to get employed, but I think there's a more important question here. Do you know what you want to do specifically? If you could work anywhere and do whatever you wanted, what would it be? Even with internships on your resume, something like \"I want a job in tech. Anything is fine\" will turn off employers and your resume will go straight into the trash. Think of what interests you personally.Once you have a solid idea of what companies are ideal for you (because of the work they specialize in), you can build two things that address real problems for it. They don't have to be glamorous but it should be something you work on consistently, at least five days a week. I'll give you a made up example. \"I love dogs and traveling, but I can't bring Fido everywhere since a lot of places don't allow dogs. I don't want to leave him at home during my travels, so I'll make a website where people can find places in an area that are pet-friendly so no one has to leave their four-legged friends at home. After I finish, I'll update my resume and apply to TravelPets ABC since I love their mission.\"Too many people don't know the answer to this question and instead shoot for everything only to end up missing everything. I hope this helps you and anyone else going through something similar.Past work experience: Teacher Coordinator Translator Frontend Dev",

Frontend interviews (not that I've attended many of them) also seem to focus mostly on whether you understand `#selector` or what a particular React or JS construct does, and very little on how to communicate with the backend team on APIs you need.I guess my point is, if you're pure frontend, you're both viewing the world (and being viewed in) a similar light. If you can do some backend, at least, you're much better positioned to talk about how the data gets to the FE. That seems to be called a \"Full stack with FE lean\" in job descriptions these days.That it pays more IMO reflects this aspect of the full stack role. It's worth being able to work on the backend at least a bit, so my recommendation would to be to get into the FS role. (I won't necessarily call it a \"switch\" because a lot of full stack roles do end up being primarily BE or FE)",

It’s unorganized, no documentation on ANYTHING, homegrown stuff that no one knows up from down since a lot of people have left, idk I’m not trying to justify how I feel I just don’t think this place is right for me. Or maybe everywhere is like this, I have no idea. No i definitely can’t ask to stay on one project, and I’m not saying I don’t want to move around EVER, it’s just moving around every 2 weeks is not great and I don’t do well with jumping around so often.

You can meet like minded individuals doing a jam, and get a taste of what game dev is like.And while you're doing all that it's plenty easy to job search and see if there's a change you can easily make.Whatever path you take in this market I for sure wouldn't just quit without another gig lined up",

System administration, DevOps, L2 L3 support, are all going to be open to you if you tailor your resume a bit. You mentioned 10 years of experience as a dev. IMO, you are a prime candidate for something like an application security job. Your years of experience are highly sought after in those roles, and they are always in demand. Just need to sharpen up on some security fundamentals, OWASP top 10, some light hacking skills and you'll be gold. But to answer your question, most of those places don't check degrees anyway, so you can put any other degree if you really want to. On your resume you can put freelance software developer, and just highlight other side hustles you did that align better. Warehouses and places like that hire anybody lol. But I truly believe you can get a job in tech, if you just target a little better. AppSec Is something you can definitely do if you love looking at code. I know you didn't ask for career advice, but I thought I'd just give my two cents.",

The criteria in the tech org was extremely coarse and must have been decided 4+ levels up. I've anecdotally pieced together some criteria of what got you axed: 1. Working on non-critical or internal-facing initiatives **right now** (doesn't matter if you had been with the company for years performing amazingly and recently switched teams)2. High TC (especially if combined with #1) think Architects/Staffs/Sr. Staffs3. If you were on leave (maternity/paternity/medical/sabbatical). Apparently they're allowed to do this if they set your termination date + severance payout *after* you come back from leave4. An actual low-performing team/group that could have its responsibilities absorbed by peer teamsThat last one (performance-related) was the exception and not the rule. I would have hoped there was far more consideration of performance/contribution, but for big cuts like this my guess is it's just too much to evaluate and they can't let the information leak outside of executive level for fear of \"spoiling the surprise.\"",

So worst case, 80%+ of employees are fine after a layoff.Reasons are usually structural, e.g. department doesn't have money making prospects or are redundant (yes, this actually happens). So, yes, you could get canned despite being a high performer, if the thing you're working on isn't deemed to have a healthy future. And, yes, you can \"coast\" in one of the many KTLO corners of a company.Thing is, some of these companies have larger populations than some cities do, so in reality there's a lot of variance in terms of people's experiences. What you hear on the internet is largely echo chambers from the outlier groups.

Even if I do pivot, I will be treated like I'm a junior developer again and be unable to promote because I wasn't able to specialize on the high demand skill sets.For context I am not in the US.

I’d been applying around and had an interview that I didn’t think was a good fit. I think if I had an offer, I’d take it at this point. There’s really no telling what’s going to happen in the next 3 years and as contractors, we can just be let go without severance. It’s a really tough choice to make, but if you feel like your position isn’t safe, pursue other opportunities. I don’t know if you’re feeling this like I am, but after this last wave of DRP/VERA, morale is at an all time low at my agency.

My contract option year is up on May 10 and my manager is working on optioning the final year of my contract before it has to open compete next spring. She mentioned optioning the next year has to be approved by DOGE but that there’s another contractor here they have approved so I’m hopeful I’m good to go.

Those Go microservices and k8s setups are solving specific problems that maybe 15% of companies actually have? Meanwhile the \"uncool\" Java/.NET monoliths are handling billions in transactions daily without breaking a sweat. The reality is most companies don't need the scalability solutions they think they do. I've seen startups over-engineer with 20 microservices when they have like 100 users lol. Your tech stack should match your actual problems, not what's trending on HackerNews. And tbh some of those \"uncool\" problems like proper domain modeling are way more intellectually challenging than debugging yet another k8s config issue.

Welcome to being a reasonable adult. You will never be ready for everything an internship or a job will throw at you. You figure it out as you go.The joke used to be \"fake it till you make it\". Not exactly true, but not exactly false either.There are things that I need to learn every week in my job and I've been doing this for close to 20 years. There's always some new change to a tool or a framework or some new thing that just go introduced, a business process than changed, new requirements from the clients, new compliance consideration, etc.If you are fully qualified, you have a boring job which is very repetitive and you should leave because that type of work will rot your brain.So, words of encouragement:1. Don't have impressive projects? Well, do something about that. Make something. All the tools are free at this point. The only thing holding you back is you. Don't know how to do something? Learn it and then use it.2. The job market is rough, but if you keep at it, make a reasonable plan that lets you have a roof over your head and food in your belly while you search, you will be OK in the long term. You career is decades long. Can you point out the last time we've had a multi-decade economic downturn? No? Good, because that's never happened in the history of this country.",

It's analogous to civil vs electrical, they have some surface level commonalities early on but you have to fully commit to one in order to achieve a minimally employable skillset (and then commit to some amount of effort again if you're going to switch).Within SWE, there's a lot of variance, from the super-competitive big techs of the world to startups that are hungry for scrappy go-getters to \"boring\" F500 industries to the consulting world. Some don't even do DSA questions. Some don't even have recruiters. If you're worried about employability, it's going to be less about which tech field you decide to pivot to and more about how well you can conduct your job search; that in itself is a whole skillset on its own",

I don’t see much talk about people attaining CS degrees with the intention of getting into IT. I wish I could more clearly express my thoughts, but I’m basically asking if I can take time to up-skill after graduation while working in IT and still be considered for a dev job in the future, or if getting into IT is a death sentence.",

        "body": "are you checking r/ExperiencedDevs ? I have 2 Bay Area centered 10 YOE friends who got jobs both through LinkedIn reach out from recruiters. They spent months and didn't have as much luck in beginning of 2024 in doing the cold applications. They've had more luck during the end of 2024, though one moved to NYC. Both based in the Bay. One hired an ex-FAANG recruiter who was a resume writer but basically they both filled in their linkedins and got premium and connected with as many recruiters as they could to start the process, sent some cold messages. Basically SEO gaming to show up higher on a recruiters radius. I think they were averaging between LinkedIn big company applications and startups on Wellfound about 1/50 call backs per application. This included top companies not just FAANG and local + hybrid positions not just remote. Focused on the Bay Area geographically but NYC as well for one of them. One is a former .Net dev the whole time and the other was an embedded systems/C++ developer for half their career, then Data Science focused developer the other half. They both did around 6 months of cold applications, one did maybe 100 since they wanted to make their own cover letters and the other did about 300. Both non FAANG but F500 company SWEs. One BS in CS and one BS in ME, no MS nothing else extra. Some side hobby projects on their Github but apparently no one has looked at those. The both got full time positions again in F500 companies, one as a senior SWE and one as a staff level SWE. So I'm not saying that you don't get call backs from cold applications and you're doing the right thing with applying as soon as possible, but I think your geographic region matters a lot too. A lot of it is just luck. The numbers are insane. We're into a new presidency and past Q1 2025 so things might be looking different in terms of effective advice compared to even 2023 - 2024 which were both brutal for the SWE market. While you do cold applications, polish your LinkedIn profile, increase you SEO with recruiters. You don't need to pay anyone for that, I think the various job search subreddits have a lot of LinkedIn tips all for free. You just need to pay for LinkedIn Premium. I'm averaging 1/100 ratio of applications to call backs as a data engineering applicant with 2 YOE of direct DE experience, though on prem and I'm working with a huge gap of almost 18 months. I only use cover letters on applications to startups on Wellfound or YComb jobs. Otherwise I've just been submitting without a coverletter following the advice posted on r/EngineeringResumes for working on my resume using their wiki and template. I've applied to around 400 jobs, almost all of them directly through the HR portals of the company but a few through easy apply because I saw someone on reddit say it worked for them, totally by chance. I've applied for mostly on site or hybrid positions in most of the major geographic regions of the US. I've had recruiters reach out on linkedin, after I changed my LinkedIn seeing their success. 2 actually, for contract work but better than nothing and if my shitty profile can get it then there's hope for others with even some experience. Also not to shill for a service but to really maximize the cold applications I used hiring cafe because the Job Title + multiple Geo region search was a bigger time saver compared to LinkedIn and just opening all the jobs in new tabs and working through each one, one by one. They have a subreddit as well r/hiringcafe",

Anyway, I’m just saying that short term, yeah, integration and project visibility offers stability. But eventually the project ends, or there’s a new shiny object, or a whole host of stuff. It’s a concern I have now; yes, being part of a major strategic project gives me clout and short term stability.

In academia, you trade salary for intellectual freedom/freedom to choose your work. That's not to say you have boundless freedom---everything you do (research-wise) is modulated by your ability to get a grant to cover it, basically. You may not get to choose what you teach, etc.> If you're someone in academia, do you feel regret?If I hadn't done the PhD, I wouldn't have been exposed to all sorts of interesting people and things. I'm likely exiting academia, but I still don't regret it one bit. I don't see the PhD as a means to an end or a paper degree---I value the experience itself and it had a big impact on my life.> And can you switch ?Academia --> industry is common (the vast majority of PhDs do not stay in academia). Industry --> academia is hard.",

I suspect academia to industry in CS is fairly actually difficult once you're no longer a new PhD -- if you have a high enough profile or connections, moving is probably easy, but if you're just some person with a PhD and a couple years' experience without flashy research output, I suspect it'll be rough. People will know it's your backup plan, you've lost the plausible deniability of \"I've realized academia isn't for me\". (New CS PhDs headed to industry aren't even necessarily deploying their backup plan, which is odd to someone not from CS. It's hilarious the number of times I have had to explain to people that, no, I am a failed mathematician, this was a fallback.)I have taught as an adjunct in a CS department. In the right university, there is the possibility of parlaying industry experience and a PhD into a full-time teaching gig--I moved away, but where I was seriously would have let me teach as many classes as I was willing to, and at a university with a strong adjunct union (there are not many) that can turn into a steady, if low-paying, role.There is no such thing as work life balance in academia. *Maybe* if you have no research obligation\\* you could more or less work 9-5 (assuming no night or weekend classes). I handed in a draft of my dissertation on a Friday afternoon. I remember sitting on my sofa Saturday morning thinking \"I feel weird\". Then I realized this was literally the first time since I was 18 that \"you could be doing math\" wasn't hanging over my head.\\*There are *very few* full-time roles like this. I did take an algorithms course in grad school from a guy who had such a position. I don't think he could get tenure, though.",

Things that seem like they are obvious things that should be a very common scenario are things you have to go digging really deep and experiment to find answers to. Obviously these are an issue in development as well, but I have found DevOps to be an order of magnitude worse. The closest thing I can think of in development is frontend development, where there is a similar lack of discipline and too often too many pieces that are extremely hard to get to play well together. You get nervous to update anything, because even minor updates can break everything.I do find some satisfaction in making things work, but given the choice, I'd rather not do any DevOps work, and would focus more on pure development.",
