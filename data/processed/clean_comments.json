Most files structures / tables probably (hopefully) had some kind of unique identifier but no primary keys.Regarding DRY, this is a not really a database or data modeling concept, it is a development concept. In data modeling, the concept you are looking for is data normalization. A \"dry\" schema is in third normal form or 3NF of higher. Which is 100% related with having a unique identifier.

You don’t want to make sure your 300 billions records are unique every time you add a new row.But the concept of unique identifier should be introduced into almost all tables. That unique identifier is normally a surrogate key. Surrogate key are unique identifier derives from other fields. For example a md5 hash of the concatenation of 4 columns. This give you a unique identifier.What’s great about surrogate keys is that they are not random. You get consistency in any systems, if you migrate to another platform your surrogate keys are still valid and that’s very powerful. Also you can reproduce the same results over and over again, which is not possible if you use a UUID generated by another system for example.Then depending on the tool you use you can validate the uniqueness of the fields yourself. There’s some reason you might want to do this yourself and not the system like you would have in a normal db and is that because you can have multiple time the same records or a different version of what you consider the same records.Since the DW is for analytics you might want to analyze those different records which are not unique in your raw layer but could be in your marts.So it’s a powerful thing to let you control de uniqueness of the fields yourself.Obviously if you don’t manage it you’ll probably end up with a lot of duplicates. But since the DW store all your data it’s better to avoid having the constraint on inserts and give the users more flexibility. Because he might need all version for what he is trying to achieve.TLDR; yep a surrogate key should be something you have in all tables (when possible)",

Most of them are designed to operate at petabyte scale, fyi.It is far preferable performance-wise to resolve inconsistencies at read-time, with deduplication rules, than to do full table scans to ensure unicity with every insert, because read operations are (most of the time) only applied to a subset of the table.Nothing prevents you from applying cleaning strategies yourself on the table though. But you will definitely pay for it.Edit: unless you are only talking about primary keys as data modelling artifacts, with no constraint on storage/querying?",

That's pretty straight forward. A data warehouse is just a very, very large database. There are two different database areas, operational and analytic. They are characterised by the SLAs you have on the data. Smaller databases are normally used for operational because you need fast response times. In analytic, the response times aren't normally as critical but they handle quite a bit more data; much of it historic. In a perfect world, if you could do both with the same system, you would. The problem is the cost to do them all in one. Of course, these are gross oversimplifications but it gets the idea across. In addition to the database component, the surrounding data ecosystems are different but they have many commonalities.Data Lake and Lakehouse are both marketing BS. Nothing more. The same is true of \"medalion architecture.\" It is an attemp to make the standard three tier (staging, core, semantic) into to something different by giving it a new coat of paint. Someone noticed that you can store quite a bit of extra \"stuff\" in the staging layer beyond what the database needs. Of course, the marketing folks thought that needed a new name. I think we are at the point now where we just keep adding buzzwords to the names. It's like a technical pin the tail on the donkey. The latest is \"now with more AI!.\" A data ecosystem is a complicated enough of an endeavor without all the confusion that is being pushed on it purposefully. I haven't even started in on Inmon, Kimball, Stars, Snowflakes, the various normal forms, ETL/ELT, etc. Good luck on your journey.",

The greatest benefit to it is that I often get chances to start over and build something from the ground up. As far as I know, there's less opportunity for that in the SE space and that's why I personally haven't tried making the switch. But consulting also has it's downsides. I struggle with the same things you mentioned: A lot of non-tech people who can't spell git much less use it. People handing you massive Excel sheets. Shoestring budgets with tooling. Having to explain to overconfident customers that their data is not clean. Etc.It isn't for everyone, but there's a lot of job security in it IMO.

(~3YoE, more in data space as a non-engineer, so view my comments through that lens however you will).Testing is a problem, yes. Especially when you work with things that are closer to ML, that have testable behaviours that only manifest when working on a huge dataset with specific patterns. This is not an intractable problem, though. You still can factor your code correctly and cover with unit tests as much as you can, and write queries for ongoing data quality monitoring (a good data analyst will be a very important ally in this activity). For more complex stuff, talk to your platform/infra/governance people about having a \"sandbox\" environment - prod data but all the sensitive parts masked. Nobody understands the complexity? That sounds like your org needs more \"less technical\" people like analysts, not less. And yes, you as a DE need to be in touch with them, because they will be able to tell you what to expect of your data.People questioning numbers when they don't match vibes? Honestly that sounds like something a data product manager/owner has to tackle. As an engineer, all you can do is deliver data quality assurance, and point to that. After this it's with the PM/PO to sell the value of the team's work.Version control issues? Yes, that happens when an org has a lot of DAs/DSs with more science/business background. I think the will to do git appears after one or two incidents when someone does a breaking change that nobody had a chance to review, or accidentally deletes some script on some server somewhere. If your data team is subsidary to technical leaders in the org chart, I think they're usually sympathetic to the idea, and you can go through them to push git adoption. You can also smooth things along by writing a \"git for dummies\" document for your DS/DA. No need to deep dive into advanced features, just teaching them commit/push/pull and merge requests should be enough. Do make sure your main is protected in all your repos, though.Stuff outside of your control, but you have to fix it? That exists, yes, but I don't think that's unique to DE. Don't backend devs in microservice-oriented companies deal with the same problem?",

There are great books that outline the math and engineering behind it, but the only real way of becoming a data engineer is dipping your toes in keeping data stacks running.3- Most successful way I know: solid stem education. Acquire work experience consuming data as an analyst, data scientist, etc. Slowly transition your work to backend/production systems e.g. making changes to ETL code, finding out infrastructure requirements, doing incident response, thinking about data modelling. Do this for long enough, and you're now able to reason about data along its journey to whatever end-consumer there is.",

This includes learning how to build ETL/ELT workflows, manage data quality, and work with cloud-native tools and orchestration frameworks like Airflow or dbt.Books like *Fundamentals of Data Engineering* or *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* give good theoretical grounding. But they don’t replace hands-on work. So the best learning path combines both: read to understand the concepts, then build mini-projects to apply them. For example, try building a pipeline that pulls data from a public API, stores it in a cloud bucket or local database, and runs some transformation on a schedule. We have a lot of interactive courses, so feel free to check out our site and browse! And finally, don’t get overwhelmed by the tool soup. AWS, GCP, Azure, Snowflake, Spark, Kafka, dbt... You don’t need to learn everything at once. Start with one cloud provider, one orchestration tool, one data warehouse. The concepts transfer well once you understand them.",

Mostly, I was transforming and consolidating data using on prem tools to automate our processes. After that, I took a BI manager role with our data science team (data science was initially part of BI at my company). Spent a year there until a big reorganization occurred. We moved to the cloud, data science became its own thing, a data engineering team got stood up. I initially moved with data science, but it was clear my skills did not mesh well except for the data engineering, but they wanted to move all DE work over to the DE team eventually. I took that opportunity after just over a year in that position. On day 1 with the DE team, we were building stop gap solutions. I spent that time getting really good with pyspark. I already had a large background with pandas, so pyspark was very easy to figure out. From there, we had consultants build our long term data platform while the full timers worked on ad hoc requests to keep the business moving and start making a name for our team. During this time, I learned I was really good at programming business logic and transformations. I was not nearly as good at ingestion or tools outside of databricks. Eventually our SAAS integration started, and I was working directly with consultants. I was well out of my depth, but I learned the process pretty quickly, patched some early holes in my technical knowledge, and got rolling. I learned that I was really good at functional programming, but pretty bad at DevOps and way out of my league in OOP. Now, I'm working on a project to rebuild our data platform to one easier to maintain, more flexible, and moves data faster. I'm focusing more on architecture, but making sure that these new consultants are training my team and me every step of the way. My manager assigned me as lead for this project. My manager wants me to train to become an engineering architect. Whereas I'm a decent engineer with a lot of potential to grow there, I am kinda a natural on all things architectural. So that is how I'm leaning now.",

As with all dev work there's a fair amount of \"it depends\" to be had in any situation, but I can't see where this level of normalization would ever be useful inside a data warehouse.I think people pursuing this behavior have lost sight of the \"why.\" The Star Schema model was originally created during an age with storage was the scarce resource so it was important never to store duplicate data. Nowadays, storage is so cheap it's practically free so it's compute that we must optimize for. Having to do dozens of `join`s to gain context on every record certainly doesn't support that. Usually, I practice some form of what you might call \"Star Schema Light\" in the silver layer where I create tables around business entities. So all the 'user' dimensions would be in one table (and it would probably have a companion SCD table), all the 'session' dimensions in another etc. Then these can be `join`d and de-normalized in gold to expose to BI tools as needed while analysts can still have some flexibility by using the silver tables. Having said all that, be careful. Myself and two colleagues were recently fired for suggesting this very thing and pointing out we shouldn't administer Snowflake like one would on-prem Oracle.",

That's how transactional databases are supposed to be. A star schema is a denormalized schema (it breaks the rules of normalization, 3NF).Your use case doesn't look very \"star schema\" to me as many to many relationships should be rare. Another way to reword this is that the UserTag entity is a fact table. You could add a date / calendar dimension to this fact and this would allow you to see how many users one tag have, which users have which tags... It also depends on how \"fast\" these tags are attributed. Could they be considered an attribute to the fact? It is hard to decide without having a closer look at your use case and the data.Regarding the surrogate keys. You don't need them on all dimensions. You need them on SCD2 dimensions, and not all dimensions need to be SCD2. You also need SK when combining data from different sources into one single dimension, and they don't have a common key.Regarding the project... 20 people working on one single star schema, 2 years. That's insane. Do you work in insurance? It sounds like something massively overengineered which goes against the premises of dimensional modeling: easy to query.",

Thanks for giving me something to look into.Uh, in sql server, merge is sometimes derided. I think it's complex and there's a lot of opportunity for weird behavior.To add one... folks seem to dislike cursors. Again I think folks don't use them properly and if they did they might like them better, but I guess it's more syntax than a simple while loop.Hot take, I don't like single quotes for both strings and to identify an instance, database, schema, object, or columns and much prefer the square brackets to differentiate one from the other.Despite best efforts to NOT be case-specific, I think there are places in SSRS or SSIS that still are (case specific). They also do weird things with instance names, like ServerName\\Instance becomes ServerName$Instance because it can't handle the slash character.SSRS went back and forth about how to pass \"All\" as a parameter between '08 and R2.I kinda fell in love with Snowflake and not having to care about strongly typing string lengths (and not having to care about SSIS crying for making everything varchar(max)).NULL and math or concatenate has surprising behavior.",

Assuming your whole team is fundamentally competent, the frequent late nights suggest someone is promising too much and/or failing to manage expectations. The bad news is that can happen anywhere. But if it's the norm, then it's probably time to move on and parlay the recognizable name into a better role.You can definitely find consulting companies that take quality of work more seriously. I don't know how to vet them besides just talking to people in similar roles. When you do, ask about the sales process, the role of vendor partnerships (this can almost singlehandedly determine your technical focus!), how they go about scoping, how satisfied clients generally seem, etc. If you get engineers to answer those questions, that will shed a lot of light on the kind of environment you might be stepping into (which is tightly linked to the kinds of clients your sales and marketing people are able to reach).(Edited to add: If those discussions make it sound like that firm is bent on pitching solely AI everything these days...huge red flag. Obviously I'm speaking from my own biases here, but IMHO it's a recipe for perpetual scope change at best, and completely unrealistic expectations at worst. Too many un-serious people selling to other un-serious people who are spending still other un-serious people's money for no clear reason. Naturally, YMMV.)By way of background, my data career has been solely in consulting. It's been about 10 years at a couple of relatively small firms (in the 100–200-person range) so I don't know what things are like at much larger ones. I have worked in-house before but in a very a different field. Overall, I'm satisfied with my career path, but it has its drawbacks, especially if technical learning is your *top* priority.There have been long periods where my technical skills stagnated. Once I've reached a certain degree of experience with our bread-and-butter projects, most of the work is on the business logic and requirements side, not the technical side, since I've probably done it a dozen times before.Obviously I'm always keeping up with developments from vendors we typically use (and what's new from others to some extent)...but it's not like I'm frequently taking on entirely new kinds of projects. That's not a bad thing in my book! All those less- or non-technical skills are extremely important. What's more, even if selling the same solution repeatedly isn't the most technically exciting, it's one way to keep increasing your effective hourly rate.Granted, my favorite clients have been smaller ones (like a few hundred staff members or less) who need all kinds of random data things solved. Sometimes that does require unfamiliar technologies, which are often equal parts fun and frustrating at the same time. But those more open-ended projects, where I'm sort of the \"data guy\" on call, are inherently less specialized, and often less lucrative as a result.",

Are you going to write a new pipeline to do that, or edit the existing one and re-run on the same input data?Another example I didn't see mentioned is data size. Your pipeline might be written such that it extracts a delta of changes in the input db table and writes them to the output. This is because just copying the whole table every day is too expensive, and the changes are expected to be small, so could instead use a smaller machine. Now what do you do if the processing logic changes?Of course there are solutions to write a pipeline such that it handles both entire data and deltas, but those solutions always depend on the specifics of the input. It's often much easier (faster) to have a 2nd pipeline for full reloads, configured for a bigger machine, etc.",

Ideally, your org should set up an AWS Organization (if not done already) and provision guardrails vis tools like service control policies and AWS config rules to enforce standards and prevent people from doing anything too crazy. There should also be a standard for how things go from dev to test to prod. But that might be beyond the scope of your team, so the best way to maintain your sanity in the short term would be to provision a new AWS account within your organization, and provide access to only the data engineering team. Analysts and the like don’t need AWS console access if they’re just making JDBC connections to some data service. If you share details about your planned architecture I can give more specific advice, but I definitely recommend not trying to deploy this in the chaos of any of your existing accounts.",

But it works more or less the same as those hackthon coding test, it is also easy to cheat, even the question is a well crafted one, as long as the candidate has a very close friend who is a good developer. (Yes we do see cheating in this kind of coding test, basically, the hundsband help the wife). But for hiring a senoir or even intermediate dev, this is ridiculous. All employed seniors have tons of work to do, no one will spend more than 4 hours on this kind of test, especially, there will be hours of interveiw coming up potentially. Also we will be careful to not helping the hiring company solving their problem. Thus it is more difficult for us to finish an assignment (I assume you will give serious difficult take home assignment in this scenario) without helping the hiring company to solve their problem. I would say, if you are a junior dev, take it, learn the new knowledge, if you are a intermediate to senior dev, just pass by, don't spend time on it. Meaningless, the one who review you result might be even less experience than you and give a false judgement and decide to not move forward with you.",

        "body": "Alright, this post can make good use of additional clarity.- Is primary_hash just a fancy way to say ID?- I hope you understand the implication of hashing, because in this context it is a trap, and you’re jumping right into it. First, order sensitivity: {a:1, b:2} and {b:2, a:1} can spit out different hashes depending on your algorithm—hope you’re normalizing inputs. Second, collisions: no hash is truly unique, so your primary_hash or payload_hash could, in theory, screw you over with duplicates. Third, compute cost: hashing big payloads (especially JSON blobs) chews up CPU. For large datasets, you’re burning cycles when a simpler key or checksum could do the job. Also, good luck debugging when someone tweaks the algorithm. Do stick to lightweight identifiers or deterministic keys unless you’re solving world hunger.- Your source system just yeets full or incremental loads at random? You're really telling us is just a coin flip? Scour their docs for a pattern—there’s got to be one. If it’s truly a coin flip, build a check (like record count or metadata flags) to detect load type. Then branch your logic: full load = overwrite or merge, incremental = append or upsert. A simple if-statement saves you from nuking 95% of your data.- Why the urge to slap a boolean is_current on everything? Your UPSERT logic already yells “this row’s alive!\". Regarding your last_loaded_ts: you just called it business_ts few words before!- Detecting deletions always come down to one of two. Check if the source emits delete events (docs, again). If not, periodically poll for IDs and just IDs. Another news: although a row is being deleted from the source system, it's not mandatory you have to delete it as well: just flag it (aka soft deletion). Overall, if you can ingest incrementally and poll for just IDs, you are saving money and drastically simplify the process.- Data retention: S3 (or Fabric’s storage) is dirt cheap for raw data and time travel queries (i.e., SELECT * FROM table VERSION AS OF '2025-01-01') have been invented in the 90s. If storage costs creep up, archive old partitions to cheaper tiers like S3 Glacier. Keep Silver/Gold lean for business logic and aggregates—don’t make them history dumps. Set a retention policy (e.g., 1 year hot, archive the rest) to balance auditability and your wallet.",

The delete logic with incremental loads is a nightmare we see all the time.**For the incremental vs full load problem:** Your boolean flag approach is on the right track. What works for us is having a `load_type` field (FULL/INCREMENTAL) alongside `is_current` and `last_seen_ts`. For incremental loads, we only update records that actually appear in the batch - never delete based on absence.The trick is tracking what constitutes a \"complete picture\" at the source level. We usually maintain a separate metadata table that tracks when each source last did a full refresh, so we know our baseline.**Storage and history management:** Bronze is the wrong place for long term history imo. We keep maybe 30-90 days in Bronze for reprocessing, then archive to cheaper storage. The real historical tracking happens in Silver where you can be more selective about what actually needs versioning.For cost control, consider:* Partition by load date so you can easily drop old data* Use Delta's time travel for short term history, separate archive for long term* Not everything needs full history - focus on business critical entities**Quick pattern that works:*** Bronze: Current state + recent changes (30-90 days)* Silver: SCD Type 2 for entities that need history* Archive layer: Compressed parquet in cold storage for compliancea reference of 3 tier architecture: Bronze, Silver, Gold layers: [https://cdn-cednl.nitrocdn.com/ZIEpBLjPiSWpOcIdsSTlIdzcQJzKTmWw/assets/images/optimized/rev-21cfb01/www.datatobiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Azure-Medallion-Architecture.png](https://cdn-cednl.nitrocdn.com/ZIEpBLjPiSWpOcIdsSTlIdzcQJzKTmWw/assets/images/optimized/rev-21cfb01/www.datatobiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Azure-Medallion-Architecture.png)What kind of data volumes are you dealing with?

I usually have a handful of questions already lined up. I can't tell you how many times I have to deviate because the candidate clearly lied on their resume. I'll see something like \"expert in cloud technology\" so I'll ask a basic question like \"what cloud provider?\" And they just freeze because they lied or embellished. It's really hard watching somebody fumble in an interview with what feels like softball questions. I normally go back and forth between high level questions about their experience, a few high level technical questions, and a few deep dives into ares of particular interest that either I need then to know for the role, or I'm trying to see of they were being honest on their resume about.",

It wouldn't help the business at all.We've got shedloads of tables with oodles of columns, but for many of them, things like nulls are totally inconsequential, or even good sometimes.And then folks start talking about duplicates, but if you're defining that to mean the database-managed PK identity column, it's clearly not going to have any dupes, and if it somehow did, it's a bug in the database engine which is far outside our responsibility. I don't want to spend CPU cycles testing MS SQL Server features that have been in place for decades.If you don't mean that kind of dupe, then that starts a valuable but lengthy discussion about what we DO mean by a duplicate; the answer for us varies by table/entity, and is generally too complex for any off-the-shelf tool to handle (that I've seen).So in short, for us the only business value is in a much more manual DQ process (manually defining what DQ means, not manually checking it!).

These run locally on our machines and also in our ci/CD pipeline so that nothing gets merged to main or deployed to production unless these tests pass.This doesn't account for everything that can go wrong. In particular, we don't have a good way to run integration or end-to-end tests locally, but we do deploy to a dev workspace and require that any changes be run successfully there, which covers most of the rest of the possible error surface.Any remaining uncertainty comes from the possibility of upstream data sources shitting the bed, which we can't control, or from the reluctance of data scientists, our immediate downstream consumers, to adopt anything resembling robust development practices, so we spend a lot of time putting out fires that don't arise from our ETL pipelines.",

Some code-heavy DEs might be able to to it, but most of us are using SQL or dbt or something like that. Traditional software testing does not work for us. We have to think differently. That pedantic message aside, we can take the concept of unit tests and apply to data engineering. We need three things. 1. Known input state (What data are we reading)2. Work (Query, task, function, something that transforms data)3. Know expected output stateDbt and SQLMesh do this with their own concept of unit tests. I'm sure other platforms have their own solutions. If you want to roll your own it is fairly simple in theory.... 1. Create known data that shows the characteristics of what you want to test.2. Run the portion of your pipeline that you want to test.3. Compare the output to the expected output. If it matches you are good. This is not that hard in small pipelines, but very difficult to maintain in big pipelines. Imagine a SaaS company with 10 subscription plans and negotiated contracts. New stuff being added every day. 800 data sources. It's really tough to maintain a test suite. This problem has not been solved in the industry and whoever solves it will be very rich.

This makes it easy to write unit tests where you pass mock inputs into transform functions and compare output to expectation. From there you just get better at breaking down these transform functions to make it easier to write unit tests for. You can also write your runtime data validations as functions in the same way and write unit tests for those to make sure they catch bad data.This separation of transform code and connecting/reading/writing code makes it easier to abstract and consolidate the latter and write integration tests for those.So in your hypothetical “process_data_to_silver.py”, assuming that’s an etl task will likely not need much unit tests of its own. It’s simply importing a dataset processing function, passing it inputs, and then publishing the output. You’ll be confident it’s processing and validating as expected because the function itself is covered.",

I often feel like a fraud often but it's usually ameliorated by being the only person in the room who has the answer to a technical question, or enough free-floating context to extrapolate one if it doesn't exist. This was through truly backbreaking amounts of study, often around technical subjects that were only tangentially related to data engineering (microprocessors, operating systems, machine learning, data science, maths) in addition to spending plenty of time learning about core software engineering (languages, design patterns, best practices, tooling) and throwing time at random new tech constantly (agentic workflows, vector dbs, scalable anonymization techniques, heck even occasionally frontend stuff) *in addition* to the obvious stuff (data modelling, query optimisation, infra/cloud). I read the entire Postgres docs from start to finish at one point. Waste of time? Sure, maybe not the most strategic choice.

Get feedback and start working on the low hanging fruit. Also, talk to your manager about specializing.

They have 10+ years on you, you can probably get where they are with practice and training by the time you get experienced enough. I started as a BI guy myself. I did a lot of data transformation work at first, which is what I love anyways. Eventually, I had to expand and that was painful. But firstly, I gained additional technical skills which is always good. Secondly, I found that I have a pretty good intuition for architecture, and my manager is eagerly supporting that. Thirdly, I made a name for myself working across teams to build data engineering solutions. That meant that I did not always need to be the most technical guy. I just had to figure out things at a high level and let our consultants who have 15+ years on me with highly technical expertise do their thing.

With no data engineers and a single analyst, there is limited investment in the data function (based on the provided information). Given the connector choice, maybe you report to finance? Regardless, it's one thing to get the data from point A to point B, it's another to ensure the data is correct. For example, what happens if they change the configuration of Salesforce objects? How will you handle that downstream?I say the above to warn of the trap of the business thinking that increased access to data easily results in more data utilization.",

        "body": "If we’re talking about the future of data engineering, it’s worth first asking: *why does it exist at all?*Originally, businesses needed someone to get them data for decision-making. First came BI developers/ETL engineers, they built warehouses and reports so analysts could do their work. Later, data analysts became more self-serve and focused on interpreting the past. Then data science took off, using that historical data to predict the future.Both analysts and scientists quickly ran into the same problem: clean, reliable, well-structured data was hard to come by. That’s when the modern data engineer role emerged, not just to build infra, but to make data usable at scale.Early DE work was infra-heavy, but as platforms matured (Databricks, GCP, Azure, Snowflake), more of the plumbing became automated. That doesn’t mean the job is going away, it means the focus shifts. You spend less time reinventing connectors and clusters, more time on things like modeling, scalability, governance, security, cost optimization, and integrating multiple data sources into a coherent system.This is also where analytics engineers come in, they work closer to the business, doing a lot of SQL/dbt modeling and BI integration. In small teams, AEs might cover most data needs; in bigger orgs, DEs still handle the scale, complexity, streaming, and compliance side.If anything, the “easy” DE tasks are disappearing, which makes deep skills more valuable:* Real-time pipelines (Kafka, Pub/Sub, Flink)* Data contracts, governance, compliance* Multi-cloud / cross-platform integration* ML data pipelines & feature stores* Performance and cost tuning at scaleI wouldn’t say DE is shrinking, it’s just changing shape. The safest way to future-proof yourself is to stay close to both the business context *and* the technical challenges. Platforms will keep automating, but stitching them together, governing them, and making them serve the business well? That’s still human work.",

One technical project manager I worked with was pursuing one, but he left before he finished it.The reality is CFA is an extremely difficult certification, each level has a sub 50% pass rate and the only reason you should pursue one is if you want to become a person who professionally is allowed to give investment advice or directly manage a portfolio.The technical problems we solve don’t require that intimate knowledge of investment vehicles and financial planning, so anyone hiring for technical positions would far value technical aptitude over whatever CFA would bring to the table. Even people who worked closer to the business side (product management, business systems analysis) didn’t have CFAs. Some management did, C levels definitely had it, except for technical C-suite who held PhDs instead.Imo spend your time on something else, and working at a place like that is really not as difficult as you expect, but your best path in would be going to a good school, doing well, interviewing well and living nearby. And I really found the work soul draining, you work to make rich people richer and have to wear a tie every day. People there drink heavily after work too.

A lot of folks in data look to deepen their finance knowledge, but the CFA might not be the most direct route if your goal is to stay in data engineering.CFA is a serious time and energy investment. It’s incredibly valuable if you’re aiming to become a portfolio manager or financial analyst who makes investment decisions—but for a data engineer, the overlap is limited. Most technical roles at places like Citi, JPMorgan, or Bain don’t require or expect a CFA. What they *do* value is domain familiarity: understanding how financial data works, how to build pipelines for it, and how to surface insights that support the business.A more practical route might be building out your finance knowledge in parallel with your engineering work. Things like:* Learning how to wrangle financial data (from market feeds, statements, or transactions)* Building dashboards for KPIs like revenue, risk, or portfolio performance* Working with time-series forecasting or valuation modelsThere’s strong demand for data engineers with finance context—it’s just more about hands-on skills than credentials. If you're interested, we’ve got some finance-focused tracks that lean technical: Python for Finance, Financial Modeling in Excel, and Financial Analysis in Power BI. They can give you the right foundation without going all-in on CFA.That said, if you’re considering a career shift toward investment roles or product strategy, the CFA might be worth it—but it’s rarely a game-changer on the engineering side.",

        "body": "I've done between 150 and 200 of these animals. The process is very similar regardless of the tools. Let me give you the high points. The goal here is to make sure you accomplish something, have a defined finish line and don't just resell them back the same used car they were driving with a new coat of paint.1. Make sure there is total agreement as to WHY you are doing this. You need this before you use any brain cells on the technical or tools side of the house. This needs to be in writing and preferably signed off by all stakeholders. None of these reasons will be technical. They will all be business oriented. This step needs to be very well documented and agreed on. Don't let anyone push you to rush this one. I usually take 3-4 weeks for this. Sometimes it takes longer. These are all of your project success criteria. Why was a decision to replicate what you already have made? The longest path to anywhere is a shortcut.2. Now that you have that, figure out WHAT they don't have that they need. Every single one of these needs to tie back to a WHY. If it doesn't tie back to one, discard it or update the WHYs and get sign off again. I'm talking reports, dashboards, messaging, etc. Do not start coding yet. This is also where to start to identify if you have the data to achieve these items. Don't limit yourself to the current state of affairs. I cannot emphasize how important it is to tie these back to WHY items. \"Because we've always had them\" is not a reason. Validate existing data products to see if they are sufficient or even needed. This is where you start to clean house on all the crap that data warehouses collect. This stage will also start to get you thinking about the relationships between the types of data. Not a data model, but a bit higher than that in conception.Nothing up to now has been technical but these are by far the most important parts of the projects. It will be very tempting to jump into the weeds, don't do it. Your post already suggests you are starting at the wrong place.3. Now you can start to design the data warehouse. I would start with the data model. Figure out what type of model you need. Don't take what is already there unless it can be heavily justified. An operational data store is not the same as a data warehouse. You don't get too many opportunities to do this in any one company. Throw away all of those marketing terms. They won't help you. A traditional three tier DW has never steered me wrong. Activities, like data cleansing and data standardization, tend to happen as you move the data from one tier to the next. Stage is used for landing data. I tend to make my core in 3NF and any data products (stars, materialized views, etc.) in the semantic layer. You do not need to have everything built out before you start using it but do have as much as possible planned out and written down. Generate regular deliverables to the business and be able to show how they address the business needs you identified in step one. If they can't be tied back, ask yourself why you are building them. This is a VERY high description of how you refactor or initially design a data warehouse. It may seem overwhelming but just break it down into chunks and always be thinking about the future. These things stay around a long time.",

        "body": "As someone who had to do this for the first time about 6 months ago:- if your data volumes are small and you already have postgres set up as a warehouse, stick with it for now, it's probably fine- don't worry about an orchestrator yet if your views are working ok. Get your view definitions under version control on GitHub then use GitHub actions to push them to postgres when you make updates. If performance starts to become an issue, then look into an orchestrator as you might need to start materialising these into actual tables.- make sure your view definitions are under version control. Look into dbt to make this easier to manage.- on data viz, sure you can use tableau but I personally have found it a bit clunky when I've used it in the past and it can get very expensive. Recently started using Sigma computing - less pretty dashboards but I think way easier to use. But honestly if you use one of the usual suspects (Tableau, Power BI etc) management can't really blame you. I don't really know anything about Kibana but if that's working for you why reinvent?- on natural language querying - your job on this is to NOT implement anything and find a diplomatic way of telling management it's a bad idea. If they insist you try it, look at setting up AI agents where you can constrain their behavior to running queries you predefine, and prompt it to say 'i don't know' if non technical users stray out of those guardrails. I know the Google genai and openai APIs both have functionality to do this kind of workflow.Good luck",

That's one more layer of complexity that may or may not be required.* You may be able to batch often enough to be real-time enough for the business without streaming (they need to define real-time)* We're looking at Prefect more than Airflow, especially the cloud version because it's fairly cheap for our needs and having the local worker is easy to setup.

Not sure how big the team is but it sounds like a lot of stuff to glue together and maintain.I have quite a bit of experience working with multi-tenant data architecture, and almost always they benefitted significantly from shared larger data warehouses rather than per-customer instance, so I suggest centralizing. Down the line some new usecases will require cross-client insights, some new developments will benefit all the customers at once, and you'll thank yourself.In terms of the architecture, it sounds like SQL-only stuff might not fit the bill here. I would suggest:- land the data in your dwh somehow- run transformations in SQL as much as possible, go with python where needed.- stay off of Spark, I don't see any benefit here for you, it is a complicated piece of software that is not even modern at this point.For individual pieces, you can either go bit by bit, e.g. one tool for ingestion, another for transformation, orchestration, etc. There are quite a lot of good alternatives, e.g. Fivetran + dbt + airflow. I suggest taking a look at [ingestr](https://github.com/bruin-data/ingestr) for ingestion stuff.[Bruin CLI](https://github.com/bruin-data/bruin) could also fit the bill here since it is like dbt, but does ingestion, transformation with SQL and Python, orchestration, quality, and governance. It is open-source, you can run it anywhere you'd like.Hit me up if you'd like to chat, sounds like an interesting problem you are tackling. Good luck!",

Plus intergrating with engines and the optimizations they have for columnar wouldn’t scale nicely on large data sets",

But I wouldn't expect a senior position to provide projects, generally our work is owned by the companies and repositories are private; and we've stopped doing \"presentable\" projects outside of work. I have multiple friends in various industries looking for work, including a previously staff backend engineer from Instagram and they're all having a hard time. I know that doesn't help but looking for work is soul crushing, and legally it's in the companies best interest to give you zero feedback on why they went with someone else. Also if you don't mind shorter projects (still FTE) but 3-6mo projects don't skip applying for the major cloud vendor PSO companies. At those companies \"YOU\" are the product so they can often be hiring when others aren't. Hope something comes your way soon!",

Developer/Team/Enterprise are all tiers within dbt Cloud, and yes, the semantic layer for PowerBI is Cloud-only. Fusion is a feature within the Cloud product.Here's the thing though: we were on the Teams plan and everything was fine until we hit 8+ people. Then dbt Sales basically forced us into Enterprise tier. The initial quote? $300/seat/month on a 3-year contract. Even after heavy negotiation we only got it down to $220/seat/month.For context, that's $26,400/year for 10 people, which feels pretty steep for what's essentially a task scheduler running on top of open-source dbt.If you're just getting started with the engineering side, I'd honestly suggest sticking with dbt Core + your own orchestration (Airflow, GitHub Actions, whatever). The semantic layer is nice, but probably not worth $20-30k/year for a small team. You could build your own metrics layer or look at alternatives for way less.Just something to keep in mind as your team grows. The jump from Teams to Enterprise pricing is brutal.",

They also are sort of limited in that you can't build a full model with multiple tables, each semantic model is 1:1 with a dbt model, which is one table or view. If you use an obt data structure then you are good. If you have a star schema or something like that that you want to represent semantically then it doesn't work.

Our tech is oversaturated with buzzwords and abbreviations for no good reason.So I've read the article and I find it very interesting. I agree with many points, especially about idempotency. And I also have a few questions:1. From my experience, layered data platforms aren't made only for the sake of business. Materializing intermediate datasets with pieces of business logic can be necessary to maintain good cost/performance ratio. Especially when the data is big, and your ETL system can only handle data increments in a timely manner. At the same time, proper naming convention and an appropriate architecture (Kimball, DV) makes the data easier to navigate. Does this align with your vision, and if not, why is your way of doing things better? Or is it?2. Implement all transformations as pure functions - it makes me think you're advocating for ETL process instead of ELT (aka using compute engines like Spark for data transformations). I make this assumption, because implementing pure transformations using sql is much more tricky, and people with expertise in sql, but no expertise in OOP may struggle to do it consistently. Even tools like DBT require careful model design to achieve real idempotency. With this in mind, don't you think having all transformations as pure functions is too costly?",

We do create intermediate tables. Sometimes, with QA results, we just store intermediate transforms (we do almost all work in SQL). We tend not to keep those intermediate tables around unless necessary. The key idea is that a single end-to-end process governs the flow from raw data to final output. That’s the critical point. While this process may technically generate multiple intermediate layers, each additional customer-exposed layer incurs overhead in terms of time, governance, documentation, and support questions. And they are rarely used. So the real question becomes: why maintain extra layers at all? 2. We mostly do SQL, with occasional Python when we have to ingest some strange format. It's mostly ELT. So are all our functions pure? No. We tend to group code together to perform tasks such as creating a dimension. If we create intermediate tables, we clean them up immediately at the end (and the start, checking to see if they are already present before deleting them). So it 'pure' without using SQL language, supported but replaced with a culture and code review. I think that tribal knowledge without language support makes it more challenging.",

At the column level you can use Cortext to generate descriptions of every column on a table in one swoop (which our power users love). Similarly, there is a nearby UI to generate the name/value pairs known as \"Metadata Tags\" such as \"Requestor\", \"Owner\" (or whatever object tags your business deems necessary). Under the hood, Snowsight is using ALTER TABLE to create and alter these descriptions and tags which means that the user-at-hand needs a role with OWNERSHIP of the involved objects. However, passing around OWNERSHIP privs is very challenging and frightening to us. Frankly, I'm surprised Snowflake created these slick UIs without bothering to create a new, safer METADATA\\_MANAGEMENT role to go along with them.",

If the schema changes or more columns are available, *as I remember it* you get a warning/error, that something has changed in your profiling. Not the actual change I think. But again, not sure.As for point 4, it generates a report that you manually have to click on and open. Actually quite nice overview in the automatically generated reports with stats on all your metadata in your profiling. It is annoying that you have log in to a different system to see them, but you can extract the metadata through the API if you want to collect it in your regular data warehouse and do your own reports.But it is expensive. And I believe a lot of other proprietary expensive data quality tools can do the same. It is just not available in any cheap/open source way.

It'd be impossible to make a full determination of the best way to model this without knowing the data much more intimately than I ever could via Reddit. However, my first reaction to your department/location example, is that if there are (relevant) properties of the intersection between these, they are not two separate dimensions. They are one dimension. Are you familiar with the concept of Junk dimensions? That might be what's relevant here. Combining Department and Location would be a pretty typical junk scenario, assuming you don't have many thousands of rows for either.",

Talking about your example, I would split them up, keeping one change per changeset. Also, createTable and createIndex should not be considered a single operation. It is very common to create indexes sometime after the table is created. e.g.. Create the table, ingest the data, then create the indexes.2. Again, I would not keep them in the same changeset. Having the CREATE OR REPLACE clause helps make the change idempotent, but the function and the trigger are still two different objects.3. I believe in this case, you should add a rollback for the trigger.Again, as I mentioned earlier, I don't have experience with Liquibase, and I'm aware that following the guidelines strictly can make everything more laborious, so please take it with a grain of salt. I don't think you should be so strict if you are creating the database from scratch, for example. In that case, I would develop changesets to create multiple foreign keys and indexes, for example. However, on an already ongoing application, that solution would not be optimal.",

For example, Warp is benefiting greatly from the OS caching disk data: \\- Cold reads (from disk) hit around 5GB/s \\- Warm reads (from cached pages) can hit 200GB/s+Curious how large you're thinking? If a single column fits within memory (say <32 GB) this should run extremely well on repeat queries on similar data (eg when a dashboard is loaded). The data used so far is \\~100GB per example (individual columns are a fraction of this).It's not designed for truly massive datasets (> TBs) yet, that'd require NVME raids and/or distributed nodes. I've tried to keep it small so it's cheap to run (I suspect a lot of cloud users are paying more than they need to for their small/mid data sizes).

I suggest reading some database literature; definitely room for innovation and quality of implementation improvements, but no need to reinvent all the theory. And there's different philosophies of design (\"in memory\" or not, distributed or not, etc, etc).Some (many) algorithms degrade poorly when the amount of data is larger than the system's available memory. It's not just about the size of data; it's also about whether there's a performance cliff (or a point where you outright start failing).You're not wrong, a single machine can do a lot. One of my colleagues posted this recently: https://datamonkeysite.com/2025/07/21/does-a-single-node-python-notebook-scale/Single nodes have gotten very powerful. But then again, smalk workloads don't always stay small. Having room to grow is good too, as is not having it be \"works on my machine\".I work on a distributed, autoscaling OLAP database engine (Fabric Warehouse) that's capable of efficient single node execution, or scale out, depending on what the query needs. So I'm not necessarily convinced one really has to choose between small scale efficiency and being capable of going distributed. But at the same time, you've already got a huge project on your hands as it is. It's a very interesting space, with lots of hard problems and competition. Good luck!",

Going the other way is harder.That said, if the data role is solid (e.g. real PySpark work, solid infra, not just moving CSVs to S3), and you want to be in that space long term, it’s not a bad move.But full stack gives you more flexibility and job security early on.

The config CI/CD pipeline will copy the files to where your DAG references them, your DAG CI/CD pipeline will deploy to wherever your airflow DAG bag refreshes.The dynamic DAG can be as flexible as you want. For example create all the same tasks but with different parameters, or it can dynamically create different task structures based on the config. Every time the DAG bag refreshes DAGs will be updated or created based on what’s in the config directory. You can then manage each resource separately and see its history in the web portal",

        "body": "For operational use cases - take the data, do something to it, send output to some downstream system - your instinct is correct in that trying to shoehorn the “medallion” concept into this sort of flow can be counterintuitive. My team and I went through a lot of back-and-forth on whether we wanted to support such use cases in our Databricks environment, or wanted to keep them separate. There were arguments to be made for separate - the data volume of these use cases is lower than our analytical workloads, and so Azure Functions/Logic Apps could be sufficient. However, then we would need to use a non-Databricks orchestrator, which would be a bit annoying for some of the multi-step operational workflows. Doing it in Databricks meant that all of our data jobs live in one place and are orchestrated through one set of tools, regardless of whether they’re operational or analytical in nature. Databricks Asset Bundles have been great for us in this regard, in terms of allowing us to define our job configurations as code. Once we got past that, we came back to the medallion. We landed the operational data in its own schema in our bronze catalog, but rather than moving it to “silver”, we created an operations catalog that serves as the use-case layer for all of these operational pipelines. They’re still sourced from bronze, and in the future, we might source analytical “silver” tables from either the bronze or operational catalogs, but this approach has been working well for us.We leverage Databricks secrets (backed by Azure Key Vault) for all of our connection secrets, and give our service principals READ access to the scope in each environment. We have also modularized our code for SFTP/FTP into a helper library so we don’t have to maintain the same logic in each pipeline. We try to stick to asynchronous patterns for our downstream writes (e.g. we drop off a file somewhere and some downstream system picks it up), but if we had to, we could also make a direct API connection and write our data that way. We just haven’t really had to do that for our use cases thus far.",

Do you have any pointers there?Also curious what your SFTP code does. Our typical pattern is to drop the file on an on-prem server and use a separate MFT application to manage scenarios where we need to push files to an external source, but maybe there's a better way we can consider as we design our new standard.",

The tasks, dependencies, cluster configurations, etc. DABs allow you to deploy your jobs from a version-controlled code base rather than needing to configure them manually in the UI. Especially when you’re working in a multi-environment space (dev > test > prod) this simplifies your life by alleviating the need to deploy jobs manually via the UI in each environment. Our SFTP helper library is basically just a wrapper around paramiko (a library that offers a Python implementation of SSHv2). By passing a few secrets to our helper class, the helper handles the rest and supports both key and credential-based auth. It saves us from having to write the same 30-40 lines of code in each pipeline, since we can instantiate our connection object with a single line of code. Our class also has prebuilt functions for getting/putting a file, checking a hash of a file against a previous version, and a few other operations we have found helpful.",

No need encode star rating or guest count in path; that info is inside the JSON and query engines can read it later. Cheap storage lets you keep whole history for replay.Each night run a compact job with Spark or any lake engine. It reads yesterday’s tiny files, writes a handful of big Parquet or Delta files, then deletes the fragments. Big files mean faster scans and less metadata load. Create a lake table on top of those compact files and partition by the field you filter most, usually `check_in_date`. Too many partitions slow things instead of helping.Flatten and enrich data in a second pass, then load it into a serving database like Postgres and put indexes on hotel\\_id, date, guests. The lake stays the single source of truth, the SQL db is only for fast API reads. If something breaks you just replay from the raw JSON folder and rebuild everything.

So if I'm at a point that I want to productionize my prototype the codebase is mostly ready. Two other points would be metadata. I almost always want to record when the record was fetched, as the time series makes it easier to observe patterns or know when a job wasn't performing correctly so I can disregard it's responses. Like maybe the hotel returns cheaper prices for future reservations on Mondays than on Saturdays. Or if my request was made with an apple device identifier vs a windows one. Lastly performing any updates to data is easier in a DB. Plucking attributes from inside the json to it's own column for filtering/indexing is simple. Or while processing each new batch of data I can perform a ranking to generate an SCD2 type table of differences with lags can help reduce storage over time (ie have a record for each change rather than a record for every request). I generally never use sqlite anymore and use duckdb as I like it's datatypes more. I mentioned sqlite as I think more people have heard of it.",

These migrations should contain only raw SQL using op.execute() to create roles, grant/revoke privileges, or update access logic. Keep each migration focused on a single, clear purpose (like adding a new role or adjusting privileges for a group). Version control these migrations alongside your schema migrations, but prefix them or organize them in a way that makes their RBAC nature clear (e.g. use filenames like \\`20250724\\_add\\_readonly\\_role.py\\`). This keeps RBAC changes auditable, repeatable, and tied to the same deployment process as schema changes. Good luck.",

Similar story with static analysis, although I suppose this is what you might be using it for. Looking for better (and more) static analysis tools might be a good idea, then. Getting a linter and similar tools is a lifesaver for syntax issues on the static stage of coding.100% on reading code and using debugger, I'd say any minute on deepening your debugger proficiency will pay off very, very quickly.",

If you can, well placed prints/logs/LED blinks can do the same thing though (bonus for not changing what your code does other than side effects or timing)And really, 500 lines of code should probably be broken up into smaller routines so you shouldn't have to tackle it all at once, anyways.> 2.

        "body": ">I'm completely unable to \"think like a programmer\".But it can be learned.>They're right, thinking like a programmer IS the hard part. Yes, it is, but as said, it can be learned. What you do is make a list of tasks. If you can't think of how to solve the task, you split it up again. If you can't solve the individual parts, you split those up again. And again.You wanted a way to 'describe it in English', and this is possible. You distill the core of the problem by focusing on what you want to do and the nouns in the problem description. You must first clearly state your problem. For example:- Problem: \"I want to know how often a word appears in an array of words and write this to the screen.\"Distill the core:- array of words- count how often- word- write to screenTo do this, I need:- An array of words (so I must define this).- A way to keep count (so I must define some data structure for this).- A way to look at each word in the array. (Thus I need a loop to pass by each word in the array.)- A way to decide if I already counted the word before (if yes: increase counter; else add word and set counter to 1)- To Write the result to the screenSimple code (pseudo; language is not important yet):```define array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana]define keep_count = objectfor every word in array_of_words {decide if you counted the word before}print_result(keep_count)```Now you have the array of words, and a way to keep count. The thing you didn't work out yet was \"decide if you counted a word before\", so that's what you do next:```if word is in keep_count {increase counter for word by 1} else {add word and set counter to 1}```So now you put that solution into the previous block of code:```define array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana];define keep_count = objectfor every word in array_of_words {if word is in keep_count {increase counter for word by 1} else {add word and set counter to 1}}print_result(keep_count)```Then refine it a bit:```define array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana];define keep_count = objectfor every word in array_of_words {if word is in keep_count {keep_count for word: increase by 1} else {keep_count add word: set to 1}}print_result(keep_count)```And you're done. You've written your program. Now you only need to translate it into the language you are using. A large part of the starting year of a computer science education is actually learning to do this, starting with small things like this and increasing the scope of the problems you're solving. Alongside this you'd learn about often-used data structures and algorithms.Repeat this again and again for years and years on end and you'll get good at it.This is a skill that can be learned, but not in \"Javascript bootcamp\". The above is programming; \"javascript bootcamp\" is writing code in Javascript. That's trivial compared to actually thinking up the solution.You always start with a problem, which you'll break down in smaller and smaller parts (where each part can be a function, which is also broken down into smaller parts), and in the end you'll be left with a (very long) list of tasks to do.",

It can just as easily be due to them having a genuinely held negative perception of collaboration or just not enjoying working with others for their own personal reasons, and whether or not that is a \"problem\" depends on perspective and opinion.Not being pleasant doesn't mean someone is a \"bad\" person.I know that it can be very frustrating to work with someone who isn't naturally co-operative, but assuming it's all about ego doesn't do you any favours. The more you judge others harshly the harder you will make it to collaborate with them. Being diplomatic and negotiating to find a genuine compromise will get you far, but it will take some initiative and persistence.There are other kinds of people who are difficult to work with, such as people who are highly social or charming but don't actually do any work and will make you feel like an asshole if you try confronting it.

I worked as a chef for 10 years and before that in media and now I transitioned to programming.One thing that was worth it from the bootcamp that helped me a lot was the access to mentors. I have been thinking that it is a shame that a lot of people pay so much money just to access to a weekly 30 min call with a mentor (sometimes even less). The material to learn is already online with even well structured tutorials or learning path, but free mentoring options are missing.I have been planning for quite some time to build a website in which programmers and other professionals can offer free mentoring options for people who are learning or starting. It doesn’t have to be for a long time or long sessions but some guidance or even code review could work. Would you be open to help me build this project? Would anybody be interested in something like this? Does a similar platform exist? It has to be completely free of charge (kind of like freecodecamp but for mentoring)",

Assuming you want a career in software I'd recommend, like your friends, that you start building live applications and learning best practices. A degree program is best, but it can be self taught.For the vast majority of jobs you'll want to start turning your problem solving to questions like \"how can I make this the most robust?\" Or \"What would make this code easiest to reuse and maintain?\" And those skills generally come with building things you actually have to deploy and support.",

So don't feel bad.Being good at competitive programming means that you learn how to recognize fundamental problems fast and how to get to a solution fast. And how to debug complex problems fast. This is all very valuable.\\> What can I actually *do* with these skills? Is there any career path that values competitive programming? Or should I just start from scratch with web dev like everyone else?Well, new flash for you. There are essentially no applications out there that are not fundamentally web applications. Today anything that is user facing is either a mobile app, a game, or a webapp. Every other kind of development are essentially in support of application developers. Why do we make operating systems? So that we can make applications to run on them! Why do we make databases? So that we can make applications better. Why do we make AI models? So that we can use them in applications.So should you learn webdev. Yes, you absolutely should. Because most applications will be web apps. Now you don't necessarily need to be extremely good at it. Especially if you are going to work in more inner layers of computing. But no one will take you seriously if you don't seem like you can cobble up some application up.I personally never really do front end work. I hate it. But the easiest way to share what you do is to set it up as a webserver of some kind. I tend to focus on the back end pieces where most of the interesting computation happens.What should you do? Where should you go? I don't know. It depends on what YOU want to do. But it seems to me that you want to solve deeper problems than making a cute applications. And good for you, I hate that shit too. How are you going to get a ob, well, you are going to need to find company that does this kind of work. You need to figure out what you care about and what you want to do.There are plenty of database companies. There is plenty of work in server administration, cloud, and infrastructure. There are plenty of needs in AI, model, development, optimization. There are plenty of jobs in various kind of data mining. We still need compiler people. I had a student hired to write kernel modules. There are a lot of \"systems jobs\".To qualify for them, you need good system understanding. Often that does not happen until people focus on that in grad school. But it is possible out of a bachelor.",

One path is great for your resume and behaviorals and another is great for your technical interview ability. Focus on whatever you need at the moment to get a job. Not getting interviews -> learn in demand skills for a domain. Failing interviews-> learn problem solving.People who say DSA etc are useless completely ignore it’s the foundation of computer science which is all their shitty web app, pc game or ai girlfriend is at its core. Most companies work on proprietary technology at such a scale that no matter what solo project you did the most transferable skill you could bring is your raw compute power.And that raw compute power doesn’t come from going through sheets of questions. Learn to recognize patterns and extract relationships from data. it doesn’t take a 1000 Leetcode or blind 75. You learn by doing and you get better by failing. In fact people who learn problems instead of problem solving can pass interviews by cramming but it quickly becomes time wasted once the short term memory fades. But you probably have a high paying job by then so jokes not on you if you can keep it. Now companies that aren’t at that level giving out Leetcode style interviews, fuck them.

Competitive programmings only benefit is learning how to write algorithms in the most efficient way possible which is great, but when you've got a team of 5-10 other developers working on the same code base, the last thing you want is your code to be difficult and hard to understand. In 90% of the jobs out, saving 10ms of execution time isn't a goal (unless your in trading software for example).I'd much rather have someone who writes clear, understandable code and help them understand performance than the other way around.>I don’t even know where to use the problem-solving and coding skills I built upThe reason why is the problem solving skills you learned are not the problems you face in the real world. You figured out how to write some algorithm in the fastest execution time possible and out in day to day life people are writing integrations to make 2 systems talk to each other, aggregating data from 3 different databases into one export, building API's with infrastructure that scales based on user load.>Or should I just start from scratch with web dev like everyone else?Yes, its what is in demand and jobs are looking for. You are more than welcome to say \"well i don't want to learn web dev\" and attempt to land jobs on old stacks no ones taking (like winforms) but if you limit yourself to just c/c++ your options become even smaller (game dev, embedded dev...etc) as a new grad.There are backend, front end and full stack roles. Look at whats in demand near you but i imagine you'll see more full stack/backend than just dedicated front end roles these days (At least i do in my area).>Anyone else been through this? How did you figure it out?If you enjoy programming and building stuff, you should stick with it and learn a more marketable skill within the domain. Meaning, look at pluralsight, udemy for courses that peak your interest or seek out a mentor in your area or online to help guide you towards a path that will result in a career.",

        "body": "I've tutored coding for almost 10 years (both as main job and as side gig). Here's some of the things I found from students who were in similar situations (1 hour a week schedules).I saw a comment below that said to teach them ABOUT the world of programming and computing, rather than actual programming, and I think that is the way to go given the constraints. That being said, here are some opinions/advice for IF you have to go through the programming route:\\- Language Choice: Don't use Unity if they aren't going to be doing things on their own time. I tried with a student once, who specifically asked for it. The result was that nothing got done, and nothing was learned because there isn't enough time to understand concepts without homework / self learning. Sure, he could memorize some scripts, and make something move, but at that point, is that really programming? I eventually convinced him to move to Python.\\- I would center my approach around the concept of \"how computers work and how to think systematically\". If you make the content of the class enjoyable, and make the learning fun/interesting, then they will want to do more on their own time. Instead of making a curriculum around \"how much can I get them to learn in this time frame?\" (As other users have said, that is no where near enough time), make it be \"How do I get them to learn a few cool stuff and develop an interest in wanting to learn more?\\- The above point is why I would pick something like python, or even html/css/javascript (yes, 2/3rds of those aren't \"programming\" languages). The reason being the lower hurdle of entry to getting something they can make working, and they can see they made. I used to believe that if someone wanted to learn properly, start them in C. Nowadays, my viewpoint has changed to \"Start them in python so you can hook their interest with a lower bar of entry, and THEN dump them into a language like C#/Unity/Language of choice once they understand the basic concepts and are interested in the next steps\". Heck, if they are interested in AI, staying in python is great.\\- You said you tried before and it was too confusing for them. I don't know how you explained it, but I'm going to give 2 extreme scenarios as an example. Look at this from a students point of view. \\- Scenario 1: You go to class, you need to either learn what int main(int argc, char \\*argv\\[\\]) means, or be told to memorize and learn it later. The former means needing to learn functions, args, arrays, return types, and more. The latter is encouraging not critical thinking. After that, you do printf(\"Hello World\");. Then you need to learn what compiling is, and how to run the program. All that for Hello world. \\- Scenario 2: you go to class, you type print(\"Hello World\"), and it shows up on your screen the line below. You made something. Your teacher can now introduce concepts one at a time, each with you making something. For example, maybe you introduce variables next, and create a Hello, name. Then functions, and create a print\\_spam. So on. Since I was tutoring, I was able to tailor projects to each student's interests (Instead of random number generator, I can do random kpop member or something), but for a classroom, it should be more generic, and maybe more open ended as a project.\\- Going to say this point again: with so little time, The best curriculum in my opinion is one that gets them interested and learning how to think critically, rather than one that dumps as much info as possible that they may or may not retain.",

With a basic understanding and a desire to put it to work, choose your areas of focus carefully. It’s tempting to dive into a little bit of everything, but in my experience, especially with newer people, they offer more to a team when they come in with some capability in a certain role. You can always learn what you need to about other areas on the job, but if you decide you like front end stuff, dive into it and do it strategically. Maybe ask an AI what front end frameworks are in the highest demand right now… pick one, like react, and learn it well. The sooner you can start contributing something to a team, the better. Too often we see juniors in our world who are smart and capable but need too much handholding, so coming in with a real understanding of what you’ll be contributing to and you’ll be shocked at how grateful senior people are to skip the handholding phase.",

For example: put(stderr, \"x = \"); put(stderr, x); put(stderr, \"\\n\");> The type of the argument determines which \"put function\" will be invoked for each argument. However, this is too verbose. The C++ solution, using an output stream for which `<<` has been defined as a \"put to\" operator, looks like this: cerr << \"x = \" << x << \"\\n\";> [...] The idea of providing an output operator rather than a named output function was suggested by Doug McIlroy by analogy with the I/O redirection operators in the UNIX shell (`>`, `>>`, `|`, etc.). This requires operators that return their left-hand operand for use by further operations.So basically, the stream operators exist to allow a convenient and concise way to output multiple values.In modern C++ you could accomplish the same goal with a variable-argument function using templates, but early versions of C++ didn't have the advanced template features needed to make that work.",

Yes, auto date = 2025y / 7 / 23:face_vomiting:. These are all terrible, hard to read and hard to use. Absolutely awful designs, all of them.

And rely on checking var type at runtime - can’t do in c/c++. Java uses weird trick with + which suddenly calls toString() behind curtains. How is that reasonable - it’s the only implicit thing in Java. At least in first versions. Python secretly calls `_repr_` but Python does many strange things. Also, notice how Python moved from print with commas separating args (and ugly way of controlling formatting with `sep=` to variable interpolation with `{}`. C++ found a pretty clean way to do it using operators. And it’s more reasonable to put `cout <<` at the beginning. I think technically you can put cout at the end of expression by using right associating operator but why bother. Assignment works right to left, why not output.",

Here's thing that i learned: JavaScript engine itself is single threaded, but the browser engine uses threads to do tasks parallel to your JavaScript code, such as XMLHttpRequest/fetch and everything that returns Promise objects. The function that you pass to Promise constructor (executor) is running on the same UI thread so you don't do anything computationally heavy there, instead you can use Web Workers to emulate browser apis off ui thread code execution. While scripts are loading they're parsed but they only execute when the script is fully loaded and parsed, so heavy scripts would delay the web site users from being able to interact with the web page elements. If you want to reference elements in a web page via JavaScript you need to make sure that the is fully loaded, otherwise you will get an error that you can't get elements by that id or class etc. You can also put the at the end of the so that when JavaScript will be executed it will know for sure that the body content is loaded. relative url references that you pass to (\"fetch\" for example) aren't relative to the JavaScript file itself but by the html page that loaded that script. There's primitive types (numbers, bools, strings etc) and object types { } (Dictionary with special abilities)Learn the old way to make classes first, with function as a class constructor, function.prototype as a prototype object. Then learn the new syntactic sugar class definer, what i found out is the code inside it runs in strict mode.",

I’ve also been using Codefinity, and I totally agree it’s a solid platform for beginners, especially if you're starting from scratch or looking for a structured way to learn Python and other programming skills. What I appreciate most is that it's very hands-on. You can write and test your code in-browser without needing to install anything, which makes it super convenient for people who don’t want to mess around with IDEs right away.In terms of beginner-friendly platforms, Codefinity definitely ranks up there. The lessons are bite-sized, which helps with consistency and reduces the feeling of being overwhelmed. I also found the AI assistant to be surprisingly helpful. It’s great for quick explanations when you're stuck or just need something reworded. That kind of interactive support is something a lot of other platforms don’t offer, especially not at this level of integration.However, the pricing model is a bit of a downside. Like you mentioned, it’s not very transparent upfront. You get into the lessons and then suddenly find out about a subscription. I think they could do better there. And yes, some of the early Python lessons are very basic, which might not be ideal for those with prior experience. But if you push through the first few modules, the content does become more challenging and engaging.What I’d love to see from Codefinity is more intermediate and project-based learning paths especially for things like data analysis, web development with Python, or real-world app building. That would make the platform not just a good starting point but a long-term learning tool too.For anyone searching for a Codefinity review, wondering if Codefinity is good for beginners, or looking for online platforms to learn Python, I’d say give it a shot just go in knowing the pros and cons.

It’s not perfect, but when I got stuck or needed something explained in simpler terms, it actually helped me move forward instead of getting discouraged.:magnifying_glass_tilted_left: **Things to be aware of**:* As others have mentioned, the pricing model isn’t super transparent. You’ll probably get into the learning groove and then be hit with a subscription prompt, which can be frustrating.* The early lessons might feel *too* simple if you already know the basics. It starts very slow, but it does pick up and get more practical.:bullseye: **Why I’m using Codefinity**:My goal is to learn Python for data analysis and later move into web development. I’ve tried platforms like Codecademy and Udemy in the past, but Codefinity has been the one that’s helped me stick with a routine. The gamified elements and instant feedback really help with motivation.Overall, if you're searching for the best platform to learn Python for beginners or wondering is Codefinity worth it, I’d say yes with a few caveats. It’s great for building foundational skills, but you may eventually need to supplement it with more project-based or advanced content from elsewhere.Curious to hear what others think have you used Codefinity for longer than a few months? Did it help you move into real-world projects or jobs? Are there better alternatives for learning Python step by step?Let’s make this a helpful thread for anyone researching Codefinity reviews or trying to choose the right coding platform in 2025.",

Different people come along with their own ideas and reformulations, but there is no One True Encapsulation that god invented and wrote on stone tablets. There's just people trying to think of programming in a productive way. And sometimes those ways aren't actually very productive, or sometimes those ways are productive for them but only because they think of things in an unusual way, and sometimes someone thinks of a new way that works for a lot people and everyone gets excited about this new way for a while until other people figure out the new way's short comings and go back to looking for better ones.Even in math, it's arbitrary. You only have clarity because you declare it by fiat--you make up some premises and rules because you think they are interesting or they will be informative in some way, then you try to figure out all the consequences of the rules you made up. A lot of math is about just using existing rules to figure out new things within that ruleset, and a lot of different math is thinking of entirely new rulesets that seem interesting and generative.Programming, and trying to define encapsulation is more like the second kind of math.",

At the time these words were coined, Fortran and COBOL were the dominant programming languages, and they were extremely barebones compared to the modern versions of those languages. It's hard to fathom just how much we take for granted with modern programming languages today.In terms of encapsulation, folks were mostly just proposing what we now think of as modules or classes. Basically, the idea boils down to creating public facing APIs that do not expose their inner variables. I like [this source](https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/01-objects/02-encapsulation/) which quotes from some of the originators of OOP-- Dave Parnas and Alan Kay. > Parnas and his peers pushed for not just hiding the data, but also how the data was manipulated. By hiding these implementation details, they could prevent programmers who were used to the globally accessible variables of early programming languages from looking into our code and using a variable that we might change in the future.Barbara Liskov is another big name in the OOP world, and [she covers encapsulation in this fantastic paper](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/barbara-liskov/data-abstraction-and-hierarchy.pdf)> For abstraction to work, implementations must be encapsulated. If an implementation is encapsulated, then no other module can depend on its implementation details. Encapsulation guarantees that modules can be implemented and reimplemented independently; it is related to the principle of “information hiding” advocated by Parnas [15].Those three formed the basis of all modern OOP concepts. They are the definitive sources. I think much of the confusion comes from the second wave of folks who implemented the popular languages and who each definitely went their own way. Because their languages are so popular, their opinions are almost equally valid despite the fact that they all disagree with each other on minor things.- Bjarne Stroustrup- James Gosling- Brad Cox- Bertrand MeyerAs a side note, when discussing design patterns, there are a few definitive sources:- [Design Patterns](https://www.javier8a.com/itc/bd1/articulo.pdf) by the Gang of Four- Pattern Oriented Software Architecture, most notably volumes [one](https://daneshjavaji.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sznikak_jegyzet_pattern-oriented-sa_vol1.pdf) and [two](https://archive.org/details/patternorienteds0000unse_u5t3)- [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZoranLi/Books1/master/Patterns%20of%20Enterprise%20Application%20Architecture.pdf)However, most of those were written over twenty years ago, so [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/) is a good resource for putting these concepts into a modern context.",

Then there’s the group that says it’s about combining data and methods together. And so on.And N-O-B-O-D-Y ever cites anything to back up their claims. It’s like: *“Well, I said it, so you should believe me.”*So in the end, I can go to an interview, and the interviewers can tell me absolute nonsense about OOP — and I can’t even call them out on it, because there’s no monumental work, no axiom, no precise definition from an authority that I can point to and say, **“No, this is the correct one.”**Everyone just interprets it however they like, which leads to the absurd situation where: if I’m the lead on a project, then *my* definitions are the truth.

It's a normal human behavior to want to only focus on what you enjoy with creative hobby.The reality is at some point in your life you're going to need to make money. You probably can't sustain your hobby forever, just doing whatever you want. Think of it like playing video games, sure you can say \"I only want to do what I find fun\" and sit in your room and play games all day. You can also sit in your room and program side projects all day. At some point you have to face reality, and find a way to make money and have some kind of success in your life. This is usually painful - a job you get programming will rarely be the same kind programming you enjoy doing as a hobby. When you get a programming job, your job isn't to make aimless side projects, it's to solve problems for the business using your skillset.Programming is a specialized skill and having a degree helps get your foot in the door, and many companies require one. I know it's painful / annoying / stressful / frustrating right now, but that's irrelevant. Dropping your major now would be short sighted and impulsive.Last thought is your priorities might change laster in life. You might what to buy a house, car, something expensive, start a family, or support someone, or have some life event that forces a larger amount of responsibility on you. Finishing your degree helps future proof your ability to make income and might make that time easier when it comes.",

The only caveat I'd add is that games can be incredibly complex; game programming is often considered one of the most difficult fields of programming, because you need to understand user interfaces, state manipulation, AI, audio, physics, and more... but if you can handle breaking it up into a smaller pieces and figuring them out one at a time, it's a great way to learn.",

But a lot of companies in bigger cities also started to let their employees work from home. And yes, you can become a developer with no degree. You just have to be very good at it. More than half of my coworkers in tech actually didn’t have any CS or SE degrees.Degree is always a plus. I also got a degree in SE. But honestly it’s all about how hard you study/code, and how much you know in depth about programming and related topics. I know a guy that has high school diploma, but he started coding since he was 13. He has worked with PayPal, Google, etc. He started from a smaller company. With connection from that small company, he just keeps growing. You can get a degree related to it, and it does help imo. I got a degree, but I wasn’t doing the best when I was in college. I switched from business to SE and it was gonna take extra year in college. I ended up trying to do as many credits as I could in each semester, absolutely regret it. I almost failed in every class. Didn’t have time to actually study what’s going on. And yeah, it sucked when I graduated and needed to land a job. I ended up doing online tutorial to refresh my memories before I was able to land an SE job. My degree helps a lot on resume, but I think your projects you will be doing matter more. Companies want to see what kind of things you’re capable of doing. I could be wrong. I’ll wait for sr dev or someone to give some more opinions about it.",

It shows you're not giving up, and that's a mindset you must keep if you really want to become a programmer - especially a good one.In general, experience > degree. I'm not a CS graduate myself - I actually studied chemistry - but I've still found my dream job writing code. It's absolutely possible.Becoming a good programmer is so much more than just hitting keys and shipping code. You'll need to accept the endless grind. In the beginning, everything feels exciting and kind of easy. Then reality hits. And honestly? There's barely any course out there that truly teaches you how to think like a developer - the pattern recognition, the problem-solving mindset, the \"sixth sense\" for asking the right questions.That said, not studying at all is a bad idea. You don't want to end up without direction or skills that can support you. But studying doesn't have to mean going to university. I'm from Germany, and here many young people start paid trainee/apprenticeship programs for around 3 years to learn a profession. Maybe something like that exists where you are too?If university isn't an option for you - especially if it's expensive or forces you into debt for something you're not passionate about - then yeah, don't rush into it. It could become a trap.Given your situation, there's no guaranteed path. But if I were you, I'd try to find a mentor - even if it costs money. Good guidance can save you a lot of wasted time and effort.Also: besides programming and avoiding university in your city, what else interests you? Maybe you can find some creative crossover - tech isn't just web apps and games. There's a lot of space to combine different passions.Whatever you decide, don't just think about the next year. Think in decades. It's your life - build something that lasts.",

And then somebody would write a library that has 50+ methods that do all those things, and everybody would include that library in their code, except that some people would use a different library or no library at all, and you’d be here asking why the language doesn’t just expose all that functionality so that it’s standardized.> Seems like massive overkill. JS wasn't THAT bad until I started learning about arrays.Which methods would you eliminate?",

Aside from that, a mindset that has helped me in my work is to think about side effects. \"If I change a thing in part A, what does that do to part B?\" and working to better encapsulate logic/steps so that generally doesn't happen, as it's generally a bad thing that makes debugging much harder.",

Spending an afternoon learning how to use your IDE's debugger will save you hundreds of hours later.* Trace the execution path systematically - step through your code in the order it actually runs, not just how you think it should run. Use the debugger's \"step over/into\" functions or add print statements to follow the flow and catch where logic diverges from your expectations.* Use 'Rubber duck debugging': explain your code line by line to someone (or a rubber duck). You'll often catch the issue while explaining.Debugging - like programming - is systematic. Don't approach it like guesswork, but like a detective or scientist: observe the symptoms, form hypotheses, test them one by one, and let the evidence guide you to the root cause.",

        "body": "That's the wrong approach. Randomly changing things will likely break stuff.Here's the analogy. Imagine you have a car (and I'm no mechanic), and it's having some issues. You open the hood of the car, and start randomly doing stuff, hoping the problem will go away.Do you think that's a solid approach to fixing the car? Would a real mechanic do that? No, they would try to figure out what the problem is. Of course, being experienced, they have a series of tests they can do to isolate the problem and the confirm it is the problem, and they have an idea how to solve the problem.In a way, you need to do the same. Randomly changing your code is not going to fix it just like randomly doing stuff to a car engine won't fix it. You need to understand your code.Because I've taught beginners, I've seen this \"I do random stuff and hope to fix it\" before. Why do beginners try this approach even as they would admit, it won't likely work.It's because the code looks daunting. If I say, tell me what each line of code does, one step at a time. Be the computer. Do each step. To a beginner, that seems like crazy slow. It would take forever to do that (even though they wrote the code). Random fixes is a lot quicker. Do something rather than do the right thing which is slow and tedious.OK, so some steps.**Determine why you think your program is broken**I've had students who tell me their program doesn't work. When I press them, and ask \"what's wrong\", they just say it doesn't work.What they really need to say is, \"I think this is wrong because when I put in value X, I get answer Y, when I expect Z\". Those three parts are key. What input (X) did you use? What answer (Y) did you get? And what answer did you expect (Z)? This is the first step to debugging. Why do you think it's wrong?**Try a smaller input**The next step is to put in the smallest input that causes the problem. Sometimes, we'd give students some sample inputs that were pretty lengthy. Their code would break, but it was hard for them to figure what was going on because the input was so lengthy, they didn't know what part was causing the problem (imagine the input is an array of numbers).The first step is to see if it can handle the smallest input possible (say, an array with one element).**Test your functions**A smaller version is to test functions. Determine* what are the input parameters* given certain input values, what are the output values**Write more small functions**Instead of writing one big `main()`, break things up into small functions. Then, you can test each function.Write a comment for each function and give some sample inputs and expected outputs for that function.**Test as you go along**Don't write all the code with no testing, then test after you wrote all that code. This won't help if the code is already written, but can help in future coding.",

I figure that at this point, people will look at the work I've done and what I can do, because I've had a decade to produce things, but perhaps if I hadn't made anything yet, it'd be much more helpful to indicate I had a vague idea of what I was doing at least.Some members of my family like that I have it for some reason, but personally, if I could go back, I wouldn't bother.

If you have already got the ability, and you have some way to show it, I really don't think a degree is going to change things any more than spitting in the ocean. The times I've had bigger offers have all been because they've seen something I've done and liked it, but I've never had anyone stop to mention the lack of degree, or ask about it since I got it.Of course, I imagine different goals and different locations might change that, from my understanding, large multinationals tend to like degrees, but I'd rather switch to a different career than work for any of them.",

It showed you how to make a games, but they are a little too advanced for beginners since they assume that you already know the basics of coding. At an absolute beginner though, I would study coding basics, there are a lot of free sources and videos on YouTube for basics.Being self-taught at the beginning is usually the hardest part about being self-taught. You have no basis on what you have to learn and how well you need to know it, or even why you have to learn it. It sounds like you're going to basically be behind a single semester, which to be honest, isnt TOO bad, even though at the moment it sounds like the end of the world, trust me, its not that much time. My honest advice for you is to try and calm your anxieties for now and build a good relationship with programming. Go and pick a youtube tutorial Playlist you like, familiarize yourself with compilers/code editors, and just practice the basics like variables and loops. Don't try and make it into homework or work, just have fun with it, make it low stakes. If you like podcasts or lofi play some in the background while messing with some loops to familiarize yourself with them. Write a loop, change the variables. Add stuff, if it breaks, oh well, start over, delete the whole loop and write it again and start testing new stuff out. Go into leetcode and try out some of the easier prompts, if its too hard, its fine, just make a point to try it out and get used to the way the syntax works.",

You now have a few months to practice coding and get a feel for if you like it over design/story telling. Also don't be afraid to not get into programming and just stick with what you know (design and story telling). I know it sounds cliche, but you'll never be happy doing things to prove your worth to other people. I wasted a lot of time and opportunities in my 20s because I couldn't learn that lesson. Maybe consider pivoting your degree to design (some uni's have game design specific courses) or to something that would better suit storytelling for game development. My degree was in IT with a focus in programming and software engineering. To me the hardest thing in my program was understanding the \"thought\" process behind solving problems with code. A great way to practice this for me was actually playing the game Human Resource Machine on Steam. It forces you to \"think\" and \"problem solve\" in a way that is really beneficial to coding. The reason I harpe on this is because to me, my C# and Python classes were pretty similar. The foundation of WHAT you were doing was the same, but the syntax you use to execute it is different.",

I haven't really heard about people extracting data and editing the code though, just playing the games with the ROMs..In some cases, it sounds like you can save (AKA \"dump\") game cartridge ROMs directly on a console and save them to an SD card. For instance, for a Nintendo 3DS, I found [this guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/dumping-titles-and-game-cartridges.html). For older systems,To look at the code though, you could use a disassembler and load the ROM into it - but it would only show you the assembly language instructions; you can't extract the original higher level code (i.e., C) from that. Reading assembly code and understanding what it's trying to do takes significant effort, as it's about as low-level as you can get. And if you want to make changes, you'd modify the instructions and re-assemble it (it doesn't get re-compiled like a higher-level language does).",

You can *read and understand* a book, but you wouldn't be able to *write* a comprehensive, fully developed novel, if you didn't *actively practice*. > watching videos, following along with examples, and I understand everything in the moment....and there we have the problem. You, like most people, focus on the *code*, on the *final result*, on the *completed car*. You don't focus on what actually leads to the code, on the *design process*, which is far, far more important than the code itself.You need to learn to *analyze and dissect problems*, to *break them down*, to *create individual solutions* to the sub problems that *then* can be *implemented* in any programming language.Learn to plan. Sit down with pencil and paper and start from there. Not from the code. Start from the problem, break it down, solve it *your* way, don't even think about programming. Once, you have a working solution, test it. Track the steps you took. The more detailed, the better. Then, convert the solution into code.Start smaller. Hackerrank and Leetcode are for experienced programmers preparing for interviews. Start with [Exercism](https://exercism.org).And if you need to brush up on Python fundamentals, do a *proper* course from A to Z: MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki.I'll just leave some of my former comments from /r/learnprogramming here:+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j9ezmx/getting_better_at_coding/mhdna2e/+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1iz7wv3/how_to_become_a_better_engineer/mf10qbg/+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j3w7x9/how_to_actually_learn_problem_solving_skills/mg3q9ya/+ https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1ioehwa/struggling_to_put_together_my_own_code/mcirhxq/+ https://redd.it/1jyd36k",

The knowledge of instructions and other theoretical language parts does not translate into intuitive understanding on how to use them to build functional code. Knowing all Chinese words is still far from the ability to write a poem in Chinese. The proper intuition takes time and practice to train.In the meantime, try to reverse your thinking. Think what your starting with and what you want to end up with. Then, go from the end to the beginning. For example, if I want to write a function that calculates the cumulative age of all the users of the system, the input is the user list, and the output is a number. Then, I know that number needs to be a sum of each age of each user. So, I need to get user age from user entry. So, I need to compare their birth date with current date. You can probably write a function for each of these steps, and stitch them together. Not sure if that helps at this stage, but the idea might come in handy.",

I got stuck in that pit for a long time.Take stabs at stuff on your own (ie, watch a tutorial, then put it away and try to recall by coding yourself - bonus points for meaningful variation from their example) and I promise you that muscle will grow pretty quickly.Something more actionable that helps me a ton is writing out the comments for what needs to happen at each step, THEN flesh it out with code.

Tech-related jobs have been in constant flux for at least decades, Your aim should be to make yourself as employable as possible **even as** the world changes around you, which it will continue to do.

Python is a great tool. But also, not everyone will be a Python dev in the future, and **not** learning Python frees up valuable time for you to do something else. (You can also learn Python later if you want to. What's stopping you picking it up at age 50 if you need to?)>Any advice or roadmap would mean a lot right now.My advice is: everyone's roadmap looks different. Yes, you should work hard - but whether that means \"get a paid job\" or \"aim to get a high grade\" or \"learn Python\" or \"learn French\" or \"brush up on your maths\" or \"do some volunteering\" or \"learn interview skills\" or one of a million other things depends on you. All of those things are good, and different employers will value different skills, and no one person can do them all.You also shouldn't forget about the rest of your life - family, friends, relationships, hobbies, rest, eating well, sleeping well, etc. No point in being the most skilled engineer in your company if you burn out at age 30, or have a heart attack at 40, or regret not starting a family at 50, or whatever.It's a lot to juggle.

In fact, you as an engineer have no reason to learn programming at all, unless you find it fun and want to learn it. And, if you do need it, you can learn it on the job or right before interviews, or just fake it. Trust me engineering firms do not care, they only care that you understand engineering principles, that you have developed your gut feeling through apprenticeship at various firms. Even if you don't become an engineer, there is still no reason to do programming because engineering is where the work will be at in the future, not programming. Programming is technically dead at this point. It will be back just not in its current form. As long as you have a good understanding of the engineering principles and practices, you can carry that knowledge into any field and use that unique perspective to solve things that only you can solve with your own perspective.",

Nobody expects you to start a revolution in the company, I think that, most of the time, as a junior dev you just need to show that you're there to learn and become productive. Also, if a company is looking for a fullstack developer, it would be strange to go there and say something like: \"*Yeah, I wanna be fullstack, but right now I'm too scared.

First, you should only consider contributing to projects that you use and are attached to, not just pick random OS projects and think you can contribute. Sorry to tell you, but it seems that your current skillset is by far not developed enough to be able to follow and to contribute to open source projects with several thousand lines of code and with several modules.You need to gain experience in building your own fairly large applications first (again not through copying tutorials).----When you face a large code base it is usually beneficial to find the main entry. From there, go through each module in the order it is called. You could, if you want (I do it), draw a treemap, use Obsidian with Mermaid Diagrams, etc. to map out the project structure. Get a general overview first and then go into details. Look for *specific* things, e.g. how a certain value is calculated, how a certain part of the code works. Don't try to understand everything at once. This will be overwhelming.This is also the reason not to contribute to random projects. You are not familiar with the product. If you are familiar with an application through use and find an issue, you check the bug/issue tracker, and then go into the code. You try to find where your specific problem happens.",

I think a good frame of reference is if something can easily be done by genAI (very small and focused scope), it's probably not challenging enoughthere are many smaller details about how you can approach this, but ultimately what you really have to do is commit to a larger project. in my uni program we already had 2 big (for 1 dev to do in a couple of weeks) projects also requiring UML diagrams and MVC code structure in our first courseI'm also always going to recommend beginners to start out with static-typed languages and NOT something like javascript. languages like these both make it harder to understand what the code you're reading (that someone else has done) is doing, and it potentially lets you skip certain fundamental knowledge that is important and helps you orient yourself with programming. if you really do not want to drop css+html+js I think you should just go on with basic fullstack and use something like java or c# for the backend",

I'm a DevOps/Backend dev by trade so I'm privy to how expensive apps can get to run, but from what I did on Exercism it seems like a relatively simple platform, with an open-source CLI and a web app at its core. That shouldnt require a chunky AWS bill.In the end they need to pay their team of 3, that's totally understandable but I would have liked more transparency about how much is actually spent on the infrastructure itself.",

Now, it depends greatly on what your project is, but in a typical project there's just a few scenarios where you'd use recursion. The fundamental one is when you're working with a hierarchical data, especially with arbitrary number of levels (so a tree topography basically). This can happen with stuff like tables (where row can have sub-rows) or file system.I would personally try implementing a flattening function (i.e. turning a list structure where there's a few top level elements to begin with, but each can have some children, of which each can have some children..) and the output should be a flat list of elements (flat list of all parents and all children, of all levels). When you're done you can move on and you'll probably forget about recursion for a long time. Also, keep in mind that most conventional (i.e. not purely functional, like Haskell) languages are not necessarily built to deal with recursion natively, and using recursion can cause stack overflow (due to every call being put on stack, instead of simplified/ignored, like a language natively supporting tail-call recursion would). In short, you generally don't use recursion unless you have a very good reason to, and you usually don't.",

I have written code and felt \"that's not working\" (from a \"I'm happy with this\" point of view) and then either refactored it or rewritten it. Sometimes you have to write code that doesn't work to point you to the code that does. You get better at your initial stabs as you gain experience. But that is a crucial part of software development - you will often face having to choose from a number of different possible ways to do things, and having more experience helps to whittle down the possibilities. But it takes time to gain the experience, and making mistakes is part of it.And sometimes, the different possibilities don't really favor one over the other. Or which one you choose is dependent on the context more than the specifics of the code itself. There are no simplistic answers.In terms of recursion, I rarely use it. There are problems that are naturally recursive, and then there are those you could try to force recursion onto. But it rarely makes sense in the latter case, especially if you run the risk of blowing up your stack when the problem gets too large.With recursion, each time you recurse, you get a new context. Every time you make a call into the function, that function has a new \"environment\" that can differ from the caller's one. Recursion really works well when each of those contexts is different, and you need to return to a previous context at some point - and if you weren't using recursion, you'd have to track the state yourself, often as a queue or manual stack.Traversing a tree, for example, is a good case for recursion, since as you're processing the children, you need to remember where you were, so that you can go back up when you reach a leaf. A recursive solution handles that for you automatically, as exiting the function takes you back to the previous context. The recursive process automatically tracks the different transitions down and back up the tree.In the case you have above, though, where you're just building a list, you don't gain much from recursion over iteration, as you don't really have anything to \"remember\" at each step. The context changes, but you're not really *coming back* to anything after that can't be handled by simple variables (no stack necessary).I'd say: hang in there and keep working through problems. It will get easier, as you'll develop instincts for when to apply different techniques. And the best way to know which techniques to use is by having tried the wrong ones - making mistake. It's part of the process, so don't be afraid of goofing things up. Right now, writing software is your own sandbox. Experiment. Play. See what works and what doesn't. Fortunately, there's no harm in smashing a sand castle design that didn't work out and trying a different one.",

Employer loves my passion for the tech, and those projects let me speak about these things in interviews very well. In my second year summer, I built an Arduino project that would present you with a math problem and you had to put in the answer using binary (with twos complement for negative numbers) by clicking physical buttons. It tracked the time spent on the answers, and I timed myself doing it sober for about 20 minutes, ingested a shit ton of cannabis and did it again. Then I spent the next few days analyzing the difference in performance using Python. I can never bring that up in an interview but I genuinely enjoyed doing it. I don’t regret it. Overall my point is you’ll never regret having fun. I don’t regret the time I spend playing video games, and I definitely don’t regret any time spent that has practical benefits to me.

I can relate to your feelings about feeling a bit lost and frustrated from my own time leaning but I can assure you that if you keep studying to build an understanding you will keep improving. Right now you're stuck with all these separate pieces of a puzzle and you're finding it hard to see how they all fit. At times you will manage to fit some together and as you connect more pieces it will get easier and easier to find new connections. Focus on the fundamentals and try to have some sort of own project at the side that you can tinker with on your own when you feel like it.My own experience - I found it hard when I had gotten my degree to structure and design code. Like you I felt frustrated and a bit lost. We had very briefly talked about the concept of Clean Code during one of the courses without going in-depth at all so I ordered and read the book. I found it to be extremely helpful and taught me structure and a bunch of common patterns and idioms when writing code in a very straightforward and helpful manner.Lastly - if there was something that I wish the school had focused more on to prepare me and my fellow students for the real world, I'd wish we'd gotten more time to work with how online services talk with each other, what protocols do they use, how is information exchanged, request/response etc, as well as how you work with web/appservers etc. It was all very hand waved and the only server we had to setup was a light-weight Firebird local server to host our SQL-dbs.So, personal opinion - focus on learning the programming fundamentals, read Clean Code, and check out how apps communicate with each other and get som practice doing that. Good luck!",

The computer doesn't really care about how many variables you use.It is much more tricky to write code other humans can understand. This doesn't really matter in this toy problem, but becomes quite important in larger or longer-term projects.For humans, giving names to things matters. It can be worth pulling outoart of a computation and assigning it to a variable *just to give it a name*. In this sense, variable names and function names serve a similar purpose to comments, but names are easier to keep up to date as the code evolves.Here is how I as a very experienced programmer would refactor that code if this were a production problem (untested): import re import sys EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS = { \":)\": \":slightly_smiling_face:\", \":(\": \":slightly_frowning_face:\", } EMOTICONS_PATTERN = re.compile(\"|\".join(re.escape(e) for e in EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS) def _emojify(text: str) -> str: # see https://stackoverflow.com/a/2400577 return EMOTICONS_PATTERN.sub( lambda m: EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS[m[0]], text, ) def main(): for line in sys.stdin: print(_emojify(line)) if __name__ == \"__main__\": main()There are a couple of fundamental differences that you might find distracting – using a replacement table instead of `str.replace()`, or transforming all input instead of prompting for a single line. The regex related stuff is a fixed pattern for applying multiple replacements to the same string.But for the purpose of this discussion important observations are:* I think `_emojify()` is a better name than `convert()`. Converting *what*?* I decided against introducing additional local variables. They don't seem to add anything. In particular, naming a value just to immediately return it doesn't tend to provide much useful information to readers.* No comments like \"get input\". Comments are useful for providing information that's not visible in the code. If an `input()` function is called, I can already see that we're obtaining input. The thing that would benefit from a more detailed comment in my version would be the regex stuff, as this is highly non-obvious for people who don't already know this pattern. Unfortunately, this pattern has no name, but it has a canonical Stack Overflow answer.",

The function could just be: def convert(user_input): return user_input.replace(\":)\", \":slightly_smiling_face:\").replace(\":(\", \":slightly_frowning_face:\")but then the reader would have to read all the code to understand what is being returned.Also, I personally prefer to always store the result in a variable before returning or printing it - it helps with debugging, because I can print or inspect the variable, use it in if-statements and so on.

What you have to watch out for is* \"scope\" - the contexts that a name lives in, within a module/function etc., and* functions that change values, vs. return values.In Python, when you assign a new value to the name \"user\\_input\", that is scoped in this case to the whole function. In a larger function body, you might have loops etc., and you can negligently change a name that elsewhere you've been assuming represents its original value. It's OK here, it could be a really bad move in another context. You know, like old school guys like me will use 'i' for an index counter, and then use it again in another loop inside that, and that of course is not going to work right.For the change/return thing ... Somewhat miscategorized as such, because what we have here is a function return. But from an object method. The .replace.replace thing Harvard handed you here, you have to decide what you think about that. It's vaguely familiar as if imported from a \"functional programming\" model, and I think Python programmers commonly get some jollies from doing things like that. But it's a little less transparent what's going on in an OOP object.method model and I personally don't get the attraction. I might split that up into separate assignments to user\\_input\\*. Consider how that would relate to your question - would you want to reuse user\\_input, or have a trail of new identifiers - user\\_input, user\\_input\\_with\\_happy, user\\_input\\_with\\_happy\\_and\\_sad ...? Again here I'd reuse user\\_input, but in another context the more specific names might be more informative.",

I know plenty of people in the field who did CS and SWE, and similar. It's barely a specialisation really. You will most probably discover that Software Engineering and Cloud Computing undergrad degrees share some kind of \"common first year\" with straight Computer Science degrees and about 10 other \"degree pathways\" at your university, to ensure everyone has the basic knowledge required to move on. After that period, at the beginning of each year, you'll get asked to choose some modules in addition to the core modules totalling the credits for the year. This is the \"specialisation\" aspect. Different degree pathways are just different module choices each subsequent year, which is why many universities allow you to switch between degrees before you get to modules that are only available on certain pathways (essentially change your degree title and pick other modules).Whether or not you will be ahead or behind your peers depends not solely on your degree pathway, but also on how well the *contents* (what you study) aligns with what you would like to do for work. You don't mention this (even though it should be the biggest factor in your decision) but assuming you want to be a Software Engineer, neither CS nor SWE will give you a large advantage over the other, and the module choices available are likely to be very similar. I've never personally met a Software Engineer with a Cloud Computing degree, but this doesn't mean much, as much of the content is likely to be very relevant.You won't save any time, they're the same length. Feel free to skip any work experience years if you're confident in your ability to land a job. Use your best judgement.Note also that employers rarely care deeply about the exact degree title. \"Computer Science or similar relevant degree\" is common to see on job ads. They do often (not always) care that you get a 2:1/2:2 or above. Nobody regards 3rd well. I'll add from personal experience that I've had certain professional opportunities that were only open to people with 1st at undergrad, a full decade *after* getting the degree. You don't know what the future holds so make the most of it. I'm glad I did and richer for it. If you look at how your university calculates your final classification there's often an alternative formula that counts your first year marks (they award you the best mark using all formulas typically), so don't believe any nonsense like \"first year doesn't count\" etc. It might, depending on specifics.Edit to add: **A-levels are not 'instead of' a degree.** **No employer is going to pay much attention to your A-levels alone, and having an undergrad degree is preferred but not a hard requirement, to directly answer the title question.** You just need to take the A-levels that meet the requirements for university courses you're looking at. The requirements are listed on their sites. They usually either don't care about specific subjects, or list one subject they require you to have studied at A-level, possibly with grade requirements.",

Find a process that works for you and hammer it in with repetition. This way, when time comes for you to perform it's automatic and requires little thought. Second, create a cheat sheet for you to easily reference hard to remember concepts. I would suggest you physically create this sheet to help solidify terms and concepts and/or but it in a spreadsheet for quick referencing. Once you feel you have a concept, command, and/or process down, remove or archive. Third, pace yourself. This is your race. Your race is different from mine and everyone else's. Comparison is a thief of joy. You should be disciplined and motivated in your race to reach your goals, but don't compare my race to yours. I may have jet boots compared to your flip flops , but I may have a lead backpack on while you're wearing a linen shirt. Finally, be honest with yourself. Our profession isn't for everyone.

So I can speed up my productivity too, you know.I tried using AIs to handle basic tasks for me when everyone started saying that AI would ruin programmers' lives and produce outdated, broken, and bug-ridden code. Yeah, it might be faster because some parts are already done and just need tweaking, but that works for small scripts since they are simple and easy to track and fix. However, it's impossible for an AI to create a full app exactly as you want because you can't specify all the details. There will always be things you do through pure automation simply because you're used to coding.Last time I asked an AI to write a server.js to run express, and it just didn’t work. I had to write everything again lol (by writing everything again, I mean going to my GitHub and copying and pasting my last server.js, which was also copy-pasted from my previous project).So no, AI does not destroy programming. There are no AI writing apps on demand, you could use something like Copilot, but it won't make a big difference unless you're doing repetitive coding. And if you are doing that, you're probably coding in the wrong way.People also talk about AI replacing artists, but artists are still working because AI can do some things to represent your ideas. However, it will never capture everything the way you want because your ideas need a brain with empathy to understand what you truly mean and what you want to do it as you wish. An AI can only replicate what you do, and all the details you don't provide, the AI will just do whatever it wants.You can tell an artist, \"I want my character to be like Jhon Wick,\" and they will take your ideas and adapt them to fit Jhon Wick vibes, while an AI will probably do Jhon Wick and just add some wonky details on top of it.",

CS50 is no joke, especially for beginners, and the fact that you’re not just watching but actively coding along *and* asking questions shows you're way ahead of just “passive learning.”Yes, it *will* feel slow at first. You’re not nitpicking — you’re trying to build actual understanding, and that takes time. It’s 100% normal to not remember everything or to need to look things up multiple times. Everyone starts that way.If you want to level up a bit without getting overwhelmed, here are a few simple tips:* **Keep a small notes doc** (which you’re already doing — big W)* **After each week**, try to build a *tiny* project using what you learned. Doesn’t need to be fancy — even a simple calculator or guessing game helps things stick.* **Don’t worry about memorizing syntax.** Focus on *what* each thing does and *why* it’s being used.* After a section, try explaining the concept to someone else (or even just to yourself out loud). It’s wild how much it helps.You're doing the hardest part right now: showing up consistently. Trust me, this isn’t wasted time — it’s the foundation that makes future stuff way easier to grasp. You're doing great. Just keep going.",

I watch it however many times i need to, I watch other related videos, I look up things i need a little more detail on. Its good cuz, I know the thing that I want to code, isn't exactly the same as whats being taught to me in the video. At the end i've gathered bits and pieces of what I like from each piece of content.and then, with AI, i describe my understanding of that thing, and i have it just confirm my understanding. this leads to a lot of back and forth with AI because now i'm able to discuss the topic with it, adjust my understanding, correct the AI where it sounds wrong, and by the end of it, even if its not fully fledged out - i have a planonce i start coding, i have a stronger sense of the separate pieces of the puzzle that i need to build, and it becomes way easier to connect them all together",

Say you commit something in git, link that to your trello/Jira task. In that task, like all relevant information, such as documentation or a link to a slack thread. Then when you look at code, you can do a git blame and see which commit introduced that code, then that commit message links to the ticket for the change, that ticket will link to the design specs, requirements, and slack discussions around it.There's a ton of strategies you can use, some may be overkill for your situation though. Product managers and scrum masters have roles dedicated to organizing work and projects. My company requires all features to have technical designs approved by a principal engineer and committed to a GitHub repository before we work on it, and that GitHub repository is the source of truth for documentation around how things should work.",

There’s some structure there to help you know where to find what you need.Now, just having systems doesn’t mean that they’re *good* systems. If your systems aren’t working well for you and your team, you should of course improve them. Perhaps you have too many different systems, or your systems aren’t easy to use. But an imperfect system is better than no system, so use what you have until you’re ready to switch to something better.Look for ways to make your systems work together better.

Its fine if you dont know what to stick to at first, keep doing your thing and as you get exposure on each of them you'll begin to see what you like the most.Just the fact that you at least know that you like doing something is a good sign. Some people don't even know what to build, you at least have an idea of what you want to and like to build. I think the best way to not feel overwhelmed is for you to try and lay out and visualize the pros and cons of each field. So, why are you interested in web development? What do you not like? And so on, and that should help you narrow down what you like the most or at least focus on one thing for a while so you can really see what each path is about.",

I'm selling it for low prices, and if you are interested (I am a teen web dev and could use any support I can get to improve my courses), I would really appreciate it. Don't feel pressured, I can't tell you what to do, but I just recommend my course if you want to learn JavaScript anywhere, from basic console.log() to classes and data structures.

And if its the latter, consider thinking about what are you really curious and passionate about. I spent 7 years studying law and 6 years working with it. It's always been easy for me, I got highest grades in school just by reading a paper 30 minutes before I needed to talk about. Never had my notes with me, it was laying clear in my head, always ready. But law is something you need to be passionate about, always digging and thinking about it, even at home. I on the other hand spent 6 years clocking out at 6pm and it left my brain until the next morning. Everyone thought I was a beast, always coming to me for the advice. I did in couple hours something that other's struggled with for several days. Everyone said I was soon to be a big deal. I was bored out of my mind. And when the opportunity presented itself, I left everything and never looked back. Because the thought about changing career was far less scary than the thought that I have to do this for the rest of my life. Now I'm getting ready for my first job in tech.

I'm not saying I'm an expert because I'm not but I broadened my experience by changing jobs every few years. I got new perspectives, learned new technologies, worked with others who had more experience and learned from them etc. If you're having difficulty learning for the sake of learning, I'm mostly in the same boat. I don't have a desire to learn something without a purpose. If I am not going to use it, it's likely that it won't be a good use of time as the knowledge will likely erode over time unless it's used.So I guess I would say that if you're looking to expand your knowledge, put yourself in a position where you need to learn something to do your job if that's your goal. That being said, if you're happy being very efficient at your job even if you're not growing your knowledge then that's ok too. It depends where your job is in your list of priorities. If you go this route though, you might want to occasionally, learn something new to see whether you're still capable of learning something pretty easily.",

It's a bit of a complex topic, so I'd suggest watching a YouTube video about it, but here's a short explanation:Imagine you have a library of books. You could store those books in a `list`. If you store those books in a list, though, you have to check every single book to see if you have `Harry Potter` in your collection. Instead, you can put those books in a `set`. Books in a set are stored in piles. Each pile contains all the books starting with the same first two letters. So, to check if you have `Harry Potter`, you go directly to the `Ha` section. You don't have to go through the entire library.Now, let's say you only want one copy of each book, and you are given another copy of `Harry Potter`. You go to the `Ha` section and check for `Harry Potter`, if it is there, you just toss your new copy. If not, you add that copy to the `Ha` section.",

        "body": "The key idea behind sets/maps are that they use the value itself to determine its position in the list. As an example, take a string \"Hello world\", which you want to add to the set. We call hash(\"Hello World\") and it returns the hash for that string (lets just say it is number like 66457). Then, we use that hash to determine the index the string belongs in, in the list. An easy way to do this for this example is to use the modulo operator. So say, our set implementation has 10 \"buckets\" (each bucket is an element in the underlying list), we can do 66457 % 10 = 7 so we place the string \"Hello world\" in index 7 of the underlying list(i.e. we place it in bucket 7).The core idea here is that we never had to iterate through the list of buckets, we derived the index from the value \"Hello world\" itself. We dont have to look at any index other than index 7 for duplicates because (assuming our hash function is deterministic), \"Hello world\" *always* maps to index 7.However, there is a problem. Say there are 10 buckets, but we input 20 elements. Since there are more elements than there are buckets, its inevitable that some buckets will have multiple elements in them. Because of this, it is actually true that we have to do some iteration to find duplicates. If there are multiple elements in bucket 7, then we have to search the bucket to check if \"Hello world\" already exists. I'm not completely sure datastructure python uses to represent buckets though, if its lists then yeah there would be iteration but technically it could be any data structure.",

        "body": "Others have answered the question of *approximately* how Python's sets are implemented using hash tables, as a high-level overview.If you want to see how they are *exactly* implemented, the source code is all there for you to read, but it's in C rather than Python.When you call `set.add()` in Python, the corresponding chain of C functions is [`set_add`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/clinic/setobject.c.h#L435-L445) → [`set_add_impl`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L2144-L2151) → [`set_add_key`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L365-L373) → [`set_add_entry`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L122-L208). And `set_add_entry` is where the actual work happens to find the object's slot in the hash table and insert it. Python's hash tables use [open addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing), so the function needs to try multiple slots until it finds either an empty one or an existing object that's equal to the one being inserted. Sets are fast because on average, this loop will terminate after a small number of iterations, *if* the hash function gives random-looking output *and* the fraction of occupied slots in the table is not too large. In order to make sure that second condition holds, the code calls [`set_table_resize`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L253-L330) to rebuild the table with a larger number of slots whenever the table gets too full.",

Having a solution to a problem is very different than taking that solution and selling it to enough people to make a living.

You cannot blindly trust that LLMs generated code is correct, especially if you are planning to deploy your app. Code may contain vulnerabilities (e.g. vulnerable for SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, etc), all kinds of bugs and missing features. Who know, maybe even real API keys that found their way into the codebase somehow.That means, that we should still know fundamentals. Not sure what you meant by low-level stuff, but learning definitely will not hurt. Just make sure to apply your knowledge in practice and build something. That will improve your understanding of the material and help it stick in your memory for longer. Don't be afraid to reinvent the wheel for the sake of deeper understanding. At the same time, try to build something new, useful and challenging to really stress test your skills and \"level up\".The difficult thing is to focus on cultivating the right kind of skills and fundamentals. There is just so much to learn and to know. I don't know the answer either, besides the obvious: learn 1-2 programming languages well enough, learn data structures, pick a framework, know network protocols (at least HTTP), maybe OAuth, maybe cybersecurity fundamentals could be useful. Yeah, take this with a grain of salt. I actually started reading \"Structured computer organization\" by Tanenbaum. That maybe useful for low-level and system programming, i guess?That said, I would suggest to give these AI tools a try every once in awhile if you haven't done so yet. Just to see what they are capable of.I shared your hesitation at first. Then, I tried it recently and found it quite useful for generating boilerplate code and writing tests. No agentic stuff, just multi-line autocomplete mode. That way, you still are in control and can immediately review the suggested code snippet, but it saves you a lot a hand-typing.As for the AI, I am not gonna be a judge of whether the hype is justified or not. But, people do use these LLM-powered assistants in professional setting, at least to a degree. It's worth to at least keep tabs on from time to time.",

I’ve used it for a bunch of automation scripts and small tools, and the standard library alone gets you surprisingly far.Rust is powerful but a bit heavy for casual CLI projects since the borrow checker teaches you a lot, but it can slow you down if you’re just trying to get something done for fun. Also, depending on what kind of tools you’re building, you might want to check out Gadget. It’s not a systems language, but it’s great if you ever want to take your automation and turn it into a backend or API without building the infra yourself. Nice complement if your CLI tools start needing a server side.TL;DR: Go first, Rust later if you want a challenge, and maybe Gadget if your tooling ever drifts toward backend workflows.",

But it also has a lot of Perl-like CLI convenience stuff, like built in regexp.It has flexible metaprogramming, so you can define little DSLs (domain specific languages) within Ruby. This is how Rails works. Someone famously made a complete x86 assembler as a Ruby DSL:```rubyfisk = Fisk.newbinary = fisk.asm do push rbp mov rbp, rsp int lit(3) pop rbp retend```That's a regular Ruby program that's also x86 assembly! It works by overriding the name resolution system within the block that's passed to `asm`.It's a lot of fun to write, but perhaps too complex -- it's maybe as complicated as C++. But that just adds to the fun, for me anyway.",

You say you want to avoid scratch, but note that the first week of cs50 is a gentle intro via scratch. Scratch is great for beginners though if he hasn't had any experience. I've introduced a 10 year old to scratch and it's pretty phenomenal to see them get their head around basic programming concepts and talk about them without necessarily having to take on a text based syntax. It's excellent preparation for taking on that text based language because you already understand how things work conceptually, learning your first text language is just adapting the concepts you know to new syntax.",

As you end the day, remove from your master list. Also good if you can plan your next day before you wrap up work. Physically crossing off the tasks is addicting! Then write those 3 things you do in a spreadsheet or notebook.If you have a manager, they will love if you ask them the rank of priority of tasks every week if they dont tell you already.Another easy way to do it digitally is email yourself all tasks you need to do and then store those emails in a “completed” folder after doing them and voila you’ve got them all in one place.",

        "body": "The simple answer is that you need to learn to program, and when doing so never use AI to produce code that has the answer written. You can still ask AI questions about code, similar to how you may ask Reddit or Stack overflow, but don't let it do the code for you if possible.I know that is an extremely broad answer and not the specific one you want, but it's the answer you will end up following no matter what you do if you want to keep being a programmer.Seeing that you have 2 months experience and seemed to have relied on \"Vibe Coding\", I would just assume you know little to nothing about programming. This isn't to insult you, but it's probably a fairly accurate description of where you are.You've taken the first steps to learning, which is great! However, like anything else in life, it will take you time to learn how to actually program. I don't know what you are working on specifically so I'm not sure how good of advice I can give, but the two sources I could recommend are:Y. Daniel Liang's Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures: This is basically the book my school taught from for a lot of it's courses, and I think it does a pretty good job. Others would have to give their thoughts on it however. Also, you would need to buy it.The Odin Project; TOP teaches front end development first, think website pages, and transitions to more back end stuff later on. I have only completed their first course so I don't know what comes after, but it does a good job of teaching the concepts. This one is free and at your own pace, so it can be flexible around your schedule.(Also there is a course called CS50 from some school that is said to be good for learning introductory programming which is free. I haven't taken it, but lots of people recommend it.)The last piece of advice I can give is that you speak honestly with whoever your boss is and try to get a programming mentor at the company. They will be able to teach you hands on, and will probably be the closest thing to an actual teacher you can get.Remember, avoid using any AI to code for you or directly show the solution to problems you are having, but you can still use it to ask about concepts and ideas. If you get exceptionally stuck, you can ask it for a solution (people ask for solutions on the internet in other places like Stack overflow, so it isn't absolutely wrong to do so) but try to make sure you've done just about everything you can to solve it by yourself first.",

Add some prints and watch EXACTLY what happens as your function executes.The trick is to see both these views at the same time. Programming is all about writing a specification which when executed will compute the result you want.Theoretically, these two views are denotational and operational semantics, if you want read more.",

Just ignore all the maths on that page unless you really want to get into discrete maths - the pictures are enough to get an idea.Both of these turn out to relate to the difference between stacks and queues (LIFO and FIFO lists): breadth-first search works like iteration with a queue, and depth-first search works like recursion, with a stack.That's all fairly woolly, but the point is that these things are all related, understanding one will make the others easier, and learning the relationships will help to cement that understanding.",

Doable, but hard. I also found their first-year CS modules a bit irritating because of how simple they were, really. I love their approach: starting small so you can succeed in your course regardless of your qualifications, but if you have any existing skills in coding, wasting your already limited free time in Scratch can be... frustrating. I ended up using my OU grades to move to a \"brick\" uni full-time, so I could get a maintenance loan and have a part-time job. Served me well. Still, I'd say that OU is better than nothing - why?* Degree: Let me phrase it like this - I'm doing an engineering PhD, and my friends in software were surprised that I got any interviews without a degree specifically in CS - and that is with a few projects in my portfolio and a tech part-time job I did during my undergrad. Another thing I'd consider is how much drive you have to go through the \"boring\" but necessary aspects, like algorithms and data structures, without uni forcing you to do so. You can build a portfolio without them, but my rusty knowledge in the area backfired against me in many interviews for junior or even intern positions.Tl;dr: Imo a degree may help you a lot because getting your foot in the door is quite hard. If you manage to get a low-level tech job, this may be a way to go, too, but even this might me a challenge (especially if you don't want to be paid very little).Good luck!",

If you’re just building up skills though here are some tradeoffs to consider:- Web development has kind of forced its way into everything now. Knowing JavaScript is kind of like speaking English: it may not always be the most appropriate language to use but because so many people speak it you can kind of get around anywhere with it. Websites? Desktop apps? Mobile apps? Backend servers? Robots? You name it and there’s probably a way to do it with javascript.- Web development, however, is all very high level, meaning there are several layers of abstraction between the code you write and what’s actually happening down on your system hardware. A rarer and more valuable skill set these days is knowing how low level systems work, because without that knowledge, you’ll never really be able to understand how to write performant code. It also offers a lot of perspective on why things are the way they are in high level languages, which can be useful from time to time. C++ is still considered pretty high level but since it’s an extension of C there are more low level concepts to there to explore. At the very least it lets you interact directly with the operating system as opposed to JavaScript which runs in its own isolated environment inside your browser.",

A TTF contains curves representing the *outlines* of characters, [like in this example.](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/101761/the-description-and-interpretations-of-truetype-font-points-and-curves) If you click that link and look at the diagram of a lowercase letter `a`, you'll see that it consists of two closed curves: one defining the outer boundary of the letter, and another one for the \"hole\" inside the loop. There's no straightforward correspondence between those outlines and the pen strokes a human might use to draw a letter that looks similar. (For instance, a lowercase `t` consists of a single outline but would be drawn with two strokes. A capital `H` has one outline and is drawn with three strokes. An `O` has two outlines, and is drawn with only one stroke.)For the kanji diagrams you're talking about, somebody had to manually draw each character's strokes in a vector graphics program. This data was released for free by the [KanjiVG project](https://kanji.sljfaq.org/kanjivg.html) and now lots of other websites and apps use it.A bit of googling turned up [this project](https://github.com/brownvc/decoupled-style-descriptors) for the Latin alphabet. It includes a dataset with letter strokes from a bunch of actual people's handwriting, plus a data-driven algorithm to generate new variants by interpolating between them. You might find it useful as a starting point.Once you have the strokes, animating them is fairly straightforward e.g. by varying the SVG `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties over time.P.S. In principle, you could imagine using various computational geometry algorithms to extract the [\"skeleton\"](https://scikit-image.org/docs/0.25.x/auto_examples/edges/plot_skeleton.html) of a letter in a TTF font, and then try to reconstruct a set of strokes from that. But getting something that works reliably and gives good-quality results would likely be a very challenging project, IMO. Certainly much more difficult and time-consuming than just redrawing the letters by hand.",

This feels like a python kinda project, but it also depends on your familiarity. SVG fonts is a bit more of a rabbit hole than I'm gonna dig into right now, but this feels pretty feasible, although you might need to make your own font to get the strokes and directions to what you want.",

You'd then animate the percentage from 0->100%.You didn't mention what platform you're on, but on web Snap.svg has the `getSubpath()` method which can perform that operation, and on native, Skia has the `SkTrimPathEffect` API that can do the same. There are likely other libraries out there that have an implementation of a similar API.If you're interested in how this works, typically the input Bezier spline is chopped up into a bunch of tiny linear segments, which have very simple closed-form length and interpolation computations. To get the overall length of the spline, sum the length of the tiny linear segments. To get a % length of the spline, grab all the tiny linear segments up to that % of length.",

There's just a single fundamental technology at play (JS) and used in a similar way (web backend). I'd actually say node might be among the easiest environments JS can be used in, as simplified as this take is.Don't sweat it, communicate that it's not what you expected to do or are experienced in doing, and try to make the best out of it.",

But the first span is interesting. It matches BOTH rules! So which rule wins?Well, when multiple CSS targets apply, we need to decide on precedence. Unfortunately, precedence in CSS is quite complicated. Here's a cheat sheet: https://i.sstatic.net/3yXPf.pngThe short version is that when you include the \".parent\" in the first rule, its specificity score is higher than the second rule, which means that it takes priority. But when you don't include it, the second rule wins.",

Their brains seemed suited to algorithmic thinking. Others find it tedious.It's like those who lift weights so they can get big muscles. They wonder why it takes so long to get muscles. It's a slow process.Most people who learn to program learn both patience and perseverance. Yes, they realize that writing the kind of code they want may be more than a year away when they expected to learn it in days or weeks.Loops are really fundamental to programming, and yet, there's so much more after that. It's like learning your ABC's but not knowing about verb tenses and conjugating verbs.Learning to program takes time and commitment, and even then, it's hard to pick the right way to learn. CS50p is a decent start because it's a course. I tried it a while ago. Like CS50x, it has something of a coherent start (to me), then goes into a mishmash of different stuff at the end. There are other courses you could try like MOOC Python 2025. But you'd still have to learn loops in any case.",

Including here. **This sub has learned nothing from history.**When oil prices are high relative to extraction costs for extended periods of time, petroleum engineering ranks SWELL. When prices sit at commodity levels above extraction costs, petroleum engineering ranks dwindle fast within 2 years. The median petroleum engineering graduate becomes UNEMPLOYED.In the boom times in the 21st century, petroleum engineering grads were walking out of school to 20 offers in the 195k-225k range with a large bonus potential. They'd go bust their ass many many hours a week out in some rustic environment somewhere. There was all kinds of \"what should I specialize in\" conversations like should I do wireline, or logging, or MWD, or be reservoir side, or whatever.And then POOF. Prices fall... extraction costs rise, and that project you were paying the PE 225k to babysit no longer makes money and STOPS. STOPS.Petroleum engineering had 2600 +/- BS grads (and don't forget several hundred MS students too) in 2017. Less than 600 now, and what looks to be about 600 in 2024. 7 years to fall. Using the broad numbers you posted, this is like the 100,000 CS grads in 2025 becoming 23,000 by 2032.**Does this REALLY make petroleum engineering look attractive to you?** A major that's seen 80% drop in enrollment in 7 years because the industry cannot support its graduates?> With the massive datacenter boom, this is pretty hot right now.Datacenters employ so few people once built; you can build 100 more of them, and they're still a minor player. Design of datacenters is mostly electrical, mechanical, and structural engineering, there might be ONE or TWO IE on a major datacenter design project. Hell there's going to be more architects than IE's. If you want to WORK in a datacenter, good luck. If you want to DESIGN datacenters, electrical, mechanical, or structural. I literally work for a company that does MANY data centers for companies we've all heard of, and I am a chemical engineer. I LITERALLY WORK HERE, and for $1,000,000 I couldn't get on a data center project. Mechanical, electrical, structural, and architects, or GTFO.> These engineering fields: Nuclear, naval...GAH... horrible. Do not study nuclear engineering. You do NOT do what you think you do. The nuclear side of the nuclear world is a solved issue and even a large new nuke plant requires very few nuclear engineers. I do firmly feel that there will be a nuclear renaissance in this country as people figure out that nuclear power is safe and can help with a lot of power issues in this countries, I am very excited for this, and actually personally would love to get in on the action given I live close to one of the major SMR players main office.HOWEVER, in a new nuke plant... the majority of engineering design hours will be spent by mechanical engineers, structural engineers (which come out of civil), electrical engineers. If you want to work in that industry, THOSE are target paths.",

So our salaries have to offset that and other basic social services that we lack. The market is horrible right now. Getting interviewed at one of these jobs without connections or a top tier degree is basically impossible. Partially because there are not nearly as many openings now as there used to be, partially because these jobs have always been somewhat like that. Even if you got the interview you’d need near perfect performance to pass as employment shortages mean they can be pickier.

It’s incredibly difficult to get in as an intern or new grad. We only source from top10 schools, top of the class, prior internships at other FAANG in the case of new grads. Once you have 4-6 YOE your school doesn’t really matter any more.The interviews are hard but all follow a consistent format so they’re possible to get past with lots of dedication and prep.Getting these offers doesn’t mean the market isn’t terrible. There’s less of these positions available but the top companies are still willing to pay top dollar for what they view as top talent.",

There's also another $12000 a year going in medical insurance and other 401k stuff.So realistically his take home is under $10,000 a month. Of course it is still a huge number but let's take a look at the expensive side. A 100 sqm apartment in those locations is around $3000-$4000. About $1000-$1500 spent in groceries and eating out. Another $500 in utility, phone, Internet and other membership.So from that $18,000 they have no control over at least $12,000 - $14,000 of expenses. They can only decide how to spend those $4,000.But if they're working at meta, the WLB is so crazy (40-45h needed to meet expectations) that that is a good chance that those $4,000 are just sitting in the bank or in the stock market.These days it is incredibly hard to get this job but hard work and perseverance definitely get you there. You need to solve 1500+ LC questions and ace your behavioral interviews. You get asked two questions from those 1500 and you need to solve them within 40 minutes.

To quickly lookup syntax, or simple things that nobody memorizes?Or are they going to let them prompt engineer the entire answer to the problem?Because if it's the former, that already happens today.... except it's not AI. It's asking your interviewer. In my experience, interviewers don't care if you have some dumb syntax memorized, they don't care if you stumble on how to do X in Y language. Those things don't matter on the job, and they don't matter in the interview. It's the problem solving they care about. Usually interviewers make it clear you can ask them syntax questions like that, or other nudges AI-as-a-tool would normally help you with. I've also been in interviews where they're totally fine with you googling, you just have to let them know you're doing that before you do it.If it's the latter though, good fucking luck. I don't know about you, but I always dreaded open-book tests/exams in college. Because they were always made difficult enough to *warrant* them being open book. They were *harder* then closed book exams. If you're vibe coding and prompt engineering your way through an interview, you can expect that interview to be written with the expectation that you're vibing through it at lightning speed, and it'd be unachievable if you didn't.",

I can confidently say that I know when you're cheating. Software Engineers are not Actors, and they ALWAYS make stupid mistakes in how they answer a question when they have the answer as opposed to when they're working it out. In cases where I can't, you probably didn't need the tool anyway because you would've got it eventually. It's also very telling because you don't see it in any other job role. I interviewed a set of executive assistant candidates for a GM, and even in role-skill exercises, the cadence of answer, the breaking down of a problem, all is very similar. If it's a SWE and they're cheating, they're getting it right immediately, are unable to describe a solution (and then immediately turn into a CS professor), or they can explain something perfect, but cannot tell you any other way to do it - even when another approach is taught hand-in-hand and is basically a pair with a given algorithm.You would be shocked at how common cheating is. I'd say maybe 5-10%, with more new grads cheating than experienced hires. I've even interviewed people that have so blatantly cheated that they've either quit an interview mid-way despite getting the answer \"right\", because they couldn't explain an if statement or why they've structured a for loop in a specific way (it's a for-each).",

Going to a startup is always a big risk--sounds like you're taking a flyer rather than a calculated bet where you know enough about the product, problem-space and market. Has this founder had success with a prior startup? That's always a good indicator, but no mention of that so I'm assuming they're fresh. Since they move fast you should see some milestones of success within 6-mo, if not that's the answer to your question.",

A really successful small firm could die in a month if they were to lose two contracts back-to-back. For the huge companies, any sign of work slowing will often result in teams being let go. They're usually done silently, but in this case it's likely to be more noteworthy because layoffs and offshoring are popular right now. From a business perspective it's good, because it makes you look efficient. After all, if everyone else is doing it, it's fine, right...It's also worth noting that in contracting firms, a LOT of people might be classed as technical/service staff when their job is essentially a PM or AM role, basically tracking work, making sure the client is happy, etc.Finally, this is my own personal perspective on contracting, but the idea that a contracting firm will have any advancements in AI is utterly laughable. It's not even a skill issue, but one where work will need to be billed to a client, and there's no fucking way that TCS is billing someone for the time taken to mess around with AI issues. Contracting firms often believe that they're at the forefront of technology, but my experience of subcontracting for TCS was arguing with a PM because I had written unit tests and they viewed it as \"unnecessary work we will not pay for\". When I pushed back, their response was \"well, it should work first time\". It's an environment of shortcuts, and while they probably love the idea of AI doing dev work, it'll end in tears without any shadow of a doubt.",

If you were new theyd let it slide and tell you something like \"if you want a quicker response from me you should get in the habit of saying hi, but then also stating in your initial message your question.\". I knbew people who would not repsond at all if you kept with the \"hey\". To combat it or encourage people to say more they would always have the same status message that said something like \"For quicker responses please state in your initial response your question.\" or some would put a lighthearted message o rthey would link [https://nohello.net/en/](https://nohello.net/en/) on their status message.",

You network so over time, your \"brand\" (you, your work, etc) increases in value.Then later, when a company wants to fill a role, employees with connections will typically refer people from those connections first. This gives those candidates a significant advantage in the market.Networking also builds a repertoire of trust.It's much much easier to land remote jobs with a good network, since the gained trust can be converted in to more flexible working conditions (since companies will have an easier time trusting you to get your work done).",

Whatever process we used to use, you can call it Waterfall or something else, GANTT chart based projects… they had a very different progression.You’d have long periods in the beginning of a project where you’d read and write documentation, do planning, research, exploratory code. Then things would ramp up, and you’d start getting the real work done. Towards the end of the project, the deadline would loom, and the real problems would start to appear.You’d enter “crunch mode”, which truly sucked, deeply sucked horribly. This could go on for a month or two. Eventually you’d launch and settle back into the beginning phase of a new project. This was a HUGE relief. Then you’d do it all over again.Sounds bad? Well enter Agile which aimed to solve these problems, supposedly. How? By turning everything into a constant drip of 2 week sprints. Every sprint is a deadline. It’s all a micro version of the old way, you never get into the massive crunch time (maybe), instead you trade it for a constant, unrelenting stress. It never lets up, not for a second - and you spend your entire career this way.It’s far worse.",

What they did do is tailor their resumes for the positions they applied for and amplified skills that would pass the ATS systems most med/large size employers use. Those job openings also had hundreds of rejected applications many looking like they were made by AI, or were wildly, wildly unqualified for the positions.",

Not to mention, just because someone is a bootcamp grad, it doesn't necessarily mean that they lack a \"self taught driven personality\".I've worked with bootcamp grads who had to fully dedicate their time to their education + finding a job in the tech industry. Meaning, there were people who used to work at completely different industries — whether they were a cook, musician, or teacher — and they sacrified their known world in search of new opportunities, and I think that that's something worth recognizing and respecting.In my experience, you shouldn't be picking your hires based on \"bootcamp grads\" vs. \"university grads\", \"self-taught genius\", or whatever title/ego-based metric you're using.The criteria for hiring someone is simple: \"Are they fit for the job they're applying for?\" If you're turning people down solely on the basis that they graduated a bootcamp or what have you, that's pretty close-minded and will cause you to lose out out on some amazing talent.If a company does a bad job at hiring an employee, that's mostly, if not completely, on the company's hiring process, not on the applicant, bootcamp grad or not.",

Our RTO policies changed and I started coming in every day and it made a huge difference. Beyond that, nothing helped more than becoming a subject matter expert. Try to find a niche that you can learn more about than anyone else. Is there a part of your job processes that feels like toil, or takes a long time, or nobody seems to fully understand? Spend some time trying to improve that thing. Research alternative tools, try to write documentation (the kind you wish were there for you right now), see if you can reverse engineer it.You will probably get stuck early on, or feel like you're missing some fundamentals, but that's okay. Ask questions when you can, and keep chipping away at it. Eventually, when you have something that you think is an improvement over what's there (probably won't be all that hard to get to that point to be honest) you can let it be known that you've created a new resource or process, and get some people to review it. Chances are good you'll end up being a go-to person for that thing in the future. You'll have very experienced devs coming to you for help/advice/best practices in that domain.From there you'll probably incidentally pick up a lot through the process. You'll recognize things in the codebase as being in some ways similar to the thing you took ownership of. You'll get a request to integrate your thing with some other unfamiliar thing, and then you repeat the process until you understand that thing really well too.Bit by bit, you'll start feeling pretty confident. Source: my own experience, feeling like a bad developer for many years and then having my confidence grow as a contributor once I figured out this mindset",

In a lot of organisations, if you don't spend your budget, the budget will be reduced next year, so there is no incentive to save money.I would never defend anything Elon Musk does, but the fact is he reduced headcount at Twitter by over half, and it's still functioning, it turns out over half the people there didn't really need to be.I'm not saying this is good or bad, but the fact is most large companies employ far people people that they realistically need.I think if all companies ran efficiently, or at least tried to, there would probably be 50% unemployment, so it's not like it's necessarily terrible that companies employ more people than they need.",

Who cares if it works, they can begin to start building revenue generation forecasts on it which is great for looking impressive to shareholders.That's the most part at least. The only companies I see doing anything really new, interesting or truly greenfield are startups. They either last a year or two before closing up shop, or getting bought out by bigger organisations who immediately shed any staff who weren't absolutely intrinsic to the synergy of product lines. And even then, that guy is walking a tight line. That is if the tech is even used. A lot of startups are bought and broken up simply to keep them from growing into a serious competitor.",

It's also going to be a lot of messing around with UIs, Salesforce is not exactly a developer first platform, it's very much a management / business people first platform.So yeah it's probably a pigeon hole, but it's a very high paying pigeon hole",

It's all largely Java-based, and admittedly I've never been a fan of Java. But even if you ignore the \"Java-ness\" of it... I frankly just don't give a hoot about Salesforce itself. Straight up just do not care, and I found myself incredibly bored with the work.It's a specialized role, but the good news is Salesforce is widely used across multiple industries. In many ways I would say it is similar to mainframe. Those industries that still run mainframes really need developers who know what they're doing on mainframe. It's just not something they teach in school, and companies are willing to pay for devs who know what they're doing. But it doesn't change the fact that it's very specialized.",

It's not walking into a tech conference, exchanging business cards, and aggressively shaking hands. It's not cold messaging people asking for some awkward \"coffee chat\" even though you both know you're just trying to milk them for a job.That feels fake as hell because *it is* fake as hell. But it's also not networking.Our network is made up of our *friends, family, and colleagues*.That's it. So in order to \"network\" you expand upon 1 of those 3 categories. The family category's tough to expand, you're kinda stuck with it. The colleagues one you expand throughout your career as you work with people. The people you've met and worked closely with in college also count as colleagues (even if they're *both* friends and colleagues). The professor you saw weekly in office hours, or the TA you had a good connection with are colleagues.The \"friends\" category is by far the easiest to expand. You expand this category by.... making friends. That's it. There's nothing more to it. They don't need to be technical either. Someone working in sales is able to refer someone to SWE. They're character checks for the company, not skill checks, that's why they still interview you. Hiring unknowns off the street is risky for companies, because character-red-flags are easily hidden and don't come out for months. Hiring someone that an employee they already like is vouching for is significantly safer.The reason meetups are so commonly suggested is because getting into a room with a bunch of people that all have a shared interest is a great way to *make friends.* If you go to those thinking you're gonna get a LinkedIn connection, you're not going to make any friends *or* connections. Go into those because you're interested in X, and the friends will follow. Doesn't need to be technical either. Go to a rock climbing meetup, go to a model train meetup, hell, go to your local dive bar and buy a stranger a drink and get to chatting. I've made life-long friends that way.The bad news is none of this is a quick fix. Making friends takes time. We're not disposable one-time use napkins that you toss in the bin as soon as you get what you want from us. If you form a *genuine* connection with us, over the course of months, we'll refer each other because we want to, and we're doing so becaues we're friends, not because we're using each other.",

See if anyone in your family knows someone in the industry they can reach out to, maybe your Mom or an uncle knows a guy who works in the industry and has an opening somewhere.Once you actually get your foot in the door, be sociable instead of the \"I don't go to work to make friends\" gremlin attitude that gets propagated all over reddit. Do good work and get on well with people in the office(also: work *in* an office) and don't be afraid to cultivate genuine friendships. Go to happy hours that the other underlings are organizing, those are the ones where you'll build real rapport with your team, rather than the official ones put on by upper management that doesn't even know your name. Go out to lunch regularly. Basically if you can do good work and be a likeable member of the team you'll begin to leave a good impression on people and over time you'll find yourself with a professional network. Sometimes it'll even extend to include people you hadn't even realized and you'll get offers to join up some new project out of the blue from someone you didn't realize had even given you a second thought.",

You can apply for Graduate level internships which can help you get that resume experience and will have a smaller competitive pool compared to undergrad internships. You can and should get involved in research because that’s such a low bar to get involved in and will immediately add experience to resume and will be a good bonus if you get published and graduate level internships will like this. There is a lot of good paying science based computer science jobs (especially in defense since you are domestic) that will see that as a big plus. Also I think finance also likes people with a more academic background since they do a lot of advanced mathematical analysis for trading strategies. So if you just want to be building apps then maybe drop it? If you want to do something that requires at least a masters like ML/AI, data science or something more math focused then it could be worth it. If you decide to stick with it you should apply to national labs for internships and you can probably get those internships pretty easily as a domestic graduate level student. But to “seal the deal” you should really get into research",

The expectations are tasks you can meet. The other job even if it's a salary increase, you just dont know what the expectations will be. I once jumped ship from a chill defense job to a big tech cloud developer. The pay was at least 50% more, but the expectation was 200% more. It drained me. Im not saying that the other job isnt worth it, im just saying just because it's eremote doesnt necessarily mean it will be similar expectations. Tbh, if you like this job, Id say ask for a raise. Say you have been offered a place with a 20% raise, give your job the benefit of the doubt too (assumingyou like being there) and say that you prefer to stay but you have to do what's best for you and see if you can come to an agreement. Maybe they give you 25% more or maybe they give you 15% more. Would you stay if they didnt match the 15% but gave you around the same ballpark (10-15%?)?",

Also, if you’re getting stuck on the language-specific stuff, you’re not alone some candidates now prep a “core language” for interviews even if it’s not their preferred one, just to play the game. It’s not ideal, but sometimes optimizing for the process helps unlock better opportunities.

I'd go so far as to say it's only a matter of time at every company.It's a very common pattern for management/upper-management to get replaced, and for a company to tighten the belt and shift their culture to the toxic-side.That part's out of our control.What's in our control is how we react to it.WLB is my #1 priority. Even if a company tries to turn up the heat, and introduce toxic expectations.... I don't let it alter my WLB. I do the best work I can from 9-5, M-F. That's non-negotiable. Management can scream about deadlines, ping me after hours, etc all they want. Doesn't change anything about how I behave. At most a 5:30pm text will get is a \"OK, will take a look tomorrow morning\".There's an extremely clear divide between my work life and my personal life. This divide lets me disconnect after 5pm, no matter how much BS is going on during the work day, no matter how stressful it gets. That stress waits around for 9am the following work day.I've had companies \"tighten the belt\" before, but I've always stood my ground. If they fired me over it? Oh well, the culture was toxic anyways and I was already looking for another job. But in reality they never did. The last time this happened I even got a pretty massive *raise*.Toxic management *loves* to take advantage of people that don't establish any sort of boundaries. Really they'd be stupid not to, it's free labor. But when you establish boundaries as the employee, more often than not, nothing's going to happen.So whenever this happens to your company's culture, firstly establish boundaries and stick to them in the short-term to keep yourself sane. In the medium/long term find another job ASAP. It's a sinking ship culture-wise.",

I'm sure he is doing this to protect his position so if you can strip that away then he'll have no defense.",

        "body": "I had a similar, less hectic situation with a principal at my last job. in my scenario, this guy was the smartest guy I ever worked with but had little to no people skills. He put in a lot of work and created many of his own work. He was basically the dream principal. He created so much work and tasks and got so much done. He didnt mind working 12+ hour days, catch up on the weekend, and still seem to have enough time to have a life. He mustve been on something tbh. He knew so much of the codebase, other principals basically bowed down to him too. He definetely had my manager walking on eggshells for him. During meetings, if he even disagreed with anything he would go on a 1 hour speech of why his way is the way. He didnt scream but it was mostly cause the company had a strict no-scremaing policy but you could tell he wanted to. He did snap a lot. Im from a large immigrant family from the northeast while I worked with many people in the west coast so I think he didnt appreciate some of my responses. Because Im soimeone if I disagree I might just say \"yeah but ..\" or if you make a snarky comment I will respond with a snarky comment. So a few times he made a snarky comment towards me, maybe it wasnt that bad but my default is to make a snarkier remark and mine's wasnt bad either but I could tell he didnt appreicate it the pushback. What he did to me he did to a lot of people but it seemed like whenever I had a PR almost done, he would have some complicated comment about changing the desifn of something that would hold me back 2-3 days of discussions. I was a Jr at the time so I didnt understand the conecpt of \"just get it in and create a new task\". One time I had to work with him on a major project he did. I could tell he hated my work ethics. I found some errors in his code and I had to change the design of it. He worked with me to change the design a bit, but every design kept failing something else. It took me like 20 designs to find something that worked. The thing was his original design already worked, but he wanted to find a better way to do it. It took me like 2-3 months to complete it and after I met with my manager, and apperently the principal had given him a list of his complaints about me. Some were fair, others not so much. The biggest one that I felt was unfair was that I had a \"tendency\" of doing too many commits in my MRs. But it was only for one MR, and the reason for that was because of the 20 different designs I had to try. I fought every unfair one, but my manager was very set that he would give me a bad review that session. he basically listed everything that the principal had sent him. I spent the next 6 months working my ass off to get back on track. But it still wasnt enough and in that project since the principal was at the center of everything it's very hard to get ahead if you arent on his good side and I just dont think I ever was. I dont think he ever went out of his way again but I just think he didnt want to ever work with me again which made things harder for me. I ended up losing my job after another bad review. Again my manager walked on eggshells for that guy, the principal would tell my manager how to do his job in stand up and even scream at my manager. I think you are doing the best you can. Your manager is not doing much so I dont think it's outside of the realm to bring it up to the VP. My guess is Bob has been in this project so long and purposely has coded things to make him the only knowledgable person to keep his job. I bet this project moves where bob moves. The problem with that is Bob can get away with more shit because weeks where bob is not working, the project probably doesnt seem to move as quickly. Bob likely produces results and everybody knows it, so most just put up with his shit. This isnt a you problem, it's a problem with how things are structured in the company/project. It's likely the company just isnt even aware of this and it's kind of a thing that has been accepted in the project.",

On average I did 2-3 job applications per day. Cover letters, sometimes change the CV, answer their application questions and explain what I have worked with and how it can be relevant even if I don't exactly know their tech stack. The job I got was for a tech stack I never worked with.In total I had 3 interviews but I was preparing hard for them, spending days learning about the company and preparing questions that they may ask me (I cheated during the interview I had bullet points on the side so I can remember stories etc.). They don't want you to be professional especially for grad roles. They want to know that you are interested in their company (show your research) and tell them what you have been working on and learning. Keep your github profile public and show your repositories they want to see you are doing something.Another thing that helped was looking at some leetcode easy questions, Iearned some very simple yet important patterns that they didn't teach me at uni and I am usually able to solve the pair programming coding interview parts. During such interviews show your thinking, break down the problems, find a solution iteratively.Was I lucky? Probably, but luck is where opportunity meets preparation.",

        "body": "50-70 applications per day seems like not a lot of bang for your buck. I'd focus in more on specific roles using specific skillsets, then have templated, tailored resumes for those roles. Right now, your resume seems a little scattershot. As an example of what I mean, in your language skills section you have Java listed first, which tells me you'd be most comfortable in Java, but none of your projects or experience mention Java anywhere, so I don't have much to go off of regarding how skilled you actually are in Java other than current coursework from mthree, which doesn't tell me much.I was in a similar boat as a new grad, and it took me 10 months to get a job (2 months after graduating). I would have 2-3 resume's with the same or similar information, just re-ordered to fit the job description. Is the job a front-end position using React and TypeScript? You better believe I'm putting that first on the resume. If the job is enterprise Java, then Java, Spring, JUnit are all going to bubble up to the top. Normally I'd suggest having a cover letter too, but it just so happened that all my callbacks came from applications with no cover letter, so your mileage may vary. Last thing I will absolutely recommend is to **bold** the **relevant skills** in your **experience** and **personal projects**. So things like **TypeScript, Tailwind, etc.** should be bolded. HR people don't have a lot of time to sift through applications, so the easier you make it for them to find the technologies they need to see the better. Don't go too crazy with it though. If around 15% of the text in your bullet points are bolded, I'd say that's good. That's just the path I took though, there's other ways to go about this. My job hunt was from November 2024 to this month and took about 300 applications sent total , but I got the best results most recently when I was only sending 2-3 applications out per day to places I was 100% sure wanted new grads with little to no experience. I'd also like to know what your application-to-interview ratio is. For me and the people around me, it was normal to get 1 interview for every 50 applications or so. If you're not hitting that (or anywhere close to that I'm guessing) then you might be applying to places too liberally. That's all I've got! Good luck, going that long without a job is rough. P.S. if your personal projects fall on the gaps in your employment, it might be worth putting the timeframes you worked on the projects. That way it would at least show you're doing something between your internship and mthree, but idk how effective that would be.",

On the down side, he has to worry about paying farm labourers and making sure the ends meet and he's pretty much spent what he sold the house in England for. They're in it now, they have to make it work. On the plus side, apart from a few initial bad starts which cost them a good few quid, the last time he came back to visit in the UK, he had a brand new Toyota. OK it's not an Audi or a BMW, but a brand new Toyota in Ireland is roughly equivalent. Especially a diesel with a Dublin plate! Seriously, in Ireland, that's doing pretty well!\\- Another bought a van, a bunch of cleaning equipment and became a carpet cleaner. On the plus side, the amount of hotels and function rooms that immediately gave him business and even rolling appointments is definitely helping to pay off the equipment he bought through hire purchase. On the downside, he's cleaning carpets at 55 years old with a 55 year old back. He likes the work but it's obviously a lot more physical than he really thought.\\- The last one now works three days a week doing minor admin stuff for an office. Filing, sending stuff out, packaging, doing the odd excel sheet stuff, fixing printers, any odd jobs. It doesn't pay well. But the mortgage was paid a while ago, no real debts, kids are off to university, his wages pay for the monthly bills easily, the wife's wages pay for the family holiday every year though kids may or may not come. If you have no heavy outgoings, you sort of don't need to chase the wage anymore. So yeah, none of that is helpful or answers your question. Or does it?",

Some people, especially younger people, will feel a knee-jerk reaction to what I said, but I feel bad for you.

Also in your practice you need to sort of streamline the thought process along with the toolset.Think of it like branch prediction in computers. The computer just guesses what it's going to need to do next and it starts prefetching data and executing instructions. It might guess wrong sometimes and do some wasted work, but overall things happen way faster than if the cpu was just waiting around.Another analogy is like competitive games/sports. The way you get good at these things is by internalizing the playbook so that you can make snap decisions in the moment based on the scenario. Obviously you get there by lots of focused applied practice. LC is pretty similar. When you first start it's normal to sit around brainstorming and headscratching a problem and that's fine but realistically that's just not a viable approach in an interview, so you have to internalize the playbook.",

Then you can extrapolate that to other similar questions. Interview more, practice. Talk a lot out loud. Explain your thoughts. Have a conversation to get input",

Agency work is also a good option as they generally hire on potential more than raw ability.That being said, you ***can*** just grind leetcode for a few months and get better at it, do a few hundred problems, figure out the patterns, watch some tutorials, etc. Leetcode's unfortunately not really a transferable skill to day-to-day dev work in my experience, they're not significantly different from the \"brain teaser\" type problems companies used to use before. If you know the answer, they're easy, if you don't... a lot of them (medium+) are based on academic thesis work, so you're probably not figuring it out under time pressure in an interview.",

Even if it did, new jobs came from that. There wa s time where companies hired engineers to maintain the pipelines. There were teams of people whose job it was to run other people's code and give them the results. THen pipelines became more automated and now you dont need a 10 person team to do that, you barely need 1 person to be knowledgable in it. Im sure those jobs got replaced, but the engineers who worked on it, got transferred to other teams. Im sure some got laid off, but they adapted and found a new job and place to work at. The thing about CS is, it's not just about programming. You will do most of your programming in your first 7-10 years or so. The more experience you have the less you code. At my current job they showed us a chart that listed how much each level codes. I had never seen it like that but the chart basically said:Jrs - Code 80-90% of the time.Mid-level - 70-80% of the timeSeniros - 60-70% of the timePrincipals - 40-50% of the timeTeach leads about 10% of the time.

Honestly, take it with a grain of salt. Most of the loudest voices predicting the \"end of software engineering\" aren’t engineers themselves and are often coming from a business lens where disruption = fear. But if you’re in engineering, you can already see what’s really happening. AI is changing the way engineers work, not eliminating the need for them. Sure, some lower-level tasks are getting automated, but that just means the bar is shifting toward people who understand AI systems, prompt engineering, model integration, performance tuning, security, ethics, etc. You’re positioning yourself exactly in that space.Also, the fact that your new role is in AI software engineering? That’s one of the most resilient and high-impact areas to be in right now. There’s still a massive shortage of engineers who can build, scale, and fine-tune AI products responsibly.",

The biggest mistake would be positioning yourself as a career changer when you're actually a seasoned developer expanding your skill set. Your deep understanding of how applications work from the client side gives you a massive advantage in backend development because you understand the full picture of how data flows and what the frontend actually needs. Companies should see you as someone who can build APIs that actually make sense for the consuming applications, not just someone learning Java from scratch.The interview struggle you're facing is real and frustrating, but there are ways around the traditional leetcode gauntlet. Target smaller companies and startups where you can often get in front of actual engineering managers who care more about your ability to solve real problems than your ability to reverse a binary tree under pressure. Focus on companies that do practical coding exercises or take-home projects instead of whiteboard sessions. Your strength in systems design and high-level thinking is incredibly valuable, especially for backend roles where understanding architecture matters more than memorizing algorithms. Some companies do hire based on these skills alone, particularly in more senior positions where they expect you to learn the specific technical details on the job.I actually work on [AI interview helper](http://interviews.chat) to navigate exactly these kinds of tricky interview situations where you need to showcase your transferable skills and handle technical questions that might be outside your current wheelhouse.",

Recruiters with even less technical experience and patience, might glaze over it or hit the reject button when looking for buzzwords. I'd either try to simplify the language or concepts of what you actually delivered or just tailor this section to specific types of jobs (like how in these projects you used Python etc. to deliver).\\- Probably remove the EE degree in progress as it's not really relevant or use it in your EE-only resume.\\- The undergrad teaching assistant role sounds like fluff, and no employer really cares about how many assignments you graded etc. you should probably write something along the lines of what you taught and areas of focus you excelled at teaching like red-black trees or something etc. Or try and take a look at other undergraduate TAs on Linkedin or something and see what they wrote. To me, at least it seems very \"I want a TA job.\"Last point is you probably want to tailor your resume to each of those roles you listed that you're applying for. At best this looks close to an \"EE major that used to be CS looking for an internship/jr role\" to me, but has some mixed signals so you'd want to orient the resume better towards those kinds of jobs if so.",

For instance, I work in sleep, with the ever more popular home studies followed up with AutoPAP, it has definitely taken a toll on smaller labs. I am fortunate in that I have worked in a larger health system whose patient population tends to be more special needs, so the home studies don't quite take the same chunk of business from us as it does smaller labs. I am fortunate that I have been working here long enough that I should be able to work here until I retire (been here 20 years and I am 44), but it's not a field I recommend getting into. Long story short, for younger people who have this similar concern, I highly recommend a trade. I have a lot of close friends who went into the trades (pipe fitters, welders, sprinkler fitters). They paid close to nothing for schooling and currently make over 100k a year (I know, its not a fortune, but for the area I live in, its considered living pretty well). There will also be a HUGE need for these positions in the upcoming years as many are retiring and they don't have the skilled work force to replace them. So, that's my 2 cents, take it for what its worth. Nothing is fool-proof, but the trades are what I would look into if I had to start over.",

        "body": "With MSCS, i agree with others. It's not rreally that necessary for us. It does help to make your resume look a bit nicer and might get you a slightly higher role and pay off the bat, but to me it's not worth 2 years of missing out on experience to do for an extra 5k-10k in pay you would've just likely had if you started to work. The key really is if you can get a job to pay for your masters degree. So in summary, it's not worth the MSCS unless you get someone to pay it for you or if you can escape paying minimal and not having to get loans. I had my job pay it for me and I grinded for 2 years as a part-time student and only had to pay 5k out of pocket those 2 years. But I also did summer courses as well to finish on time. As for your leetcode grind. I am not someone who really thinks you need to \"grind\" leetcode to get a job. You can and might be good at it to land the job, the problem is that many people think they can just grind it and dont care to learn the ins and outs of what they are doing. So they basically are hoping to get a similar question where they can think \"omg that's leetcode question #100 or similar to it, i just need a map\". But they dont care to learn why they need the map, or if there's a slightly different approach they could take. I have been in the job market twice in my career, never had to grind leetcode and I got into two big tech companies (one of them a Mag7 company) by just following a google DSA guide I will link below. It has videos from cracking the coding interview author that explain DSA very well. Also links free leetcode study guides with example questions to practice on. Companies dont care if you get the questions right, they only care if you know what you are doing and explain your thought process well in the questions. I got both those jobs and didnt do 100% well on the questions. A few times I got stuck but because I explained my thought process well they liked my approach. They know you wont get it 100% off the bat, they just want to know where your heads at. So for me i like to say \"hey i think I can possibly use a map here because of XYZ possibly a set\" and then I try it. I also go step by step. So usually the first thing I tackle is the return cases. I.e. if I am doing a array traversal the first thing I write is the return case if array is empty. It sounds dumb, but they appreciate when you tackle the small things first that could easily be forgotten. Also it's one of those things of once you start coding your nerves go down even if it's a simple lin. Then at the end I write test cases and try to go through multiple different cases (empty array, edge cases, etc). If any of them come out wrong, then I quickly refactor.Google DSA link is: [https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/)",

Most tech companies care way more about your ability to solve coding problems and demonstrate practical skills than they do about advanced degrees. A master's degree might open some doors at research-heavy companies or for certain specialized roles, but for the majority of software engineering positions, you're better off investing that time and money into sharpening your interview skills and building a portfolio that shows you can actually code.That said, the interview grind is real and can be soul-crushing if you're not strategic about it. Focus on understanding patterns rather than memorizing solutions, and make sure your projects actually solve problems or demonstrate technologies that companies use. The market is tough right now, but candidates who can confidently navigate technical interviews still get offers. I'm on the team that built [AI interview helper](http://interviews.chat), and we created it specifically to handle those tricky interview moments when you're stuck on a problem or need to think through your approach out loud.",

If you didn’t get the solution you failed the interview.I dont think it's as binary as you think. For me when I've taken coding interviews, i've gotten jobs at major companies when I dont even get the question entierely right. If im in the ball park and my explanation as to why I got there is correct, i've impressed the interviewer. There's def been times I didnt get the answer but I also realized my mistake or didnt and said \"my next idea would be to do XYZ since this didnt work\". For me all 3 are just as important but the more Jr you are the more the coding interview should matter. The more Senior you are the more leadership and system design should matter. Because as a Jr it's important to know how to code and learn system design within the company, as a principal it's more important to know design/leadership over code. Seniors and mid-level need to know more about leadership/system design than Jrs but less than principals. So for percentages id say:Jrs - 80% coding, 15% System, 5% leaderMid-level - 65% coding 25% system, 10% leaderSenior - 40% coding 30% system, 30% leaderPrincipal - 20% coding, 40% system, 40% leaderThe higher you go in this career the less you code so for a principal coding shouldnt be important because at that point it's assumed you already know.",

For example, they might think of a straightforward brute force approach and we start with that, then I indicate towards a way they might be able to make it more efficient and see if they catch on and can take the hint and follow it to a better solution.It's also to account for people have one or two 'bad questions', like basically having a mental blank on one. You can mess up on the easiest question and still pass the interview (not common depending on how badly you mess up on the simplest question, but the point is it's not pass/fail).",

You can have the best social skills in the world, if you don't show you meet the bar for coding you are not going to get the job. This doesn't mean social skills are not important, but I've never met somebody fail the coding portion and still got the job because of social skills.

It was more or less a dead-end job since there wasn't a lot of room for advancement/salary increase. Mentorship was non-existent as was training and pretty much everything else. Things were siloed and if you did what you were told you would get the job. I'm thankful I had the job because at least it was a foot in the door into IT. The second job I'm at is better in some ways and worse in others. We're very understaffed and are on a hiring freeze with a lot of technical debt that is overdue by years. Like a lot of organizations we want to be proactive by reacting to the latest trends in IT-- if you guessed AI, you'd be correct. We have a Github that's there more or less for some kind of version control, but it's used kind of rarely. Yes, the technical debt is to that degree. However, I'm lucky to have someone that's at least willing to work with me, and help me out and provides me some advice of things I should be doing-- that's when I buy a book on that topic and read it. I try to do a book a month when I have the time. My advice would be to do that, talk with someone you trust or who is willing to help a little and research on your own. People will take notice and be happy you cared. If there's other IT departments you work with, I'd also ask some questions what they do, their responsibilities and at least understand them from a cursory glance so if you know of something is their responsibility you can articulate yourself in a manner where people will at least see you're taking yourself seriously as a professional.",

The only issue was the new job was in a completely different part of the city.I didn't have a car yet, my previous job lined up nicely with the bus routes ( although coming home I usually just Uber'd to save time). With the new job I usually just Uber'd to work, this was fine. But I literally had some days where the Uber home would take so long I'd just fall asleep. We're talking about 45 minutes( one way) turning into 80 minutes on a bad day. Eventually I just moved within 10 minutes or so of my new office. It was a great job and a major stepping stone for me, but there's no way I could have done it without moving. Since you own your house and probably don't want to move, just take the shorter commute.

With today's market, you got to be pretty competitive (4-5 years ago, you had a better chance of \"getting lucky\"). Working full-time is a pain, and even putting just 10 hours a week into transitioning into SWE can be hard. All-in-all, I wouldn't be surprised if it took you over a year to line up your first job.I will say though, as a self taught dev with no degree, you got some strengths here: You have a CS degree and you've been working a job that will generally look respectable on a resume. I do think you have a pretty healthy shot at transitioning into SWE, but the market is bad and it's pretty rough out there.I'll assume you have some rough experience with programming (how to reasonably use classes, functions, if statements, for loops), or at the very least, all that will come back to you pretty quickly.If you want to get into fullstack, I would start off by focusing on Java / Springboot for backend, JavaScript / React for frontend, and use Git. I would ***probably*** recommend taking a Udemy course (I never personally tried Udemy, but I often hear good things) for both React and Springboot. You can just watch a YouTube tutorial for Git. Try to get to a point where you can work on a project pretty consistently. Just have one project you're pretty committed to.After that, there's interview prep. Go through the roadmap on https://neetcode.io (mainly focus on the video explanations, don't waste a ton of time trying to solve questions yourself at this stage). After the roadmap, do some random questions LeetCode, and try to get to a spot where you have like an 80% chance of solving an unfamiliar medium-level problem in under 60 minutes (if you haven't solved it after 2 hours, just look up the answer and try to think where you went wrong).More than anything else though ***talk through the problems***. You wanna be good at \"solving\" problems because sometimes you get \"assessments\" (basically you have to solve a LeetCode problem before getting to interview anybody), but for \"interviews\" you need to be good at talking technical. You should look up \"mock coding interviews\" on YouTube interviews to see what mean here.You should start applying before you're 100% confident with anything though (you're never going to be 100% ready to start applying). In fact, I would honestly recommend you just start sending out like 3 applications a week ***right now***. Just half ass it, get it out of the way, and get used to it. Don't waste too much time \"waiting to feel ready\" (I wasted a lot of time on this back in 2021).For your resume, skim through the wiki on r/EngineeringResumes. You'll have to adjust a bit though because of your background, but do what you can to leverage your current work experience (be detailed), and mainly try to sell yourself as \"an important team member that holds some key responsibilities and/or accomplishments\". I know that can be really awkward, but again, I think you got quite a respectable role.And finally, as far as applying goes, apply to any role that looks reasonably relevant, doesn't look too \"specialized\", and asks for less than 5 years of experience. Don't be too picky, just focus on playing the numbers game more than anything else.",

Python, SQL (start writing your own soon!), Power BI/Tableau are great tools, and healthcare companies are constantly hiring analysts who can work with lab or patient data. Bonus: you can build portfolio projects using synthetic healthcare datasets to show immediate relevance.That said, if you’re more drawn to building things end-to-end, **full-stack with Java + JS** is solid—but it’ll take longer to ramp up, especially if your coding muscles are rusty. One middle path: try backend-focused roles or automation scripting in Python to bridge between the two.You don’t need to “catch up” on everything just pick a direction, build 2–3 focused projects, and you’ll have a strong story.

I've actually done a few uDemy courses over the years but I think that approach doesn't work for me as well because I don't really feel like I'm retaining any of the stuff just from watching a video and regurgitating. Maybe I'm taking the wrong courses. But yeah, I just started learning Java with Spring Boot tonight. Decided to do a common project (Making a Letterboxd \"clone\") , but rather than watch a video tutorial, I'm using chatGPT to learn. At first, it's been giving me a bunch of code snippets to paste and I'm going through with that to learn the process in how to make a project from start to finish with a backend and frontend, but I think moving forward, I'll ask it to give me less code snippets and more just explain concepts and theories with examples without the code directly related to the project I'm working on. Perhaps I'll try to get the fundamentals down again, maybe make a solid project or two (Nothing too crazy) and then start applying within the next week or two. Thanks for being encouraging about my chances. I'll try to leverage my science/healthcare background and maybe look for more niche roles in the biopharmaceutical industry related to tech/SWE. Obviously, they won't pay as big as tech or finance companies, but I'm just trying to learn and get my foot in the door ASAP to gain more relevant experience. Thanks again for the advice :)",

But I would try to be fleixble; and the work sounds actually interesting, at least to me. Java is great, but I wouldn't limit myself to one tool, I'd work with any interesting tool that comes my way. I do have limits; I'm sure if I got tasked with writing ancient COBOL or Visual Basic, I couldn't do that for very long.Every job is supposed to have a mix of tasks you enjoy and tasks you don't. The big red flag is if after six months or so, it's all tasks you don't like. In that situation, you should raise the issue to your manager, and ultimately, look for another job.Lastly, QA is often less interesting work than dev. But often they stick newer devs on QA, you learn how all the different internal systems and workflows and processes work, you make sure things don't break, and as you demonstrate competence you transition into actual development efforts. FWIW, I'm in a new dev job, I have 30 YOE, I'm officially a dev, but I'm limited to more QA type tasks at the moment. However, I'm learning how everything works, building rapport with colleagues, and building lists of improvements that would benefit the product, and I'm sure I will get the chance to implement some or most of my ideas, during the next year.",

It depends on how well the automation is. I have only done it for 1 project. It wasnt great at first. Most of the automation wasnt built and most major issues came up from the same few things. Because it wasnt automated, we didnt notice until the customer complained and once customer complaned theyd wnat to get on a 3 hour call because they wanted an explanation. Then wehad to write a report to send to them. It sucked.We could get 20 tasks in a day of on-call. Once automation got better, there were less customer complaints and less tasks in general. Most days Id have at most 5, one time I had no incidents and it was like I hit the lotto. But this project was also a major big tech company with customers worldwide. My current company has on-call I have yet to be added to. From what I hear it's one week long. Unless it;'s major incident there is no requirement to fix it until the next business day.",

When you're employed and job searching unsuccessfully, your mind begins to think \"If I could just do this full time surely I'd line something up quickly and that'll solve all my problems!\"The problem is that's not how it works. If you're getting 0 interviews now, job hunting \"full time\" will continue to get you 0 interviews. When you're not even getting *interviews*, that's not a problem you can solve by just buckling down and committing more time to the search.If you were struggling with leetcode, or performing well in interviews, that argument would hold more weight. More interview practice means better performance. But you're not even getting the interview. That's not something that'll get better if you \"practice\" 8 hours a day. There's nothing *to* practice.I'm not invalidating what you're feeling at all, I'm sure it absolutely feels like quickand, and that you're stuck in your career.But want to know a worse feeling? Being unemployed, draining your savings, while still having all of those exact same negative feelings. That'll be way worse. Getting into that hole is how a lot of people spiral into a deep career-ending depression.Quitting your job will not be a magic fix. If anything, it will make your search *harder*. It's always easier to find a job while you're employed with an income. An important consideration a lot of people don't think about is because you have an income you have the power to reject job offers that aren't good fits. Imagine you get another offer for a role *just like* the one you're currently in. Obviously you wouldn't want to accept that, right? That's the whole reason you're job searching, to get away from this kind of role.When you're employed, you just turn down the offer, and you continue the job search. There's no rush.When you're unemployed, you feel an intense pressure to accept *anything* because you need to put food on the table. So you accept a bad offer, and inadvertently end up back at square one.Hold onto this job, and job search on the side. This is how most people change jobs.",

CS theory becomes more important the higher you move up and you should fill in your gaps that you undoubtedly have. A single Intro to whatever language course is 45 hours of instruction with 100 hours of homework and graded exams. That's about a bootcamp level of work that accepts anyone with a credit card and doesn't fail people out.>Or should I just double down on building projects, learning on my own, maybe picking up some certs?Recruiters will not look at or consider your projects and certs are scams they won't care about either, unless you see them as a plus in the job description.

Unless there's a compelling reason for you to leave your job and attend school full-time, I'd consider a part-time graduate program, perhaps even an online program from a reputable university. Expanding to online programs could expand the number of schools and specializations that you can consider, and keeping your job means you don't have to worry as much about the job market and it reduces financial risk after you finish the program.If being in an academic setting is important, you may not have to leave your current job for a part-time in-person or hybrid program at a local university. Depending on your current company's policies, you may be able to do a flex schedule at work that lets you attend at least some of your classes in person, and you should still get access to other campus resources.The state of the job market in 1-3 years, after you finish a graduate program, is probably the biggest question. This is especially true if you specialize in something your current company doesn't currently need. It's not clear how long it would take you to find a job using your new degree and specialized knowledge. It's common advice that it's easier to find a job when you already have one.",

They'll likely ask about challenges you've faced in your research, how you approach ambiguous problems, and what excites you most about applying your skills in a startup environment.The key is showing intellectual curiosity and demonstrating that you can think beyond just executing tasks. Be ready to discuss specific projects from your research background in detail, but frame them in terms of business impact or real-world applications. VPs care about ROI and strategic thinking, even from juniors, so connect your technical work to broader outcomes. They might also probe your adaptability since startups move fast and priorities shift quickly compared to academic research environments.I'm on the team that built [AI interview helper](http://interviews.chat), and it's designed exactly for situations like this where you need to navigate senior-level conversations and think through how to position your experience effectively during high-stakes interviews.",

Then after 2-3 months if you dont have much going on, be ok with starting a contract or something.",

Foreign Visas - Joseph Edlow was recently confirmed to USCIS director. A major hawk when it comes to h1b and opt, F1 etc. Only good for domestic stem. 3. The fed rate - Naturally if debt becomes expensive, labor becomes expensive. This situation is still unravelling. Only time will tell So the answer is: Possibly. This situation is sticky. On one hand salaries in tech are great. But the market itself is volatile. Like anything it's a calculated risk. If you want to mitigate it and still remain in tech. Id consider a double major in math and target quant roles. Be warned, those devs comprise of some of the best engineers in the industry. Goodluck",

TikTok looks like the standard ML Engineer new grad job posting -- I'd bet they have a similar one for master's students. I'd expect the first Spotify post to have a de facto MS expectation for a new grad.I have an unrelated math PhD and no CS degree. 10 years ago, I would have applied to all of these and would likely have struck out on TikTok (no one wanted me in their new grad pipeline) and Spotify research (both because I'm arguably unqualified and because people focused on first-author papers and conference \"quality\" *do not* know how to interpret math CVs). The others probably would depend on which way the wind was blowing that day and the company culture (for example, Google seems willing to talk to anyone plausible).",

The courses (for the most part) are excellent but you truly get out what you put in. I've thoroughly enjoyed my Master's program and I got so much out of it, beyond simply having a Master's. As for the actual value... for me it has yet to materialize as I'm transitioning out of the military next year. I should also mention that military paid for my degree. All that said, I am already in the interview process for a few defense tech positions in the $150k-$185k range so I definitely don't regret pursuing my Master's.",

I would recommend masters if you are potentially interested in research route otherwise if you want to continue with regular SWE, then your position, salary etc will solely depend on your interview performance and if an undergrad does better than you, they will end up with a better salary. So imo masters won’t be a good bet. Would highly recommend reading technical books to work on your fundamentals and get them strong and in parallel work on your soft skills (this is a game changer that most engineers don’t focus on and allows one to stand out). Doing this catapulted my career to senior from new grad in under 2 years over other engineers with 3-4x the amount of experience.The books you read will depend on what you want to focus on. For eg, my area of work was distributed systems so the main books I read were around that but the general ones I recommend are the following 2: DDIA, philosophy of software design. Then also diving into design patterns, pragmatic programmer, etcBased on what you are curious to learn and specialize in (FE, BE, DE, DS etc) you pick up relevant books there and start diving in. Also you don't have to read books cover to cover (though the previous 2 I mentioned, do read cover to cover) unless they excite you or you think you are learning from them. I usually use books as a frame of reference so when I get stuck I know where to look (tbh AI like ChatGPT has made that much easier now).For soft-skills (the real game changer), I would recommend focusing on good documentation (and I don't mean writing docs that no one reads, but being strategic with it) like writing summary docs to summarize complex discussions, writing well-thought-out design discussion tradeoff analysis docs to promote healthy, structured discussions and building alignment, etc. Speech is equally important - the phrasings used, the tonality used etc can immediately set an authority apart from a noob - this also translates 1:1 into slack threads, and code reviews as well. Small tweaks like that can instantly make someone come off as authoritative and knowledgeable.",

They might ask you to debug a failing test, explain how you'd structure a test suite, or discuss strategies for maintaining test reliability as applications evolve.

It's not about grinding leetcode it's about actually understanding DSA and sometimes the leetcode grind doesnt help you understand how DSAs truly work and sometimes it's noticeable when someone just grinded leetcode as opposed to someone who actually understands what each DSA does and the speed of it.

I dont mind being called out but it seems like he's going out of his way just to do it to me is there anything you can suggest that I can do to best approach this. I dont mind talking to him but I felt it may be best to bring it up to you so to avoid the wrong approach.\" Something like that.Unfortunately in this career there are always hostile devs. Some you can learn to co-exist with them, others it's impossible. I've worked with 2 guys like that. First guy, was a screamer. His way or the high-way. I was terrified of hij when I first go tthere. Then I had to work with him. Funny thing was, he ended up being the nicest guy. I learned how to work with him basically. I noticed that if I had a difference of opinion I had to back up my words. Most of the time I was still wrong lol, but sometimes I was right and he gave me credit. I think he liked that I did my own investiagation and even had my own points. I wasnt just taking his word as the god given truth. Now in my second job, I could never figure out the hostile dev. He had no people skills that I could crack. In a lot of ways I compare him to Michael Jordan. He was the guy that knew everything of the project. He produced in his sleep. He didnt mind working 12 hour days. He told managers how to do their job. I fhe didnt like your work ethic, he didnt want to work with you. And I think he realzied early on he didnt like my work ethic (Im more of a9-5 guy). I worked with him on a major project he had created and it went terribly. I kept finding erors and had to change my design like 20 times because each time I came up with a design, another problem would come up. Then he gave my manager a list of his complaints of me. My manager kind of walked on eggshells for him tbh. I will admit some was fair, but others just seemed unfair. The biggest one I remember that I felt was unfair was that my manager said that I have too many commits in my MRs. That happened once and it was because the design changed so much. I fought it but my manager even 6 months later was still using that against me. I ended up getting fired. I dont blame that dev but it defintelty felt like the beginning of the end when I wasnt on his good side.",

Sometimes they are completely clueless people that don’t understand that using a wide audience chat is not how you deal with things.So, we’ve fixed this a few ways. First step is to document every single time they call you out on a wide audience chat of any kind. If this person does this to others, probably should document that as well. The more records you have the better. Screenshots are also preferred.Second step is to let your manager know that you don’t appreciate being put on blast by this other dev in a company wide chat especially when they you’re not at fault for the issue. Include your record of every time they call you out specifically and what the actual issue was that had to be resolved. Ask your manager how this should be handled. The wrong answer is “nothing”. We had to do a meeting where all the devs agreed to not individually name people even in our team only chat for issues. Senior Devs can ping people directly and handle it not in a chat.Third step is if this behavior continues and your management doesn’t do anything, notify HR with your documentation. Make sure you have save this documentation somewhere you have access to in case they retaliate (manager, HR, senior dev).On most of my teams, we never had to get past step 2. Only once did we have someone get to step 3 and HR talked to the offending dev and manager. Behavior stopped for a few months and then started up again. In that case, the guy was gone in like 48 hours after he started again because he started blaming people who weren’t on our team or didn’t work on the project with issues.",

My view is if you are competent in .NET Framework, you'll be able to work in .NET in the first week so I wouldn't reject anyone based on that.",

That being said, a lot of DS roles are centered around LLMS now, so if you have/can get exp with LLMs that might make things easier! However, for \"future proofing\" I think Cloud and DevOps are both the best ways to go. DevOps roles have struggled the least in this market - and most SWE/ML/AI Engineer roles explicitly require it now. Almost same with cloud computing, but maybe not to the extend of DevOps",

You will never finish more work than the incoming one. That's a lost fight, so don't bother.4. You will get burnt out, no doubt, just a matter of time. You can have a Porsche and love it, but would you still love it if you spent 15 hours a day in it, every day, while you technically had an 8-hour drive? Maybe for a short while, would quickly become a burden.5. There are plenty of good companies that people enjoy working for, don't overthink it, you are not the only one who is happy with the workplace. People are not after your job, relax.6. If you establish unrealistic perspective of yourself delivering the amount of work that requires 15 hours of work and pretend you work 8 hours then they'll quickly assume you work fast and you'll be expected to work that fast all the time. Once you finally get tired of it or how other things to do in your life (working 15 hours a day is a really bad idea, means you literally have no life off work), you will be seen as underperforming out of nowhere and you'll have to answer \"some\" questions.7. Overall if you work for a good company, as you said yourself, the amount of work and team velocity is more or less known and established. If you deliver on time the amount of work you are expected to deliver, you'll be fine and that should be your performance measurement. Working 15 hours a day only means working 7 hours too long and taking 7 hours a day from your life which you will never get back and cannot buy and you will regret it when you get older. You will realize how stupid that was not to use your life, but instead you either got extra money or/and better position. Neither of which are worth it.",

But can't admit to it because it might be too much of a shocking / shattering worldview disruption. You're *supposed to* have a good life, you've worked hard, and you have a solid job. You did it all right. So what gives? It might upturn all the tables in your world which you've constructed for yourself to realize this vital aspect of life has serious problems in your approach where you endorse your own burnout as a way of life. This burnout is the shape of *doing everything right* you learned growing up - how can you abandon it when *everything went right?* In a very human way, you somehow both know you are burning out and are also defending against realizing it by distancing yourself from the knowledge of this fact - cognitive dissonance.You feel real bad about it and come here thinking we can provide the correct mindset for you to peacefully exist in a state of cognitive dissonance. The only way out is to resolve it, not to live with it. That's your choice to make. You may be lying to yourself in other ways that promote your coping with unhappiness. If you find yourself asking yourself \"do I feel this way?\" You should perhaps instead ask \"if I felt this way, what do I do? Does that seem right, why or why not?\" I think the actions you'd suggest for yourself will bypass your thinking self and give you a gut reaction feeling that will tell you tons about what you really want and eliminate some confusionJust my thoughts and I'd be proud if any of this gives you any value",

I got more of the \"we dont expect you towork more than 40 hours \\*wink-wink\\*\" chat. Everybody I knew was answering emails and calls at like 11pm. Manager was taking laptop to his kids events. People on vacation would get on calls and chat threads to resolve issues. I tried drinking that kool-aid but I also tried respecting my hours. I ended up getting fire dwhen my work obviously didnt compare well to my teammates who were doing 60+ hour weeks when I was strictly maintaining myself to 40-50 hours.'But that job had the culture of working more. Your job doesnt. It's great that you have that mindset to do more and it will get you to keep your job but that's where you need to have communication with your manager. Start doing 8 hours again and every manager meet ask him how you feel you are doing, if he feels you are ahead or on time with things.",

I worked there for 4 years and I know each company and project is different but in general pros and cons are:Pros:\\- Chill and relaxed. Deadlines aren't a big thing in this industry and most of the time past 5 pm you dont hasve to think about work. THe office is ghost town after like 6pm. \\- Easy to coast - i knew people who worked 4 hour days and coasted the rest of the day. Some older people would leave after 4-6 hours and charge 8. \\- Work life balance is amazing. \\- Good benefits.\\- 9/80 - you set your own time but you can't work more than 80s hours in a pay period. So what a lot of people like to do is work 9/80s. Basically it's working 8 days of 9 hours (monday-thursday of both weeks), then work an 8 hour day on one friday to get the 2nd friday off. Some companies allow you to put extra hours in a OT bank hours. Since you can't charge OT, you put it in that bank and can use it to leave a bit early on a different week. What most people di dwas use it to save on vacation hours. So theyd work enough to have a week worth of OT hours and then use those hours instead of their PTO when they were on vacation.\\- Job security - I cant speak now (especially with some of tracking of government jobs) but befroe that, the defense industry was a great place to have job security. Because you needed securty clearance and that's expensive to get. So even in years where the companies didnt do too good, theyd avoid trying to layoff engineers becauset ehy knew once things got back on track theyd need as much as they could get. \\- The projects are really cool and working with real hardware makes it worthwhile.Cons:\\- Lack of learning. It's very easy to coast and because of it, unless you really try you wont really learn much and going to a bigger company you may feel behind on how to work in big code systems with huge deadlines. \\- You can get stuck in maintenance hell. If the company is running out of projects, they may keep you in maintenance in one of their legacy projects. Lack of developing there. \\- Pay isnt that great compared to other CS industries. It's still better than most careers but dont expect big tech pay and you may need to jump around your first 10 years to get a good check. I made 75k off of college and with a promotion and few raises was at 90k after 4 years. Some of my friends who job-hopped to competitors are making like 120-140k as Senior level engineers. \\- No RSUs. \\-",

Ignore the person who you responded too, the person sounds like a workaholic who has zero self respect.But it makes zero sense to be happy to work more hours. That is less personal time to you. I find it weird certain people can’t work 8 hours and log off. Any hours above that is time you will never get back in your life for a job that doesn’t care about you.",
