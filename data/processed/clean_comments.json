There's not really a ton of time saved with actual code generation for me, since most of the time spent is spent on actually understanding the data and business needs. Writing code that does what I want is usually the easy part, the hard part is knowing if what I want is what I need.All that said, we are investigating many different models for various content generation/fact checking/data quality checking purposes and it seems relatively promising. It's still too often wrong to be left unsupervised (I wouldn't let it publish anything public-facing without heavy review) but I think it's showing a lot of potential as something that flags things for human review.",

Ideally you also have tests that can be run before you deploy into a test/integration environment, and more tests that you can run before you merge your code to the main branch.Tests should be done as early as is reasonably possible, to detect errors and issues as soon as possible, so that people waste as little time as possible creating and then hunting down and fixing defects.These tests are built on certain assumptions, positive or negative, then 'Given [x] When [y] Then [z]'. DQ checks are there to catch when your assumptions on 'given' and 'when' don't hold -- something gave you nulls when it shouldn't, or some new code value came in for a column that didn't exist before, or some formatted number had a format change. You can't check the output for various features to detect if something went horribly wrong, and you can halt the process or quarantine some data so that it doesn't corrupt everything.But those DQ processes should themselves be tested. Do they correctly identify certain scenarios and actually halt the process (or do whatever other mitigating action you specify). Otherwise, where's the confidence that they actually work?",

        "body": "I feel like I’m being called to respond here. I remember you commenting something similar under one of my posts. I was planning to write a separate post to address it, but since you brought it up here first, here I am :)We really should make a clear distinction between testing **imperative code** (like Python, Java, etc.) and **declarative code** (like SQL). There are some similarities, sure, but the overall intuition is quite different.Procedural code is much more detailed — it’s built to operate on small units of data or small transactions. You can stop execution at any point, inspect variables, and debug step by step. You have full control over dependencies, can inject mocks, and create true unit tests (It is all very well described by many books and authors).That’s basically impossible in SQL-driven projects (which is what I’m talking about in my posts). Here tests are essentially black-box tests you're testing the outcome of a whole query or pipeline as it runs through the SQL engine. There’s no pausing mid-query or stepping through line by line.Here’s how I see the distinction in SQL-driven projects:* **Data tests** — I treat these as part of the models itself. Like you said, they run at runtime. I think of them as *assertions* that validate whether the model can handle certain inputs.In imperative code, it would look something like this: def foo(request): if request is None: raise Exception(\"Request cannot be null\") if not is_request_valid_from_business_perspective(request): raise Exception(\"Request is not valid in this context because of X, Y, Z\") do_actual_processing(request)The actual processing code is only meant to work with data that’s already been validated. If the data doesn’t meet the criteria, we terminate early and skip that specific request.In SQL-based projects, I see data tests playing the same role. The simple, built-in tests are kind of like basic assertions like `request is None`. More specific, custom tests are closer to the business logic checks, like `is_request_valid_from_business_perspective(request)`.The difference is that we place the test on a previous model in relation to the one we're currently building, and we run it against the entire dataset — not just a single piece of data. Unfortunately, if it fails, it can bring down the whole build, unlike in transactional systems where only one transaction would fail.* **Unit tests** \\- These focus on verifying logic rather than the data itself. The goal is to ensure that a specific block of logic behaves as expected. Support for writing this kind of test is limited (it’s available in dbt, but I don’t find it particularly easy to use). Still, it can be useful for checking that complex conditional logic works correctly or that your regex patterns aren’t doing anything weird.* **Diff tests** – These run the whole pipeline with your new changes and compare how the exposures or main models differ between the old and new versions of the code. It’s kind of like an integration test. It’s especially useful for explaining to data consumers what changed and why those changes happened.These are all the automated tests I use in analytical projects, and so far, this testing setup has been sufficient for all my needs.So, in summary, I agree with the distinction you made. I think about data test in specific way, I am aware that this is a run time concept and use it there.",

It could be directly from a source system, from a curated lake are, data model, or a cleansed area. The idea is to drive a feedback loop to upstream and downstream systems by engaging data stewards to enact process, behaviour or policy change to drive long term improvements in quality. Sometimes it may be possible to directly integrate with these systems to automatically enact change/fixes, but this should always be done with a person to approve. The point is, what you describe are two different concepts entirely, and are not comparable in any way. There is absolutely zero overlap and it is not something based against data flowing, it is most likely never to interact with the layers an engineer will likely touch.",

As it was done before the MCP era, we basically need to provide knowledge base of SQL syntax, table metadata, and its question - SQL pair to make sure the gpt is not hallucinated. As the data warehouse itself is not neat as well, there was a need to preprocess the data first before we dump the data and the gpt can access it.it also need to be done on case by case basis, as we need to create examples per business use case and if there is a use case where complex analysis is required, good luck facing hallucination.as for the action part, it just become a fancy chat base wrapper to existing app that originally need to be manually operated by some teams.in the end, that project getting stale and become a data extractor for business team to get data that is not available in dashboard yet",

I haven’t done this myself yet, but something I hope to experiment with soon: build an MCP server that scans your metadata and samples the data so that it “understands your database”. You can then, in theory, hook that up to Copilot or some other LLM as the MCP host. There are probably good and bad ways of doing this, but it should in theory be doable. Someone on this sub recently posted that that they had successfully implemented this (I give this sub slightly more credence than LinkedIn lunatics).To those concerned about OP feeding private data to public LLMs: enterprise LLM products exist (ChatGPT Enterprise, GitHub Copilot, etc) and they typically have privacy/security guarantees, or so I’m told. This type of setup should only be used with those, obviously. All that being said, the most successful use case of such a setup would probably be the data team having more intelligent/aware AI coding assistants, eg using an agent to build you a pipeline that isn’t just guessing at your schemas. As for your stakeholder… I still don’t understand why some people think a fancy randomness machine will give better results than a simple SQL query, which is a straightforward and deterministic way to pull the data one needs.",

We have spent decades trying to build deterministic systems that give the right answer every time but effectively we are throwing a probabilistic system on top that will add to the error rate. Their expectation is that you one shot determine the correct answer every time and that's never going to happen no matter how much you tune it, add agents or whatever. The best you can do is reduce the error rate, but that takes some serious work with experienced people, not just something you get out of the box from some crap tool or whatever.Also the context of how the LLM got to that answer that it gives is often SQL and that's gibberish to most business users, so they can't even evaluate whether something that \"looks weird\" is actually correct or it's an obvious mistake in the SQL construction. Personally I think AI is great for tasks in which the user can evaluate the output from their knowledge like doc retrieval with links, coding assist, etc. But we are not at a point where we can blindly trust answers from AI.Kinda related, we had a call with a company that was offering some kind of vibe coding tool for data engineering. You feed it a bunch of context and it would build your pipelines with an agentic model (orchestrator/workers from what I could tell). I asked the question of how it could get to understand your source systems when the documentation is often lacking. They said the expectation was that you had full documentation for your systems that you could feed to the tool. I almost laughed because I have never actually seen that anywhere outside of maybe a small biz that only uses Salesforce or something.",

My team DE's use DBT heavily for the data pipeline work, without data models, they cannot build proper structured pipelines. Data Models are the foundations for any OLTP and OLAP systems, they are systems, tools and applications agnostics. Few tweaks here and there but for most part, a strong base model can be plugged into any application. Data Vault has got more popularity in Europe than in North America, but it'll take sometime for companies to adopt it. I sometimes feel that the art of data modeling is a long forgotten skill. My team tech lead comes from traditional ETL background and has done lot of modeling in his past. I still spend lot of time on the model naming conventions and establishing proper standards. Every field when read the first time should for most part convey a business meaning, inform users of what type of data it might be storing rather than guessing games.",

Data engineers often work within a data platorm or framework, so I am not sure what is being built where an integration test would be useful beyond valdiating results in a Dev and/or UAT environment.

There is no simple way to change the inputs and capture outputs of a SQL select statement. When you’re developing, it’s natural to just want to run an SQL statement and see the output, and it’s not that straightforward when you’ve got a template and model jargon.You have to template your code out to parameterize every input and output. Then you have to figure out how you’re going to get your test cases hooked up in there. Tools like dbt and sqlmesh don’t feel like they scale all that well imo, and it’s odd to store database tables to test as yaml.Plus some more head scratchers about how you’re going to make ephemeral and idempotent tests, and separate environments. When I started, nobody at my organization was aware of the tooling that can do this. It can feel overwhelming to set up a good CICD process.",

In my experience (mostly feeding business/analytics reports) having good tests for business logic is more useful than technical testing (like is this column nullable or unique, etc) because I'm trying to minimize scenarios where the data pipelines succeed but the numbers make no sense to business people and then the business complains or stops trusting the numbers. And I find a decent amount of issues with technical data quality will be noticeable immediately, like if you try to upsert with a duplicate PK, the pipeline will fail and you'll get a notification. It seems like you have the perspective of a DE working in a tech minded company where tech/software is the product, so it makes sense to have the highest possible software quality. This is not the case for all non software companies, where having old and shitty software is the norm and asking for budget increases gets you laughed out of the room. This culture filters down into who gets hired and what tools get used, so the business ends up with worse quality engineering talent all else equal. Sometimes that blows up in the business's face, other times nothing bad happens for years. Those DEs probably aren't going to write tests because they don't see the benefits, are too lazy, are overworked, or don't have the budget (or some other excuse). idk if that answers your question but i think it describes reality a bit better than the strawman arguments the earlier commenters provided",

        "body": "I've been working on (and failing at, honestly) getting data engineers to adopt proper testing practices for ten years. Here's what I've observed:1.     **Legacy Systems and Technical Debt** Many organizations are stuck with legacy data architectures - monolithic data warehouses, batch ETL processes built years ago - that are incredibly difficult to modernize. The technical debt from years of ad hoc development makes implementing proper testing and observability feel like trying to retrofit a Formula 1 engine into a horse-drawn carriage. Migrating to modern cloud-native stacks requires significant investment that many companies aren't willing to make.2.     **Lack of Data Engineering Maturity** This is the big one. Most companies still treat data engineering as a back-office function rather than a core engineering discipline. You end up with a mess of one-off scripts, undocumented workflows, and manual interventions everywhere. Very few data teams practice basic software engineering principles like CI/CD, proper testing, or version control for their pipelines.3.     **Resistance to Cultural Change** Data teams have historically worked in silos - engineers, analysts, scientists, and business teams all doing their own thing. DataOps requires breaking down these silos and adopting agile methodologies, which is genuinely disruptive to existing workflows. Leadership has to drive this cultural shift, but most executives don't understand data engineering well enough to know what needs to change.  You need to test at every point on the data joureny4.     **Tooling Complexity & Vendor Overload** The data tooling landscape is overwhelming. Every vendor promises to solve all your problems, but integrating everything into a coherent, testable system is a nightmare.5.     **Lack of Automated Testing & Observability** This is where we really fail compared to software engineering. Data teams still rely on manual SQL checks instead of automated data quality pipelines. We have open source tools now - Great Expectations, , dbt tests, and my company's DataOps Data Quality TestGen - but adoption is still painfully slow.6.     **The Meaning of \"Testing\" is Confusing** This one drives me crazy. When software engineers talk about testing, they mean unit tests, integration tests, etc. that run during development and deployment. But in data engineering, \"testing\" could mean: Testing your code logic during development (like software engineers do), Testing data quality when new data arrives in production, Testing data at various points in the produict process.7.     **Do you test in development when code changes, or in production when data changes? The answer is YES to both**, but most teams don't distinguish between these different types of testing. This confusion leads to either over-engineering development tests or completely ignoring runtime data quality checks. We need both static code testing AND dynamic data testing, but the industry hasn't standardized the terminology or tooling around this distinction.8.     **Regulatory & Compliance Challenges** Compliance requirements often prioritize audit trails over engineering best practices, creating friction around automation.9.     **Lack of Executive Buy-In & ROI Justification** It's hard to quantify the ROI of \"preventing data disasters that haven't happened yet.\" Executives see testing as overhead rather than insurance.The frustrating part is that we know how to solve these problems - the tools and methodologies exist. But changing organizational culture and overcoming years of technical debt is incredibly difficult. It's like trying to rebuild a plane while it's flying.",

So even though we pull changes instantly from the source, we can hold them in our internal buffer (cheap object storage) and forward them downstream however you want, hourly, daily, whatever. That gives you the performance and safety of CDC without forcing a real-time architecture where it’s not needed.So yeah, real-time extraction doesn’t mean real-time everything.

        "body": "You need to see every state change.Take a CRM with a customer issue workflow. The issue may bounce between a variety of states through the day, and the CRM doesn't log all of the information related to the state change at the time it was made into a fully comprehensive audit log. This is even a reason why the system might have CDC enabled -- so that this in depth functionality is offloaded from the system.Alternatively, getting account balance and related details in a banking system on each transaction. Transactions may not log the actual remaining balance at the time, that's just on the account table. You might want analyses on lowest/highest value on account even during the day, or the amount of time spent below a balance level or in arrears.All sorts of tables live system back ends may provide better information if all their state changes are logged to a full history table.You might not necessarily *need* this now, but I've seen business want to convert to faster update frequencies and/or finer granularity pretty frequently. It is generally not that much more difficult to set up, and once you have the pattern set once it is just repeated for every other table.Doing it by default makes later development much easier. If it saves the work of just a single person for just one week in an entire year, that could be worth $10k/yr. Is the marginal cost of the full history more than that? Does it save so little development time? What if an ask for finer grained data came in for more tables? What's the lost value of all the data you *didn't* collect?---Speed / latency and flexibilityIf you bring this into a bronze style append-only log table, you have access to all the data essentially immediately. Any use case that could ever use just the latest state information without having to burn down the core database with excessive queries to get it will want to hit this instead. You can be constantly ingesting this data.You don't have to integrate it into SCD2 tables constantly though. You could do that daily, or hourly, or every 15 minutes, or skip it on weekends, or do it monthly, or on demand. Because the incoming data is a full change log it doesn't matter how often you run the process, it works the exact same way. It isn't like snapshots where you have to run each snapshot individually and sequentially in order to get the correct behaviour for building a history, and you run into issues when you have to skip a day due to the source system having a planned outage because your DQ checks throw up errors that you're missing a snapshot.---Efficiency with actual slow changesIf only a small proportion of the data is changing over a given snapshot period, then you don't need to be sending the 10x, 100x, 1000x, or 10_000x data volume of the full snapshot just to make the state change (including deletes) calculable. You can get away with sending significantly less data.If your integration process to SCD2 or other tables is set up properly, you can also get away with significantly less processing. Only the primary keys in the latest CDC slice will be updated, and only for SCD2 records that are currently active (or end after the CDC slice starts). You can filter the target table for the appropriate date range then semi-join on the primary keys to limit what you're working with. I've had this cut down the amount of data being processed when compared to snapshots by ~95%---Automation and concurrent usesCDC is useful for all sorts of ways to use a database, and it is a fairly generic feature. Rather than maintaining lots of manual queries to snapshot data and then having to write more scripts to export it and transfer it, some SaaS come with built-in CDC processes where you can direct the data to be emitted to lake storage, or to an event system like Kafka. It may be significantly easier for the ops team for the original database to just enable CDC and point it to somewhere you can access, rather than managing and tweaking an in-house snapshot setup.If the CDC is being evented out low latency as it occurs, it could also have multiple consumers. There may be other processes around the business that want to follow along on data level changes to trigger alerts or workflows, so that the business doesn't have to dig into the guts of a SaaS or overload the development team. If they're setting this up anyway, there's no need to then set up another redundant process for another team, they can just pull the CDC like anyone else.--- CaveatIf the data is changing extremely rapidly and outpaces the size of a daily snapshot, then you're probably not really looking at something that's typically usable as an SCD2 table, or at least one where it probably isn't helpful. You can often just have an append-only table for the CDC if all the data are essentially inserts, as would be the case for banking transactions for example. Or you might want to initially ingest into an append-only table, then on a daily run grab the last change per primarty key before midnight to generate a daily snapshot delta.In any case, for almost everything you receive, always put it into an append-only table first, then work with it from there. It almost always make later processing easier and more efficient, it really helps with being able to test or scope out changes on real data, and if anything ever goes wrong with the integrated (eg SCD2) data then you've got an essentially immutable copy that you can rerun and restore from.",

        "body": "I think the question is confusing a little unstructured data (image, video, etc.) and unprocessed structured data (raw JSON, raw CSV, etc.). My experience is on structured data, so I will be answering about this.In my understanding, the value proposition of the \"lake house\" as opposed to \"data lake + data warehouse\", is to reduce the amount of tools and data pipelines required to get your data from a raw state to a state that your end user can analyze.1. data lake + data warehouse (from Hadoop ~ 2007 then cloud ~ 2015): 1. ETL 1: Raw data is extracted/transformed/loaded (ETLed, or just dumped) into the data lake. 2. Storage 1: A data lake is optimized for massive low-cost storage (S3, GCS, Azure blob, MinIO). 3. ETL 2: Data lake data is cleaned, joined, aggregated etc. into a query-able state loaded in the data warehouse. 4. Storage 2: A data warehouse is optimized for analytical-oriented queries OLAP. It is generally an expensive independent black-box service with its own internal file storage so it requires additional data transfer (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift etc.).2. lake house (from Delta Lake ~ 2019): 1. ETL 1: Same as above. 2. Storage 1: Same as above. 3. ETL 2: Same as above, but you're not loading into a separate OLAP service, you stay in your object storage and just store in a different format, a lake house format. 4. Storage 2: A lake house (Delta Lake, Iceberg, Duck Lake) is optimized for OLAP queries, but it can be created in the same massive low-cost storage as Storage 1. It relies on additional table metadata that allows replicating some of the features and optimizations that make the previous OLAP services more performant than querying a basic partitioned Parquet table. For example, compared to Parquet only, it allows: 1. transactional changes (either successful or not at all), 1. schema evolution (adding new columns without rewriting the whole table), 1. time travel to previous versions, 1. upsert/delete/merge at the file level instead of the partition level, 1. and related read/write optimizations.> 1 - One of the most common examples is the data lake populated with tons of parquet files. How different from each other in data types, number of columns etc are these files? If not very much, why not just throw it all in a pipeline to clean/normalize the data and store the output in a common warehouse?So the key with Lake House tech is you can keep using your massive low-cost object storage for your OLAP layer as opposed to loading into an expensive OLAP black box. I have not detailed the generation before \"data lake + data warehouse\" (before Hadoop), which is mostly \"OLTP + data warehouse\", as you didn't ask about it.You can find more details in this article from Databricks who makes Delta Lake: https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf> 3 - Will these technologies become the de facto standard in the near future, turning traditional lakes and warehouses obsolete?Given their killer features above, I think so. But it can be a progressive evolution of your existing data lake, you don't have to trash it. Now, \"lake house\" warehouses are still distributed \"big data\" warehouses, which means they shine in processing huge amounts of data in a reasonable time and cost, and they do that better than partitioned Parquet tables. But this is still not as performant as PostgreSQL on average data, highly specialized OLAP databases like Click House or expensive black box OLAP like Snowflake. Although, Duck Lake may be bridging the gap for average data, with its metadata stored in OLTP instead of file, and its highly performant single process C++ engine.",

Many of the systems that are older, but still very functional, are also very brittle. You don't change the file format just because you want to use a different format. You have to come up with a business case that makes changing the format worth it. BTW, cost savings are a terrible way to start a discussion to get money. Figure out how to make more money by changing the file format and you may have something.2. We have heard all about the coming of semi-structured or unstructured data for years. Like cold fusion, it is just 20 years away. PDFs are a horrible way to move data. They are designed for how the information looks, not how it is held. You wouldn't believe the number of escape sequences are used to make PDFs look good. Those are very hard to get the data out of. Ask your local data scientist how much they love pulling data out of PDFs. They'll tell you it sucks. The first step to using them is to get the info out of the PDF into text and then try to make it work.3. Not even close. 90% of what you hear about these \"coming technologies\" is marketing BS. Know what huge financial institutions, like BoA, and huge retail, like Walmart, use? They are still using EDI. Yep, technologies from the 70s and 80s. Why? Because it works and they all trust it. These newer technologies are a long way from that.",

It's a shit show almost everywhere and most of us are just trying to make it work and learn as we go. If everyone had well thought out plans, competent data governance, expert engineers in every tool under the sun, clear ownership, and clean data then most of us wouldn't have a job. I'd bet good money that you could take any given person that says they don't have what you're describing at their job, go to their workplace, and you'd find a bunch of random garbage in spreadsheets in the finance department, random junk getting imported into tables with \"tmp\" or \"stage\" in the name that have wormed their way into production processes, broken processes, and multiple people within the org using totally different definitions of the same thing but reporting the results to stakeholders. Anyone pretending otherwise is lying or too ignorant to know they're lying.",

This means understanding your source data fields and testing them. This is especially true for json blobs where nested keys are expected to hold json data, only to find that the API actually returns null values or different nested values or keys based on other keys in the blob - yay. But achieving this is not easy. You need to get in contact with the business owner / data owner to understand the fields and the business rules (and what they mean). And you need to ensure you've got signoff prior to deploying the pipeline, so that any failures can be reviewed with them before you make your pipeline constraints more lenient. Trust me. But, the myth of \"we will fix it in post\" is real, and never actually happens once the next pipeline comes your way. Post-fixing methodologies are essentially like adding a second etl to your pipeline - which you will also need to maintain, and it's totally abstracted away from the source data pipeline now. Most analytics is quite removed from production systems, and business/ stakeholders want their data NOW. But part of any data pipeline is the \"people pipeline\", connecting people from the relevant domains into a single conversation so that parties can understand the risks and uncertainties and the business rules. But, if you only build pipelines and you don't care about what happens after you give the data to people, or you don't care about the teams who need to use the data, then just build tests against your destination schema constraints. Bonus shortcut, just exclude all records that fail the test and magically your pipeline never fails. Business will think you're a rockstar! I strongly encourage KYD.",

Then, half a year later, after adding new logic, it failed right away pointing that something went wrong. **Regression testing** could be the most rewarding. The idea is simple: produce two versions of a table, before and after applying the changes. Then compare them record by record, see what doesn't match, and try to understand why.These two require the least investment from you yet bring immediate value.",

Most systems aren’t fully sequential because you need that all part of the pipeline support sequential task to deliver you data sequentially which is not the most common. For example at the moment you rely on s3 events, you’ve just lost your ordering. Can be interesting to build things in order but also to find missing data.And like you said, build test right (closer to your business domain tables), then shift left (closer to the source of data) anytime it’s possible. It’s usually easier to build a test that apply to a specific domain use case because you know what you want and expect. And it’s always better to test closer to the source.",

Great if you want full control in code (Python-native), lightweight pipelines and open-source flexibility.As for LLMs, tools that integrate LLMs to auto-build or fix connectors will have a huge edge. Airbyte already started exploring this. I don’t think these tools will disappear.",

I see that updating your business data once a day might be a bit slow, but wouldn't every, say 5min, be totally fine?In parallel you're mentioning metrics for system outages. From my point of view, those shouldn't be part of your CDC workflow, but rather in Monitoring system, e.g. Datadog. Could you elaborate here a bit, on what you envision here?",

When we shift to corporate, there will be politics involved or there will be some culture that you have to adopt. In this case, sounds like the culture is not that good. You might not be culture fit. But it doesn’t mean that your bad or you underperform. It’s just that the company’s culture don’t fit your values. Working outside shift hours is bad. There has to be some level of respect there. Not unless the role requires an on-call responsibility. Don’t be too hard on yourself, brother. On the other hand, there are also some factors that might contribute to your situation. It might be possible that your communication style ia different from the the comm style of your boss or your peers. For example, there are some people who don’t respond via email. They respond via chat. You mentioned that you tagged your boss on a doc and he seemed to miss that. So, that might be an issue. Adjust to your boss’ comm style. If he wants a chat, then do so. His email might be swamp with a lot of emails so your email might be burried in his inbox. Another thing is, in start ups autonomy is the usual culture. In corporate, it’s not always the case. There will be a lot of times that you have to have buyins from certain stakeholders. Even your boss. You need to push for approvals and sell the idea to them. Culture is really different. On the issue of passive-aggressiveness. I might be wrong on this one but have you spoken to your boss lately? Have you communicated your concerns? One possible reason that it looks like passive-agressiveness is that you don’t speak enough with your boss.In startups, speed is usually name of the game. In corporate, you can only do so much until your boss approves it. Lastly, communicate always your work. It’s important that you become visible to your boss and he’s aware about what you do. If everything still fails, even if have communicated everything, then it might be the time to loom for another company, specially if it affects your mental health.",

It also sounds like the last person probably did pick up everything and anything (probably why they left) and now it is being paid forward to you. Just because one team is like this doesn't mean that all are. Even in the same business things can be different. It sounds more like a leadership issue than a you issue.

Multiple sentences and once you’re done are you sure you described it correctly and the other person understands? The jargon removes ambiguity from the communication and speeds up the process.For example if I could say **”Define a function that takes a function as an argument and/or returns a functions”** or just say **”write a higher order function”****”Define a function that has a nested function that has access to variables in its enclosing scope”** or I can say **”use a closure”**Both of those alternatives are much more precise and succinct.Edit: I’m not saying don’t look stuff up. i am saying try to learn the jargon you can to be able to communicate precisely.",

With flat pricing you do not pay for each query.If you're willing to self-host, then ClickHouse is excellent and may be a cheaper alternative. You can store all of the data in GCS or S3, saving a fair amount of money depending on the amount needed to transfer. (ClickHouse Cloud, which is also great, charges a bit more for storage then BigQuery, but may come out as cheaper than BQ depending on your use case — you need to do the math here.)40GB/day streaming is something you can do with a single, low-spec ClickHouse server without needing any clustering.

Data lakes and lakehousea are fine but also come with the small files problem. Also not mentioned here, how are you doing analytics. If you are reading 25tib of data and the end user can tolerate a lag in updates, maybe an analytics tool with its own datastore can cut costs. Other than that, others mentioned looking for partitions, you mentioned a lake house, limiting columns in the select is a good idea, anything to avoid full table scans. It might be a good idea to look at table size, analytics needs, and the number of bytes read v. number of bytes used in your worst queries. Set alarms for slot usage, query length, and bytes used too. If they trigger often and are well written, look at the queries and processes triggering the alarm.",

For the bigger ones use editions/slots/capacity pricing or whatever they call paying for a vCPU. Split these into different GCP projects with distinct pricing options (one for slots, one for on demand)- don’t reinvent the wheel with custom queries for monitoring usage and hacky dashboards for costs but use something like mastheaddata.com to get insight per consumer (e.g. Looked, Fivetran, dbt) and pricing optimizations per query.",

Do this in multiple phases, first clear strings of punctuation, trim white spare and set a uniform case (e.g lower case - you can fix this at the end with a lookup back to your table). Secondly, You need to use your official degree dataset in place of big text.txt but you should follow this approach: https://norvig.com/spell-correct.html, if R is more your flavour: https://www.sumsar.net/blog/2014/12/peter-norvigs-spell-checker-in-two-lines-of-r/. Keep in mind you may need to split each word in to its own line, keeping track of the original string it came from with an id, then join it back up so the spelling corrector is applied on each word. You can also split each word in the degree in your master table out so you can keep joining based on relevant columns. Hope this helps",

SQL UDFs handle simple regex, date math, and lookups while staying transparent for the next engineer. When the logic involves third-party libraries or complex branching, reach for a sandboxed Python or JS UDF but lock the environment to a frozen requirements file so you can reproduce results months later. For CPU-bound crunching-tokenization, matrix algebra, image hashes-compile to WASM and call it from the warehouse; it’s faster than spinning up Spark just for one function and sidesteps Python’s GIL. External UDF servers shine when you already have a service in production, e.g., calling a fraud score API, but watch network latency and cache aggressively. I’ve used BigQuery remote functions and Snowflake external functions for these patterns; DreamFactory handled the auto-generated REST layer when we needed to expose those services without hand-rolling APIs. Resist jumping to exotic stacks until SQL or basic UDFs truly break down.",

A good observability tool can help establish a baseline and notify you if something changes. \\- Some data sources have fairly irregular schedules, with frequent ingest during work hours, batch updates during the night, and no updates during weekends and holidays. You often end up with very loose freshness tests because you can't combine freshness with a cron.The setup can be as simple or as difficult as you want. In the simple case, just create a service user for the SaaS and watch the dashboard populate. In the advanced case, you can spend months writing custom yaml tests in MonteCarlo, integrating Airflow webhooks, etc.The crux with the more advanced tools that actually use ML is that they notify you of anomalies over slack, and they then expect you to tell them if this is an actual anomaly. When you set it up it just observes for a week or two, assuming that whatever you see during this period is normal. After this, you will probably start receiving a lot of notifications of possible anomalies. If your team is able to check with some domain expert, you can give the underlying ML model good input and over a few weeks there will be way fewer false positives.If you don't have access to someone who can tell you if an anomaly is an error or not, these tools will be very annoying. If you do, you probably also have a good shot at writing meaningful dbt tests.The more simple tools are more annoying. The anomaly detection is often a simple Z-statistic, so there is little chance of reducing false positives (other than accumulating more history). On the plus side, the simple tools are often open source or open core.Lastly, a few questions to keep in mind: \\- What types of failures are you looking for? Is it silent failures in the data ingest pipeline you created? Is it upstream changes to data structures, odd content etc that might stem from an error in a different system? \\- What do you want from it? Is it for the DE team to check possible errors in their own system? Is it to notify users of possible issues? \\- What is your tolerance level for false positives? \\- How much effort is it to check out a possible anomaly?None of these projects ended up seeing the observability tool as an indispensable tool. From what I can remember, there was one or two cases where the tool caught an issue before anyone else. But they are expensive, and there are mostly false positives.",

We've been running data observability tools at iDataMaze for about 18 months now, started with Monte Carlo then switched to a custom solution built on top of Great Expectations.Honestly the biggest value isn't catching data quality issues dbt tests handle most of that fine. It's the lineage tracking and impact analysis when something does break. When a client dataset gets corrupted upstream, we can immediately see which reports and dashboards are affected without having to manually trace through everything. The setup was painful tho, took way longer than expected to get all the integrations working properly. And yeah there's definitely some dashboard fatigue we had to be really selective about which alerts actually matter vs just noise. What pushed us to stick with it was scaling issues. When you have multiple teams pulling from the same datasets and everyone's building their own stuff on top, traditional testing just doesn't give you the visibility you need. The blast radius of a single bad dataset can be huge. One thing I wish these tools did better is understanding business context. They're great at telling you \"this column has more nulls than usual\" but terrible at knowing whether that actually matters for your specific use case. For what it's worth, most of our enterprise clients are still hesitant about full automation. They want the monitoring but still prefer human validation before any auto-remediation kicks in.

Then it might actually be good!Of course it can be done in different ways, for example using dbt to call stored procedures strikes me as a bit odd, as -in my experience- dbt takes care of many things that you could otherwise use stored procedures for. But of course, you might have your reasons. Also, dbt only had community supporter SQL Server connectors, which can be fine, but if the community stops supporting it, you might fall behind on versions quickly (this happened for a while around the second half of 2023). Nothing of immediate concern, but something you may want to keep in mind.A while ago I had similar requirements but used Dagster on a VM for orchestration and hosting dbt (also storing data in blob storage), so I avoided Azure Data Factory and Azure Functions. I don't think this is a better or worse approach, but it's an alternative to reach a similar goal. I'm curious what people would recommend instead, but keep in mind my first sentences: if it's working, secure and cost acceptable, it's not shit.",

        "body": "Your architecture has a solid foundation, leveraging Azure's capabilities effectively. Using Azure Functions to handle different API endpoints is beneficial for scalability, while Azure Blob Storage serves as a flexible intermediary. However, consider integrating Azure Data Lake for more efficient data storage and retrieval, especially if data volume grows. Using dbt to manage transformations is great, as it provides modularity and enhanced version control, but ensure proper testing and documentation of SQL procedures to avoid potential pitfalls. Automating more aspects of your pipeline, like error handling and monitoring through Azure Monitor, could also improve robustness.Your pipeline design appears efficient, but here are some areas for improvement. Directly loading JSON into staging tables is fine, but you might want to explore the use of [Delta Lake](https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/how-to-create-delta-live-tables-in-azure-databricks?utm_source=pawan&utm_medium=reddit) for its ACID transactional integrity and improved efficiency in handling large datasets. Additionally, you can enhance the scalability of your Azure Functions by moving them to Azure Kubernetes Service if your function apps face heavy workloads. Incorporating better data validation mechanisms before data transformation can save time troubleshooting downstream inaccuracies. Finally, enhancing your logging and monitoring setup, possibly integrating [Azure Log Analytics](https://www.projectpro.io/project-use-case/building-data-pipelines-with-azure-synapse-analytics?utm_source=pawan&utm_medium=reddit), will provide better insights and faster response times to issues that may arise.",

(Open a support ticket if not)Lately I've been unfortunate enough to work with Fabric notebooks on spark pools and they have a totally unrelated concept which is called \"high concurrency\" mode. Be careful while googling!!The reason high concurrency mode was important in databricks -at the time- was because the \"interactive\" clusters sent the driver of all jobs thru a dedicated driver node and it doesn't scale well when lots of jobs are running at the same time. My recollection was that there was deliberate synchronization performed, for the benefit of interactive scenarios involving human operators. In high concurrency mode they remove that self-inflicted performance bottleneck.",

Your instinct about Postgres being easier on the dev side is spot on the SQL compatibility makes the migration much smoother.But honestly, with 87TB of highly relational data and that schema structure you described, I'd lean towards Postgres here. few reasons: The relational nature of your order management system is gonna fight you every step of the way with Mongo. Sure, sharding comes easier but you'll end up with a mess trying to handle all those one-to-many relationships across collections. Plus your devs will hate life trying to rewrite all that logic.For active-active with Postgres, yeah its more work upfront but:\\- Citus handles the sharding pretty well for this scale\\- pglogical or BDR can handle the multi-master stuff \\- Your existing queries won't need major rewritesThe 15M users across US east/west is definitely doable with either but given your schema complexity I think you'll save months of dev time sticking with relational.One thing to watch out for tho - active-active with financial transaction data gets tricky with conflict resolution. Make sure you have a solid strategy for handling concurrent updates to the same order records across regions.What's your timeline looking like for this migration? That might influence which route makes more sense from a project management perspective Also curious about your read/write patterns are customers mostly reading their order history or do you have heavy write loads during peak ordering times?",

        "body": "Upfront disclosure - I work at MongoDB. But I’ll fully upvote every comment that says you’ll have to redevelop most backend code to use MongoDB. Fact! On the other hand - an Order Management use case is perfectly suited to the MongoDB document model. Your data is not highly relational; it is highly structured. A customer places orders, and orders contain items. That can be entirely achieved in a single collection with nested fields in MongoDB. The performance will be superior. There is rarely a need for transactions in MongoDB - use a flexible document to capture the reads atomically, and if you need to update other collections that contain values use change streams. Jumping across 87TB in relational tables is inherently less efficient. Going further, if you use MongoDB Atlas, I’d expect you can use the built in archive for a majority of the customer data (orders >6 months go to archive?), adding minimal latency degradation (+1-2s? Vs sub 100ms for hot data) and massive savings, with no added code. That could half the size of your cluster and costs. But at worst, for the near hundred TB of data, you are looking at a 25 shard cluster which would be active-active and could accept east/west geo-specific writesGoing even further, how does your order management support search? Atlas will provide you order search capability within the same cluster or with dedicated search nodes. And vector search. And all of this is Highly Available starting with 4 9s of uptime with options to increase to 5 9s. So if your C-Suite is weighing in with technical requirement (active-active) - my suggestion is ask them what the business requirement is - uptime, latency - and steer them back towards doing their jobs and letting you do yours ;). And ask them what value lucene search would provide to users? And then returning to the reason for you not to use MongoDB Atlas - you will have to refactor more code. But we do offer purpose built genAI refactoring solutions to help customers achieve this. DM me or check our website. End Users can even Experiment with “Relational Migrator” but you’ll need custom or some of our internal tooling to migrate 87 TB. Good luck!",

If you are just using it for analysis and some lag is acceptable then most columnar databases have geospatial functions built in (snowflake, dbx, etc) and are as performant as the horsepower you throw at it. For heavier processing that takes many hours/days typically you might look at Apache Sedona, a spark fork designed for geospatial processing. Based on your example though it sounds like you could probably get away with parquet files or some cheap cloud columnar DB implementation.We do similar stuff at the billions of rows scale (no geocoding though), with spatial indexing and location points on Snowflake.

Leave the technology selection and named individuals etc for project/programme world. Each strategy will be different due to the current context helping you to identify the goals you want to go for. The last one I wrote just a few months back targeted a change in operating model. Mainly due to a lot of pain points coming from heavy IT, engineering led decisions and a complete lack of governance. There's plenty of bad examples out there but the MOD and NASA strategies are ideal I've linked to a few below with elements I rate as being good. They focus on principles and goals. The strategies which focus on \"we need to move to databricks\" or \"data governance process will look like this\" is not a strategy. Once the context, vision, goals and objectives are in place you simply lay out a roadmap for the next X years and this is then used to kick off the initiatives in the business to deliver on the strategy. Again, this is why it's a strategy and why it leads you simply in a direction to fix where you are.The people hired, the architecture patterns, the solutions chosen and tech changes all use the strategy vision, principles and goals to keep aligned. You can not allow the strategy to dictate the low level answer.

What's going to happen next?4. What do we do about it?Luckily, those things build on each other and can help you prioritize your work. For example, first standing up simple reporting and over time growing that into predictions and recommendations. That last part is where a data team really shows its value.You can extend, or alternatively, start this thinking by considering who your data team's end users or customers are now and, just as important, who they'll be in the future. These are usually:1. Business users: The folks looking at dashboards.2. Analysts: The folks diving into the data to answer novel questions.3. Reverse ELT: Platforms you send enriched data back to, often marketing.4. Data Science: Perhaps to answer questions 2 and 3 above, or to power your application.5. Application: Your application itself. Are you responsible for master data concepts like a single representation of a user that needs to be fed back to your platform?Once you have a sense for these things you can then think about the technical requirements that answering those four questions and serving those five customers might entail. Often, these can be grouped into two big questions (the ones we're always asking first in this sub):1. What is the volume of the data?2. What are the latency requirements for my uses?For example, making a dashboard for business users to see what happened usually doesn't require data more timely than a day. That's why so many organizations start with simple batch ELT jobs. From here, you can begin to build into the other use cases and customer needs. But, on the other hand, maybe you know that you're immediately going to be tasked with some application or data science need. Being aware of that could help you get in front of that problem and start with a more robust, lower-latency solution like streaming or microbatches from the beginning.If, like many data teams, your first responsibility is to get the business users and analysts the data they need to understand what is happening to the business, I find [Metric Trees](https://www.datacouncil.ai/talks/designing-and-building-metric-trees) to be the most useful way to think about this. You can use this framework to anticipate the data you'll need to surface and to inform your understanding of how to organize it so that all the data relevant to a particular domain or user responsible for that data is co-located for their use.In the end, it all comes down to your unique needs, but those various points are some of the things I consider when building out a vision for what the data team should be building, how they should build it, and when.",

You might be nailing the coding challenges but struggling with system design discussions or not articulating your thought process in a way that shows senior-level thinking. The gap since March isn't helping, but it's not insurmountable if you can identify what's happening in those final interviews.The good news is that reaching final rounds repeatedly means you're close, not failing. Companies are investing significant time in you, which signals genuine interest. Try getting feedback from those rejections, even if it's just a brief call with the recruiter.

From march ain't too long, especially in this hard time, and you've made it to the final 3 times which means you were really close. But yeah mentally its indeed very devastating falling out when you're that far into the process. Other than just trying to keep getting better, all I can say is stick in there and dont give up, you're definitely not alone. The market is tougher every where.",

I'd consider applying for quite junior roles, graduate roles, and setting the expectation that you're coming in at a junior level but expect to move up a grade quickly given your past experience.All that said, it's hard to know what to recommend in the interview itself behind generic interview advice. Maybe you could ask for feedback from the interviews that haven't proceeded; you might get some nuggets of info.",

In my case I could see shorter lengths in the plan, but YMMV.Queries with string functions or expressions often punt on calculating the output length, using a multiple of the input size as a default, so the over-allocation gets even worse if you don't fix the base column.",

In one of my projects, we have defined and modeled the data efficiently. Such that for varchar columns, we have setup a column length if a column is varchar or if it’s a number, etc… This made development and data validation easier. In your case, you can go with the macro approach.Additonal approach is you can add a logic to the macro and will check if what is the average column lengths on all tables and have some margin, say 10%. Or… create a macro with 3 levels of lengths like short, medium, long. Each have equivalent lengths. What I could suggest, before doing any dev work, do some data profiling.In my previous project, we always do data profiling on the sources to check different metadata. One of those is the max length of columns of the source table. From there we set the desired length.",

The reason why is that Redshift allocated the max length of a VARCHAR in memory, uncompressed. This wasn’t a huge problem if the table was not joined, but it became a really big deal when trying to run joins and if there was redistribution across all nodes. They would totally gum up speed transferring data across the network, and you really felt it when you were handling millions of rows.It’s possible Amazon fixed this, but I doubt it. When I was there the most senior eng on that team did not understand why CTE’s at times took longer than temp tables.You should test this yourself with runtimes (turn off caching before doing so).",

You can pick optimization and DB internals along the road -- you don't get to read the source code of modern DWH plus you probably won't be able to read them anyway, and most of the optimization guides are just a few web pages so you only need to memorize and understand those. And since you are just ingesting data into DWH, most likely you don't need to write raw ingestion code -- and even if you do, it is going to be way smaller scale than Netflix.Basically the task falls into two parts:\\- Gathering requirements from stakeholders and make sure you clarify every question before moving into implementation stage. It's difficult and sometimes impossible, depending on the quality of the stakeholders, most of whom don't know what they want anyway.\\- Put up tests, alerts and monitoring into each pipeline.That's pretty much it. Apparently the people part is way more important and difficult than the technical part. It's essentially sort of BI analyst job.Oh and good luck on Fabric.",

You can write a little powershell script to run the CLI command to launch the server and UI, then setup that little powershell script as a Windows Service. See the old Non-Sucking Service Manager (NSSM) to do it easily, NSSM is open source and still used to this day on Windows stuff.We ended up using Prefect Cloud’s free version though since self-hosted was missing auth and we didn’t want to expose our instance to the internet, but heads up they recently changed pricing and now I think you need the Starter plan to do that? Could be wrong so double check me.They - like do many other companies - don’t seem to care much about Windows shops, no one ever does. Their docs didn’t have any of this in it whatsoever, all they mentioned was setting up a Linux daemon. Literally none of these companies ever care about Windows users.That was the best option I found.By the way, I’m a bootstrapped startup founder and love orchestrators, I’m deeply passionate about them, and I’m actually writing my own C# job orchestrator for dotnet. :relieved_face: check out [Didact](https://www.didact.dev) if you happen to use C#, releasing very soon.",

I work with spark, but don't really leverage its distributed power, so there are probably other people better suited to answer the question for you, but that's just my take.Also in general I would recommend getting your fundamental understandings of anything you do down first, rather than specializing on a specific technology especially if you're early on in your journey. If you limit yourself to one technology, you limit the positions you can potentially be hired to do. Also if you're really early on in your learning, you don't really have the perspective to know what makes a technology good or easy to use or not and your opinions on it might change once you see how you work with it in real world scenarios vs classroom/tutorial/personal project scenarios.",

While big data tools code base need more performant compiled languages, historically Java for Hadoop (and still for recent tools like Trino), but also Scala (Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Apache Flink), and more recently, C++ (Databricks' Photon, Apache Arrow, DuckDB) or Rust (Apache DataFusion, Sail).If what you are interested in is high performance coding, then I guess the second job is what you'd prefer. Although my experience is in the first one, I think there are way more jobs in the tool user category than in the toolmaker category. But making those tools probably require quite advanced knowledge of performance, so you may succeed with specialization. This community is about DE, so you will get most of your answers from data engineers.What is your level of education, are you graduated in CS or already an experienced coder?For distributed system engineering, if you are into theory, I think a good starting point are the scientific articles that described the concepts behind the tools when they were still cutting edge research inside the laboratories. For example, those are articles from Google that served as a foundation for building Hadoop at Yahoo:- \"MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters\" - Jeffrey Dean, Sanjay Ghemawat, Google, 2004- \"The Google File System\" - Sanjay Ghemawat, Howard Gobioff, Shun-Tak Leung, Google, 2003- \"Bigtable: A Distributed Storage System for Structured Data\" - Fay Chang, Jeffrey Dean, Sanjay Ghemawat, Wilson C. Hsieh, Deborah A. Wallach, Google, 2006There are likely more recent articles in the same vein.If you want to develop those tools, I would probably study the active open-source tools like Apache Spark, Trino, Apache DataFusion, DuckDB and Sail to understand the general designs and the hard problems. Then study the foundations of those problems, try to solve issues and submit PRs as training, and eventually try to get a job at those organizations.",

        "body": "There's not really a one-size-fits-all answer because everyone's path is a little different. The most general answer I could give is that people get into the field they want to because they become the best applicant for the role they're applying for. For some people it's easier than others, like if you're going to a top-tier university and are top of your class, you can have for the most part pick of the litter for what roles are available to you.You can become the best applicant in other ways though, it might be you have very relevant personal projects to the work, or you can demonstrate you're passionate about the field/industry, you might dominate DSA problems, or you might just have really great soft skills or some combination of all.My path isn't very common at all, I was a college dropout, but I did go to a top 10 school (so I had big student loans) and did well in my program, but wasn't super passionate about school as a whole, I was the only person invited to join the honors program based on programming ability alone in my class (others were admitted into it based on their high school academic performance/application to the university) only really sharing this so you know what type of student I was, since I think you'll see so much of everyone's path is determined by some combination of their natural ability and their work ethic, I was more of the natural ability type, my work ethic sucked. I was very passionate about programming though and had held a job doing webdev since high school, so I had 3 paid internships with a F500 during college as well as part time work as a transcriptionist. After dropping out of college, I dealt with a bit of depression related to a death in the family, and the reality of having to pay for my impending student loans, but after 6 months of that, I got a job working in a call center doing tech support for a big consumer electronics company. I saw inefficiencies in the way they were doing things, and I used the tools available to me at the time (sharepoint and webdev skills) to build things to fix those problems, and eventually I got pulled off of the phones to do that work more and more because my managers basically got a rogue development resources meaning they could prioritize things that made their department run better.Eventually I got noticed by the data + reporting team at that company and they made a position for me where I started working with SQL and .NET and learned to build ETL processes. I had learned Database fundamentals at university, and had worked with them a bit as far as standing up websites from scratch went, so I was confident I could do it. And after 10 years there I got laid off, and moved to a nonprofit where I was hired to do SQL and Salesforce stuff, and now they've moved to Databricks, which is where I started doing python and spark.My path was partially my own making but also partially luck, I did know that I always wanted to prioritize brand recognition of the company I was working for over other factors when applying for jobs, but you can see because of my setback of not having a degree, my path diverged a bit from the \"standard\" path. I also wasn't really particular about what type of job I took, because I know I enjoy programming regardless of the form it took, so I took the opportunities in front of me. At the end of the day, the worse you are relative to your competition, the lower your standards need to be as far as what opportunities you take. One thing great about programming is even if you aren't completely fulfilled with the type of programming you do at work, nothing is stopping you from doing the type of programming you want to do at home on your own personal projects and it's even encouraged, because sometimes you will get into roles where you are stuck on outdated technology, and your only way to advance is to learn something new on your own.Enough babbling about me, ultimately if you really feel passionate about it, just learn to do it. Where I would recommend starting with data engineering is [this zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp). There's a link on that git to [their youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb) so you can go through it at your own pace. It will walk you through environment setup so you can actually run things locally and I think has very applicable real world scenarios that it walks through rather than small programs related to web/app dev that you mention you're not a fan of.My caution to you though is that there's no guarantee even if you know the technology like the back of your hand that you can convince a company to hire you for it without any real experience, so you may want to prepare yourself for a different entry point. Like I think taking a data analyst position is a more realistic entry level position that sets you up for data engineering.Hope this helps.",

However, it would be useful just to have point in time statistics on something at least for debugging. I feel like we have a large blind spot on even just table counts let alone column level stats. When something goes wrong, it's challenging right now to even answer what this table looked like yesterday. I'm thinking right now of an observer service and an anomaly service at least and have it extensible for different source types (Snowflake, S3) and table types (raw source, transformed source, transformed model). Checks happen on a cron-friendly cadence but at least once a day. Maybe even configurable indepdently by source, path, table or check type. Is it opt-in or opt-out?Would love to hear more about how you are thinking about it! I'm just starting to formulate my thoughts about it. And before any vendors come at me, don't bother, you're barking up the wrong tree :).Edit: I should amend this to say that we have a LOT of dbt tests and we are very good about defining a unique key and testing on it (not null and unique) so we generally know about fan-out problems but I'm more thinking the silent failures. Something is null all of sudden or data volume drops off a cliff or there is a significant skew in the most frequent values in recent data, amounts skyrocketing due to math errors, etc. Logic has changed somewhere so how can you be very certain that the downstreams aren't silently negatively affected.",

Based on [this explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/6wilmr/comment/dm8blj7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), I then got detoured into the researching pedantic questions like whether Java byte code is at the same level of abstraction as assembler (answer=yes, though its binary form is more comparable to machine code in that it doesn't use text mnemonic labels and the instruction set is for a virtual processor) [1].Google AI says that an app that is deployed as a docker image \"doesn't have direct access to the host OS's files, processes, or network configurations in the same way a natively installed application would.\" The ambiguity here is \"in the same way\", which pretty well makes the statement impossible to decipher. I hope that it allows access to `c:\\users\\My.Name\\MyProject\\MyScript.py` or `c:\\cygwin64\\home\\My.Name\\MyProject\\MyScript.py`?In any case, even though it took years, I now *can* access Anaconda at work, so the availability of PySpark provides much needed relief from the setting up of PySpark outside of Anaconda and integrating the two.**Notes****[1]** I also found it informative that *microcode* is at the level of abstraction of sequential state machines for digital circuits, according to Google AI.",

This would've saved you hours and can possibly save you hours in the future. The answer is yes, ofcourse you can add scripts, files and networking (it narively passes your own connection, so you can download packages within the container, but you simply copy files into the container). The whole point is that you can run your entire application inside of a container without the overhead of an entire VM, but with the flexibility of everyone 'using the same os'.For pyspark is also just skips the JAVA and SPARK environment variables because those are just already setup for you.If you ever need to host your applications using something like docker is highly advised anyways. There shouldn't be a barrier to installing docker. It's one of the essential applications in any orginization where code and hosting plays any role. And (almost) completely bypasses the 'it works on my computer' syndrome.",

When deploying to our integration environment, in addition to the docs output I mentioned above, we use pipeline tasks to upload our manifest.json and download it before the run so we can use state:modified. We don’t use —defer yet, but I think we will in our new (non-Synapse) environment.

Treat your warehouse as a feature store for documents: break sources into small, well-tagged passages, snapshot them, and pump the embeddings plus raw text into something like PGVector or Pinecone so RAG stays deterministic. Build lineage on the chunk level, then wire row-level roles into the retrieval layer; that’s way easier than hoping users classify PII correctly before pasting it into ChatGPT. Automate redaction inside the pipeline-simple regex masks won’t cut it, lean on entity detection like Presidio. Observability matters more now because any silent refresh lag will surface as hallucination, so monitor vector drift the same way you watch table freshness. I tried Airbyte for bulk pulls and LangChain for orchestration, but DreamFactory gave me the instant REST endpoint over our on-prem SQL that let the agents pull just what they need without exposing the whole database. GenAI data work is really retrieval, governance, and tight feedback loops.",

I agree, especially we don't really need structured database to power LLM - basically we can just throw unstructured data, create embeddings, RAG it and let LLM deal with it, or use the data for fine-tuning. 2. This all the more reasons companies will want to move to create their own chatbots with internal knowledge and localized models, and force employees to use it for work, and maybe the task of data engineer will be to update the RAGs and the models behind it once in a while. I think by allowing even access to external LLMs like ChatGPT somebody will bound to throw PIIs to these tools sooner or later.",

I still optimize, debug, and add logic myself where it is off. You have to be very specific and say almost exactly what to do, even for a model like claude 4. The job feels more grounded in logic, documentation, and promoting vector search tools and observability for our analysts. Reading docs seems to be a chore. I recently told an analyst to stick my documentation and schemas into claude as well. It claims to have no need for a RAG database when fed good context. As for other tasks, llms can create boilerplate. I usually have to find the random bug and perform validation checks. For some reason, setting an integer to 0 is an optimization, lol. There is more focus on logic, cleanliness, readability, searchability, and quality for sure. Less on the boilerplate. If you dont use a tool like dbt, use it. It is a context generator.",

You are going to lean heavy on processes to ensure the team managing the platform (e.g. RevOps for the CRM case) maintains schema.Coming from an API that you have no control over? Not much you can do except pause the impacted data and make the necessary refactors.Coming from the upstream application platform?

If MSSQL hiccups for some reason, Databricks jobs will fail* You’re paying for Databricks to sit and wait on network calls. Even with pushdown, you're still bound by MSSQL perf and network I/O.* No lineage, no retries, no observability.

A filtered read on an indexed datetime column (\\~1 M rows, 5 GB compressed) finishes in 90‒120 s and costs about $0.40 in warehouse compute plus cross-AZ egress; the same job through Airflow + S3 copy lands in 6-7 m but is five cents cheaper. The real hit comes when five analysts launch the query at once-MSSQL tempdb balloons and the firewall team screams, so set WORKLOAD GOVERNOR or spin up a read replica. Cache the result in Delta and keep a water-mark table so you only federate deltas. If latency isn’t critical, batch every hour and vacuum old snapshots. We tried Fivetran for CDC and dbt-exposures for lineage, but DreamFactory ended up being the quick way to surface the delta API without more Python. Federation shines for small, well-indexed slices; anything bigger still deserves a proper load path.",

Not only that, RAM cache is also very critical for performance, and hash tables are nearly always inferior to simple arrays when it comes to hitting cache. For performance there is also the idea of branching - in simple terms: whether or not the CPU can guess correctly if an if-statement will be true or false. Due to that you want as little if-statements as possible in performance critical areas, and i think all practical implementations of hash-tables have if-statements.2. Hash tables usually dont have order. If i want sorted data and often return the smallest/biggest member or a rank related to size, Hash tables are useless. Even simple strings have meaning to their order. EDIT: i dont think you can actually achieve order in hash-tables without a complementary list/array.3. You may need/want to use stack memory instead of heap memory and hash tables are hard and inefficient to implement using only stack memory.4. hash-tables pre-allocate chunks of memory before its ever used. if you want to save on memory you may want a different ADT.With that being said, when you mostly care about average case big O notations, hash-tables are pretty amazing. This is why they are often used in leet-code questions.",

I bit of a big hunk with my current project, and some obstacles have taken me a week or more to figure out, but, programming is solving problems, and that's what I love about it. You can dm me if you have questions, and I'll try to answer them for you.",

It's puzzle solving on steroids, and constant learning.My only caution would be to watch out for the current tech hype cycle, which right now is for AI stuff. Learning the fundamentals of programming and CS instead is a great starting point if you aren't only in it for AI.",

Walk into any bookstore, and you'll see how to Teach Yourself Java in 24 Hours alongside endless variations offering to teach C, SQL, Ruby, Algorithms, and so on in a few days or hours. > The conclusion is that either people are in a big rush to learn about programming, **or that programming is somehow fabulously easier to learn than anything else.**> Felleisen et al. give a nod to this trend in their book How to Design Programs, when they say \"Bad programming is easy. *Idiots* can learn it in 21 days, even if they are *dummies*.\"> Researchers (Bloom (1985), Bryan & Harter (1899), Hayes (1989), Simmon & Chase (1973)) have shown it takes about **ten years** to develop expertise in any of a wide variety of areas, including chess playing, music composition, telegraph operation, painting, piano playing, swimming, tennis, and research in neuropsychology and topology. The key is deliberative practice: not just doing it again and again, but challenging yourself with a task that is just beyond your current ability, trying it, analyzing your performance while and after doing it, and correcting any mistakes. Then repeat. And repeat again. There appear to be no real shortcuts.It's a marathon, not a sprint. As long as you're learning, you're achieving something. Keep going.",

To be fair, I've never applied to a job that was for, say, a React developer.The ones I've been that did coding were on paper or on a whiteboard. I believe the reason they did this was because using a computer with a specific IDE would favor someone that used that IDE or someone that uses an IDE over someone that just uses Notepad++ to code that only does syntax highlighting.It would be unfair to have interview someone where Netbeans was the IDE (since it's not that popular) or maybe IntelliJ (popular, but it costs money so some companies won't pay for it). And nowadays, there's AIs helping out.It is a mistake to think great coders code everything from scratch. If you use, say, Flutter, you're already not coding \"from scratch\". Someone built a web framework so you wouldn't have to code things from scratch. Also, frameworks have a lot of moving parts, so it's hard to recall it all.This is why you see leetcode problems because they require minimal knowledge of libraries and frameworks and mostly rely on DSA knowledge.It will depend on the interview. When I had one and asked if I could just use pseudocode, they kind of implied no.

It would seem a shame to skip over such an informative and succinct convention and I think it would make a lot of the response handling more convolouted. It's an interesting question but I'm struggling to think of a scenario where returning 200 for an error is good practice, though as you've said these APIs do exist!",

You could decide not to of course, but then your API is not RESTful but instead simply an API communicating via HTTP.There are some HTTP communication protocols, like GraphQL, that (almost) always return a 200 response and the error in the body. Unless you are specifically using one of these protocols I would use the correct HTTP verbs wherever possible. Conforming to industry standards just makes everything easier. For example, many JS network libs (like Axios) understand that a HTTP status code of 400 is an error response and will throw an error on the client. This makes error handling client side a lot easier, as you can implement try/catch blocks.",

        "body": "I am of the camp that outside the most common status codes, no, you should not use most of the status codes that exist, because most of them have niche semantics that won't be applicable to you or are used in specific subprotocols that ride on top of HTTP like WebDAV, or HTTP extensions. Perhaps a 200 for an error is not OK, but I would prefer an API with consistent error responses to one that abuses 20 different HTTP statuses all slightly incorrectly. Same thing with HTTP verbs.Most HTTP status codes are designed to describe outcomes related to the transport itself rather than the business logic that is behind it, and as such, HTTP status codes should be used to describe issues that occur prior to any form of processing or side effect and past that you should fall back to a very small subset of statuses to describe the outcome. That is what a body is for.. The problem with this tends to be when people have to shoehorn complex behaviour into a single endpoint due to reasons outside their control, and they start abusing other HTTP status codes (especially WebDAV codes) to try and communicate their intent for things like partial success, or precondition failure, or side effects. They then do not realise half the HTTP status codes have strict and specific semantics about things like headers that should be included with them, and they break the rules of the spec by using them, which is far worse than just not using them at all. HTTP was not originally designed for requesting that Amazon sends you a new bag of cat food, it was designed for asking Amazon to show you a webpage about cat food.There is then confusion on what describes a client versus a server error. Does a 400 purely specify that a request looks okay, or does it imply that the actual data it represents is meaningful in terms of the current system state and data that is stored? Do you expect a server to start processing your request prior to giving a 400 back? Does bad request purely describe the request itself or the implication of that request? Do you consider a 500 to mean something went wrong during processing or just that your server is fucked? Once you get into the rabbithole of trying to work out exactly when each code is valid, you realise the system you are integrating with made a totally different decision on how to organise this and interpret it differently.The other issue is that some HTTP libraries made the somewhat braindead decision to throw exceptions when you get certain status codes, and this then makes integration more difficult. Really what you are often communicating is semantically tied to your own system, and if that is the case, using the body to communicate that rather than the status code can be more sensible.Even from a monitoring perspective, anything significant will be relying on application metrics rather than metrics from load balancers to determine system health. Load balancer metrics for status codes just give a rough idea of how much stuff is working versus not working.TLDR: 400, 401, 403, 404, 2xx, 500, 503 are OK. Use those as you will. Anything more complicated that is related to business logic should just be in a 200 or 500 and detail the issue in the body. Abusing other codes like 422, 423, 507 just because they \"sound like\" what you want is far worse than just using vague codes. If you are giving me a 479 Shits Fucked Yo designed to be used with WebFTP v2.718281828459045 from 1943, or a 486 Its Tuesday that Twitter used once, then I have a problem. Using 200 for errors might be controversial but if it is easier to do that and provide consistent responses in the body across your systems, then go for it. Whether you are checking a status code inside or outside a body, most programming languages use the same constructs to inspect it. If using a 3 digit number at the start of a response is what people think defines usability, then they are just gatekeeping unless there is an actual technical requirement for it.",

I found a lot of my spiraling was due to being overwhelmed \\- Optimize feedback loops. Fastest way to kill my productivity is needing to wait 5 mins to see if a fix worked. Test-driven development is nice. Fast builds are nice \\- Struggling with a problem? Write about it, pen & paper. Doodle if you want. Rant if you want. I personally find it more effective than rubber ducking \\- Silent timers: you may have heard of pomodoro timing, but I didn't mesh well with being interrupted right as I was in the flow. I do something pomodoro-like but keep the timers muted, and just switch when my focus is drifting and I notice my time is up \\- I found taskwarrior (CLI) meshes really well with my brain as a task tracker \\- Jumpstart guides: for larger projects that have some setup, I found it takes a lot of effort to get started making changes. I wrote a four-step \"jumpstarter\" for one of my projects that carefully walks through making a trivial hello-world-style change to one of the classes, building/deploying the project, and seeing the change on a UI. Takes like 30 seconds, but somehow, doing that helps get me in the headspace to start doing actual developmentYou mention a lot about reading unfamiliar code: unfortunately, this is more-or-less a practice game. Some more tricks that work for me in no particular order:\\- Above all else, make sure the code can run. Trying to do any development on code that doesn't run is a death sentence \\- Commit archaeology -- whole codebase is hard to read? Try git blaming some stuff you're interested in and just understanding one well-documented commit or PR \\- Documenting things -- there's probably missing comments that are making things tricky, may as well make it easier for the next guy. Having docs for a function's dependencies makes it easier to read that function since you can now understand what it does without needing to ctrl+click into another context \\- Debuggers are good, learn to use them \\- Tests are good, learn to write them -- this is the core thesis of \"working effectively with legacy code\" \\- Learn editor navigation shortcuts: be able to quickly navigate to that one class that you know the name of, to jump into and back out of specific functions, etcOverall, I'm fond to say \"productivity is an engineering problem.\" It's not the type of thing where you just find The Solution and you're good to go. Any engineering problem worth talking about has competing solutions with tradeoffs that require a process of designing, implementing, testing, and revision. Try to find specific things that are killing your productivity (the 5 Whys technique is good) and hack at it like any other complex problem.",

I’m not concerned with being right, I’m concerned with training my brain to think. Some of my best learning came from allowing myself to do it my way all the way, even if it turned out to be dead wrong, because that teaches me exactly why things are done the way they are. I then take my solution back to the LLM and ask it to give constructive criticism. You can also get problems from a book or a website, it doesn’t have to be an LLM, but I like the instant feedback.Additionally, in my notes, along with having definitions for things I’m learning, I also have a questions section. The goal isn’t to answer the question immediately, the goal is to track with honesty what I actually know vs. what I need to work on. For example, if I keep asking the same question 5 times across different problems, that’s an area I don’t truly understand.Bonus: LLMs are really good at pattern recognition. Once it has enough data on you, you can ask it something like ‘Based on out previous conversations on xyz, what do I know well, what are the areas where I need to improve and what learning style has proven to work best for me?’We learn in chunks. You have to build up those chunks one at a time and train your brain to think, not consume.",

Create tic tac toe game, then create computer opponent 2. Create Checkers game, then create computer opponent 3.

Hopefully there will be minimal to no permanent harm done to you.Take note that we may end up working for a toxic workplace too and it's better to learn how to protect yourself, both in your family environment, workplace, and anywhere. Learn not to overthink and stay rooted and grounded in the physical world you're in. Trust your thoughts, emotions and gut feel, don't let others tell you poor or even dangerous advises.Consider doing internships to gain real work experiences, learn to sell yourself well on your resume, LinkedIn and in interviews.The best thing for you is learning how to protect yourself, and plan to move out of there or be away from them.and if you ever choose to get a life partner, be careful not to repeat the mistake of being with someone toxic. We tend to be attracted to who we find familiar, and children from toxic family, have a tendency to gravitate to toxic people too, even when they themselves aren't. Break that cycle.",

From your post i understood that your in a very tough situation! The major problem you have is 1.toxic family 2. Financial problem 3. & currently dont have a laptop! The first thing you have do is convince your parents to give your laptop back! Then you said your financial situation is very bad so you should do some part time job in any clothing store or any shop, you can try cafe or something like that! They will pay you enough to survive i think! Considering your 20 year old female i think it Will be very tough for you to leave your home just like that! If you can do that it will be very good but outside home in india as a lone girl finding suitable living place is very tough to get! You can live in your local hostel where College girls lives or something like that! So now you got your laptop & got a part time job & also found a shelter! Now the journey of coding begins! As you want to learn ai / ml or like this kind of things! But the thing is this very possible to learn but considering you situation you should first learn WEB DEVELOPMENT! Because it is a very suitable career path to enter the tech world & you can land a job very fast as a intern or junior web developer & you can learn 100% of it in Just 6-9 months! So how will you learn? For that there are many resources in YouTube & those are completely free! In my opinion you should learn from codewithharry's sigma web development course! There are also others resources like Freecodecamp etc but sigma web dev course will ne best for you bcz its in hindi! Thats all! If you have anymore quarry plz feel free to ask & Don't lose hope! Have faith in yourself you will be able to overcome any problem in your life!!",

Contrary to popular belief banging your head against problems and trying to self-solve everything is most often the worst route. There is a bit of nuance here. When you already have a degree of skill in an area, then solving things to get a deeper understanding / appreciation is good. But as a newbie learning core ideas, be that in mathematics, or programming, or otherwise, the \"solve it yourself\" approach of so many old school masters is well evidenced as being a poor route.I would recommend a middle road.Getting AI to simply spam code at you is a terrible idea. But having it do code reviews, and even to give you clear answers so you know what to do, is a good idea. There is very little value in sitting there for a day, struggling to figure out how to align things in CSS, if you could have learned the core functions of flex and grid in 30 minutes and then spent the day actually practicing them.Be sensible. You seem like a smart person. So you can tell the difference between a case where you are using AI to do the work for you vs using it to teach you things in an efficient way. And don't depend only on AI. But it is a powerful tool and you should use it. There are many Luddites who swear off it and will tell you that you will never code if you touch it. But honestly, they are just living in denial. We are where we are. Love or hate AI it is here. And so use it. Because I assure you other people will be.",

The point is, in college you start learning mechanics (c/c++), then algorithms (sorting, etc), and finally OOP(system design). If you can understand how to program, the language doesn't matter. It just becomes the syntax you use to translate your concept/thought into reality. Instead of jumping from one to the next, stay focused on learning the principles, and it becomes simple to learn others.",

I know that there are a lot of ways to do the same stuff. If you saw someone did something differently - it doesn't mean that you are wrong. It just means that you just discovered one more way to do the same stuff.Be proud to say \"I don't know\". Don't try to hide it. If you get into a place where people shame you for that phrase - they are stupid and cowards. Not knowing something is just a first step into knowing it. Without this step - you will never learn anything.I worked at some companies where the code base is so terrible that even with my bad experience I was shocked by its quality. And the people there were so proud of themselves.After that I started to realize that perfect code exists only in examples. If the project is live and constantly changing - the chances that it will become a monster are almost 99%.It doesn't mean that you should not care about your code. It means that at any point of your career what you know is enough. Just keep learning from your mistakes. And keep going.Perfectionism killed more projects than bad code.

There are so many details that one uses seldom; you cannot remember them all, and the details may change over time. Actually, try to learn things at a conceptual level. Learn the vocabulary and words that you can use when you need more details; things you use regularly will eventually stick in memory.Also, making mistakes is part of the journey. Try to avoid making too big mistakes and try not to repeat them; learn from your mistakes.It is very rewarding to have undisrupted time and to focus on building new features from \"scratch,\" but dealing with bugs, security issues, library/framework updates, and requirements changes are also part of the work.

Make mistakes, recreate things that are already created. Don't expect that it will lead to greatness but it will help you understand why (in the case of libraries) some decisions were made. Likely you will (in some cases) run into the same constraints.For chess: why not make a chess board that lets you move a piece (and the board verifies your move is valid). that's an achievable goal. You can do it in text or using simple graphics. (graphics takes some learning but it is manageable if you set your goals low, like just load sprites for board and pieces. then displaying them in a grid. then if you cna make moves and if you make illegal moves it will stop you (just with 1 side of the pieces) you can start on taking turns with the opponent. At any of these stages you can ask for help, talk through your planned strategy. Don't literally build what people here / elsewhere tell you is 'the optimal' way to do it. You don't need to get a perfect solution , you are exercising your brain at the coding gym. It's good to get pointed in the right direction but it's important you do the work.We all feel like this. Especially at the start of a project because there are too many options. Once you start a project, the options become smaller and it will become easier to do steps forward. At some point you have removed enough unknowns for a specific problem that you have mental space to work on the problem at hand (isolated from the rest of the issues it becomes easier to think about). then you'll find you actually can work your way through it.There is a reason that in school you get given clearly defined problems with clear boundaries. It makes it very easy to focus on what you have to do. Build a datastructure that ... , build code that finds ... , etc. If you want to get a break from the high level things you can always go do some exercises but don't stick to them permanently.And when you see a tutorial, don't copy paste their solution but read it and then implement it yourself.",

A chess engine is no simple project.I can relate to the feeling of everything just feeling hacky, when merely plugging things together. Often that is, because one does not understand what exactly is happening on the lower levels of a thing. And if one was looking into that, then the actual project one was working on would be completely stalled.It can help to either do a very minimalistic project, or consciously say no to something like React and build things the traditional way, just rendering a few templates in Django. And if Django is too magical, you could go more minimalistic with something like Flask, or Falcon + Jinja2 + some database connector.Or you could go even more rudimentary and choose to do some coding puzzles. Like Project Euler, Advent of Code, or similar. Those allow you also to write beautiful code to solve problems elegantly.

What matters as a software developer is your ability to creatively problem-solve using the fundamentals of computer science to tackle complex tasks. Being good at this will make you successful in all parts of SWE.If you want a decent-paying job as a software developer, here is your roadmap:1. Go to school for a CS degree2. Get an internship during your studies3. Between school, work, etc, practice building large, complex, full-stack projects to showcase on your resume4. By the time you graduate, you will probably spend several months to a year competing for entry-level jobsJumping in to SWE expecting your life to quickly improve is a mistake.

Nursing is absolutely recession proof. People always get sick, and there's a massive shortage of nurses. Plus at 48, you'd have a solid 20+ year career ahead of you.But since you asked about tech longevity... AI/ML, cybersecurity, and mobile development aren't going anywhere. Web development is evolving but still fundamental. The thing is, tech moves fast and you gotta keep learning constantly. At Metana we see people in their 40s and 50s successfully transition into development, but it takes real commitment to stay current.Here's what I'd consider in your shoes. What actually interests you more? Do you want to help people directly through healthcare, or do you get excited about building things digitally? Both can be financially rewarding but they're completely different day to day experiences.Also, have you thought about healthcare tech? There's tons of opportunity there, especially for people who understand both sides. But honestly, if you're leaning toward nursing for the stability and recession-proofing, that's totally valid reasoning.The rental income gives you flexibility to take either path without desperation, which is huge. Most people don't have that luxury when making career pivots.",

If it's about \"need,\" the answer is \"not much,\" because there's such a wide range of specializations needing different things. Moreover, you're right that nowadays it's very easy to look up things, but it's a matter of proficiency that eventually you should be looking up less things.For example, the first time I ever got a NullPointerException I remember it was a really difficult bug, I didn't know what pointers *or* null were, and I had to frontload learning all that. Once you've seen them enough though, you just know what it is, how it happens, and how to debug it, and usually (for NPEs caught early) it's a ~2 minute ordeal. I see stories online about people spending hours debugging missing semicolons: once you reach a certain level of familiarity with syntax, that just stops being an issue.As you start to get more proficient, people generally expect you to \"just know\" more. Seniors *are* very adept at learning new things in tech, and very good at finding information to fill their gaps. But they also know a lot, and can more or less jump into a moderate-complexity codebase and get to work without much ramp-up. It's not that they \"need\" to memorize the information, but that they need a certain critical mass of experience to be able to do their job effectively. (Try asking foreign language learners about the difference between being able to look up a grammar table vs having the table memorized vs being able to speak correctly.) This is all ignoring the logistics of how one even knows what to google for unclear issues.This especially applies with specialization: I wouldn't expect most programmers to know low-level details of memory layout, paging, CPU caching, etc, but since I write database internals, it's sort of critical to being able to do my job. OTOH I've met other devs at the same company that don't know the difference between RAM and disk, and they're doing fine in their expertise: it's just not a thing that's very relevant if you're working in some areas.So, overall, I think the answer is \"learn *some* things well.\" You see people often reference T-shaped skillsets, where there's a large set of shallow skills (the top of the T) and a few deep ones (the vertical line). Syntax / basics are pretty much must-have, as well as some library/framework experience. But beyond that, be willing to dive into the details of tools you work with, practice learning as a skill, and start building that internal library. Looking things up on the job is fine, but learn from those resources, don't just drop them and move on as soon as you've found an answer.",

This is a process.Writing the code itself (ignoring AI writing the code for you or just vibe coding) is a bit of that process and a bit of actual knowledge of the methods, properties and syntax required. This just comes with time. At first you will be constantly looking things up, but eventually it will start to sink in. Im personally glad I learned most of what I know before AI because now it is hard to do anything without it since it is just so much faster to get a quick answer.

For beginner to intermediate topics there are already enough resources that exist for you to become a fantastic programmer. AI is like having a really smart friend, that will happily just do your work for you, even if you ask it not too. This is great when you have a job, but if he does all your homework (or practice projects) you will literally learn nothing. And I'll answer the rebuttal I always hear : > but connorjpg what if I understand its outputYou mean you understand the assumed correct answer that was given to you? Yeah I can understand a test when I have the answer key infront of me. Doesnt mean I will remember, why, how or when to use these answers. And as soon as I take the test I will forget everything... Not to mention the more complex the questions you ask the higher chance there will be integration issues or just flat out incorrect returns, and without underlying understanding of the basics you will be completely lost. Now if you are working, use whatever you want, as much of it as you want, no one cares.source : I tutor and mentor college students.",

They make surprisingly human errors (I had one recite an entire regulation paragraph semantically correct but with the wrong number), and even now often remembers outdated information.- Do not ask for patterns or strategies by name. LLMs will start rambling and get lost in bullshit bingo and buzzwords. Instead set your system prompt to encourage being critical and opinionated and then ask about the differences directly in a slightly wrong way. It will then give you the context you want.

I've heard of some senior developers who had a junior developer that decided they didn't have to figure out how to do the task assigned to them. They would just ask the senior developer who got frustrated (and did it for them).The problem with hiring someone that's new is they can be a net negative. I've seen posters who say \"if they're so desperate to hire programmers, why is it so hard to get a job\" (this was in the past when there was more need for programmers). The answer is a bad programmer is worse than no programmer at all. They introduce bugs. They require hand-holding. Even with experience, they sometimes never get much better. With so many programmers out there, companies can be picky and pick those that are ready to go. There are internships for those that are part-way through their CS major degree, but even in an internship, they assume you can pick up coding, figure out an API, etc. But it's hard to tell how much you know, so you might be ready. Have you tried building a small webapp? I'd say, apply, and see what happens. Even those that seem well-prepared are struggling to get replies (e.g., those that have a CS degree).",

Good read, but not really a programming book.*Code Complete* - Never read it.*The Pragmatic Programmer* - More software engineering than programming proper with a bit of self-help/development in there. Pick it up and read it at your leisure since it's more like a collection of essays, there's nothing to work through like a textbook. Many things in it will be more useful after you've graduated from smaller programs into larger programs or systems of programs.*Clean Code* - Gets a ton of hate, more suitable once you've gone to work or maybe late in college. Don't, like many of the haters, neglect the message in chapter one where the author states something like \"This is a book written like there's only one way, but there are other views and here are some of them.\" That is, after chapter 1 they write as if what they say is dogma, it *is* true and there are no alternatives. Which is a fine way to write because writing the 100 variations and counterpoints would result in a tome, and you'd be better served by reading what others believe than whatever Bob & Co. interpreted of what others believe.",

You still have to actually learn how to program and you should learn it on SOMETHING, once you understand the concepts and get a flow for making things it becomes easier to pick up another language. I wouldn't leave yourself not understanding async for example, it is used almost everywhere, even if you aren't writing it, it will be built into the libraries you are using. The best way to learn is to do, so pick a language and try to write something with a thread or two just to see how it is done and run the thought exercise for managing the sync and flow of everything. I think the advice is true, when you get your job you will be working in the tech stack the company has and most of the difficulty will be figuring out the companies code base, so while you might be an expert in one language they may be using another. However, this does not mean that it doesn't make your life easier to know one language and just learn the ins and outs of the other language vs trying to figure out say async concepts while figuring out he language, it is much better to pick up a language and read what kind of async stuff is in the language while understanding the concepts and challenges ahead of time. It is much better to help you evaluate the code base as well if you have a good understanding of what 'good' can look like. Another interpretation of it might really be that you can't learn everything a computer can do now a days, it is essentially infinite as it continuously expands day bay day. But again, do not take this as don't bother mastering what you are working on, or, i don't get this topic and am free to moving on. If you move on make it for a good reason, you won't ever use it perhaps or hate it so much you would refuse a job working with it etc.",

The part of the kernel that does this, is called the **scheduler**, and it is also responsible for running the different threads in a multithreaded process.The difference between concurrency and parallelism is very important. You can have a concurrent system that never runs anything in parallel...for example an event-driven system. A concurrent system *can* be parallel, but doesn't have to be.Also, bear in mind, that neither multithreading nor multiprocessing guarantee actual parallelism. They are a requirement for it, but it is absolutely possible to have a system that is concurrent, but not parallel, using either of those. For example, currently (as the GIL is still in place), a threading python program is multithreading, it is concurrent, but it is not parallel processing, as only one of those threads is allowed to run at any given time.",

It's more useful to know how you'd practically use concurrency.Generally, you can either pass messages between processes, or share memory.In the former case, you create a pipe between two different processes, and then send data from one to the other through the pipe. This is convenient, but there's a cost to it; the message itself must be copied and typically you'll have to make a system call to the operating system to do it. Still, it's great when you don't have much data to send or you need to compose different programs together and make them talk to each other (as in most command shells).In the latter case, there's the risk that two different threads will edit the same piece of data at the same time. To prevent this, you can use atomic operations and/or mutexes. An atomic operation is guaranteed by the language to make other threads wait to mess with the variable until you've finished reading or writing to it. A mutex is a lock that only allows one thread at a time to lock it. So, you can lock the mutex, mess with the variable, then when you're done, unlock it and let another thread do whatever it wants.",

You already understand user problems and how systems break, which is half the battle.Between JavaScript and C#, honestly both are solid choices but I'd lean toward JavaScript for someone in your position becuase JavaScript is everywhere. Frontend, backend (Node.js), mobile apps, even desktop apps. More versatility means more job opportunities. The learning curve can be a bit weird at first but once it clicks, you're golden. C# is great too, especially if you're thinking enterprise development or want something more structured. Microsoft ecosystem is huge and pays well.At Metana we see a lot of career changers and the ones who succeed fastest are usually those with some kind of customer facing or problem solving background. They just \"get\" what users need in a way that pure CS grads sometimes dont.My advice? Pick JavaScript, build a few projects that solve real problems you've seen in help desk work, and apply for roles that value that crossover like developer advocate positions, technical support engineering, or even full stack roles at smaller companies.Either way you choose though, you're already ahead of most beginners because you understand the business side of tech. Don't underestimate that advantage :)",

Newbies often think that learning to code means learning syntax. But that's really not the case.It'd be like assuming that you could learn to write poetry well by simply reading the dictionary.Once you have core skills moving to a new language is often quite simple. I recently learned Go (I'm mostly a JavaScript and Java developer) and it took me a weekend. Not because I'm amazing, but because the core skills I already have are all applicable to Go too. I just had to learn new Syntax (which a good cheat-sheet helps with anyhow) and work through the quirks.I'm far from a total wizard with Go, but I have written a pretty decent API server using Gorm easily. My point being, pick a language and just focus your efforts on going deep. Learn the core skills. Build actual useful things with it. And then, down the road, explore other languages if and when you need them. Which you choose is most often a practical choice based on how easy it is to do something in them, who else needs to work on the project, what is already in place, etc.",

Write all steps down in plain english like the video in step2.2. As in the video try to break your own instructions. Fix your instructions.3. Once you have clear list of instructions try to create the program 1 instruction at a time. My advice would be to look for the simplest solution for each step.Feel free to DM me if you get stuck.",

Small achievements should always be celebrated - especially when overcoming hurdles that have held you back a while.I'm a middle-aged hobbyist, and one of the things I've learned when pursuing other hobbies (Chinese, guitar, etc) is small steps. Good to have goals but need to crawl, walk and eventually run in that order.Most never get near to achieving their original goal because either their original goal was too ambitious and / or there is too large a gap between the effort and the end i.e. the amount of used guitars on sale when people realise that just learning to strum EAD chords takes approx 2 weeks of work.Glad to see another person presuming the time honoured text adventure (or in your case a CYOA). I too, have a number of goals that eventually included creating a MUD [multi-user dungeon]. I'm working on baby goals by first completing CS50x, then working ony simple RPG character generator.The key is simple: get the basic concepts  working, then expand. Can I do points allocation for stats and include out of bounds error checking? Great! Can I get player input for name including out of bounds error checking? Better! Can I expand upon that and create a banned name list ruleset, et al?Going in with lofty goals from the get-go, sees them cut down to size, and either the initial motivation disappears or one adjusts and creates smaller goals w/ a more realistic expectation.If the original motivation remains intact, and one can embrace and actively enjoys learning - and has a realistic timeframe - then go for it!Keep your CYOA - simpe, very simple - to start. Once you have the basic structure, good method to handle and track decisions, then think about expanding. All the best",

The ENIAC computer was programmed by connecting wires between components that did addition, subtraction, multiplication, comparison, storage and so on!But of course that was very low level, and programming languages then came about, that did the job for you. You wrote \"A = B + C\" instead of plugging C and B into the addition-component, and the result into the A component.And as programming projects grew, you didn't write code for mathematical functions yourself, there were libraries for that, you write Math.sin(X) to calculate the sine value of X, you never write the lower level calculations yourself.When programmers repeat code, then instead write functions to reuse, and when those functions are needed a lot in every project, they become part of a shared library, or often the programming language itself. No one writes code to sort a list alphabetically, there's always a built in .sort function, that you don't even need to know how work.And when you write applications that look a lot like each other - say a web-interface to administer a database with users and their logins - you don't write the same code over and over, but do it once, and create a framework, or even easier, use a framework written by someone else! **But!** And this is the important part! - There's always something missing! The application you are working on will always need some feature that isn't in the framework, or library, or language, and then you have to write it yourself. You always have to \"dive down in between the cracks\" and write filler-code for that one thing or another. And also, to connect the components you still use very basic programming at the lowest level available in the language, variables, for-loops, if-statements and functions are still as important building blocks as they have ever been. So you won't get away from needing to understand basic coding - but mostly you don't have to write very much from scratch, you almost always build on something existing!",

So I'll write a class that handles using an HTTP client to pull down data from an API and do something useful with it. Cool. Now I have something that can be plugged into a larger system to do other things based on that data. Rinse, repeat until you have a program that's solving a unique problem (or solving an old problem in a new and hopefully better way). A core rule of our craft is \"don't reinvent the wheel\". If something already exists to do what you need to do, use it. If it doesn't, write it yourself. But generally speaking once you get past the educational phase and into the real world, you're solving unique problems within a certain domain -- medical billing, insurance, manufacturing, banking, flight scheduling, game development, whatever.

That said, you still need to figure out where to place the supports, which type of nail or screw you need and where to put them, how thick the walls need to be for insulation + electricity. The seniors are thinking about how to make sure the house is weather resistant, passes local zoning, ways to cool the house naturally without just using a ton of AC. Your job is to make something work with high fidelity, on a timeline, up to spec, and part of that is making tradeoffs in how you build it. A very big part of that in the modern world is deciding between different libraries and packages for your job. Maybe HTTP is best for your project, maybe gRPC, maybe graphql — they are all prebuilt tools but still need a ton of implementation within your projects to work and all come with pros and cons. One thing is for certain though, you can’t just tell the lumber company and the crane operator to design and build the house.

Plumbers seek to put together parts from a catalogue. Lead through the catalogue, pick the right part for the problem, buy the parts, put them together. Hackers seek to understand the problem and the machine and be able to derive a solution from the combination. No catalogues necessary. Of course, people are always a mixture of both to a greater or lesser extent. But at least in terms of hackery, programming is NOT bolting together things we already knew. It is finding new ways to say things. There always seem to be a lot more plumbers than hackers. But maybe that’s because of environment. A lot of programming is done for money and money tends to discourage hackers and push everyone to be a plumber.",

Like if you want to learn to make games then why are you watching their crash course for the MERN stack? You know? I feel like that would be a bit of a waste of time, especially if you have a career path because I feel like you should stick with it so that you don't risk burning yourself out with too much information. But if you just want to have fun and you don't really have a clear path and you just want to build and learn then I don't see why not, go ham and smash your keyboard until something cool is built. But if you have a clear goal, like mobile development, or embedded systems or web development, then I think watching crash courses that focus on that alone is a lot more beneficial if you're trying to master your field of interest. It's good to be curious, but doing 3 different crash courses on completely different things can lead to fatigue and burn out, at least that was my experience when I did that.",

For example spending an hour searching for an explanation is not relevant to learning the content.

In fact, I am old school so I am even against the IDEs. It is like learning to ride a bicycle, these tools are the training wheels. Sure you can use them at the very beginning and at some point they have to come off so you can actually learn how to ride a bicycle otherwise you would be just riding a tricycle. Traditionally the training wheels are bad enough that at some point we will abandon them because it is simply faster to not rely on them. But the situation is switching, the training wheels are so good, it actually makes sense to keep riding the tricycle and just never learned the bicycle properly. In short, you will end up riding a tricycle forever thinking you are riding a bicycle. But you can say, there is nothing wrong with tricycles if you can go from A to B faster. The problem is \"adaptation.\" You see once you learn one bicycle, you can ride any bicycle with ease. This is not so if you had learned a bicycle with training wheels because you have to put on a new set of training wheels, learn from the training wheels on how to start peddling the new bike, etc. I know my analogy sounds weird and stupid but my point is that it is always a bad idea to use tools that can lead to a dependency. Dependency can hinder your growth and make you stagnate as a learner at an early stage. If you are a pro and your goal is to get things done, then that's a different story.",

(e.g \"woof woof\" for dog, \"nyaa\" for cat). \\- The age value should not be longer than 20 for cat, 18 for dogTry and create that application. You don't need to use database or txt or external store. just an application that you can create Cat and Dog object in main function. It's simple application that make use of inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation that you mention.

Start the assignments as soon as you can, write up your notes after each class and see if you can implement a toy example of the concepts, and if you can't then that is awesome, you know have questions you can ask and something to point at.University isn't really about how smart you are, it's about how much targeted work you put in and being proactive.

You can get most of the same effect with e.g. VSCode but disabling intellisense, any autocomplete, and highlighting. It's a silly thing to need to know how to do, but it really helps, and you'll start getting \\*much\\* more precise at reading/writing/debugging syntax in other contexts too.Regarding the actual topics, I agree with others that finding another textbook might be the way to go if your lecturer isn't working out for you. Many of the types of people who write textbooks are really passionate about teaching, and have put in a lot of work to put their own spin on these concepts. There's a lot of recs online that you can try reviewing.I personally really liked making my own versions of others' abstractions. E.g. at some point I wrote a program (mini search engine) that used my own version of the \\`List\\` interface with my own implementations of \\`LinkedList\\` and \\`ArrayList\\`. I also liked making a \\`Logger\\` interface supporting a \\`println\\` method that could interchangeably log to the console, to a file, to an encrypted file (with caesar cipher), and to a graphical window.",

If you’re just starting out, I’d recommend following his YouTube playlists in the order he’s arranged them - he usually builds up from basics to advanced topics, so it’s a good flow for learning concepts step by step.Once you’re comfortable with the basics, you can use his TUF website to focus on specific topics or practice questions. The site is great for targeted revision and for brushing up on theory before tackling coding problems. Some people like to watch the theory video for a topic, then immediately try related questions from the site—that’s a solid approach too.So, in short: - If you want a structured path, follow the YouTube playlist order- If you want to focus on certain topics or practice, use the TUF website to pick and choose. Good luck!",

Everyone says the same thing about how passionate they are; but if you ever had a computer or even a graphing calculator then you could have learned. This seems like the only thing people ever say they're passionate about before they have even tried it. And they always say it after talking about games.Again, this is really the default thing to say. Someone wants to make games. They're \"passionate\". Never tried. They don't know what to do about their career. You could pick almost any 18-25-year-old boy and they'll say the same thing.The point isn't really to discourage you but instead to encourage you not to limit yourself to the only thing that feels safe: games and internet.

First goal is to build something that works. It always starts ugly and messy and probably more like functional scripting than OOP. Second goal is to make it nicer to read, which means separating stuff out into functions, and if it's really its own monster, taking up half the main file, to a module it goes, purely for ease of use. I almost never set out with an idea how how many or what types of modules will need, I just come to points in the process where I'm like, damn that's ugly, or I realize that I'm re-using stuff, or this function is huge, let's throw it in a new file.Of course if you find yourself creating something where it's extremely obvious that you'll be using it all over, then sure, go ahead and proactively write it as a module from the get go and build it up as you go.",

Just endless pain and headaches and frustration. But until you experience some of that pain, none of the strategies to solve it really make that much sense. And when you're starting out working on smaller projects, often a lot of code organization is kind of optional anyways because you're not dealing with enough complexity for it to really matter.So, like, sure, read about it. Think about it. But understand that what will make it click is getting your hands dirty in the guts of big, complex codebases.This is the kind of thing that, although there are principles that can be applied, really needs experience and developing some *intuition* for the problem in order to be able to do well at it. Which is a *good* thing - it is the skills that are hard to develop except through long practice that makes programmers employable!",

        "body": "I think the easiest way to think about this is to think about what functions are actually meant to do. A function is a set of code that performs a specific task, and can be reused repeatedly. For example, thinking of a simple calculator application that we want to be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. When we think about specific tasks that can be made into functions, it sounds like we will need a function for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, as those are all specific tasks that we want to perform repeatedly. Of course, identifying functions gets more complicated for larger projects, but you don't need to know all the functions you could possibly need ahead of time. Modularization isn't something that happens completely up-front before you program anything, it's something that you will do throughout the programming process. For me what works is outlining functions I know I need at the beginning, then starting to write my program and looking out for sections of code that are reused multiple times. When I realize it is something that is going to be reused, I move it to a function. Basically, keep an eye out for things that your program will be doing a lot of. Any time you are seeing the same logic repeated, or have something that performs a specific task, those are good things to consider putting into functions. Don't worry if you can't identify everything in advance or feel like it's a struggle at first. That's part of the learning process and I promise, it gets easier the more you do it!",

In my opinion it’s similar in this way to object oriented design. I use a limited version of both in my personal projects and when I’m working on small teams.For modularizing, you generally start with one file, and then at some point you break it into multiple files just as a basic organizing step. And yes you often make classes to encapsulate natural units, like a matrix class, a networking class, a class for the application overall.But once you start going crazy with lots and lots of classes, and complex class hierarchies, you make it harder to make those fundamental pivots.As a simple concrete example, an oop book might tell you a personnel management app should have an Employee class and from that derive classes for various types of employees, probably using intermediate classes, like a Manager class, from which you derive UnitManager and SeniorExec, all with their own classes. This might work out well in certain cases, if you’re lucky. But in my experience, just make the one Employee class and give it a “type” member. See how far that gets you before making a tree of classes, each probably in their own code file. And the same idea goes for overall modularization.I have a saying: Don’t divide and conquer yourself.",

We don't know what is going to change, but we know that change is inevitable. Maybe an API you depend on gets a breaking change, maybe you want to drastically change the way you display stuff to users, maybe you discover a major security flaw with how you're handling data etc etc...The way we prepare for that is not by thinking about every possible scenario and making preparations, but instead by building systems that are flexible to change. One way you could achieve that is by following the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID).1. Limit your modules to only one responsibility. ([example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON))2. Write your modules to be open to extension, but closed to modification. ([example](https://alexnault.dev/open-closed-principle-in-functional-typescript))3. Any substitute modules you write should not break the program. ([example: a square data object is not a valid substitute for a rectangle data object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle#Violation))4. Keep code decoupled from other code it does not need. The math module does not need to know about drawing boxes on the DOM.5. Depend on interfaces rather than specific implementations. Makes it trivial to substitute behavior.",

There is just no way anyone can learn every field in IT, because it is just too big.With that in mind this would be my suggestion, take it for what's worth.If this was me, this what I would be doing:1. Take a look at different jobs that are going in your area, what is hot, what is not, what you like, what you don't like.2. Make a note of the skills listed in the Job Descriptions (JD) for all of these jobs. You'll notice these jobs can now be categorized into job groups, based on the skills required. These grouping will be based on things like languages/frameworks/technologies etc. There will be dozens of these job groups.3. Now based on what you learned in boot camp, pick a job group for which you think you have the most skills.4. Next identify the skills you don't have for that job group and go away and learn those skills to at least a basic level.Why do this? Because at the end that process you can confidently craft a resume that lists ever skill set required for the job group. That then means your resume has a better chance of getting through the vetting process should you apply.In summary, if you want to get a job in IT you'll need to make sure you have at least a basic understanding of every skill listed on the JD for the role for which you are applying.",

Still a lot but well worth it for me on reflection.All of this to say that they are not all bad and there are exceptional boot camps out there, at least I’d highly recommend mine.

Then it turned out that I couldn't ever do the job of a senior computer programmer because of a brain disability. If you're interested in the details of my brain disability, read this GitHub issue I created seeking a workaround: https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/159406 :backhand_index_pointing_up_medium-light_skin_tone: Basically I can only handle codebases that I am not the designer and author of if that codebase has fewer than a (relatively small) number of lines of code in it. I got around this issue as a junior developer by having a senior developer tell me, for every task I had, which file or class the code fix needed to be made in. That being said, eventually the senior developer got tired of holding my hand and spoon feeding me and then I got fired. Eventually employers caught on. But yeah, in short, you could literally have a 4-year degree in Computer Science from MIT and then discover that you cannot work due to a very specific brain disability. Life's not fair.

You can read and learn the syntax basics easily on a phone, but as for practicing it, it will be a tad hard.

Typically an array or list is good for most things. When given the option, prefer nonresizable arrays to arraylists/vectors to linked lists. If your language doesn't provide options then it doesn't matter.If you are searching for things in an array, try a map or a set. If you need to add/remove things from the front, try a queue or a deque. Other datastructures have niche advantages; but you'll know when you need them. The rule of thumb I use is that if I'm reading about something and see a datastructure mentioned I check its wikipedia page; it's probably important to whatever I'm doing.For algorithms, if you need to sort or do some other common operation your programming language probably has a way to do it that's faster than anything you can write. Otherwise, just write it in a way that works, then think if there's any way to optimize it a bit if you really need performance or it's really ugly.As much as I like quicksort I don't think I've ever needed to write it myself.

The whole idea of learning DSA is to learn how to evaluate the pros and cons of each structure or algorithm, and decide based on the individual case.However, for most real-world applications it isn't that hard. Never implement an algorithm, if some exists in the language/library/framework you are using! Don't choose a sorting algorithm, use the built-in sort, that is always the most efficient one! And for data structures, there are mostly only two choices: lists and maps. A list is an ordered list of items, where you can get, add, remove, insert any item you want. A map is a collection of items identified by a unique key-value, for instance user-objects with a userId. Every language has effective implementations of both, in Python it is list and dict, in JavaScript it is Array and Object, in Java it is ArrayList and HashMap, and so on. Most of the time one of these will do just fine!But if you want to know more, you need a course in DSA - or a good book. I really like [\"Grokking Algorithms\"](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-algorithms-second-edition) \\- it focuses much more on the understanding, than on the actual implementation or the math.",

For example, the original names of the variables are lost, and all of the comments are lost as well. So it is also necessary to track down real JavaScript \"source code\" (i.e. unminified code) to learn how people are writing this.Nowadays a lot of people also write TypeScript as the source code, which \"compiles\" (sometimes called \"Transpiled\" in this context) down to plain JavaScript.

Game Development imo is that prestige-teir/world-class field, like neurosurgeon for doctors, rockets for the engineers or stockbrokers for the finance bros. Start with the basics, in a language like Python, just to understand what a programming language is, how it works, and how we communicate to computers. That doesn't have to be super intensive, then research Game Development. Btw OP, Unreal Engine is C++, which has its own flair to it. This is why most people here are recommending this route.",

The hash is intended specifically to prevent people from doing what you're doing: generating CNC files with \"unauthorized\" software. In that case the designers will have used something like an [HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) (if they're competent) and you will have no hope of reproducing it without reverse-engineering whatever existing software generated the hash.In the second case, reverse-engineering the system is almost always possible *in theory*, but *in practice* it might be very very difficult.",

I personally prefer more structured languages, like C#, Java, and C++. I actually prefer C++ (I use the POCO library) overall because it lets me write the fastest code possible, and to access other C/C++ libraries directly (most of the core libraries you'll use in any backend framework are based on C++). But I learned to program long ago and I'm in the minority on that.For front-end, you are ultimately always working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. There are a ton of pre-processors that can compile, obfuscate, and otherwise turn code from some other source format into JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. For my part I just use those basics straight, usually with jQuery. But I've also used JavaScript compilers like esbuild (which I like because it's very fast).So I think it's largely a matter of taste and people tend to mostly use what they already know.I think the main constraints are (1) if you're writing server code that needs to be very fast, you either need to master something like numpy or the equivalent JavaScript libraries, or use C++ or rust. In my opinion, it's easier to use a fast language like C++ instead of trying to cleverly use numpy or other C++-based libraries to make a slow language like Python faster. And (2), because front-end code is always in JavaScript, if I'm using a scripted back-end language I'll prefer Node over Python, just to keep everything in the same language.",

If you start from python its hard to understand heap VS stack memory, memory leaks, pointers, parsing binary data into structs and other concepts. Its also the common intermediate language between many languages - many languages have integration with C, and then integration between the languages is done through C.You may not use these \"low level concepts\" most days (depending on your job), but when you will need them (optimizations, weird bugs, integration with weird external projects) you will understand them better. You will also learn to appreciate higher level languages, and understand some of the \"whys\" in their design.Then, in parallel, python is just a great scripting language for quickly getting something done, can teach you how higher level languages work, and many big projects use it.After knowing enough of those two, i would suggest trying to understand what you like and want to learn/work at, and either pick another language popular in that domain or stick with C/Python.",

Maybe I misunderstand and it’s not so much going from legacy to new framework, but more being able to find bad code that could be made more efficient without breaking anything?Sorry, this may be out of my league still.

See a position that asks for python, docker, cloud ? Etc, learn it, make project, update portfolio rinse and repeat.Data science is completely different and I think it will be very hard to learn both for development and a data role :SQL, python, datamodeling, ML, DL , statistical analysis, brush up on statistics and mathematics.You have EE master degree which is a strong degree but still not that related to software or DS so make sure that you have a strong portfolio.",

You already understand complex systems and problem-solving at a level most bootcamp grads dont have.For where to apply, try AngelList for startups, they're more willing to take chances on potential over perfect resumes. Also check out YC company job boards, reach out directly to CTOs on Twitter, and honestly just cold email smaller companies whose products you actually use.Project-wise, forget the typical todo apps everyone builds. Since you have an EE background, build something that bridges that gap. Maybe a tool that visualizes electrical circuit data, or automates some workflow you know engineers deal with. About internships, unpaid ones are tricky legally in most places, but if its a legit startup where you're learning tons and building real features, it might be worth it short-term. Just make sure you're not just doing grunt work.One thing we see at Metana with career switchers like yourself, the ones who get hired fastest are those who can tell a compelling story about why they switched and what unique perspective they bring. Your EE background plus Python skills is actually a rare combo that certain companies really need.Also, don't wait until you feel \"ready\" to start applying. You'll learn more from a few rejections and interviews than another month of tutorials. Companies can teach you their specific stack, but they cant teach you how to think through problems, which you already know how to do.",

My job was to put together the backend of the core starter kit or \"platform\" as we called it. The frontend was also a generic frontend that could be branded and modify very easily, and my backend needed to work no matter what the client's ask was.Eventually this became a much bigger deal with dozens of people on the broader project once the platform started selling.

Good luck.” What they should say is, “Here’s why you’d use X in situation A, why not in situation B, and what the tradeoffs are.”Think about how your best teachers helped you learn a difficult concept. They didn’t just throw facts at you, they used metaphors that hooked into emotionally salient narratives you already understood. They met you where you were. Docs almost never do that. They assume tabula rasa logic and ignore the emotional friction of learning.For me personally, I can’t remember something if I learn it in isolation, like just reading the docs. I need to actually understand why I should use X or Y by thinking through what problems this solves. So instead of trying to memorize pandas functions, I focus on understanding what problem each one addresses. When I encounter groupby(), I don’t just memorize the syntax, I understand it’s for when I need to split data into groups and perform operations on each group separately.People think the software industry is smart because it’s lucrative, but honestly, most frameworks are born in corporate hellscapes, not classrooms. There’s almost zero thought given to long-term cognitive overhead, onboarding cost, or whether the tradeoffs even make sense outside the dev team that built it.We don’t need more features, we need more epistemology. Teach people how to think through code, not just parrot API calls.Delete out of your mind “move fast; break things” a more mature ideology is “move slow; ask why”.And most importantly never give up!

        "body": "If there's one thing I can tell you from my ~15 years of experience in the software industry (and longer as a hobbyist), it's that you should never say something is impossible. Modern software stacks are so complicated that there's an endless number of places bugs could be lurking.Just from your description, by process of elimination, the most plausible *categories* of problems are:* The upload process is uploading the first user's image to a different key than the one it logged* The download process is incorrectly downloading a different key than the one it logged* In between the upload and download, something is overwriting the second user's image with a copy of the first user'sAnd the most obvious next step to narrow down the problem would be to enable detailed access logging on your S3 bucket. If you log timestamps and file sizes of every write, then you should be able to clearly distinguish all three of those scenarios.> Based on just... all my understanding of how code, and computers, and code execution works... there's just no way that one user's image from the JS running in his browser could possilbly \"cross over\" into the other user's browser and get uploaded via his computer to his unique and distinct S3 key.Well, remember that even if the user environments are separate, there is bound to be shared state somewhere on the backend. For instance, if you're using AWS Lambda, then a single function execution environment will generally be reused across multiple successive requests. So if your code is inappropriately storing data in global state across requests instead of reinitializing it, then a bug could cause data from the wrong request to be used. But saying any more would require diving into the actual details of your code.",

It's very possible that none of those applicants are actually qualified and they're picking the ones they feel can learn on the job.I'm not sure where you are but I'd like to share something...A few years ago I was hiring for a test engineer. We wanted someone in the US city where the office was, where one of the company offices was or possibly remote. Out of \\~2000 applicants 1500 were not even in the US (all of them needed sponsorship which the post explicitly said wasn't available). Of the remaining 500, 450 didn't live anywhere near one of our office. Of the remaining 500 we determined that 200 weren't actually real or in the US. Of that last 300 only 20 had what appeared to be relevant test or development experience. So out of 1000+ applications there might be less than 20 worth moving on or who you actually could hire.If you're pressed then try hacker news or posting a listing here if it's allowed",

There's a short period of time where you can get hired to do Y without previous experience in Y. After that, they're only going to hire people who already know Y. Further, it's easier for you to get X jobs than Y jobs, because you already know X well.You also can pivot to Y and choose wrong.

AWS, iPhone, Facebook, YouTube among others were all launched in that time period. There was massive growth every year as more people got cell phones, wanted apps and social networking and companies moved compute to the cloud. Fast forward to 2025, everyone who wants a mobile app has one, everyone who wants on the cloud is already there. What’s the iPhone moment now? LLMs? One of the reasons they are being pushed so much is that this is probably the only hypergrowth market around right now. While there will always be a need for engineers unless there is a heretofore unknown radical increase in demand, one that AI/offshoring can’t meet, the past 20 years of growth are gone.

That PTO is still earned. They can convert to \"unlimited\", but if they're legally required to they'll still have to pay out everyone's unused PTO once they do that.I worked for a company in one of those States once. They were unlimited, but during an employee's first year they did accrued PTO. After I had started, the company decided to get rid of that policy and make everyone unlimited from day 1. In order to do that, they paid out all the accrued PTO we had all gained. It actually worked in my benefit, I still was able to take the same amount of vacation I otherwise would've, but I had already accrued a bunch which they had to buy out, so I got a nice fat bonus.Even if your husband's in a State that doesn't require a company to do that, they *might* still do it anyways to keep people happy. You could have him ask HR to clarify what happened to unused PTO on July 1st.Other than that, no, there's not really anything your husband can do.",

What value do you have to offer as a competitive edge if someone else can come along and vibe code a better version of your product in a week?CEOs forget, they don't hire software developers because they can do repeatative tasks, as if it's just data entry.

It's true that Meta is overall more \"intense\" but what this really means is that people don't coast. Getting high ratings and raises is very doable, which is why everyone is trying to do it, and I wouldn't say that's a bad thing. The E4 -> E5 promotion is probably easier to get at Meta.The biggest differences in my mind are:1. Meta is more customer metrics driven; a good project is a project that made the numbers go up. Whereas Google is more focused on alignment: if the senior engineers agreed your design was good, and your leadership thought it was a good idea, and you executed it well, then it was a good project regardless of what happens after. On the positive side, this means that at Google you can spend more of your time on risky, speculative things; at Meta you have to think about your time more like an investment portfolio, with some things you're pretty sure will pay off to \"fund\" your riskier ideas. On the negative side, as you advance in your career at Google you have to spend more of your time sucking up to leadership, because there is no objective way to determine whether your projects were good so it is more of a popularity contest.2. Google has better engineering practices, infrastructure, and documentation. This follows from Meta being an entertainment company; Instagram users will come back even if the app crashes sometimes, but Google Cloud customers wouldn't tolerate this. Things break pretty often at Meta. The downside of this is that you spend more time firefighting during oncall. The upside is that it's much easier to ship things. Code and design reviews are less nitpicky and there are fewer barriers to just doing things. It does mean that more knowledge at Meta is in people's heads rather than written down, so you have to build out a network of experts. There is more chatter and context switching as a result, although overall there are fewer meetings which is nice.If you were someone who disliked the bureaucracy at Google, Meta will be a good change of pace. They are both good companies to work at, it's all about what you value.",

That's true for other types of engineering, but unlike building a bridge or a car, in software the transition from \"development\" to \"production\" is continuous.Instead of thinking about that, orient yourself to the job the software is doing, and what specific problem its solving for people. Under that perspective, there's a minimal set of things you need to do in order to do that job. Most of development planning I do, is figuring out what is that minimal set of things we need in order for the app or whatever to be successful.The difficult thing about software, and what will take years to learn, is to understand the tradeoff space between doing something fast that quickly solves a problem but might have a lot of tech debt, and taking more time to do something right, and having less tech debt or ongoing costs. There's no right solution, and in different business cases you'll want to make different tradeoffs.",

We have pyramids to build.Maybe you \"finished\" implementing Amazon, now you can expand into better user experience, you can improve latency on so when users click, things update faster. You can optimize infrastructure so your website costs less to keep running. You can build analytics to study user behavior and increase user dwell time/user spend/whatever metrics to target. You can build software to remove fake listings and illegal listings. Even keeping the lights on is non-trivial as you expand your user-base you'll have scaling issues, internationalization, need to deal with local tax law and compliance, etc.Even if you chose to sit on your hands the whole time and just keep things as-is you'll eventually be subject to externalities: compliance things like GDPR and CCPA (user data retention), or your business will fundamentally be disrupted as is the case with Google Search (ads) and ChatGPT changing the way users query internet.I spent the last few weeks literally writing document to define Q3 work.

        "body": "Before you entirely abandon this field, here are some things that might help.1,000 applications is intense. But applying online is also a saturated channel and an increasingly inefficient one. In the past 3 years, a bunch of recruiters got laid off, and according to our data, there are about 3X fewer recruiters working now than there were in the first half of 2022.At the same time, the number of (non-spam) applicants for eng jobs has 3X'ed since the first half of 2022. I don't have numbers for how many spam applications companies are getting, but if I had to guess, I'd say that it's probably another 3-5X increase.So, recruiters are maybe 30-50X less productive than they were a couple of years ago. Which, for you, means that applying online isn't the best approach.Before you completely give up and switch to a field that takes over 10 years to start making money, try doing outreach instead. You can give yourself a deadline. Something like, \"If I can't get some responses by January 2026, I'm going to med school.\" And until then, I'd focus on trying to get in the door.So, what to do? I'm one of the authors of Beyond Cracking the Coding Interview. We have a whole chapter on how to do outreach that includes some templates, and it's free: [https://bctci.co/free-chapters](https://bctci.co/free-chapters) It's the first document, and just go to Chapter 7: Getting in the Door.When you do your outreach, in the part of the template where you should mention something unique about you, try writing about how you were able to automate your job. I bet it's a good story.Finally, if you post a link to your resume/LinkedIn in a response to this comment, I'd be happy to review and share some notes. That said, you (and others in your shoes) probably don't need to spend lots of time on your resumes because recruiters typically scan them for brands, and either you have them or you don't. Anyone who tells you to spend a lot of time polishing your resume is probably selling snake oil.",

Hell, you can spend another 3-4 years getting a whole second degree in something else if you want, and still be the same age as most of the student body(again, priceless).21-with-a-degree-and-no-debt is the most future any adult can possible have.

There's a lot of talk about tech being a boom-and-bust industry, but even to an experienced tech exec nowadays they've seen three busts:1. Dot com2. Great Recession3. TodayThe difference with the first two is that tech (and especially web-based software + SaaS) has grown its talent pool significantly since 2008. One man's trash is another man's treasure. Once companies set in these Three Horsemen of the (Tech) Apocalypse (RTO, Offshoring, and Stack Ranking), those companies in the past would be seen as \"failing\" culturewise. However, in 2023-2025 the normal cycle of job changing was disrupted, so you have a lot of built-up dissatisfaction from people who want to change jobs, but can't find new opportunities. When opportunities arise at these companies with those qualities, the new folks may be arriving from something that was an even worse dumpster fire. A good example is GEICO. They fired swaths of their IT/SWE and have a 2.6 on Glassdoor. They are pretty much bottom of the barrel as far as large companies. However, if someone was working at Geico and transitioned into something like Amazon, they might find it a breath of fresh air.The real problem at the end of the day is an oversupply of engineers. Fix the problem at the source and reduce enrollments.",

The skills you need to maintain a long term relationship is vastly different than what you need to be successful in getting that first/second date. Plenty of people currently in a ltr would get eaten alive if they had to start dating again and plenty of people who can easily date around make absolutely terrible life partners. Ideally you would need to be good at both to succeed in the long run",

I had a year of savings in my emergency fund. Unemployment is difficult to get, doesn’t last long, and peanuts in my state compared to other states so it wouldn’t have really been much help to me.2. PIP terms were a month-long effort with goals that were realistically scoped larger than a month and also depended on the rest of the team for success. Resignation was an immediate two-week notice period but I was given the time to brush up my resume, prepare for interviews, etc. Not having to work my ass off for an extra paycheck to have two weeks of uninterrupted job search time was worth it to me. And honestly, I just needed a break.I would not do it again without a job lined up lol.",

A layoff for a company that staid in business, means that somebody didn't consider you part of the group that was worth hanging on to, while a resignation is still your own choice, and that perceived negative judgment never comes.I don't know this part for sure, but I believe there may be some kinds of background checks, like for those entrusted to very high-security operations, which asks explicitly whether you left voluntarily or involuntarily, and (again just spitballing) but I expect the check may not pass if the story doesn't match up with investigation, or if there are too many involuntary departures over a certain amount of time.",

Switching careers like that isn't easy but you sound like you've approached it so far as a structured problem that can be conquered.You joined the workforce right as we're all taking a bite out of a crap sandwich I'm afraid and that's not your fault.My advice; don't put such a priority on social groups. People can be really full of it, and that's not fun. My recommendation is to find an open source project that aligns with your interest and try to make ANY contribution and become part of it. It can be super small contributions, as long as you're addressing a problem, work well with others, document cleanly, etc. As you do that you're going to meet people just by working. And you'll earn trust and build a role in a community from a really meaningful angle.You don't need anyone's permission to *build* the type of community engagement you crave. I believe in you!",

This guy was a higher level engineer who basically developed everything and went out of his way to make the code 100x better and refactored. But he also was the AH engineer who cut people off, wanted to get in arguments over any little disagreements and would go on rants for over an hour if someone dared to disagree. People def walked on eggshells for him. The thing was, I think he basically knew there was very little they could do to fire him. This was in FAANG for a product that had many big time customers. Even with his AH behavior, he produced results even in his sleep. In my opinion he was like what teammates say about michael jordan, he wanted it so bad he didnt care if he was an asshole about it. It sounds great in sports but in an office job, it doesnt sound as great. He would tell my manager how to do his job. I could tell my manager hated the guy too but just was complacent with him.One time I worked with him on something major. I could tell he hated my work ethic. Im not saying I was perfect but I felt like I was getting a hand on the work at that point. When I was done, my manager decides to have a 1:1 to discuss my work with him and I basically get a list of what I could've done better. I accepted it and tried to improve on it. But guess what was in my next review session when I got underperforming, all the shit that the higher level engineer had said about me. I accepted some that I felt I could've done better but tried fighting the ones I felt were unfair. One that I remember the most was that there was a merge I did that had too many commits. I admit that it did have more commits but it was because the change we worked on had like 20 different iterations because everytime I wrote one change in, it broke something unexpected so it was a lot of trial and error. That one merge was an outlier from all my other work but it was used against me for the following year. I got Pipd shortly after.I saw the writing on the wall but I gave the company 110% and then I got fired early this year, a year after I worked with that guy. It definetley was the beginning of the end when that one higher level engineer. I dont regret it I tried respecting my work life balance and I knew early on the job wasnt for me.",

You say he is emphasizing your “poor work”, is your work actually poor? Did you get comments from senior engineers before you started coding? It sucks that you are getting singled out, but you might be working on particularly sensitive or critical stuff and that might justify a much stricter review process.2. If you think it’s unjustified then you could try and have a 1:1 chat with the person in private and try to figure out what the problem is. You should not assume malice, they might be very busy. If you made an RFC previously, you should be ready to say you solicited feedback early and these concerns never came up, and that you’re finding it difficult to make progress at the moment because this late feedback is asking for major overhauls. You’re hopefully looking for them to back down, or for compromise, and to figure out how to avoid this problem in future. I would also think carefully about what this person is likely to respond positively to if you want a positive outcome, much depends on the individual here.3. If they are being really obnoxious and unhelpful, you could always just tell your manager, and possibly start disregarding the more persnickety comments. You should be very sure though that you’re delivering good quality work and management have your back. This is difficult if you don’t have rank though.Other than that, there’s not much else you can do.",

You were doing senior-level work for years, mentoring people, doing system design and architecture - that's what matters, not some arbitrary title that got screwed up by bad management and weird rubrics.The job market is brutal right now and you're getting filtered out because of title inflation, not because you lack the skills. If you were the longest-tenured engineer doing senior work but got stuck with \"Engineer I\" because of a broken system, then putting \"Senior Backend Engineer\" reflects what you actually did, not what some dysfunctional HR system labeled you.

Sure - after ten minutes of inactivity it would save changes and close. But, one of the managers totally screwed up their edits and those changes were saved.So I was asked if I could prompt user to see if they wanted changes saved or not, before auto-closing due to inactivity. I pointed out that that would defeat the entire purpose of automatically closing it because, you know, *they’d walked away from it*. So I was told to auto close it *without* saving - except next I was told that on the first business day of the month, some of the managers entered data and would sometimes have it opened but inactive for more than ten minutes while they were working on it, and one had just lost their desired changes. So could I have it auto-close after ten minutes of inactivity, without saving, unless it was the first business day of the month, in which case I should auto-close but save it first?An. Excel. Workbook. I had actual real work to do. I did it - I also got told I was being “difficult” when I asked if the managers could just be told to *close the damned workbook when they were done using it*.",

We also don't have many hard deadlines unless we need to meet new legal standards. This means there's no pressure when it comes to using our (rather generous) PTO and that time actually gets deducted from our expected work output. I literally never work more than 40hrs per week unless I choose to crunch something for my own peace of mind. I only go to the office two days a week.If you're willing to take a pay cut, I'd look for smaller companies like this. The salary isn't super competitive, but the rest of our benefits are great, the culture is super relaxed, and the WLB is on point.Granted, this is only my second job, and it's my first job in tech.

And this was at Target, not some tiny startup!But after that I got really interesting, researchy work, lots of space to learn (I was building a new supply chain optimization system, but I didn't have any operations research background starting out!) and a ton of flexibility, scope and autonomy. I know lots of teams that have much \"harder\" interviews but then the actual role turns into just doing dull, bite-sized tickets assigned by somebody else.So my only conclusion is that a team's hiring practices are, at most, a relatively weak signal about the team culture and the nature of the work.I would not try to draw any strong conclusions from your hiring experience. Instead, I'd try talking to the hiring manager, talking to somebody on the team and asking questions to understand the day-to-day experience as well as the broader context around the team and the work. This isn't full-proof—I just left a miserable role at a company despite talking to multiple past coworkers who seemed happy there—but, with social questions, *nothing* is fool-proof. So I just try to get the best impression I can, but also remember that all sorts of things can happen.",

Most jobs were either fully onsite or hybrid, you were required to relocate to wherever the company HQ was. There were *some* remote jobs, but nowhere near the amount we saw in 2020-2023.Now the market is going back to normal. This isn't the \"new\" glass ceiling, this is how its always been and always will be.There's plenty of jobs in Atlanta though... I used to work in a medium sized city in the Midwest, much smaller than Atlanta, and there were tons of opportunities for SWE out there. The opportunities weren't super sexy, or super high paying, but they were decent jobs. I'd be shocked if you've managed to apply to every company in all of the Atlanta metro area. Maybe your search strategy is where you're going wrong, you shouldn't be running out of companies.",

Honestly feels like good luck to live in such a small metro with relatively boring tech companies. I stood out.It may require being patient and persistent, but local roles felt so much better in terms of getting interviews. There just aren't as many to go around, which is stressful. But I focused just on a few, tailored everything, worked through contacts at local tech meetups... The options and network were so much better than shotgunning my resume across the country.Maybe my advice is hit up some meetups, find the really local job boards, startup incubator spaces, etc, and try to meet people in person wherever possible. Lean into the benefits of being in a city not flooded by big tech layoffs. If you make a good enough impression you can get your foot in the door before the company even posts the job. Heck you can convince people to create a job for you, if you seem worth it. That's the stuff you can't do remotely and is much harder to do in a major tech hub.",

You may be too young to remember war, but we've done it, and we'll likely do it again, so I sort of agree with your Dad: not worth the risk.You might be a little bit better than my friends (mostly ground pounders or support during the Iraq surge), but even \"smart\" veterans who end up at fancy language schools and in the drone program have incredibly high rates of PTSD and all sorts of other problems.If it's the absolute last option, and you get a good MOS, there are clear benefits: like a great social welfare program for veterans that includes healthcare and other entitlements, and maybe some skills in a specialized area that can apply to cyber security. That said, the military is no jobs program, when in you exist to serve, and that service is a sacrifice. If you want to fight, if you want to serve, do it, otherwise, you could easily end up worse off where you are today, in ways that will be difficult for you to imagine right now.Therefore, you need to try harder to make what you have now work. Expand your job search, hit pavement, look for roles outside of CS, be willing to move. You gotta hustle, and one way or another that's going to require a bunch more work that you are currently doing. Good luck!",

As an institution, they don't really act with the best interests of their employees at heart. You give up a lot of your freedom and rights when you enlist.

If you do it solely for your own career and everyone/thing comes second, life will suck for others, and as I've seen personally, men will die. If you do that, fuck you.2. There's lots of roles related to this field, particularly in the AF. Look into those.3. If you do it, and serve honorably, you will not regret it. Of all the good, the bad, and the ugly, and there was a lot of ugly, it's the greatest point of pride in my life and I'm thankful every day that I did it. I gained so much, both materially and non-material. 4. Talk to actual vets/actives about it. Do NOT listen to anyone here who did not serve. My DMs are open. I was USMC infantry, but I have a lot of connections across fields and branches.5. It WILL help you in the job market. Good vets that get and into stem out have a great reputation of working hard, thinking critically, and being able to work under pressure. I was asked a lot in interviews about how my prior service related to my think critically and problem solve, as well as leadership roles.

I know somebody who spent 2 months at work before he was given anything to do aside from trainings. That was partially because it was a job at a bank and there was a lot of red tape, but also...just a super awful onboarding process.I just started a job recently, and my onboarding was kind of a mess too. HR person was on PTO and nobody picked up the slack. My manager eventually messaged me halfway through the day, but I had next-to-no guidance my first week. I just sorted my system out and noodled around company docs. Fortunately it's a remote position, so I just got to hang out and play videogames in the dead space. Not as much fun to do nothing all day when it's onsite. Sorry homie.It sounds like you're doing the best you can. I'd ping your manager again just to check in and see where things are at, but not in a *needy* way. Just ask if there's anything you should be doing while you wait on the onboarding stuff, but I'd try to write the message in such a way that you are not concerned/bothered by it. Not a great move to annoy your manager on your first week, but it is still their job to...do something. Or at least let you know that this is how onboarding always goes.> he called me and we had a 3 min team chat where he said he would assign me an onboarding guideThis is the one thing that hits me weird. Was it *actually* 3 minutes? Not even 10? That's an alarmingly short intro call. If that's the case, I'd be prepared for him to be a very dont-give-a-fuck sort of manager. Ideally, that means your work life is chill, and not that everything is a scramble and you look bad because your manager doesn't do their side and throws you under the bus after the fact.I wouldn't sweat it yet, but there are a ton of managers out there who...need to be managed.",

That time I’m there was very little emotion. The next team I worked on, I spent 6 years going from a mid-level to and lead. Over 4 years I got to build out an awesome team. Not just developers, but a few BAs, a PM, and a QA team. This was for two huge projects. Nothing makes people close like time in the trenches. We all became great friends. After the second project launched, I needed a change of scenery and a great remote opportunity opened up that would allow me to move home. Resigning from that team was the hardest decision I ever made. Some of those developers couldn’t hardly write OOP code when they started with me and by the time I left, we were a well oiled machine. Not a day goes buy 2 years later that I don’t think about them.The last two years I had the chance to build a software dev practice from near scratch. It has been a great experience, and some of the folks I’m really going to miss when I leave in about two weeks. This time I knew it was the right decision to leave (bad culture fit, lost a big contract for reasons the dev team had no control over, inconsistent / lack of full time adjacent support, and never ending dangling of carrots that always vanished when they were to materialize). Am I going to miss my team? For sure. Some have become friends like my last team. But the reality is that for them to grow as well, I need to move on. They rely way too much on me and I failed to get them to fly on their own because of pressure from the top to deliver now now now. My new role is a director of software engineering, so it’s going to be a new experience for me… but I will always appreciate the folks I work with daily. I don’t think leaving good people is ever easy. It’s great when you can challenge each other just the right way, attack problems with some out of the box solutions, and just being nerds together in general. At the end of the day though, you have to worry about your and your career progression. You don’t want to be the guy/gal that sits for 10 years on a project and never gets to grow or even totally stagnates. It’s human to care, but at the same time be happy for what you all accomplished together and leave on a high note.",

You just need to showcase it properly and target companies that don't filter purely on pedigree. Experience and interview prep do matter. But so does clarity about what you actually want. Do you want to go deep into systems? Build user-facing products? Work on small teams or at scale?Pigment self discovery helped me figure out what kind of engineering I'm wired for when I was stuck between chasing prestige versus finding purpose. It's not about \"what's next\" generically, but what growth path actually fits you. You're just at the point where the next move is less about proving you're smart and more about figuring out where that fits. Keep building, but don't forget to think about what kind of engineer you're trying to become.",

A lot of successful engineers don't start at FAANG, and plenty of people who do start there end up leaving for smaller companies anyway.You're in a pretty solid position. Full stack experience at a small company where you're leading features? That's valuable real-world experience that beats a lot of what new grads get at big companies where they might spend 6 months just learning internal tools.For getting into big tech eventually, it really does come down to two main things: 1) having solid fundamentals, and 2) being able to communicate your experience well in interviews. Your portfolio projects + the feature leadership experience you mentioned gives you good stories to tell.Don't bother with a masters unless you want to go into research or very specialized areas. The time you'd spend in school could be better used gaining more experience and prepping for interviews.Practical next steps: Start doing leetcode regularly (like 15-30 min daily), practice explaining your projects clearly, and start applying to mid-size companies as stepping stones. Companies like Shopify, Slack, Stripe etc often have good engineering cultures and pay well but aren't as competitive as the absolute top tier.For the behavioral side of interviews - this is where a lot of engineers struggle. You need to get good at telling stories about your work using frameworks like STAR. That's actually why I built Score My Interview, because so many talented engineers miss out on opportunities just because they can't evaluate and communicate their impact clearly.The comparison thing is tough but remember - social media shows highlight reels, not reality. Focus on your own growth trajectory instead of comparing timelines with others.",

The old guys I know in this business, do not give a shit were you used to work. They barely care where they worked. And no one outside this business cares who you work for. Now, how do you advance your career. Try to stick it out for two years in your job (but it's okay to bail if a better opportunity comes along...becoming the CTO of your buddy's start up is not a better opportunity), then move on to the job, work another couple of years, three if you like it. Then move on. Every time you change jobs, you will get more money. More importantly, you will increase your breadth of experience. You'll be exposed to more approaches to development. Which will make you better able to advocate for one approach over another. It will also help you understand what really matters vs. what's just noise.Eventually, you'll want to start increasing your time in jobs just to show you're not a job hopper. However, you wil reach a point where it really doesn't matter. My default advice is keep your linkedIn profile up to date, turn on the quiet open to work flag, and respond to every recruiter that isn't a clear scam, even if it's to say, \"thanks, but this isn't the right opportunity for me\". My average is about three years.You do this for a while, and big tech companies will start to notice you. They may not be FAANG, but the pay is good.The most important thing to remember is that your career is a business. The companies you work for will let you go the minute you stop making financial sense. You're allowed to make the same decision about your employer.",

Most companies wouldn't even let a junior dev talk to clients without supervision, let alone own the entire relationship.I've seen this pattern before. Companies dump everything on whoever's willing to take it, especially if you came from QA and they think you \"understand the business better.\" But just because you CAN do all this doesn't mean you should.You're not crazy. This is definitely too much for a junior role. Either push back and ask for support, or start looking elsewhere.

From different perspectives. https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3474623This talks bout how employers are more likely to hire people with a genuine interest in the the topic. Particularly in CS this is true because you’re probably getting interviewed by people in their 30s/40s who went to this degree purely for passion. The rise of the job market was an upside from the desired major. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335277092_Exploring_factors_influencing_the_continued_interest_in_a_computer_science_majorWhite paper researching the success predictors in career an education related to CS, passion was among the most important. It’s also definitely a sentiment on a lot subreddits and in person anecdotally. I have a couple friends struggling to find jobs, but they all became programmers after a career of passion or major of passion. All the folks who majored in CS because they wanted to make games or loved coding are fine. Some had to make career pivots (leaving games industry mostly cause that market is toxic as hell). The major is no longer the automagical 6 figure pumping major it was 10 years ago, but those who love the craft are finding jobs. Being on forums or discords about coding, going to hackathons, etc. I also should note I think this is a bad thing and always has been. Teams that require you to be really into it are usually toxic workaholics and creat a poor environment for long term retention. But now every job wants that and it’s leading to overworked and burnt out high performers and disenfranchised adequate performers.",

Schedule 30 minute meetings with the people in your team and learn about them. What was their journey? What is there specific role in the grand equation? What about your manager? What’s their perspective of what the team does? Are there specific skills in tech you want to learn more about?

Are you getting past the resume screening at least? Are you getting recruiter phone calls and moving to the technical interviews? 2. Are you open to interviewing outside of Vancouver, maybe even in the US? 3. Curious how you’re fitting all of that experience on a resume.

The good news is that your background is genuinely impressive and you're not starting from zero like most new grads.Stop delaying graduation - you're essentially in limbo right now and employers can sense that uncertainty. Graduate in August and commit fully to the job search, but expand your geographic scope beyond Vancouver. Toronto, the US, or even remote opportunities could open doors that Vancouver simply can't right now. The trades and military options aren't bad backup plans, but don't abandon tech when you're this close to breaking through. Get your resume professionally reviewed, practice your interview skills extensively, and consider contract or startup roles that might be more willing to take a chance on someone with your background.I'm on the team that made [interview AI](http://interviews.chat), and I've seen how much difference it makes when people can practice handling tough interview questions and get real-time feedback on their responses - it might help you convert those eventual interviews into offers.",

You'll be part of the unlucky cohort of people competing for junior positions with no experience. There's a reason people go back to school. Mostly to pivot and be eligible for new grad/student recruiting pipelines again. Your best bet is to continue doing internships and get a return offer. They are unfortunately the only pipeline to get into most reputable companies.If you hit the button you'll likely find yourself back in school doing a masters in a few months.",

The AI does it at $3/task.One day, we hear about another CEO who wants to “streamline” and cut junior roles, the next day, we are told to “stop panicking”, all while every junior I know is 200 applications deep with a few phone calls to show for it.I’m not denying that tech hasn’t been bad before, but for the first time ever, this doesn’t feel cyclical. It doesn’t feel like we gotta just “hold on until the market stabilizes”, it truly feels like there IS a replacement, there IS genuinely a reason to not hire juniors. Let’s say juniors do break into the market. It takes 2-3 years to move from entry level roles to mid level roles for most people. Where will AI be in 2-3 years? Even if we get in to the disappearing junior roles, I feel like it’s going to be the same uphill battle moving forward, AI won’t stop advancing unless we hit a wall. With each step up the AI ladder, the market is flooded with more and more people who can all work down (think seniors applying to mid level roles), so the people at the bottom (us) will be FUCKED.This is all just my opinion based on what I’ve seen though, maybe there’s something I’m not seeing.

Employers are expecting devs to be fully knowledgeable of their tools and languages, but also to use AI to quadruple their output. Except, when you begin learning this stuff in 2025, it’s very difficult to force yourself not to use AI every time you get stuck, especially when your employer is expecting you to and their deadlines reflect that.Truly understanding programming comes from writing your own code from scratch, running into problems, and spending hours and hours nearly ripping your hair out trying to fix it. You can use AI to help understand small bugs or minor new technologies, but there is no substitute for building that foundation the hard way.**What should you do?** Keep using AI to get your intern work done, you’re already in and you’re doing your job. On the side, start really learning how to program. Since you’re already using JS, and it sounds like you’re going the web dev route so far, I recommend doing [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths). Start with foundations, then do the JS course. No use of AI allowed, at all. When you get stuck, you have to research on good ol’ google. After you complete even just the first project all on your own, you’ll feel so much more knowledgeable. Don’t drop the ball, make a weekly schedule and complete the entire course. Edit: As you learn more via your individual learning and projects, start incorporating this knowledge into your intern work. Start writing your own code as much as possible, lean less and less on the AI.Once you’ve done that, you’ll probably have enough understanding to know what you need /want to work on next, be it PHP or something else. To touch on your comment about REST APIs, this isn’t a language, more just a concept that you can get a general understanding of in just a couple days or weeks. The more you work with them the more you’ll understand. Again, do real research on this, take notes, and then experiment with making API calls in a personal project",

I have metrics to back up most of my claims, and I write around 3 paragraphs for each section pointing to concrete details backing up my justification for the scores I've given myself.Every year my boss has agreed with my scores for each category or rated me higher than I rated myself.You need to make it easy for the person doing your review to justify giving you the score. The less they need to critically think about the grading criteria the better in my opinion. You need to advocate for yourself, in all facets of life, because it is very unlikely that others will do it for you.If you haven't done so, start keeping track of accomplishments throughout the year which you can point to as justifications for your rating. Even if they're small.I've even at times flat out said in my comments that I perhaps don't fully deserve the rating of 5, but since I felt I was on the cusp, I gave myself the nod because I need to advocate for myself. Be assertive but fair.Not all of this may apply to you if you truly feel that you are just middle of the road average, but you should still be your own best advocate.",

I would argue one of the big problems in this industry is people trying to overuse design patterns.

You are very junior.>That being said, I wanna still grow towards a more senior role, like a senior SWE or software architectSenior is hard position that is still a long ways off for you. A very fast promotion to senior would be 5 years. I've seen many people that were very good in their role take 10+ years to make Senior. I wouldn't worry that much about it. Keep working hard and keep asking your manager for bigger projects.Also, enjoy this time because eventually you are going to miss it. Your job is low stress, nobody is really counting on you for anything, and you have free time. This will not last forever, you will have deadlines, many of them will be unreasonable. You will be asked to make hard decisions and then people will bitch and complain about it you for years afterwards when it doesn't work out. People will want things from you. Nonstop. You will have meetings, hours of them every day. Even outside of meetings people will want things from you. I literally have to go hide in a phone booth at the office to go heads down because people are always coming up to my desk to ask me things.Source: was Senior at Amazon and was also Staff at Google.",

You're trying to do everything at once and that's why you're advancing slow. Pick one thing and go deep for like 2-3 months. I'd suggest focusing on system design first since that's what'll get you to senior architect roles fastest.But something most people miss is that you can actually grow within your current crappy role. Those support tickets? Start asking why they're happening. Is it bad error handling? Poor user experience? Scaling issues? Then propose solutions during team meetings. Even if they don't implement them, you're thinking like a senior engineer.Document everything you fix and the impact. \"Fixed authentication bug that was affecting 15% of users\" sounds way better than \"did support tickets\" on your resume.Also, start a side project that mirrors what you wish you were doing at work. Build something that scales, implement proper architecture, use modern patterns. This gives you real talking points in interviews.The leetcode grind is overrated unless you're targeting FAANG. Focus on building stuff and understanding systems.One more thing. Networking matters more than people think. We see this all the time at Metana with our bootcamp grads. The ones who connect with other developers, join communities, contribute to open source... they level up way faster than the ones just grinding tutorials alone.You've got this, just need to be more strategic about where you spend that energy. Stop trying to learn everything and start building something real:)Your current job sucks but it's temporary. Use it as a stepping stone while you build the portfolio that gets you out.",

Unfortunately your company is being grimey so you have probably have to work on personal project. Start with a hello world and implement your own idea and apply what you know.

Having regular production incidents implies you have a fragile product. That's a problem. It's not sustainable.That's one of the main things I focus on during the reverse-interview process. I really dig deep into on call rotations, how frequent calls are, when the last incident was, what the response was during that last incident, etc.Unless I'm unemployed and desperate, I will not join a company that says they get after hours calls more than a few times ***a year***. Let alone per week. The type of company you join is very much in your control.There is a bit of a differentiation between after-hours calls and business-hours calls though. During business hours there's all sorts of support issues to work through, but I'd never really describe them as all hands on deck critical production incidents. Either way, during business hours I'm OK with incidents. That's stuff I work through as a normal part of my job. It's the after hours prod fires that I'm not OK with.Here's my anecdotes for after-hours on call incidents:Company 1: I was called once in my 3.5 years here. The team as a whole was called a couple times I think. There weren't any during business-hours support fires either.Company 2: Across 5 years, there was a single after-hours prod fire I had to deal with. There were some small fires during business hours, but nothing major. Even if we didn't get them fixed during business hours, we'd just wait until the next day to fix it, so it was a very casual business as usual.Company 3: Across 2.5 years, 0 after hours calls. This company was a bit of a shit show, so they had a lot of small fires during business hours, but again nothing was ever serious enough that it couldn't wait until tomorrow morning. We were not working after 5pm.Company 4: Only been here a year, but so far 0 after hours calls.",

Anyone that remembers being locked into Microsoft tooling and an ecosystem that relied on someone making \"Windows equivalents\" will happily embrace someone with knowledge outside of their bubble. .NET is full of people absolutely crippled by imposter syndrome, so having someone from a Python background is an opportunity to learn.If you can work with C# and have a vague understanding of .NET, how it works, what the language can do, and the primary patterns you'll see (e.g. Builder, Repository, maybe some ORM knowledge), you'll be fine.",

If you're applying to a .NET position, flesh out your .NET portion so people can see you have the depth of experience they need. If applying to a Python position, emphasize your Python experience. Asking about *why* you have to do that is spitting in the wind. You only have so much space for your resume, so why waste some of it on fleshing out skills that aren't relevant to the job you are applying for? If you do that, peopel are going to want to know *why* there isn't more verbiage that is *directly applicable* to the position. And that's why you get these questions.Why don't people ask about TypeScript? Probably because it's the realm of front-end app development. It's a different ball game entirely from the types of jobs that want .NET or Python.There is no industry rivalry between languages. Companies choose the language that best meets their needs and in-house experience. Only individuals play the \"your language sucks\" game, and for the most part that shit dies out before they hit their 30's. The ones that don't let go of it end up being insufferable to work with, and walking examples for why soft skills matter.",

If you are referring to emergencies, that's just part of normal team responsibilities. It doesn't matter what your job is, you're responsible for the stuff you throw out into the world. If your users use your service on weekends that means you will work weekends when things go wrong. The problem is the frequency in which those incidents are occurring.I'm also in banking and we avoid your issues by :1. Doing a lot of testing - development is 4 weeks behind prod.2. Have a fallback for when prod breaks - We have a \"disaster recovery\" environment that is 1 version behind and tier 1 support can activate it at the push of a button. \\#2 turns nearly any emergency into a non-emergency, the worst that will happen is a 10 minute call with support. The problem is that your team isn't putting in the necessary work to ensure that emergencies don't happen and there are no mitigation strategies for when they inevitably do occur.Your team has a lot of bad practices/habits and unless your team is willing to recognize the problem, it's only going to get worse. Try bringing it up to leadership, but if nothing changes this is the kind of thing that would make me leave. I'm OK with toughing out a problem I know we're working towards solving within a reasonable time frame. But there doesn't seem to be any end in sight for you.",

There is a very strong chance that the exact role has not been open for eight months and that the company has simply been hiring engineers with a similar profile for an extended period of time. In recruiting this is often referred to as a \"pipeline\" posting or approach. I've shared some thoughts below regarding the information that you brought up in your post. \\----**Timeline & Cooling Off Periods:** Regarding your viability, six months is a relatively short 'cooling off' period and most companies prefer to revisit after 12 months. This is generally a better timeline for a candidate building meaningful skills/experience/knowledge. **Interview Process:** Having an initial 1-2 part technical screening and 4-5 part onsite (six total) is standard, and your seventh interview round being a repeat round indicates that you did show some potential but likely failed in one key element (coding, design, or modeling). Sometimes this can result in a down-level, but that might have been the reason for the follow-up, to confirm if they should reject or down-level. **Recommended Approach:**Rather than trying to frame things as \"this position has been open for very long and you should reconsider me\" I would simply check in and see if they have any new opportunities that you can be considered for, and perhaps share some of the interesting work that you have been doing over the past six months that might make you more qualified. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a periodic check-in, and hiring volume can often change things (more hiring is better for candidates, less hiring often leads to a more challenging 'bar' for talent). I would still expect that it could be another 4-6 months before they reconsider you, though.",

That means you're actually doing fine. Companies don't keep people around for a year if they're truly not cutting it. But I get it, you want to level up and feel more confident.We see this pattern all the time at Metana with developers who feel stuck. The breakthrough usually comes when they start building real projects and connecting with other devs who share similar struggles and wins.Your current role is actually perfect for learning fundamentals properly. Enterprise environments teach you things bootcamps and tutorials never do, like working with legacy code, understanding business constraints, collaborating with teams.One year in is still super early. Give yourself some credit and keep pushing forward. The fact that you're self-aware enough to ask this question tells me you're gonna be just fine.You got this man, just gotta be patient with the process :)",

There is a reason you are a junior dev and not a senior dev.That being said a few words of advice from someone who's been doing this for 11 years. 1. The fact that you can acknowledge this at all and care about it puts you ahead of the game. This was all of us at one point, myself included. I basically lied to get my first job because I was so desperate and then I had to deliver. What did I do? I wasn't the smartest person in the room but I was willing to work more than anyone around me. I worked nights and weekends, not every one but when I had the time, I was working all the time. You don't have to do this forever, but I would recommend this to any dev new on the job. Absolve yourself of the idea of \"work life balance\", cause if you wanna be good and you aren't naturally gifted, its not gunna happen. Don't get me wrong, I still played hard on the weekends when I had time, but most likely, you are young and have very little responsibilities and you need to take advantage of that. Yourself in 10 years will be on your knees thanking you.2. I had a great professor in college that told me something I never forgot. \"A great developer has read for 15 minutes for every line of code he writes\". You need to read. Read everything, read all the docs of all the tools you're using, know them front and back. Read books, clean code, clean architecture (these are terrible books btw but you need to know them), gang of four, anything you can get your hands on about programming, read it and know it.3. You need to be kinder to yourself. Believing that you can do it is 90% of the game. Instill some fight into your spirit and dig in. No one is going to advocate for you like you can advocate for yourself. Positive affirmations, whatever it takes, you have to believe you are capable. If this shit was easy, literally everyone and there mom would do it. There is a reason it demands a premium in pay. I believe in you, you can do this, its gunna take some work, but you have an opportunity here to build a career that people would kill for. Make the most of it!",

That's not junior dev stuff, that's some architecture level thinking. Your team lead probably just wants you to build confidence before throwing you into the deep end, not because you suck.The competition anxiety is real tho. When I was building startups, I'd see people constantly worried about being replaced by someone cheaper/smarter/faster. But something Ive learned is that average devs who can communicate well and understand business problems are actually gold.About the PM pivot tho, honestly, it could work. You already have dev background which most PMs lack. You understand technical constraints, can talk to engineers without sounding clueless, and you've got that project leadership experience.But before you jump ship completely, maybe try focusing on becoming a technically aware PM rather than abandoning code entirely. At Metana, we see tons of people who started as \"average\" developers but found their niche by combining technical skills with other strengthsAlso don't let imposter syndrome make you quit something you might actually be decent at. Maybe you're not the next senior engineer, but you could be a damn good technical PM who actually gets how software works.Give yourself more time to figure out what clicks for you before making the full pivot :)",

LinkedIn is a nightmare, recruiters are NPCs, online application forms are ridiculous. ZipRecruiter, Indeed and applying directly at company sites were most effective. Made it to final rounds 3 times. Accepted an offer from a midsize company whose interview process included paid consulting on a project that turned into a full time offer. Fully remote and more pay than previous role.If you have skills and experience there’s definitely something for you out there.

Fully remote for mid and senior level is great because you don’t need as much hand holding as you will early on. Take the more established, higher paying startup as the first job. Also, moving away from friends and family is hard but the great thing about your hometown is that it will always be there. Go have a new experience in a cool city, learn and if you hate it, look for a remote job in 2 years and move back. as you get older, it gets much much harder to move away so doing it while you’re young and unattached from major responsibility is the perfect time.",

The wrong ones can also wreak havoc on your mental health and personal life. Is the big company a tech company, one that sells software? Does it have name brand recognition? Do they have modern technologies? You have to consider your career trajectory, and how this impacts you in the long-term.",

        "body": "It's a trade off. The start up will be more stressful, and you will be working more so less free time. But you will probably be learning a lot, which is an investment for the future. It's a bonus if you're interested in what they're developing. Likely a more casual work environment with sharp people. Job security highly dependent on how successful the company is.Working at a big company means more job security, way better benefits, 401k, and better company name recognition on your resume. You will have to deal with bureaucracy for basically everything. You can probably clock in your 8-9 hours per day and not worry much outside of work. Probably have lots of downtime as you work there longer. Clearer path to promotions and career trajectory. You can be successful if you just follow the rules and do your work as expected.Some questions you can ask yourself are - how big is the salary gap between the two, including benefits? Will you have to be an independent contractor at the startup for tax purposes? What is your personal situation like (i.e. if you lose the job, will your family go hungry)? What are your career goals? I was presented with the same situation when I graduated. I worked one day at the startup and ended up quitting in favor of a government job (they gave me the offer the same day). After 8 years in government now, 32 years old, I'm glad that I took the path I chose. I built my pension to over $100k, put a downpay on a house for my mom, have seniority on my team, basically impossible to get fired. I think the pragmatic decision would be to take the startup job, stay and learn for 1-3 years, then you can explore options after that with the skills you built. You're probably the most motivated out of college with the least responsibilities, so you'd be able to afford working extra hours.",

It sounds to me like he’s just using the tool to give himself enough back-and-forth that the concept sticks, so that he’ll eventually be able to do it on his own. Sounds reasonable to me, if that’s your learning style",

Or is your objective to learn the concepts?So, I find that through this repetition of typing or just thinking about my approach and refactoring, communicating it back to AI and getting a response - it really builds how thoroughly I understand the algorithm or how a DS is applied to certain types of problemsThe objective i guess is to understand the dsa & concepts well enough through rando LC problems - and so that on the spot given a rando question - that as i read it back to myself i can recognize what i have to do faster, and as i code the solution out i can communicate to the interviewer with more command of what i'm doingSo yeah tldr - yes to get better at interviews, but not to get better at tossing ideas back and forth in interviews with the interviewer and eventually navigating to the solutionE.g. eventually I hope to get good enough at telling AI \"this is my approach\", or tell it step by step what ill do, and then it straight up just replies \"yes that's the way to solve this\"",

There’s still maybe 2-3 meh filler courses that you’ll have to take, that might not be super relevant for ML Engineering roles but it’s not a big deal.You cannot beat the cost, and you’re getting lectures from some really great researchers in the field that are highly respected. Even being an online program, I’ve found some ways to get involved in research projects.To normies, Penn might look or sound better as it’s an ivy but in this field UT Austin is more respected.I’m not even done with the program yet but I think it has helped me get recruiters from FAANG/adjacent companies to reach out.As far as helping out your career, who knows. I am already kind of a ML Engineer at my company, but it’s a passion for me and I wanted to keep learning more. And I think it will help bolster my resume when applying for ML roles. I think for $10k it’s worth a try if you are interesting in possibly being an MLE",

But if you want to actually learn the material, I’d say it’s like 5-10 hours per week per course.

The fact that they already have customers lined up with 300-500k contracts is actually a really good sign.Your current situation sounds kinda stagnant tbh. Limited learning, backto back layoffs, product that isn't viable... even with job security till Q1/Q2 2026, that's not exactly inspiring. Plus being siloed into just applied AI work when you could be learning MLOps and data engineering, that's valuable stuff.The founding ML engineer role sounds legit too. CEO with previous founder experience, both him and CTO are seasoned with relevant background. That matters way more than people think.Also can you negotiate the equity up to 1% ? At pre seed that's not unreasonable for a founding engineerHonestly the fact that you're even considering it tells me you're probably already leaning towards the startup. Your gut is usually right about these things.One thing tho. Make sure you understand the vesting schedule and what happens to your equity if they don't raise that seed round. But overall this sounds like a solid bet if the team checks out :)",

Honestly, I have no preference. I'm just looking to get any big name on my resume to open doors and compensate for my no-name college. A big AI lab makes sense for my experience, but they're so competitive right now. I at least got an OA from Amazon (didn't advance, will retry in 6 months).>Learning wise do you want to go deeper into applied AI work or MLops work.

I frame it negatively because the current work isn't particularly deep - I'm not learning much.
