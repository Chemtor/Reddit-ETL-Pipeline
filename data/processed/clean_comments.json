Well, yeah, that's a solution that is pretty much guaranteed to cause a ton of DQ problems. As opposed to having the source system publish domain objects that are locked down with data contracts. * Data engineers build almost no quality-control tests, no unit testing, no reconciliation checks, no anomaly-detection, and no field transform audits to track changes over time. dbt and great expectations are generally poor tooling that only address a fraction of this. * Product managers, given zero push from engineering, leave out all considerations of data quality - no SLOs, no dashboards, no investment. Which means it falls 100% on the engineer's heads.It doesn't have to be that way. But data engineers need to be better informed about DQ and push hard for architectures, tools, and processes they need.",

Let's suppose they have to capture and use name and address data.The way in which they do so is perfect for them.A different line of business also needs name and address data, but for a different purpose. The way they do so is perfect for them.Marketing want a single customer view. Neither line of business collect the data in a form that allows comparison. You now have a data quality problem.The only way I have found to improve the data quality is to fix it at source. You do this by making the down stream data vital to the earnings of both lines of business. Customers get pissed off because, as far as they are concerned they are buying from company X. They couldn't give 2 hoots for the fact they bought product line A which is different from product line B. As customer retention is far easier than customer recruitment, anything that looses customers is very much frowned upon.",

One large org I used to work for had biweekly calls with representatives from each of our source systems and the warehouse team for that purpose. If a significant change is happening and you're the last to know about it, ask yourself who else knew ahead of time and how you can get in sync with pending changes moving forward.",

Any pipeline fixes is only on the ingestion and translation from 1st to second layer.(I know there is medallion architecture and other words to label this, but I've never actually seen it in practice called that)",

Before the project kickoff we all sit together, revise the solution architect proposal, discuss business logic, etc. On that pre-development meeting we have a dedicated QA person, DQ person, lead developer etc. After or during the meeting, me as an owner of the DQ step, have a chance to raise any concerns, ask questions, change some part of the solution and in the end plan the initial and continuous DQ check.

And no we cannot bring on help at this time. And no I cannot put new work on hold because I (the boss) cannot say no.\\- Everything is fine, your other team mates (who are work-a-holics) are meeting deadlines, why are you complaining.\\- A general lack of boundaries by your boss, management, or team mates to say it can wait til tomorrow for stuff that legitimately is not criticalI have some or all of the above at all of my jobs. When you have a boss who won't advocate for the team it really makes everything bad. At my one job (a 200 head count startup) I was getting calls from the CTO at 8 PM at night to ask about what filters we were using for our SMS notifications. Mind you, the SMS notification job ran at 3 PM. He could have just asked me the next morning in the office. The problem is once you give into this type of nonsense it is hard to get people to back off and respect your boundaries.I now have a job with a great boss that sets clear boundaries. Maybe once in 4 years have I had an emergency call while on PTO or during off hours. And in this case it was a legitimate emergency and I was given extra time off to compensate. Sometimes we still fall into the \"get it out the door we'll fix problems later\" cycle, but at least my current boss sets some sprints aside to eventually address these issues.tldr: sounds like your company has management problems and doesn't respect boundaries. Unfortunately you either have to deal with it or probably find somewhere else.",

But they're very easily configurable to become pay-as-you-go, and that generally offers significant savings in contrast to the traditional on-premise model. Particularly wrt licensing.Using a cloud provider also generally lets your org offload the personnel cost of some number of support staff (network engineers, helpdesk and operational staff, etc.) by way of using \"managed\" services in their stead -- functionality cloud providers provide on your behalf to assist in the routine work people would otherwise have to do (such as applying updates).",

We don't need computer power 24/7.As for the platforms, there's more setup and engineering work to get those going and patched constantly. I'm a heavy user of Databricks. I could put together something similar with Spark, but that would basically double my workload so we'd end up needing an extra engineer.Cloud lets us offload all the physical infrastructure and maintenance, and the associated labour. It lets us pay for the compute power we need, which is a lot less than a full server which would spend most of its time idle.",

The irony is that the cloud started as “freedom to run anywhere,” But now it’s just recentralization with APIs.At the end of the day, it’s a trade-off:Cloud = speed and simplicitySelf-hosting = control and efficiencyDifferent priorities, same goal shipping faster with less risk.",

Every technology you use is likely deeper than your current use of it. If you make a habit of digging a bit deeper each time you work on something you will build greater mastery than many of your colleagues - a lot of people just want to do the work and go home, after all.If you pursue that mastery you should easily find interesting work as a senior data engineer (meant as a description, not necessarily as a title). If you envision the staff+ roles in your future, then combine that deep technical mastery with a product mindset. What is the business rationale? What is the use case for that request? (this one will start to annoy people who are accustomed to always getting their requests fulfilled) How does this look when you imagine the results?

I was able to repair the damaged rows using the UAT db before anyone noticed, and then I created a generic script I could reuse every time that used a parameter to toggle between testing and update mode. But that wasn't enough for me, I wanted to fix the problem as close to the root cause as I could.As soon as I had time to dedicate to it, I set about cataloging the various kinds of data fuckups we were seeing from source and then updated our message queue processors to detect them, automatically correct them (generally it was timestamps that were out of order) and created a report for users to audit what data we corrected.",

I eventually fucked up due to exhaustion and bricked a whole ass section of ingestion2datamart pipelines that the marketing department was reliant on. The whole marketing campaign went to shit as we couldn't fix things in time. Everyone in biz was out for blood, and they didn't blame themselves, the poor financial decisions, the bad management, severe understaffing, the clueless PM/POs or anything else. They came for us personally, by name. They couldn't fire us cause they had no replacements, but they made work a living hell day in and day out, scandal, \"public\" shaming, scrapped our bonuses we already worked hella hard for and so on. That was the last straw, I started looking for better gigs. I cannot express in words the satisfaction I took from telling my manager I'm quitting on the spot in the 1:1 meeting he set up to \"discuss my failures and performance review\". After that kafkaesque experience, I can take pretty much anything now.",

I had no choice, because I was sitting in meeting after meeting, and all we ever did at the SLT level was complain about our problems. Always problems, never any solutions. And the source of all of our problems was always data. And so I just became fed up. I thought to myself, “fuck it, how hard can this be? AI can write SQL queries. Wtf are we doing here?” I grew up abroad and went to an international school. When I got to college in the USA I realized nobody ever bothered to teach me calculus in high school. And then I had to take calculus in college, and I was so far behind. I was failing the class. It was the same thing this time as it was that time. I said, “fuck it, how hard can this be?” I ate tons of adderal, chain-smoked cigarettes, chugged coffees, for months until I taught myself calculus and caught up to everyone else. Same thing this time, including all of the stimulants and adderal and coffee and nicotine. I just “no-lifed” AI & DE & automation for 9 months until I figured it out. I go into the same SLT meetings now, and I’m like a God :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:. The same people are there with the same problems they were complaining about 9 months ago. They’re bumbling around in the stone ages, and my team is landing rockets on the moon, metaphorically speaking. My experience? Almost anything you do that matters in life starts from the thought: “Fuck it, how hard can this be?”",

Documents in old school doc repos like Documentum are modeled with their document models, basically metadata. All kinds of data items and sets of items can be semantically modeled using OWL, RDF or whatever ontology language. Ldap is modeled in whole part containment models + keys. Object databases tend to use class diagram like models because they work well with UML, even if schema is optional or not a thing. The list goes on. everything is modelable to some degree.

Then pickup data modeling which is the hardest skill to obtain, many at senior levels fail that round. Sometimes, can only come with experience. Then onto distributed compute and storage. At last, python and cloud skills. Don't focus on tools, rather focus on the fundamental concepts, processes, standards and conventions are important for sustainable career.Once you have the above, those can be applied to any domain since your base is very strong.

Data is all about how the business runs.* The better you get it, the better you build.So yeah, domain knowledge helps, but the biggest edge is knowing *how data supports those processes*.

It's much simpler and safer than opening up firewall access.How we do it in each case really depends on several factors: size of updates, required frequency of updates. Many people overengineer this part, they buy one ETL tool and try to solve everything with it. Most executives think they need near-real time refreshes which would be needlessly expensive and complicated. Daily or semi-daily is more than enough for most applications. Some we refresh quarterly or annually.That's step one, transport.Step 2 is modeling and harmonizing the data into something usable. If it's for BI we'll map it all to a semantic business model.

        "body": "What you're describing is roughly how I'd define \"business intelligence\" (as in r/BusinessIntelligence). BI for short.Data engineering can be, and often should be, a part of doing BI, but doesn't strictly have to be (depending a bit how you define DE, which is a different controversial topic). And DE is also applicable to situations that aren't BI. And BI is more than just DE, as you've observed - choosing how to model the data uniformly, for example, isn't really DE (IMO), although many data engineers also know a lot about data modelling.A platform that does all this stuff is traditionally called a data warehouse - and these days, that can encompass things that aren't strictly a data warehouse in a micro sense, but could still be described as a data warehouse in a macro sense. (Very little terminology in this area has really super-precise definitions that everyone agrees on.)Normalisation is actually not necessarily the way to go at all, for data you want to use for analytic purposes (\"making sense of data\"). _De_normalisation is often more appropriate. This is a huge discussion area within data modelling: a great place to start IMO is the book \"The Data Warehouse Toolkit\" by Kimball and Ross. Get the 3rd edition. This is not just a random book rec, it's a really foundational text in this field, covering \"dimensional data modelling\" aka \"star schemas\" Not everyone agrees with it but I don't think anyone should be critiquing it without having read it.In terms of tooling and platforms, you can build your own stack using tools (often open source) that each focus on one smaller thing, doing it well; or there are big enterprise offerings that aim to provide everything you need in one package. Databricks and MS Fabric are two of those that get discussed quite a lot.We settled on MS Fabric for my org (mainly my choice) and it's been a huge success for us. Though this is an unpopular opinion to have in this sub. It handles data ingestion from all our business systems, and everything that needs to happen thereafter through to Power BI reports.",

        "body": "Analytics consulting firm for 10 years here.I've seen many many companies and very few ever get there.Trends I've seen:* Product-led companies, think SaaS (B2B and B2C), have been thinking about their data architecture since day 1 and are more likely to mature this effort faster and the most likely to get there. And it is because most of their business systems are built by software engineers. * Sometimes they mature and separate the marketing/acquisition teams from the product teams and that is usually the death knell for centralizing product and marketing data.* That leads me to marketing data. It is usually the lowest requirement on the totem pole and at the same time it is the most difficult to deal with - it needs the most modeling, it doesn't ever rationalize (compared to accounting data), and its systems and tactics change the fastest. Almost no one ever gets this properly centralized/joined/productionized.* Sales-led companies (particularly the ones that don't have a digital product) revolve around the CRM (as they should, it is the *sales* system in a *sales-led* organization). Parallel efforts to pull data out of the CRM and join with other business systems are competitive for dollars and brainpower of decision makers. It is easier to build out the functionality of the CRM (apps and integrations) than it is to build out the data practice in the org outside the CRM.* In ecommerce of the last 6-7 years there has been trend toward Customer Data Platform, which I see as directly competitive to data warehouse. I have never met a company that said \"we are soooo glad we invested in that CDP\". Most never get fully integrated. Once they do, they realize that in order to automate reactions to customer behaviors, they need to understand customer behaviors, which is what they would have gotten if they'd invested in analysis of the data rather than orchestration.",

On my team, we say there are two levels of QA a) technical QA (does our data pass tests, non-null, 1-to-1 relation, etc.) and b) business QA (does it make basic sense) It is my opinion that it is virtually impossible to have the same person do those two types of QA and definitely not simultaneously - it requires such a different viewpoint.Sooo... we have turned into building tests on the actual source systems - sometimes in APIs (cause we want to react to system owners and potentially take action in the systems) and sometimes in early model tests (think dbt tests) before any transformation.One even turned into a \"lead magnet\" tool. One of my engineers, a former Great Expectations eng, built this Google Analytics audit tool that checks like 100 common business-level QA \"data smells\" that say something is off in collection and to give alerts to the marketing team (often culprits of janky data collection):ga4addon.com/lp/free-google-analytics-audit",

The key to avoiding the 2nd type is having a standard way of ingestion which you know wont introduce errors. I realize thats pretty general, but that's because theres a lot of ways to do this.Now, the best way to avoid the 1st type is to use different data. If the data is so unreliable that you have to be doing work to clean it before it enters your warehouse, your best bet is to get it fixed further upstream. Data engineering is really the movement of data. As soon as you are modifying data because it is unreliable, you are introducing a 2nd aspect, modification of data.

Anomaly-detection could also help. * But there'll be outages as you're surprised & scrambling to solve the problem.With Data Contracts: * You have a *shared* contract for what the data being published needs to look like * The publisher can test data against it before they make any changes * You can compare data you receive to it, and if it fails, just open a ticket/whatever for the source team to fix their shit. * Life is good",

        "body": "I can only speak to my use case so I’ll describe that and why I like using mostly python based libraries. We build lots of econometric models to forecast supply and demand of various products. We ingest various datasets from a variety of public sources and paid vendors. The datasets are not very big for the most part and the ones that are very large we typically only need a subset for any given model run. So we essentially have 2 classes of data pipelines. (1) get external data and bring it internally and (2) our actual model which is technically just a pipeline of tons of transformations on internal data. I'll talk about (2) first. A single model run will load well over 100 internally stored datasets and run various transformations, statistical and matrix operations, overrides and adjustments etc to spit out a final forecast. This is all done in mostly pandas, but some polars and duckdb mixed in. The types and amount of operations we do (thousands of cross dataset interactions between hundreds of raw/intermediate datasets) could not easily be expressed in SQL, and in fact can’t even be easily expressed in polars operations. (See this thread for more info on why: https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/23938). We use frameworks similar to (but not) Apache Hamilton to organize the models into modular units of logic that can easily be swapped in and out and overrided for scenario analysis. These frameworks also provide caching so that we can run our pipelines incrementally and only rerun portions of the pipeline that have been affected by upstream changes (kinda like dbt).For (1) this is much more standard ETL and there’s likely lots of solutions that we could successfully use. But what we’ve landed on is pure python scripts. Pretty much one simple script per data source using mostly requests and whatever database api we storing to (s3, sql server, etc). All these jobs are scheduled in airflow (using only the most barebones airflow functionality. Just a fancy cron for some minor dependency management) which gives us good visibility into operational health just from their standard task views. It’s a super simple set up, with basically no dependencies on large overarching systems or vendors besides Python/airflow. Basically free to operate and easy for anyone with basic Python experience to maintain. And it’s consistent with all our other processes in terms of SDLC.",

        "body": "Well, a python data pipeline doesn't necessarily involve data frames. In fact, I usually avoid them: * transform tasks are just sitting on kubernetes, ECS, or lambda, waiting for SQS message that indicates a new file has landed on s3. * These tasks may normally just have 1-10 containers processing data that arrives every few minutes, but can easily auto-scale up, sometimes to 1000-2000 containers like when I decide to reprocess historical data. * They read the small s3 file and process one record at a time - with pretty much vanilla python. The output is typically these days a parquet file.I use vanilla python rather than data frames because it's easier to write tests for the transform functions, easier to collect metrics on how many rows failed any given transform and then write out those stats when the file is complete.Now, is SQL, along with CTEs better than this? Well, if your data is already in the database then it could be faster. And it is easier to learn SQL than how to program - so SQL-based transforms could be built by non-engineers. But it will be more expensive, it won't scale as well, it will be much harder to test, and it can easily become very difficult to read - especially if non-engineers are building it.So, I'd say there a few pros and a lot of cons.",

You don't control prioritization. Start logging off on weekends/nights unless you're explicitly on call to support a very important thing. It can usually wait until you're back in the office. Most deadlines are made up. Some aren't (Legal/Regulatory/Things that directly cost or make money), but most things aren't in those categories. Start missing those kinds of deadlines if they aren't tied to your prioritized work. If anyone asks why, that's what your careful notes and manager prioritization is for.You provide a valuable service. You probably know the company's data better than most other employees, and you have the domain knowledge to be able to make it useful for other people to extract value from it. Start acting like it.

Don't move tech unless you need it, and ClickHouse, as you mentioned, is pretty solid on search.",

Another option is to move to flexible pricing, or something like that, but problem is still there with original setup, somebody has to pay $75k/month if OP doesn't do something about costs.Question 2: There is conflicting data in my systems. How do I solve this?Your solution: 'It's engineering problem' is moving problem to somebody else. On top of that their data is in their systems where users enter data. To fix that you need to combine data from different systems and make corrections to data based on one system, that's basic use case for DWH. It isn't always possible to force people to enter correct data to systems or correct it afterwards.I'm currently doing a project where customers has about 100 salespeople and they make mistakes all the time when entering their trades to ERP. It's way too costly to fix their mistakes afterwards to ERP and you cannot train 100 people where rotation is constant to enter only correct info. So there is incorrect data and we fix it in layers above ERP. It isn't always realistic to except perfect data.In OP's case they don't have layers above their different ERP's so to fix data they would need those layers. Which is another project and it's going to cost.To summarize: In perfect world your solution is good. Fix pricing so only some of customers have to pay $75k/month. Then fix data at the source so there isn't conflicting data or errors in data.In this world where we have deadlines, budgets and projects need approvals we need to make quick fixes.",

You can then make changes to the query, add indexes etc, and compare the info. I used to get such a kick from reducing a humungous query taking 10 mins to run and doing millions of logical I/Os to e.g 3 seconds and 1% of the original logical I/O.As a rule, the quicker you can limit how much is being read and computed, the better a query will perform. So if i am joining millions of rows to millions of rows and THEN filtering or aggregating, that is going to require a lot more reads and memory. If i can filter the incoming data first or aggregate it, then do my joins, it will run much sweeter.",

I still have 4 chapters left.One advice: don't follow the book chapter order. I found it to be extremely useful to have a chat with Gemini 2.5 Pro, tell it my whole career, give my CV, and ask it to provide me a full detailed study plan. It provided me an excellent plan which has showed to be (1) easier to follow, (2) structured to allocate more time to topics I have no hands-on experience, and (3) identify key topics/concepts to focus considering both their weight on the exam and also my experience. What you have to keep in mind is that this exam is to level you up to management positions. It is not something that you will be able to leverage on if your aim is to have a hands-on future experience. Last but not least, don't forget that there are levels that depend on how many years of experience you have and that you also have to pass two other specialized exams.",

The only people who are happy are the ones who make their own happiness, whatever way they do it. Sometimes they change things sometimes they adapt, sometime they delude themselves into thinking things are ok. But “proper guidance” is, if not an illusion, an extremely rare bird. There’s no syllabus or logical progression of courses in the real world.Also leaving a 4 month long internship after three months sounds silly. Sorry if I’m misunderstanding. But it sounds like you’re learning a ton, and you’re almost done.Edit; I see there’s a potential two year commitment. IMO you should stick out the internship and take the job.

A data platform is understood as the set of services and tools necessary for data teams to be able to develop whatever is necessary to meet business requirements. Looking at the Databricks context, Terraform can be used to standardize cluster deployments, catalog creation, permissions and access to these catalogs, among other things. In the project I'm working on, there are hundreds of clusters, it's impossible to manage, track and make the necessary changes manually. When we use Terraform, these tasks are abstracted using Git. And there is also DABs (Databricks Asset Bundle) which is based on terraform to manage the databricks assets.",

It's not really about Terraform, but whatever platform you're working with. For me, working with Snowflake is easy enough so the Terraform is ok, trying to build complex things in AWS with all the right security and stuff with the right designs is a bit of a non-starter.I've found that the Terraform provider docs are generally pretty decent, and they can help highlight how things work. For instance, with the AWS stuff, the examples will show the dependencies and how they relate - you can't create component C without first creating A and B.",

If the scale of your customer's data is not huge (< 1bn records in a data set) using your cloud object store, whether s3, azure, or gcp, with mother duck as the query engine could be an excellent, low-cost choice. Since MotherDuck rolled out support for the DuckLake lake house format (and DuckDB recently introduced white support for iceberg tables), this might fulfill your catalog needs as well. If you really need a rich ontology of your data rather than a simple data catalog, you might want to check out some data virtualization options such as star dog. Ontologies come with a ton of additional complexity, and you will be more restricted in where you can store your data / what formats are supported, so I would recommend avoiding the ontology route unless it truly is a critical part of your business. If you need to support very large scale, I would look for options that have a serverless pricing model available and incorporating that into your own customer billing.

SSIS can handle on‑prem migrations, but you’ll write more glue and own the failure modes. If you stick with SSIS: use the SSIS Catalog (project model), environment variables, SQL Agent with retries/alerts, CDC components, bulk-load to staging then MERGE, and a metadata-driven pattern (BIML helps). I’ve used Informatica and Talend for this; we also used DreamFactory to expose legacy DBs as REST so apps stayed decoupled during cutover. Bottom line: you’re buying guardrails and support; if your team’s strong, SSIS works.",

Haven't had the time to stand something up to compare, but was tinkering with the thought of having duckdb-wasm pull and load a bunch of parquet files and then have the browser essentially operate as its own little dashboard. Not sure whether the speed and egress combo would beat more traditional means of serving up analytical data to users and whether it'd be some sort of governance hell, but it would be really interesting if I could just ship a bunch of tiny files to a browser and cut down on some of the service costs by making things run on the client side.

But then someone else will chuck a fit that although sounding unimportant the uplift costs of changing it or the impact it has on their job as linchpin to the business is too great, and so it has to continue indefinitely. Until… someone suggests another data warehouse to fix it all! And then cycle continues.All kinds of data warehousing and reporting is a nasty and costly business, frankly. The data sucks and is almost always demonstrably wrong. The tools fucking suck and cause endless friction. The technical debt is ginormous. And changing from any platform to another is both required as tools get acquired and stop being supported, while also being utterly impossible to change because they back thousands or tens of thousands of reports that have no migration path and that nobody could possibly understand.",

This is where the magic happens: you can apply labels to these pods: dag\\_id, task\\_id, and most importantly, customer\\_id. Then you just go into GCP's native billing, which can group costs by those labels, and you can see exactly how much a specific DAG for a specific customer is costing you, down to the penny But if a full migration to Kubernetes is too much, there's a \"good enough\" method. Instead of tracking dollars, track resource-hours. Airflow logs the duration of every task. If your workers are a standard instance size (e.g., n2-standard-4), you can build a simple cost model: cost = duration\\_in\\_hours \\* cost\\_per\\_hour\\_of\\_worker. It's not perfect - you'll miss network and disk I/O - but it'll get you 80% of the answer for 20% of the effort and help you find your most expensive tasks",

If your Airflow workers are not dynamic or they use the same pools of compute for all tasks, having a tagging system that trickles up into GCP/AWS billing is likely not possible. However you can often tag individual 'task runs' of ECS/Cloud Run instances and have those trickle into billing natively. In my experience you do lose out on additional aspects like networking out, which can be substantial, and if you can't find a way to associate that you'd need a top level overhead you append onto each task or maybe by runtime. Regarding non-efficient tasks, what does that mean? Airflows native monitoring shows the Task Duration and Landing times. Perhaps also look at sensor runtimes to subtract from overall runs as they're 'efficient'.My opinion would be that Airflow is a task orchestrator and attempting to patch in some sort of cost observability natively would not work well. Use the systems that are native to billing are the way to go. If your environment is stupid complex per tenant, we used to have terraform project creation to deploy tenant environments and then you can provide permissions for airflow to run compute/etc in those projects. Then you can track everything at the Project level and put them under a folder to ease IAM.",

Meanwhile they sacrifice everything in place including the biggest one, \"model first approach\", no proper naming conventions and standards, documentation, unit testing, etc. My current team is very strict on \"model first approach\". As soon as new line of work is discovered and identified, epic is created. Then modeling user stories where I work on creating data models starting from stage, raw vault, business vault (if needed) followed by information mart model (dims and facts), and views on top of IM objects. In stage, we establish the object and field naming convention and carry the same till the final end views. Now we have things in place for data lineage, meta data driven, scalable and sustainable data models in place. Every CDC goes through data model which is approved via GItHub PR, that helps with versioning, tracking audit ability and back tracking any changes. We also have master branches in Erwin model mart where we merge our approved model changes. Everything that I listed is barely practiced these days at many companies. AI is overhyped and over kill in many aspects of data engineering area.",

To be able to calculate contributor level revenue, you need to declare the grain of your fact table as the revenue of a single contributor to a single project. So your ProjectContribution table is actually your fact table (it has the right rows), it's just missing the additive fact column. You don't need, and indeed actively don't want, a bridge table in your model. That would be a violation of Kimball's principles in this case. (Bridge tables are perfectly justified in some situations, but this isn't one of them.)So within power query, you need to left join ProjectContribution to the source fact table, and do the multiplication to get the more granular, additive actual revenue numbers per contributor per project. You can then remove the % column (it's only semi-additive and can be calculated via a DAX measure). That gives you your one, new, fact table, which you can then relate directly to the project dimension. And maybe to a contributor dimension as well (if you want to be fully Kimball-by-the-book).",

Fully Apache 2.0 licensed across all components.* **OpenMetadata** \\- similar feature set to DataHub. Backend is Apache 2.0, but UI/connectors use the Collate Community License (source-available with \"no competing SaaS\" restriction—can't offer it as a managed service).* **OpenLineage** \\+ **Marquez** \\- standardized lineage events, but you're building the metadata layer yourself. More pipeline-focused.**Orchestrator built-ins (dbt, Dagster, Airflow):** These track lineage *within their domain* but don't connect downstream to your actual reports/dashboards. You get table → table lineage but it dies at the data layer. No BI tool integration, no report ownership tracking. **Commercial:** Collibra, Atlan, Select Star, Monte Carlo - all have report lineage features. Expensive. Some have limited BI connectors or require their agents everywhere. **TL;DR:** If you want report → dataset → pipeline end-to-end lineage with ownership/KPIs attached, you need a proper catalog. DataHub if OSI-approved open source matters (procurement, contributions, full commercial freedom), OpenMetadata if the SaaS restriction doesn't affect you, commercial tools if you've got budget and specific BI tool needs. The gap most orgs hit: their orchestrator shows them pipeline lineage, but nobody knows which dashboard broke when table X changed. That's the report lineage problem as you've identified.Good luck!",

The goal of the library isn’t to replace pandas, but to save people from rewriting the same pattern every time: extract the columns, modify them, and reindex. Functions like `swap_columns` or `move_after` just centralize that logic, handle bulk operations, validate inputs, and keep everything consistent so users don’t have to think about the mechanics each time.About `sort_columns`: yes, the pandas one-liner works perfectly. The value of having a single entry point is mostly convenience. You can switch between variance, std, mean, correlation, NaN-ratio, or a custom key without changing how you write the code. For some workflows that reduces friction; for others the built-in one-liners are already enough.Appreciate you taking the time to look at it and share your thoughts.",

        "body": "I've done this to subset data for micro-batches. It does work and you can create quite clean and comprehensive collected datasets with it, but there are caveats.First, if you have links between two entities of the same type (customer-customer) then you will need to recursively traverse this graph to make sure you get everything, otherwise some referential integrity or derivation can break. These links can themselves be derived links rather than explicit ones, so it isn't necessarily something you'll be able to pick out algorithmically right away. An example I had was that two customers could be linked via a shared account, but the relationship was in a generic customer-account table, and the account could appear multiple times. Pulling in a customer that wasn't initially selected could pull in *another* customer, because the third customer may be related to the second but not the first.Second, you may end up with 'orphaned' data if you have you have some entity that is disjoint from your entry. Ideally this is not the case, but if you have multiple domains that don't directly interact you may end up just dropping an entire domain. Similar to the prior point, this is mostly something you'll find along the way, and you just need to give yourself an additional entry point.Third, you may have reference data that you don't want to filter in this way because certain outputs or reports may expect all reference data to be available regardless of whether anything relates to it. For example some classification reference set where someone does an aggregation group by that classification -- they may suddenly see classifications disappear entirely if no data was joined to it. They may prefer to still see the classification, but get `0` values in the aggregate data. Again, not something you can easily algorithmically determine, it is more of a UAT process on your data selection.That said, this is afaik the only real feasible way to get a comprehensive random sample of the data at a given point in time. As long as you come up with an extensible and performant way to relate tables for key selection, to add extra entry points, to specify 'full copy' reference tables, and to specify 'loopbacks' on key selection, it is just a matter of configuring things.I am not aware of a 'standard practice' for this. People usually either just give up on referential integrity, or limit the time window and select everything rather than random sample.",

        "body": "I think you are right that data governance often grows out of other data domains like engineering or analytics. Companies usually learn the hard way why their engineering or analytics initiatives fail, and only then start thinking about governance. At first they try to handle it with existing people, and when it grows large enough they start hiring roles dedicated to it. In my experience this mostly happens in big regulated industries like banks, insurance companies or government. Small companies usually do not care much, and it is fine, because their scale rarely makes the problems severe, and a small team can still handle them. So yes, I would recommend looking at highly regulated areas like banking, insurance or the public sector. You will find more demand there.As for entering data governance, it is a bit odd. From what I have seen, these roles are not the most sought after in data teams because they usually require less deep technical work. But this may only be true in organizations where the governance practice is already quite mature. Data skills still help a lot, and most places expect them in governance roles. Many organizations are still in the transition phase, where governance is mixed with regular data roles. It is still common to see a data engineer who is also a data steward at the same time while his job description might not actually indicate that.",

We have more people with the skills than customers willing to pay for those skills sadly...even though gdpr is a legal requirement. Gdpr has many facets and some are taken less serious than others and the serious ones are easy to implement with RLS and the likes.

For instance, in countries like Germany where the automobile industry is huge, companies are starting to take data governance seriously. But instead of hiring an entirely new team, they usually trust experienced internal people from engineering or analytics and hand those responsibilities over to them. Of course, they often have one dedicated person overseeing governance to guide the engineers, but that’s usually about it.What’s confusing, though, is that some industries seem to treat it differently. For example, Lufthansa recently started hiring specifically for data governance roles, which shows that aviation and other heavily regulated sectors are beginning to take it more seriously. So it feels like while in some industries it’s still considered a “risky zone” for newcomers, others are already investing in dedicated governance teams.",

I've seen everything, from organizations that have dedicated teams and resources for every part of it, to large organizations that have nothing in place and cannot even export data from an IT system to Excel.That being said, very few organizations actually have it figured out. Because of that, roles inside data teams overlap a lot and people end up wearing many hats. So the recommendation to enter through any data role if you want to move toward governance is valid. It is often easier to pivot internally from analytics or engineering into governance or data management than to try to find a pure governance job from the outside.It can also be risky. In some highly regulated organizations that are still immature, I have seen them hire data governance specialists before they even have data teams or a CDO. In those cases, the governance expert ends up sitting under legal or some other non data function. That is where it becomes ugly.",

But now it looks good but doesn't do anything, so you learn JavaScript...>Many people don't know how to imagine what goes into some complex multi-region live streaming platform like YouTube or Disney Plus, but what they can do is imagine what the UI looks like and what their imagined idea of it would look like. So they just start there...Since I'm so new, I think it might help if I do a lot of small tutorials (Github project-based learning/build your own x, big book of small python projects, or automate the boring stuff) to get exposure to what projects look like and what I'm capable of.*I'm currently doing things that I find fun (learning DSA and reading books like Eloquent JS), but I plan to incorporate your advice soon. I think it's a matter of taking one big topic, breaking it down until you can't, researching those broken down topics, then breaking it down more until you have something actionable. I just haven't done that for personal projects much yet, so it's easy to feel overwhelmed. .*Perhaps since I enjoy learning how things work, I can use what you said and learn how to make something like YouTube (or whatever else works) until I can recreate a crappy version myself. I won't be building my \"own idea\", but I'll learn the skills needed to do so (similar to what my initial idea of learning from those other materials, but framed in a different way). Idk, I'm just rambling.

I find most resources for learning when it comes to programming to be quite frustrating, and they don't explain enough. I was only able to do a semester of computer science, but I was attending a university generally quite well regarded for their computer science / cybersecurity programs. I ended up having to stop attending for financial reasons, unfortunately. Anyway, what I LOVED about their program is that it broke everything down to the fundamentals. It's been a few years so some of the following may be incorrect. This is just an example, but they had us learning C++ and started us off by learning how a computer works. Then they had us learning how a variable is basically just assigning a name to a block of memory, and storing data in that location. Or how arrays are sequentially assigned blocks of memory, so if you know where X index of an array is located in the memory, you can find the other indexes. How you can't dynamically increase the size of the array due to how C++ is reserving memory, how typing works, etc. I find that with most learning resources, they just don't even *attempt* to explain how a particular thing works beyond a basic level. But then when you try to wade into the waters of reading documentation, it's so filled with technical jargon that it's often incomprehensible to a beginner. I don't want to build legos and just slap stuff together. I don't want to know how to USE a particular programming concept, I want to actually know how it works. I recall when I was younger, attempting to build some small projects. Inevitably, I would write a bit of code that I thought understood in one project, and try to re-use the same concept in another project with a slightly different use-case, only to find that it fundamentally was not doing what I originally thought it did. When that happens now and again? Not a big deal. When that's happening pretty frequently? It becomes frustrating, and it makes me think that even when I can re-use a concept in multiple projects successfully, that I still don't totally get what it's doing. That's the issue that I have with trying to learn by just trying to make something. I care a lot less about making any one particular project, and a lot more about knowing how everything I'm doing actually functions. Anyway, huge block of text over. If anyone has any advice for where/how to learn things in a way that is more complete than \"this is X, use it like this.\", I would love you forever. I've currently just been working my way through boot.dev's python course.",

At this point, it is too late to catch up, but you can easily do better next time. If it helps: A programming language in general is a human readable language, that can be used to describe a set of instructions. In the case of C, the program can then be translated into something the computer can \"understand\", or more accurately: execute. If you write something like `int a = 7;` the computer will know to use some memory (in the stack, if you want to know) to save an integer, and initialize it's value to 7. `a++;` will then increment the variable by 1, so the value of a is now 8. While this sounds really simple, that's basically all programs (in C) do. We write values to memory, change those values in a way that is useful, and then hopefully achieve stuff. Even more complex things, like serving a website or using word or excel is basically just a lot of this.",

Get in the car. 1. Step toward the car. 2. Put your right foot in. 3. Put your butt on the seat. 4. Scoot over. 5. Put your left foot in.4. Close the Door. 1. Put your hand on the door handle. 2. Pull the door shut. 3. Release the door handle.5. Start the vehicle. 1. Put your foot on the brake. 2. Put your hand in your pocket. 3. Close your hand around your keys. 4.

It finally made sense when I came in on Monday after a weekend release and noticed an algorithm I had written (tree traversal, but that doesn't matter) had been rewritten to be less efficient by the chief architect. I was young and inexperienced and stormed in and demanded an explanation why they had \"regressed our performance\". He calmly explained the situation. To get the release out on Saturday night he had to modify the structure of the data slightly...in a way that was incompatible with my traversal. He had spent about half an hour trying to figure it out, writing unit tests to test the old and new structure...old passed, new didn't, the issue he was troubleshooting came down to the algorithm. It had no tests other than the ones he wrote. No comments explaining the reasoning behind it. It was not obvious to him why a convoluted and non standard algorithm was used. He had to fix it, and had to support it, so he did the reasonable thing and replaced it with a well known algorithm that worked with his new unit tests. Problem solved, release shipped.Starting to sympathize with the predicament he was in I explained my concern...the performance wasn't \"optimal\". \"'Optimal'? how do you know yours was 'optimal'?\" I stammered a bit and conceded I didn't actually know...but it \\*was\\* more efficient. \"Benchmarks?\" ....\"no...I never benchmarked it\". \"What cases does it work with\"....\"oh..this and that and the other....\". His response was \"how do you know?\". \"I tested it!\" .....\"No...no you didn't. There were no tests. There are now. We know this works, when it works, and how it works.\" I responded indignantly \"but it's slower\". \"By a couple milliseconds, a few dozen times a day it runs. Do you care about that? Why? Isn't it better to know it works because it is tested with cases we expect it to handle?\"\"Yeah. If I write unit tests to fix the trivial issue with the original algorithm can I replace it?\" .... \"I guess you can....but is a few milliseconds of execution time a dozen times a day worth the effort? Don't you have actual bugs to fix?\" ....\"Yeah....\"....\"Then do it the next time you change that code\". It never had to change. I never put it back.If I'd written unit tests showing the conditions the traversal handled, what it's preconditions were, etc he would have fixed the trivial issue with it and gone about his way, me none the wiser. Because I did a shoddy job it became his problem, and he fixed it the most expedient way possible...reasonable while the entire release team is twiddling their thumbs waiting for a critical fix.If you don't unit test your code it doesn't really work. It \\*might\\* work. But you don't know that. You don't know what it is expected to handle. You don't know how its author was intending it to be used. I became an instant convert to unit testing after this. This happened in about 2004 before unit testing really became considered mandatory. I'm glad the industry has changed in this regard.",

All the best engineers I've worked with over the decades have had solid fundamentals, and all the worthless ones have not.So I'd say that you don't need to worry too much about the C languages specifically, but you would probably benefit a lot from using it to become familiar with how your computer works and how hosted software works with the system to get resources and do things. It will leave you with a deeper understanding and appreciation for how (not) and what (not) to do and when (not) to do it etc. You will consider things that people who have only ever worked in more abstracted environments won't, and that can make a big difference.",

In this respect your teacher is correct.There exist, however, other kinds of programming, where performance-critical code has already been written by others and multiple pieces of software need to be glued together in a non-critical manner. Programming languages usually used for this purpose are so called \"high-level\": Python, JavaScript, Swift, etc.You can, of course, have a good programming future with a high-level programming language only, never even touching C/C++, but you will never be able to write low-level software such as a game.",

You need to know what to learn and at what point. Then once you think you got it by reading the theory you must prove it to yourself by doing a project and using the theory to build something. Here the Odin Project also does a great job. You learn the theory and then you build a project they provide where for each project you need all the theory you were supposed to learn prior. The course is hard and takes a long time to finish but imo is far better than a 5 hour youtube tutorial. Just watching someone code or just copying a project is not the same as creating your own version of a project which you will be required to do in the Odin Project. It reads like an ad but I did use it to learn Web Development and I just legit think it's a fantastic course if you are ready to put the time and effort in.",

Remember that a computers biggest strength is that it does exactly what you tell it to do. The only problem with that is it does EXACTLY what you tell it to. Knowing how to tell it something and knowing what to tell it are very different things. Like everyone is saying, the only real way to learn how to program is to just program. Make things. Make things work. Break things, then fix them so they work. You can spend 10 years learning the theory but until you actually code something it just won't really click. Like trying to learn to be a mechanic by watching YouTube but never actually touching a car. Sure, you could figure things about and fix them, in theory, but if your car actually broke down well, don't strip your nuts over tightening~ Pick a project/s and just code them out.

Someone in their basement can write a kernel and all the hundreds of things to control an entire computer, if they are reasonably smart and dedicated. But the specs for web dev are vastly more complex.However, almost nobody builds software from scratch. You can make it much simpler by only plugging together libraries and learning about how the parts work. Or even just use a browser engine like Chromium und wrap features around that as hundreds of vendors have done.So, let’s just say: it’s not a great project for an early student. It will be messy and unpleasant. There are probably nicer side projects like games, a browser extension, coming up with one specific tool or library and bring that to completion and share it. It’s way more satisfying to build something tiny but useful, even if it exists already, than trying to fumble around in a large ambitious project, learn a few things but ultimately lose interest without a result.If you want to stick with web tech, pick one aspect: just video rendering or just CSS parsing and build a lib for that as an exercise, but you can still publish it as an achievement for your portfolio.",

AI, at least right now, is prone to bad coding style, prone to bugs, prone to weird decisions. A person who lets an AI do his task for him and does not oversee the result, he also will leave such nonsense in his project. And it will be visible to recruiters. Some recruiters for sure will leave out such people.2)interview stage: when a person does not know what he is doing it will be much more apparent during the interview. He can't explain why he wrote his project the way he wrote (well, the way his AI wrote). He is unable to make changes when asked. Sometimes the interview will give him Leetcode exercise. As he did not solve his assignments on his own, he will be unable to solve these Leetcode exercises on the spot.3)probation period. First 4 months or so. Then the team is testing if the person is even suitable for the job. A person who just relies on an AI will generate more nonsense to pull requests. He will have more issues with his task. Perhaps the internal team blocks certain AI-tool-related communication and he can't even use the AI tool. Because some projects are proprietary and the client has not given permission to use cloud-based AI tools.

I understand, it can be a pain in the ass for you to carry 3 people in a group project, especially when you get the same grade - but the truth is, no one cares about grades. So you got 8/10? Great! You had slackers and this was your handicap. You can't do everything perfect, but what you can focus on is your trajectory. 8/10 with slackers is still pretty impressive imo - maybe there's some ego being involded too somewhere? That's good. But when you don't really have any interest in the subject, the last thing you want to meet is the tryhard dude that has 100 expectancies of you, when you just want to pass... Maybe team up with simiar colleagues.Anyways man, be good and stay safe!",

Not for the love of it, not because they like to create, not because they're working towards self-fulfillment. Nope. They only do something because it *might* make them money. This then plays into everything I do where I also enjoy the process and learning and creating. But nobody around me seems to care unless I am doing it with the intention of starting a business and making money selling it. While some times that is my goal, sometimes I just like to make stuff. If you do happen to make something cool, inevitably most praise will come in the form of a sentence like \"these are so amazing! You should sell them!\". This is actually why AI is so popular. People see a shortcut that they don't have to fucking learn anything anymore. Just type in a bunch of words that your brain vomits out and the AI will make it for you. These people don't realize that they're being lobotomized of their creative drive. I hate everything about the current AI stuff that is being pushed. I'm not a luddite. I've used them all. I have yet to find a situation where I am not just better off doing it all myself. It can't even gather the relevant documents I want for a project. I gave claude a list of the components I planned on using and asked it to gather the datasheets. It was successful with only 60% of them. In the time it took me to get that 60% and then realize the other 40% was not related and find those, I saved -30 minutes. If I can't trust it to gather datasheets, what the hell can I trust it for? Don't even get me started on using it for programming if you're not already a good programmer. All the forums are drowning in posts where people are asking humans to check their AI outputs because \"it doesn't work\". You can't even post your own stuff to get opinions without these brainless chudz dumping it into an AI and posting the always wrong outputs. Next election (not american so I'll have a proper, legitimate election) I will be voting for the asteroid.",

This thought is also why I ended up in a warehouse instead of being a software engineer with a great career. Through coincidence I saw a comment on Reddit where someone asked what's best way to learn web development? Someone said try the Odin Project. I went on the website and really liked what I saw and decided I will start to learn how to code but this time I promised myself that if I start I won't stop no matter what. This promise to myself would become very important later as I had several moments where I wanted to give up in the beginning because I couldn't solve some Javascript puzzle.At the same time I had the idea for an App that we could really use in the company I work at. For many years we used a whiteboard to do shift planing and it was really cumbersome so my goal is to develop an App for this but I had no idea how.7 months passed by and I was around half done with the Odin Project and decided I had enough know how to start developing the digital shift planer. If anyone is interested in the detailed development process of the App I wrote a long post in the Odin Project subreddit, you can check it out in my profile.Anyway after 3 months I had a working app that we now use for almost a year and as mentioned above I also won a company price for it. And after our IT guy posted it on the companies social media (it's a huge company with around 30.000 employees worldwide) I had several requests from managers around the world from countries like Taiwan, India and a couple of others for a demo. It turned out that they all are still using Whiteboards for their shift management. While this is happening I am developing an App that me and a buddy of mine plan to turn into a small company.All in all I spent around 3000 hours now with programming over almost 2 years. It's never too late of course to start but I can't help but think if I had put that effort in when I was 15 I'm sure I wouldn't have ended up in a warehouse. The only thing I know is that I won't stop anymore and maybe it will lead to somewhere, maybe it won't but even if not then it will stay a lifelong hobby for me that I do in my freetime like I do now.",

I find thinking about code really tricky, I give up easily or stop thinking. But granted, my studies are very fast paced and, I would argue, not suited to beginners. If I want to get good I know that I have to keep coding, writing code, understanding and structuring logic consistently. I'm very impressed by people who find ways to continue working on a problem when they get stuck, or who move on to another problem, or who, perhaps even more accurately, know which questions to ask themselves to allow themselves to actually consider the problem at hand.",

With the rise of YouTube and platforms like Udemy, etc. everybody thinks that they can be a teacher.Teaching is hard. Setting up good quality tutorials or courses is difficult and tedious. I've done that. I've authored and taught several courses. It not only requires good, in depth, knowledge of the subject but also certain communication skills as well as the ability to fall back into one's own beginner stages.It is very difficult to find the balance between becoming too elaborate (like I did in this comment), depth of content, and handholding too much or too little.",

Later switch to TypeScript and learn the Angular UI framework, and you will have a highly marketable skill.Another worthwhile first language that is production ready is C#. You can use a Game Engines like Godot or Unity to learn it. Using a game engine will give you plenty of engaging ways, to visualize what you do and will keep you motivated to follow through, as you will be able to create very nice programming challenges in a game world setting.Another highly regarded option for a first language to learn is Python.As always, feel free to check some job sites to see how many job openings exist for a certain language or skill if you need advice about what to learn.",

I got into math because I wanted to draw pictures on a computer. Or maybe music _and_ computers.Use your hobbies / interests to guide what you might _do_ with a computer. A lot easier to work hard on something you like that it is to work hard on something that is boring.So to answer you question:If I were starting again _today_ I'd play with [nandgame.com](https://www.nandgame.com/) to learn a _little_ bit about how computing hardware works.Then maybe a class on \"From Nand to Tetris\".I might see how far I could go at [https://www.khanacademy.org/computing](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing).I'd look for cool projects on youtube or [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/) and try to make one of them. Maybe look for a robotics team if your school does that sort of thing.I might get a RaspberryPi or two and study networking.I might read up on how to program simulations and enter a science fair or two.I might see if I could get some books like this from my school library book loan system:[Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution - 25th Anniversary Edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution).[Dealers of Lightning: Xerox PARC and the Dawn of the Computer Age](https://www.amazon.com/Dealers-Lightning-Xerox-PARC-Computer/dp/0887309895)The reason I like these 2 books especially is they're about people who _created_ things that changed the world.

You get self-paced content, live expert sessions, and real-world projects, so you’re actually applying what you learn. They also have partnerships with Microsoft, IBM, and AWS, which keeps everything relevant one things which could be better is if some modules can be a bit faster, but overall, its great way to build practical skills. Also, certification from these big giants really matter when you apply for any job.and yeah, coursra is good too but more theoretical than hands-on. Great for building strong foundations, not necessarily for immediate job-ready skills. They have some subscriptions plans too that you can explore..Which ones have you explored so far?",

And it doesn't get easier. I *think*, but I'm not sure, that we get faster at it.My steps.1. Reproduce the problem, if possible. Get to the point where you can make the problem happen every time. If possible. Understand the inputs and other things that cause the failure. There are some bugs that are intermittent. Those are the worst. You can learn about [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) someday, but not today. If it's your thing write a test case which generates the bug.2. Try to figure out exactly which line of code caused the bug. If you get a traceback or other error message, it can tell you this. The top line of the traceback (bottom line in Python, why, Guido, why, did you do this backwards?) probably shows you the source file and line number where the problem occurred.3. Eyeball the code and the error message. Read the error message three times carefully; it often tells you exactly what is wrong in a language you don't quite understand.4. Learn to use a debugger to step through your code line by line. Start stepping (set a breakpoint) a few lines before the suspect line and do step step step. 5. Try putting in a fix to the problem.6. Repeat these steps.7. If you get frustrated after doing all this, take a break. Get a good night's sleep. Sometimes the answers to my bugs have come to me in dreams. Seriously.Most importantly:**Always remember that debugging is harder than programming. Don't use all your cleverness programming something, because you'll never be able to debug it.**You got this. Welcome to our great trade.",

Did the program crash or is it still running? — it will very likely range from a little bit tedious to extremely tedious the first couple of times you pay this much attention to an error message, but relatively quickly you’ll build a mental model of all this and you’ll be able to skim error messages quickly and come up with a full hypothesis of what’s wrong and how to fix it. You’ll start to understand things like how the tracebacks are presented in your programming language, sometimes the most relevant details are at the top, sometimes they’re at the bottom — and plenty of other useful little detailsUse the actual debugger for your programming environment, and get comfortable with it, ideally through some IDE/text-editor integration. Yes print line debugging is great and useful but it totally pales in comparison to a full blown debugger that lets you set breakpoints and jump through the code function by function, line by line, or breakpoint by breakpoint… Combining that with the skills/intuition that come from reading error messages will be extremely valuable for you and save you an absolutely unreasonable amount of time throughout a software career compared to not having those skills.",

If you decide it’s “Client/Server” then great, you’ve got two top-level components you can start with. Maybe it’s MVC or EDa etc. Whatever it is that choice should lead to some obvious top-level components. Then you can start mapping them to Use Cases and decomposing them into lower-level components. Some design principles should also guide your selection. Don’t duplicate code in multiple places. Keep implementation details abstracted. Don’t mix unrelated functionality in the same component. Etc.

Often times you won't know if your architecture was good until it's too late - it's not always an exact science. I wouldn't rely on AI to build the structure / architecture, but I would chat with it about different options and the pros & cons of each. You should be the final decision maker though and use AI to teach you and brainstorm with you, not make the decision for you.",

Depending on how exactly you define this problem, those are between 1000!/900! to 1000\\^100 sequences, which is about 2\\^1000. There must be one number (seed) for every possible sequence. So that seed would have to be up to 1000 bits long, so around 125 bytes (octets). This is about 10x longer than the \"10-15 characters\" that you were hoping for, more if you were hoping for ASCII characters.In general: there is no free lunch for compression. All compression techniques rely on the data having some pattern that can be described more compactly than just using the raw data.Further reading:* Shannon entropy is a concept for describing how much information is in a piece of data. This measures how \"surprising\" the data is. Compressed data cannot be shorter than the Shannon entropy in bits. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory* Kolmogorov complexity describes the theoretically most compact representation of data, i.e. how long a program would be that reproduces the data. In your model, the seeds would correspond to programs that generatea sequence. The seeds cannot be shorter than the sequence's Kolmogorov complexity. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity* The Pigeonhole Principle is a useful technique for thinking through these kinds of problems. Here, I used this principle to notice that the size of the seed (pigeon holes) must be at least as large as the number of distinct sequences (pigeons) I want to generate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle",

To \"go backwards\" you just mark off each 3-digit group.- You can store a number from 0-999 in 10 bits.- You can store a number from 0-999,999,999,999,999 in 50 bits.You can combine several smaller numbers into a bigger number. This can capture a few fractional bits of savings [1] but you can't magically convert an arbitrary 100-number sequence to a single 32-bit int.To actually compress data (losslessly), your compressed form needs to be variable-length. Then you assign more likely inputs to shorter compressed forms. (This only works if some inputs are less likely than others. If all possible inputs are equally likely, the average compressed output will be at least as long as the input, regardless of the internal workings of the compression function.)[1] Information-theoretically, a number from 0-999 contains log(1000) / log(2) = 9.966 bits of information, assuming each number 0-999 is equally likely. You need 10 bits to store such a number because a block of actual memory is always a whole number of bits.For example, if the maximum number is slightly larger than a power of 2, say your numbers range from 0..1099, then each one is log(1100) / log(2) = 10.103 bits. You need 11 bits each to store your numbers separately, wasting 0.897 bits. You could store 5 numbers in a single value ranging from 0..1100^5 - 1 which would only need 51 bits. The \"theoretical\" savings is 0.897 x 5 = 4.485 bits; in practice we only get 4 bits. Again, we \"waste\" 0.485 bits because a block of actual memory is always a whole number of bits.",

Its the same chortcut that is indexing like this p[3] instead of this *(p + 3).In your code, you are trying to assign a primitive value to a pointer. Pointer stores adresses, not primitive values, so you get an error. Correct thing here would be allocating memory (excuse my C++) like `char* p = new char;` and then dereferencing it to assign the value to the memory block that you just allocated `*p = '\\n';`The thing with text in \" \" works because thats a string, and string type is const char* which is the same as char* so there is no unkown conversions. Btw, im still not sure on the mechanism of this, like, what adress does it take from the literal value? Does it create a new memory block? Need to research.",

Most CPUs within the same family are backwards compatible, but the instruction set (assembly language) across architecture is different. It's not just the language is different, but the registers and addresses are different as well. So different architecture requires a different binaries i.e. you need to compile for architecture. OS has the same problem, but on the other side. Your applications needs to interface with the OS, and different OS has its own quirks. For example, Linux vs windows uses foward-slash / double back-slash for paths; Windows adds a carriage return to the end of line, and Linux doesn't. There are a lot of other difference in permissions, networking, filesystem, etc. i.e. you need to compile for OS. The OS doesn't do the work for you. The OS runs on top of the processor, and can only ask the processor to do work that the processor already do eg. execute this binary. It's the same as how a mobile app is not actually doing the work but is instead asking the phone to do it. So in the same way, you have Android apps, and you have Apple apps i.e. compiled to different OS.",

Those opcode, operand instructions use the instruction set of their target processor. The opcodes are literally switch settings that direct the operands to the physical hardware gates in the cpu. Your OS is not going to do any final compilation of your program. It’s going to load machine code into an isolated virtual memory space and control physical memory storage, swap space, and cpu time vs other managed processes. It will also provide mediated access to hardware via OS calls. You still have to compile for the right cpu architecture and OS. Virtual machines like the Java JRE let you start with a semi-cpu agnostic median build that is JITted into machine code at runtime. The OS still doesn’t do it. With some runtimes, like .net, you do have to specify a target cpu architecture as well. That’s a VM design choice on whether they want to abstract certain cpu features like the size of registers (32 vs 64 bit), endian storage, etc. and OS features. These choices still have to be made eventually of course and abstraction adds overhead if the actual cpu uses a different standard. Ultimately recompiling for x64, arm, and ppc is not actually a huge imposition.",

Instead of what you did, write \"System.out.println(....\" in one line. The same way how you wrote \"keyboard.next() in one line not in two lines.2. Give meaningful names to your variables. What is a? What is b?3. Read about methods. Your main method is too long. You can take out the quitting part and separate mathematical operation parts into separate methods and then use these in your main method.4. Move the definition of your variables after the quitting block. Because there is no point to define these variables when you never set a value to them with your quitting. Here it has no effect but in larger programs defining variables you don't use wastes system memory. Also, in your case there is no need to define a variable and set a value to it, separately. You can do just \"double a = keyboard.nextDouble();\" And the same goes for other variables as well.5. Don't add comments unless necessary. Your code should be self-descriptive. I suggest to read about Clean Code standards. Add comments when the code itself can't explain the existence of itself: why the code is there, why it does what it does, etc.",

So you could ask it about equations or proper conventions.Some great starter languages if you're coming from nothing would be python or JavaScript, but if you want to do other languages, you should learn about static typing. Additionally, I'd stay away from languages like c due to the amount of concepts that need to be learned opposed to python, js or Java.Another tip is to start simple. It may seem redundant, but it's going to help with motivation immensely. If you can mark something done, you can feel good about it.",

But I always use AI for brainstorming sessions in solo projects(since I need an opinion on my work too) asking if my idea was right, to rate my idea, talk about the limitations of my ideas.Using AI for discussing on optimizations is the best part of using AI(But the prompt must make it clear to only discuss but not to code) .

The second part is sometimes not something that you can see.Guys I work with heavily rely on AI. Here is what I have noticed since I have to review their code. They understand the code it generates. But they don't understand or aren't aware of the problems the AI is trying to solve. So when it implements a solution, it looks correct, it technically does what it said it does, but it's often not actually correct...even when it looks like the code is working. - AI will happily reinvent the wheel. Not only that, it will reinvent a slightly incorrect wheel and each wheel will be slightly different, even though it's supposed to be the same wheel. - The best way to have no bugs in your application is to delete all your code. AI will happily delete your code. We did a review where a guy was having problems with authentication. He just kept feeding the errors into AI. What did AI do? It deleted the entire Authentication system in the front-end and hardcodwd an API key in it's place. Problem solved :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:. - I am constantly finding race conditions in the code these guys submit. Why? Because they aren't aware of the implications of the code they are submitting.Now I work with another guy who does know what he's doing. He has AI write a lot of the code. But he is constantly correcting AI. Telling it that what it produced is garbage. He can make AI iterate to a correct solution a lot of the time. Other times, it's just quicker to write it yourself because the AI just doesn't get.When I was learning, I recognized that I didn't know what I didn't know. Knowing thst this class problems even exists in the first place is 99% of the battle. What separates experienced developers from junior developers is knowledge of what types of problems exist. Now as far as learning, I relied a lot on YouTube tutorials, books, Google, stackoverflow etc to learn concepts and how to make something. In my case, there was a project that flipped the switch for me. I went from not knowing how to do anything other than stupid little college programs to \"holy shit...it makes sense now\". That was a project that I actually made for a group and they actually used it. And in using it, they ran into all kinds of problems. Encountering those problems and thinking about why they are occurring and then solving them...that's what really started my learning. Most of my solutions came to me during long showers :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:.

If you are totally new to programming, what I have been doing is first identifying what I want to gain from said language, (for me it was Golang, I want to build software, develop \"engineers\" mindset, and get hired). The one thing I have learned overall about programming, is that fundamentally it is the skill of problem solving. I have used python before and when I solve problems, I don't even see the language anymore, I see the problem. I have 3-4 different resources I am using for go specifically. Learn go with tests, learn go the hard way, and Exercism. Each resource fills in gaps for the other. Exercism helps you develop the problem solving skill that is fundamental to programming, Learn go the hard way is a total beginners book on programming with go. Learn go with tests is a more intermediate book I go through after I finish the same topic in both exercism and LGtHW. Its allowed me to immerse myself and not just \"learn go\", but develop the problem solving and engineers mindset. All this to say, find what works for you. If it is a text based courses and books, then great, if it is a video course, then great, if it is building something, then great. Just experiment around with a 3 different resources max and see what works for you the best.",

You are asking your `ConcurrentHashMap` to create a new entry for key `\"Key\" + i` with value `null`. Later you are asking it to give you that value, `null`, back and assign it to the `values` variable: `values = dataMap.get(key);`The very next line you try to call the `add` method of your `List`. The value of your `List` is null. This causes the null pointer exception. The best way to avoid potential null errors popping up is to never use null. There are very few situations where null is your only option. If you avoid ever typing \"null\" in your code, you will have fewer headaches later on.In this case you are hand-waving a call of some kind (`// placeholder for async data`). If you plan to handwave actual logic you have to make sure that your handwave reflects what the actual setup will look like. In this case you expect your data to be a list of integers.

You will probably end up using a library to convert pixels into a PNG file. If you struggle, you can always come back here with a more specific question (\"I'm writing a drawing program as a webpage in JavaScript. The user puts pixels on a canvas with the mouse. How do I convert those pixels on the canvas to a PNG file for the user to download?\").It's up to you how far you go into the details of graphics drawing. For example, whether you use the line-drawing function provided by your graphics library, or you [convert a line to pixels yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm).C++ can be helpful if you want high-resolution, high-performance drawing code for fancy effects, or you want to interface with existing C++ libraries.

In my experience it comes boils down to doing the actual programming _a lot_. It is not just like but actually _is_ learning a language. You start by copying mostof it ir modifying what's already there. With time you become more proficient and build up a mental repertoire of patterns that are frequently used. With time you will come to the point at which you will be given a task and immediately think of patterns you've used previously. when given a task you break it down into smaller problems like copying files, sending data over a serial connection, receiving, logging to a file or plotting data. You don't have to reinvent the wheel. most of these singular tasks are solved in a similar way most of the time and you only have to tweak or modify according to the current circumstances of the project. So just start small, continue reading a lot of code by others but most importantly stick with writing a lot of code yourself. This is what cements that mental repertoire.",

You’re asking about a data structure, i.e. a specific implementation detail, while the text you’re referencing is explaining an architectural detail.In this case, a stream processing system just means a system that is continuously processing data as it is produced - in other words, the job is never “complete”, the system may just be idle at some point waiting for the next chunk of data to come in. Data is pushed to this system rather than the system pulling data into it.The implementation of this can certainly use a queue, and in reality a system like this will likely use multiple queues and/or stacks along and way.TL;DR a stream and a queue are really just different things, not necessarily a replacement for each other. A stream is some data coming from a source which may or may not have an end, whereas a a queue is just a FIFO mechanism for processing data. Consider an example outside of programming:- A “stream of people“ would describe many people passing through some point at some rate without necessarily defining a start, end, or quantity- A “queue of people” would describe a line for people to wait in a FIFO fashion. There may not even be any people in the queue at some point in time- A stream of people may be entering a building to go wait in a queue, to go wait in one of many queues, or do something else entirely- A long and fast moving queue might be described as a stream",

You can have many consumers, and distribute the messages to them to balance a load. You can have lossy queues—that makes sense for some applications. You can replay events from the recent past. And on and on.Either one can handle data in near real time. A stream is systems-architecturally much simpler than a more generalized queuing system. Your Saturday night production incidents will be easier to sort out with streams instead of queues.

So a “manager approval request” was theoretically a generic ticket type except that it only came from ServiceNow. So we basically had code that was specific to each ticketing system but it wasn’t _explicitly_ specific. An abstraction layer would have good general ticket handling. An indirection layer has system specific code but it’s masked behind the layers. :)",

For example, a backend engineer will work with the server and the database too. However, at the beginning they really do not know what the requirements are to interact with another engineer that is working on the frontend.Same for the frontend, they don't really know what to send to the server, how to send it, and what to do with it when they get it if then don't have someone on the backend to interact with.You are learning on your own so you will be missing one of the sides if you don't do both.Just some thoughts about it.

First just get it to work. If it’s too slow, do some optimisation on the bottlenecks. Then look, is this readable?

Where people generally get hung up is that in the systems that *need* monads and *call them that*, they generally have great facilities for working on monads at a higher level (e.g. LiftM), and once we are working at that level of abstraction it becomes very difficult to disentangle the category theoretic language from the stuff you’re actually, like, doing.

As in, flatmapping lists are fine, but I still don't find stuff like a :: [Int] a = … b :: [Int] b = do x <- a y <- a return $ x + yparticularly intuitive (it returns all possible additions of values in `a`). Or this definition of a `powerSet` function: powerSet :: [a] -> [[a]] powerSet = filterM (const [True, False])Running state-changing actions seems entirely benign in comparison to the multi-value stuff.> Monads that \"do something\" (= arent simply context), like IO, are \"lazy\". They are representation for computations that are yet to run (unrelated to lazy vs strict languages)Most noticeable with the `Future` monad, which in monad-less languages tend to grow their own `async`/`await` keywords rather than being handled with just `return new Future(foo)` / `future_foo.unwrap()`. :\\^)",

You can use the epsilon-delta definition of a limit to prove a ton of stuff in Real Analysis. But you can revisit those same problems later using the lens of topology, and make some of it easier and some of it harder.Additionally, functional programming typically comes with some very strong guarantees on mutability and which operations are dependent on each other, stronger than can be made in *arbitrary* non-FP contexts. This enables a different class of compiler optimizations. But of course, immutability has many of its own performance downfalls, so it’s incredibly application specific.TL;DR: functional programming is useful because it’s another tool in your toolbelt for solving very hard problems.",

Were they as good at it as me? Of course not. But did almost all of them get their degrees regardless? Yes.Skill comes with time and experience. We are all born knowing nothing about programming. Some of us start earlier than others. Some learn faster. The fastest learner in the cohort was very unlikely to be able to catch up to me, so comparing themselves to me would have been pointless. It's just as pointless for you to do. The beginners were not alone.Start where you are. Put in the time and effort and you'll do just fine at university.",

Your portfolio should include some bigger projects like application that does something, library that solves or handles some specific problems etc. If you are learning and already have some basic knowledge behind you try to create base application/library that does anything you want and with every new thing you learn try to add it to your project. You learned some new for loop definition? Add it somewhere. You learned some generic basis? Write a method that uses them.In the end, you will have nice extensive project to portfolio with all stuff you learned.",

Or learning alongside him until he’s ready to plan his own course of action. I say this because my dad was a tech guy, even went to school for it. But I could have never relied on him to teach me to code or give me a roadmap for it. He didn’t understand past a certain point of hardware himself.

First, find out how to read from the keyboard - usually you'd then get a variable representing which key was pressed.2. Then you need to determine what should happen for each key - no matter what you decide, it is probably going to be rules that only you know, so you have to find some way of telling the program what the rules are. But begin by writing them out on paper for yourself. e.g. \"A\" should add 1 each time, \"S\" should add 10, \"D\" should subtract 1, and so on.3. Begin by writing a program that only understands two of the rules, like \"A\" and \"S\" or whatever makes sense to you. Probably something like a set of if-statements.4. When you have that basic program working, it is time to expand with all the rules - but writing 102 if-statements are going to be annoying! Hopefully you can see some sort of pattern, like if key 'x' is pressed, add value 'n' to the number ...5. Maybe you can use a data structure like a `dict` in Python to pair up the key 'x' and value 'n' values, and then find the pressed key in that `dict`, and add the matching number. This will take a bit of research into dicts, but it will be time well spent!",

They're very different things, even though they look similar.Your web server is responsible for looking at incoming URLs, *translating* them to paths in the filesystem, and serving those files as a response. The details of how it does that are part of the server's code and/or configuration, which you didn't show in your post.Typically, you specify a \"root\" directory somewhere, so that e.g. a URL like `https://mysite.org/foo/bar.png` gets translated to the file path `$PROJECT_ROOT_DIR/foo/bar.png`.The network tab will tell you what URL the browser **is actually** requesting, which is vital information. But it won't tell you what URL it **should be** requesting. You have to determine, based on your webapp's configuration, what URL it **should be** requesting to get the correct file. And then you have to specify the correct URL accordingly in your source code. The network inspector tab is a tool to help you check whether this was done correctly.",

If you had to pick another popular one I'd recommend considering PostgreSQL. Note that Microsoft SQL server has free versions but for commercial use it has license fees, while Postgres is open-source so it's completely free, no strings attached.

That will be specific to SQL Server.Once your database is set up and you know how to type a query, you can now switch to just about any SQL textbook or tutorial, and all of the basics will work the same as any other SQL database.Alternatively, pick your course first and then choose the database they recommend.",

        "body": "One of the first things to do while building software is to break it down into manageable chunks. Setting out to build a huge system, which is what you have envisioned, is likely to result in feeling like its too big and burnout. I would encourage you to pick one small component of what you want to build and do that. Skip the fancy UI, make it a command line utility so you don't get bogged down with building a fancy interface. Stay very focussed on it and only it. Don't worry if it feels like you can't visualize it, you can add that later once the core is working. For example, \"signal processing\" is very general. What inputs do you want to process to produce what outputs? Pick one, say the ability to accept stereo audio and determine which side of the space it is on. Not where it is, just which side, ie left or right. Test it, first with unit tests, then using live data. Get it working, very well. Feeding unreliable data to the next step in the processing pipeline will create pain as you have to determine which component is unreliable. Then add multiple sources of input, ie two people having a conversation back and forth. Extend it to identify that there isn't a single source. Get that working. Then extend again to identify which side the sources are on. Get it working. Unit test everything so you don't accidentally break stuff that you had working. I could go on and on and on...but that is how you build a complex system from the ground up.Expect your project to take years working on it full time. What you have laid out is a \\*massive\\* undertaking. Spend ample time evaluating existing libraries and tools that do the things you want...it's almost always easier and faster to use existing components than to build your own. Beware of the licenses...don't use anything that you don't want to be restricted by in the future. You can always replace components with others or your own if you determine they don't work. That might be reasonable to get you past a hurdle, but can also be a waste of time if you try to use something and it just isn't suited. Rack it up as a learning experience and move on.Break everything down into manageable chunks. Days or maybe a week...longer than that does not provide enough structure or confidence in feasibility. Don't know how to do something in order to know how long it will take? Break it down into chunks that you can research until you know enough to have a good idea of what is involved and how long it will take.Did I mention breaking things down into manageable chunks? This project planning can be difficult because it's more fun to dive in. It is a necessity...don't skip it. It will be more gratifying to get a small task done rather than have a big undefined task that slogs on and on.",

You'll come to regret it.First of all - you'll spend all your time finding the perfect translation, but often the words themselves don't actually mean in programming, what they mean in English. Just something as basic as \"print\" - it never means \"print\", it always means \"write this sequence of characters to the standard output stream, be it a file, or terminal-window\". Which is probably why different languages (and APIs) calls it write, print, log, out, or >> ... So what should your translation be? And if you choose the Spanish word for \"write\" as the function name for \"print\", then what'll you do when you suddenly come across another function called \"write\"? Should that be called the same, or something different?And even if you succesfully translate all the functions, classes and methods, you still can't translate words like if, while, for, function, class, return and so on - you you'll still end up with a mix.And the worst part is - when you forget what a translation means, and come across some of your earlier code - you'll have no way of understanding what it actually does, if the Spanish-named functions are part of the program itself, or translations of the system-functions. And you won't be able to search for anything, because no one else knows your exact translation files ...But you are not the first thinking these thoughts, and in fact there has been a number of localized programming languages around the world.

I like the test files it runs, and the way it comes back with old problems/sections to make sure you remember the basics at times. The code editor isn’t just an empty text box, but it also doesn’t auto fill everything for you. The XP system is nice, it really makes you feel bad for using a hint / the assistant. And when you do use him for help, he never gives you the answer directly, he helps you through it. Overall I recommend it. :)",

You can organize into projects, epics, stories, tasks, subtasks, with priorities and current status, assignments, and related issues (blockers, etc.). There are comments, descriptions, attachments, and workflows, backlogs, and sprints (or kanban). It is pretty easy to create simple tasks and you can go as deep into it as you want. This would be great process learning as this is the way companies typically work.I hope this helps. Ask more questions if you have them. You all are doing a really great job learning.",

Like do you really need a timeline and assignments, etc, when you can just talk face to face in class.And my suggestion, as an alternate, or cooperative, because it's what I'm learning, is to try out Test Driven Development (TDD). Or BDD or whatever who calls it.TDD is kinda tricky until you get used to it, but fundamentally, it's just your list of notion tasks, written as code, as part of your codebase. You just have to change your point of view from \"is this task complete?\" to \"is this task fail-pass?\" It's an automated checklist. It's an awesome feeling to run my tests and have a lot of :check_mark_button::check_mark_button::check_mark_button::check_mark_button::check_mark_button: show up.I'm not saying to follow TDD strictly to the letter. I'm saying to add a bit of testing. Even now, when you write your code, you need to know if it's working or not. Automate your manual checks is what I'm saying.",

You read about it. YOU BEGIN BY STUMBLING AROUND, LOST AND ALONE IN THE DARK until you trip over something that might possibly happen to lead you somewhere. You have no idea what you're doing or where you're going until you get there, only to discover it was a dead end, and then you have to backpedal and try to figure out where else you might be able to go - perhaps from a past breadcrumb, perhaps a different trailhead you found along the way that you can come back to.Figuring shit out on your own means being lost most of the time. If you are willing to accept that whatever you're trying to do - you're likely not the first, and your problem was probably already solved first 60-80 years ago, then there's a lot of academic research to do. It's reading, reading, reading...If what you're doing IS unique, well then you have to spend a lot of time just thinking, just trying stuff. Every failure informs you of what not to do and how not to do it. You have to know what you want to accomplish in the first place so you can measure how far off you are.> I want to know how I can truly figure things out on my own and study effectively without missing important or essential informationYou need to embrace that you're totally missing shit, all the time. There is a depth of knowledge in front of you that you have no idea is even there, but the more you learn of it, the more profound all future insights would be, the faster and better you will find future solutions.But don't miss the forest for the trees. I've been programming for over 30 years - I'm tickled that Unicode is backward compatible with 1830s telegraph equipment, and that means something to me, but it doesn't mean anything to you. You're not there and it doesn't have to matter.> while also avoiding wasting too much timeThis bad attitude is not going to serve you. NOTHING is a waste of your time. Thomas Edison didn't invent the lightbulb, but he did improve upon it. He said it himself - he didn't fail 10,000 times, he just found 10,000 ways how not to do it. That information was GOLD back then. You don't learn from successes but failures. Being lost and stumbling, \"wasting time\" as you put it is a very necessary part of the process, it builds your intuition, which is what you actually need - knowledge you don't know you have and don't have to think about, but it informs you. You may not yet be on the path you want, but you're learning all sorts of other things, and it always comes back around to aid you.",

True, not all the knowledge gets put into projects but projects are still a way to see where you are in your journey.Let's say you can build an A. But you can't build a B yet. Which sets you a milestone. It can be a milestone in a linear line (simple HTML page -> static webpage -> dynamic webpage -> a web service -> etc.) but can be also on all kinds of directions (a home automation system, an MMO game, a Java applet for a smartcard, etc). For example I feel comfortable with Java. I use it in my daily work. I can build web services that consist of separate microservices/monoliths and communicate with each other via Kafka or via some MQ tool. That is my position on backend web application development line. Yet when I add frontend side to it, then I have to take many steps back because I do not feel comfortable with stuff like React or Angular. I can get my tasks done but it is out of my comfort zone. I am yet to reach a point where I do not mind a Jira task that tells me to work on our frontend side. Or, a totally different direction: I'm still quite a beginner when it comes to creating mobile apps. I can get something done on a hobby project level. But I can't work as a mobile app developer. And programming a remote control? I can't do it. Probably can figure something out by reading documentation and using trial and error approach, but it is totally out of my specialty. And implementing a post-quantum cryptography algorithms? No idea at all.I use different stages/levels of projects to measure my knowledge and skills. What is easy for me, what I am fine with doing, what I can teach others, where I'm struggling, and what I can't reasonably do.",

But if they lack the mental horsepower and abstraction skills to take what they've learned and add to that knowledge easily, they're still beginners.Anyways, you can keep a checklist of things you want to learn if you want, but it doesn't really show you anything about your progress towards becoming a decent programmer. That's a far less concrete thing, and has more to do with how your mental development has gone and less to do with the specific things you know.",

The wages dropped along with the number of positions.Before that it was Cloud computing. Wedge the word cloud into your startup to increase the chances of getting funding. Cloud experts were in great demand. Ultimately cloud has become pretty ubiquitous and now just a part of dev. Mostly it's just the cloud providers who have made big money from it.I think AI will be the next Cloud, rather than the next Blockchain. Lots of companies looking for an excuse to use it, most not making any money from it. Lots of AI startups going nowhere. The infrastructure required to train models will limit the AI providers to the larger companies with each trying to gain market share. AI is a financial bubble, but a useful tool also.

And a two year gap is an issue, but it’s something you can overcome (you can also finesse it on delivery).1. Go all out on applying right now to see if you can get an offer within the calendar year. It’s unlikely, given how close we are to the end, but those kinds of arbitrary markers matter on a resume.2. Target what’s sinking you. It sounds like you have to some extent, but in a more nebulous way. Do practice interviews with other people online. There’s literally nothing more important than that, and getting feedback.Also, I second what everyone else said about vitamin deficiencies, chemical imbalances, etc. Sometimes it's just something medical in our bodies that needs tending to.",

When I got out, I had no idea what to do, went through a really bizarre divorce (not related to that transition) and basically sat on my hands for a year and a half. Had to move back in with my parents, it all made me miserable. Finally decided if I wanted to do something worthwhile, I would need a degree. Turns out if you haven't been in school for awhile, its hard to get accepted to a technical program, so did community college for a year, got into a program, didn't really know what I wanted to do, did math, decided CS might be reasonable. Transferred to a different (better engineering school), COVID hit, decided the work I was doing in CS was remarkably boring, did really poorly, felt wayward again. Got transfered to a different program (Civil Engineering), got through the whole program pretty quickly and cleanly, basically could care less about it. Now I am in a Computing applied AI and systems masters program trying to focus on the components I actually enjoy (to varying degrees of success so far). The joy I find in all of this comes in at the edges, and honestly my girlfriend and cooking, the little things I do everyday keep me sane.I say all of this to say its okay to be struggling, its fine to vent and shout into the void, its fine to be tired and disappointed and honestly, in my experience is its also normal to feel like you are doing everything right and still come up feeling like you didn't get anywhere. Life is a grind, survival is a grind and if you can set goals and work towards them, that is awesome (and aspirational), but when something doesn't work out, for whatever reason, it doesn't mean you are washed, you aren't done, just time to figure out the next thing.",

It only makes sense if \"salary expense\" is the only thing you care about.

The finance industry operates exactly at the peak of its own hype cycle, *they* decide when the party is over and the money will stop flowing, and are always certain to secure their own bag before anyone else. Your continued career success is based on the opinion of some Warren Buffett-looking dude who spends most of his days working from his vacation home or in Stamford, CT, contrary to the delusions of some people on this sub, who think that SWEs are sacrosanct. This profession isn't, and never was, immune from macroeconomic realities and hype cycles.

We'll probably end up a regional power like we were back in the early 1900s.So yeah, long term I'm expecting leaner times as the endless growth that fueled our on-average 8% YOY growth levels off.Save your money y'all.",

Might get a handful of people trying to weasel through on a VPN, but it would at least create a barrier, and I’m sure the HR folks that review the resumes and stuff would appreciate not having to sift through 90 resumes of ineligible applicants just to find the handful of eligible ones interspersed throughout.",

        "body": "Yep, this is one thing I think a looooooot of execs either underestimate or don't even think about when they decide on a layoff.When I was laid off in early 2023, half the engineering department was let go, so from 16 people down to 8. Had a final meeting with my boss the day before my last day, and he told me they were told it was for two reasons:1) Rising interest rates were cutting into the bottom line and they were concerned about runway (they had at least several years at the burn rate at the time).2) They lost their CTO, VP, and Director for the engineering side of things, and the rest of the executive board didn't want to handle a team of 16 engineers directly, so to make things easier they decided cutting the team in half made sense.In the few months after the layoff, half of the remaining engineers left for other opportunities, taking the org down to just 4 engineers. Apparently this led to some panic with the execs, and they finally did what I and others wondered why they didn't just do in the first place: they promoted they very capable and well liked lead engineer to VP, giving them their delegation point.One of the staff engineers who remained (who I worked with at my job before that one) said they were considering seeing if folks who were laid off might be interested in returning, and flat out asked me, \"If we offered to bring you back, would you?\" Told him I'd really have to think about it, but given the reasons for why the layoff happened I would have a hard time being willing to trust the company wouldn't do it again. He understood and that was the end of that conversation. Sucked too because if I would have been able to just slide back into my job there, as it was before, it would have been a $20k pay bump compared to the job I'd started a few weeks before that conversation took place.Layoffs lead to further attrition, and it's usually the most capable folks in the org who have avenues they can explore to leave. My manager, for example, gave notice a week after the layoff to go be the founding engineer of another company a buddy of his had started, and had been bugging him to join.The entire reason I was at that job was the place I worked before laid off 20% of the company in early 2022, and the attrition afterwards was big. I survived that layoff, the first one I ever survived, but it sucked watching folks I absolutely enjoyed working with leave. Many of them ended up at one or two other companies, and I ended up at one of those companies when one of them suggested they reach out for me to expand engineering. Frustrated with the promotion process and not liking the new landscape of things, being able to interview for two hours (system design and leadership rounds to assess level, no coding) for a $25k pay bump was too tempting.There are mental aspects to these things that linger, for everyone regardless of whether they were the ones let go or if they got to stay. I'm not saying layoffs should never happen or are never necessary, but for all the ones I've been through they definitely felt too reactionary and didn't consider the aftershock among those who remained.",

But I’m not fully convinced that [ATS](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumereview/comments/1jsb9a8/4_steps_to_creating_a_jobwinning_resume_resume/) is irrelevant; some of it may be hype, but formatting your resume for it still makes sense. The OP mentioned spending $300 on a resume rewrite, which is fine if it worked, but there are much more affordable tools with good templates that help you build and organize everything easily, even sending your resume to many recruiters at once. And with AI becoming more involved in hiring, it seems like these systems will only become more normalized over time.",

I like riding dirt bikes, and it’s super dangerous to go out alone if you get hurt. In the past have met a good group of friends playing D&DI’d also say, try to be more open with people. If you are making stuff up about doing things on the weekend, it’s going to be hard to feel out who shares similar interests. It’s kind of awkward after college to be like ‘You seem chill, wanna kick it sometime?’. It’s way easier to be like ‘I heard you were interested in doing X, I’ve been wanting to check it out’ and then it opens the door to invite them to do something together.

It’s about scope and leadership.At senior you’re doing the scoping and system design. You’re making project roadmaps across several quarters. You’re delegating tasks to Mid/Entry SWEs but you can still code like a workhorse. You’re the PoC for cross team projects, maybe not cross org yet. You interview candidates. You’re not a people manager. You probably run the standup meeting. You identify blockers in projects and are the loudest person yelling upwards to leadership with major risks (entry level doesn’t see it coming and M1/principal+ may not be close enough to the daily work).That’s my view. I’m sure it’s different everywhere though.",

FAANGs and the like.Average tenure at my org before promoted to a senior engineering/product role is a little above 6 years. We don't hire externally into senior/staff+ roles -- it's just not possible to have the necessary organizational/product knowledge required to operate at that level until you've been at the company at least a year or two. You're also not getting promoted to \"senior\" without:* Demonstrated track record of owning complex technical delivery from start to finish. You worked with one or more product teams and drove the bulk of the high level technical decisions for those teams, and shipped many successful products/features while working with those teams.* You have successfully mentored multiple junior engineers and new members of the team up to autonomy.* You have been responsible for fixing time-sensitive regressions, or responding to incidents, and are recognized by the incident team or release management for exceptional work.For any of our Software Engineer promotions, your manager needs to go stand in front of all the other managers in the horizontal/vertical who have Software Engineers and explain why the specific person they are promoting should be promoted. It's an opportunity for every other manager, who will on occasion need to explain to one or more of their reports why they ***weren't*** promoted, to call bullshit. HR director and the chief of the particular vertical/horizontal are always in the room, and typically facilitate as well as ultimately have the final say (chief as budget owner) in whether a promotion is approved/denied.We have plenty of people who have been here 6+ years and have no interest in matriculating to a senior position. We have senior people who have been here 10+ years and have no interest in matriculating to a staff+ position. That's perfectly fine because we will always need gifted technical people who both enjoy and excel at the \"chop wood, carry water\" work.",

It's more like... if you're at mid level, you're consistently exceeding expectations.not to say that you can't become a senior just by time served but, in my experience that's not the way it usually happens.It's not just like... output. More like, you have these traits/habits that combined with your skill, you're clearly a Senior.One of my previous teams, there was like 6-8 of us mostly mid-sr. One of the devs had been there 3ish yrs, maybe her second job, I was surprised to find out she wasn't Sr - because of the sense i got from how she operates. But she got promoted maybe after my first month there. There was one official Senior on that team already that was clearly outdoing everyone on the team. It wasn't a competitive thing, it was more like \"goddamn how did you do all of that?\".And IMO usually the Seniors have these traits:* mentioned above, they're always exceeding expectations* they can take ambiguity and figure it out and get it done* instead of asking to do something, they just do it* the don't have to be asked to mentor someonethat last bullet has a bit of a blurry line, some companies will make it a point for a Senior to be assigned to someone for mentorship. That being said, people are gonna come to you for guidance, you shouldn't deny that because you're not officially their mentor",

Its ability to search through the codebase for context and examples is very helpful.3. Give it context. Point it in the direction of a similar test suite with patterns you want it to emulate. If you just tell it to write tests for Service X, it will do whatever it wants - which is usually not what you want. Point out patterns you want it to emulate (e.g., “Use fluent assertions and create separate expectation objects to compare results against”)4. Don’t trust the tests it creates. Testing is meant to find the cracks and AI is an agreeable little sycophant. It’s just trying to get tests to pass. So there’s a balance you need to find where you come up with how to test and the AI just writes it. Otherwise you’re in danger of coming up with tests that are meaningless but pass and create false coverage.",

My prompts for larger changes are usually about 2 or 3 good paragraphs.There's 2 approaches to this:* learn how to provide all the necessary requirements and context so that an agent can do everything all at once* break up your work into small bite sized pieces and have the agent work on those one by one.

When I was at Compass we went from 150 to 440 engineers in a year and I sat through probably hundreds of technical screens. The correlation between leetcode performance and actual job success is... not great.What I've seen work better is giving them a real problem from your actual workflow. Like pull up some messy production data and ask them to write a query to find something specific. Then watch how they think through edge cases, ask clarifying questions, handle nulls and duplicates. For Python, give them a small script you actually use - maybe something that parses logs or transforms data between formats. See if they can extend it or fix a bug you introduce. The best candidates will ask about the business context, not just dive into coding.Also consider splitting the time - 15 minutes on a practical coding exercise, then 15 minutes discussing their approach to debugging, testing, code reviews. Ask about a time their code broke in production and how they handled it. Or show them a piece of your actual codebase and see if they can understand what it does. These conversations tell you way more about whether they'll succeed than watching them reverse a linked list. I've hired people who bombed leetcode but were incredible at understanding business problems and writing maintainable code that other humans could actually work with.",

Actual job performance can vary on multitudes of factors, like motivation, how does the job help them accomplish their professional goals, etc. Also, 30 minutes is a short time to make a decision on someone who you might be working with for potentially years. I split my interviews in 4 parts:1: Introduction about me, what my team is looking for and why they've been selected for an interview, their background and most recent projects they've worked on and what was their role. This could be 20-30 minutes. 2: Behavioral side, to assess if they can handle the business side, how easy/difficult would it be to work alongside, etc. -15 minutes 3: Technical Assessment: Prepare questions based on their resume to assess if they understand what they've mentioned. If someone says, I did X in my previous job. Can you explain how you did X? - 15 minutes 4: Questions from Candidates: The quality of the questions help assess how likely they want this job and understand what's required of them them to be successful-15 minutes(Can be longer if the questions needs to be answered) Pro Tip: An ideal candidate fits 80-85% of your criteria and has room to grow. If they meet 100% of the requirements, they're more likely to outgrow the job position quickly and move somewhere else.",

It's usually pretty obvious within a minute or two if the person actually has the level of python expeirence they claim (again you'd be surprised at how many people say they have several years of experience as a senior python engineer then it takes them 5 minutes to remember how to define a function or whatever) and then you can spend the rest of the time gauging their communication skills etc.We actually measure internally what % of candidates pass the initial 30 min tech screen and then fail later rounds of tech screens and have experimented with lots of questions, the fizzbuzz-style one had the best outcomes.",

I always had to adjust my time estimates up 2-3x when dealing with the contractor folksWhatever the reality is for employees inside these companies is immaterial to me, but my first-hand experience with them on a professional level is unfavorable.From the interviewer side: I've interviewed a few dozen people from these places for senior-level roles, mainly from Cognizant, TCS, and WiPro - overall not good candidates from my sample size.From that perspective I think the actual work they do or get assigned to ends up a limiting factor for a lot of these candidates. My experience is these shops aren't hired because they are going to bring some amazing insights to a project, they're mostly brought on to take care of essentially side projects or be line cooks - don't need to lead or design anything.",

Someone would respond then \"make your own startup\" but from what I evidenced from the peers who are cofounders, the workload for a tech startup cofounder is more like 24/7 for worse pay.

When you talk to the hiring manager,you will find out rather quickly if the so-called hard requirements are actually a critical part of the skillset you will use. Why?Most hiring managers are spastic and pulled in 50 different directions, so the time and attention they put into job posting templates for critical and preferred skills is low. Reuse of templates is common. One time when I left a job, they reposted my job, and the skills were so misaligned that I could not have been qualified for a role I had actually done.",

For example, when you know people underestimate, why aren't you calling them out then and there? I don't mean it in a accusatory way, I mean are you aware of where the discrepancy is coming from, e.g. \"code complete\" vs \"rolled out 100%\", does it account for KTLO/distractions, high intensity work (focused dev) vs low intensity work (babysitting some request to another team), are there unspoken social pressure dynamics, etc. And have you articulated the impact of these heuristics on your team's estimation skills? I've literally had to tell people \"don't tell me the number you think I want to hear\", for example, when I smelled a \"going through the motions\" estimate.On the code quality front, \"letting them failing\" is another way of saying to give people autonomy to potentially shoot their own foot (and then own up to it). Rather than taking over the driving seat, you can ask questions like \"what have you tried\" or \"have you considered X\" to put the bulk of investigation work back on their court and indicate that they own the outcome of that task.",

EM does a lot more in the realm of fielding requests for work coming from other teams. Understands our capabilities, commits us to work that is in our ballparkand so our tasks to start are usually very broad in definition, something like \"Add Drawer Login Component\" with really just the design files attached and some bigger acceptance criteriait's on us to break that down to the smaller manageable tasks, and point them as a group. Then they're just added to the queue for the sprint, that's what we've committed to. All unassigned.and so now, anyone can pick up any of those tasks, let's say given an assumption we all have similar skillsets. Maybe a junior picks up a task that is a little more difficult; they can either take on the challenge, or maybe a more mid or senior stops them and says - \"oh hey this might be a little more involved, but you can help me build this part of it\" and create another ticket.So now we're all trusted to get the job done by doing all the discovery and now we have to work a little bit more together, and everyone has an idea of who's taking what. Junior A is prob waiting on bigger design things from Senior B before they can start. The senior would be inclined to prep the junior on what they have to do. or get them to focus on something else while Senior B finishes.You, just kinda make sure that you're aware of the progress, and the more senior engineers are there to identify risks. And you need this teamwork to happen, in order for you to be able to focus on the more important thingsEngineers handle their own PR reviews, since they've been working more closely together they already have context of the changes, they've prob already done an initial once over, and things move a long quicker.anyway i think you get it but keep in mind this is the IDEAL state of things.

I’ve tried encouraging them to talk to me at anytime, set aside specific open hours on my calendar where we can get together, quickly responding to any messages, reminding everyone that I’m available both before & after standup every day, I welcome draft PRs to give my opinions on before they go too far off in the weeds. So far none of this has worked, still the first week of a 2 week sprint there are never any questions or concerns brought to me, and it’s not until the last few days of a sprint that crappy PRs start coming my way. I’ve had enough, so I just keep rejecting and commenting on the PRs and they keep rolling into next sprint which gets our scrum master all up in arms. I’m not their manager, but I’m one of only a handful of people whose approval is required on basically every PR.So I’ve got my popcorn out and am watching what comes of all of this. Obviously to take this approach you have to be confident of your continued employment (which I am) and have the higher ups on board with your approach.

        "body": "60 hours a week is a solid chunk of time to become good at anything, which equates to about 3120 hours yearly.Now here's the kicker, you either like your job or you don't.If you do, then you need to apply 20 extra hours to working more (if you're salary, if not then up to you),or if you don't like your job then apply that 20 extra hours on another subject. If you choose not to apply that time to your job then you're looking at roughly 1000 hours a year, which is what you need to \"master\" or \"grab the hammer\" I call it. Some guys spend 20 years in C++ optimization and still find new things out today, so they are \"masters\" or \"able to drive nails in one hit\". That's truly how I look at it, can you walk into an environment and within 10 minutes narrow down a root cause. If you can't find something that quick then you haven't spent at least 1000 hours studying.If you choose to apply those skills to your job then you also need to make sure you aren't a slave to it, then people can control you and make your life a living hell. If anyone questions why you're there so late/early, or you login for a lot of time, then you can gently slip in that it's part of your \"professional education\". Literally use those words.If you're Indian or Asian (in those countries) then I would be careful with what you give your boss, they could become abusive. If it's an American employer then feel free to work for free. Why? because you're not working for free, you're making yourself look better (job security) and you're progressing your skillset. The Key:Do not think that your devotion to the company will result in that job security or professional progression. You're using them for education while paying your bills. Companies will chew you up and spit you out so be careful with how you practice things at work. The Middleground:Study outside of your job things that will make you useful then either grab tickets you know you can do, or communicate that you want to try this because you've been working on it alone. Why not just self-study and keep it private? Well a homelab isn't going to teach you how to upgrade pods and update images in a production environment, you can mock something like it, but when your boss is breathing down your neck and crap is running down your leg then you'll be glad you worked in a real env. The Takeaway:Take advantage of having a job and a place where you can see things break live, that's where the money is made, not when everything is running well.If you are truly just a curious individual then forget everything I said and protect 20 hours a week to explore whatever you want. Having a job means you can buy GPUs, electronics, hardware, etc. maybe not the best but something for you to work with. No one skill will make you permanently secured in your job, no one job will make you automatically rehireable, but constantly learning new things and \"getting a hold of the hammer\", will keep you happily employed. Me? well I'm unemployed because well...I don't know really...actually I suck at Leetcode and haven't used NodeJs a lot. However, if you have a job then you're in good standing.",

If you’re struggling, let your manager/senior know rather than failing silently. There is nothing wrong with struggling. But there is something wrong if you cry in quiet and put your team and deliverables into risk. If you let them know, they can also communicate with whoever is necessary and take action earlier. This way, if you deliver stuff, perfect move on to the next thing. If you struggle and let them know, you will get the help you needed and everyone will still be happy because they know they can trust you.And second part is learn to be independent and you need to carry some of the burden the team have. Your existence should not be a burden for someone else but rather help them to carry it. Few examples of this could be, actively review pull requests. Don’t wait someone else to tell you to fix something if you see a problem. Write documentation if you know something. This is kinda related to company size but if you are working with different teams from different departments and they need help, be the guy who they get that needed help from.",

Azure is _more_ than thriving.Second, look at the company in question’s health. Specifically, review their recent stock price history (if they are a publicly traded company), see if they are operating at a net loss, and read reviews from employees to see if there are any negative trends to watch out for if you were to join. (For example, if one employee review says that everyone backstabs each other, but the other 300 show nothing but praise, the backstabbing claim was most likely made from a bitter person who got fired, or at least it is very uncommon at that company. However, if more than half of the reviews indicate serious backstabbing problems, then yeah, that’s a major red flag.)",

        "body": "This is kind of a brain dump, but hopefully it helps:There are four types of layoffs (at least):1. The company is doing bad and they need to cut costs to stay afloat2. Corporate greed - the company is doing perfectly fine but the shareholders aren't seeing enough profit so we're gonna lay a bunch of people off to get more \"efficient\", which actually means \"overwork the shit out of people\"3. Bloat - the company is doing fine, but there's a bunch of people that aren't actually working on projects that are valuable and the company can realistically not justify keeping them around4. A team is no longer necessary because the product/service/whatever they support is getting axed because it sucks - the rest of the company is fineAnd that is the order of how unappetizing it should be to join that company. A company that is struggling so much that it needs to lay people off is not necessarily a company that will turn it around because of the layoffs - things might get even worse after the layoffs.A company that is laying people off because of greed is going to have a horrendous work culture where people are going to have to work long hours, where a lot of knowledge will have recently left the company, etc. So you're not necessarily at risk of getting laid off, but you're going to be dealing with a pretty shitty work environment for a while.A company that allows bloat to happen now might allow bloat to happen again - if they aren't disciplined in their hiring, it means there's a risk that you might be the next bloat they get rid of. So this is going to be a role in which you're going to want to quickly make sure you're attaching yourself to valuable projects.And lastly - sometimes shit doesn't work out. We're seeing this with Amazon for example - you signed up to work on Alexa and now Alexa looks like it's going nowhere. It sucks, but sometimes you do need to get rid of like an entire department because it's just not what the company can justify. And as long as you're not joining a highly experimental arm of the company, this shouldn't really impact you much.I think by now there are very few companies that haven't done layoffs, and a company that is conservative enough to never overhire will have their own issues - namely, probably some stagnation and some lagging the market. Not always, but often.",

Stability of position may \"feel\" stronger and your psyche will appreciate it. The people will appear more at ease and will usually be more pleasant to work with.Management will probably have a better vision and plan to steer the company. With a company doing layoffs expect lots of changes in direction and reorgs.So basically, your thought exercise while not totally impossible is hinging on two assumptions: the company was hurting before and the layoffs are improving their standing, and that these companies would be even interested in hiring in the first place. If you were even able to get an opening at these companies, would you even want to work there? Maybe, but unlike a share of a company you purchase you have to live that work every day and suffer from the environment for your livelihood's sake:Source: survived several major layoffs at medium co for the last several years.",

        "body": "Hey, I’ve been through similar experiences and have a few opinions to share.1. You’ll improve code quality on the job. The alternative is to look at more code (open source) but I don’t recommend that unless you’re really passionate about it. Otherwise, it might add more stress. So, just try to criticize and improve your code base at work. Practice articulating what looks good and what looks bad, and why. Experiment with new ideas and you’ll learn faster. There are many signals to look out for in a codebase: does any part of your dev flow slow you down when building new features, are any parts confusing if a new dev were to work on it, do you have to update multiple places in code for a simple feature, etc. If you have few complaints then maybe your structure is solid after all. If you do identify issues, chances are that it’s something someone else ran into and found a solution for, so it’s always worth searching for how others approach things.2. The only way is to study and to practice. There are tons of online resources. One that I’ve used is GreatFrontEnd, but try googling or searching this sub to find some structured learning resources. Also, ChatGPT is a great tool to ask dumb questions and get good feedback. Chat is also a great tool to ask your exact question : “how do I rebuild my fundamentals in a structured way.”3. Similar answer: study and practice, using online resources. I’ll bet you know a lot more than you give yourself credit for, but maybe don’t have the language to articulate ideas. Again, you can treat AI tools as a dev buddy: before developing a feature, create your rough design idea and ask Chat for feedback. (Typically this would be done with colleagues, but if you don’t have other devs as resources, AI is a solid tool imo.)4. I recommend stopping your weed consumption until you feel less anxious about your career. If you can’t cut it out completely, I recommend reserving it for a specific time and in smaller doses, like at night after all responsibilities are done for the day and you’re ready to wind down for bed. This is a nice middle ground because quitting cold turkey can lead to relapse and a negative spiral. Reserving it for night time only is a guilt-free window for you. This way, you’re using weed as a reward rather than a coping mechanism. Just make sure you have a solid and consistent waking schedule. :)5. This is more life advice than just career advice: we’re human beings with finite time in this life. You’ll never have time for everything so a good skill to learn is time management. With this career revamp you’re working on, write out everything that’s on your mind, and then choose the ones of highest importance (it’s subjective and only you can decide that). For each item that you’ve prioritized and deemed important enough to focus on, break it down into smaller chunks. Rinse and repeat until you have less overwhelming and more actionable tasks. And most importantly, do the tasks! If they’re small enough to complete, it helps you psychologically build momentum. If tasks seem daunting it’s usually because they feel more ambiguous and that’s when our minds resort to coping strategies (like smoking weed or scrolling on your phone). In these cases it’s okay to dive in and try things out until it feels less ambiguous, and from there you can continue the process of identifying and breaking things down into a todo list (aka backlog).One last thing, I’d recommend looking into therapy as an additional resource. I know that it can be expensive and might feel useless, but here’s my take on it: it’s not some sort of silver bullet solution to all your problems. If you can consider “cutting down on weed and strengthening my SWE foundation” as a long-term project, then therapy is a great resource to use along the way. It’s similar to what you did here, you posted how you were feeling and some advice and strategies were recommended. But with consistent therapy, each session is like a check-in: here’s what we talked about last time, here’s what I tried, and here’s where I struggled. It’s a continuous, iterative development process, much like how we build good software products!Good luck, you’ve got this!",

The simplest, hardest, and most effective place to start is to quit weed entirely and start running, or anything you can tolerate that gets your heart rate up. Eat candy, drink some beer, watch TV, do whatever helps to avoid actually smoking weed. If you have a good support network, lean on them. But doing whatever you can to get your heart rate up and not smoke weed is going to help you more than anything. You can DM me if you want, it's a pretty weird and isolating kind of addiction that most people don't really take seriously unless they've been through it",

They may understand what the code is doing, but never understand why AI decided on its approach. So if asked how to solve the same problem, even at a high level, these people generally cant come up with an answer.This results in a lot of suboptimal code as the developer settles for \"it works\" because they dont know how good code should look like. Right now AI is decently good, but in my experience, the more you have to keep re-prompting for changes, the worse and worse it gets. So not having a clear direction for what something should look like before engaging AI can sometimes lead to horrible code as you don't know how to course correct because you dont even know what the course is.As a new junior developer, your work is probably very simple and things that AI can handle really really well. But as you progress in your career and tackle more complex issues that AI just isnt good enough at yet, you will need to have critical thinking and problem solving skills that I think you are not developing because you are so reliant on AI.This ended up being a bit of a soap box for me, but tldr: solve the problem on your own and use AI as a faster typing interface so you can develop your problem solving skills better.",

A little harmful to readability, but most compilers will disregard these anyway.One recent example I've seen, is enforcing \"code deletions and additions must have test coverage\" on a large legacy/enterprise codebase. Effectively, what this means is that you either need a lead to sign-off on an exception (pretty easy to get), or that when you change the legacy functions, you must add enough test coverage to \"prove\" that it works.Otherwise, the scanners because just another step to the compiler. Probably okay to add in the beginning stages of a project, but quite burdensome to carte blanche add after a few years.",

In terms of transitioning understanding the domain you’d be working in is as important if not more so than your technical experience, so if you can find an SA role that is focused on the industry you work in now that’s probably the best way to get your foot in the door. Interview process was relatively easy, not highly technical. I was asked to describe in detail my technical work on my resume to basically check that I have a basic level of technical skill and can approach a new project, do research, build any required new skills, and execute, but no leetcode or anything. Obviously being personable and charismatic is relatively important as well. I’m at a Mag7 company. I believe SAs here are paid roughly 10% less than equivalent level SWEs but the pay is more than double what I was making in my last job at a Fortune 25 non-tech company as a SWE. WLB here is good with the caveat being that any SA role is likely going to require some travel. I’ve traveled approximately 6 times in the last year which isn’t terrible but I have colleagues who are traveling once a month or more.I’d say career trajectory is good, in my company SA has a high level of visibility, and because it’s a very versatile role that spans sales, product, and engineering I think it would be fairly easy to transfer into TPM or engineering from here. I don’t personally find the work as fulfilling as SWE but I also think that’s partially because I haven’t quite hit my stride yet. I have zero regrets about the transition in because of what I gained financially. I may try to transfer into a SWE role once I’m able to though.",

        "body": "Hey, I really feel for you. I went through something similar transitioning from Java to React and honestly, it was brutal at first. The whole functional programming paradigm, ES6, components, props, how renders work, Redux - all of it felt like trying to drink from a fire hose. I had anxiety and panic attacks over it. So I want you to know: this transition is genuinely hard, and you're not failing because you're finding it hard.That perfectionism/ADHD piece your therapist mentioned is huge though. Modern frontend development, especially in complex codebases, IS a constant stream of \"wtf is happening\" moments. Even seniors get lost in deeply nested components with no documentation. The difference is they've built up tolerance for not knowing and can sit in that discomfort longer.Also, you lost your mentor. That's massive. You went from having someone who understood the codebase to basically being on your own in a system with minimal documentation.The isolation is probably making everything worse too. Even if you go to the office and those people don't understand your specific codebase - they've been through what you're going through. We all have, even if we don't show it or are too proud to admit it. You could try working from coffee shops sometimes too, just to break up being alone all day.For me, it took 1-2 months of really intense, focused work before things clicked. But what forced me to lock in was when the stakes got really real. That kind of pressure made me focus in a way nothing else does, but it's also not sustainable or healthy long-term.Your manager's job is to help you thrive - you could try being really open with them about needing more structured support after your mentor left. Pair programming helped me a ton - you get to ask questions in real time and it actually makes both people more productive. If you ask your manager or even just another dev to pair with you on some tickets, most people would probably be down. And when you're stuck solo, timebox it - give yourself 30 minutes to struggle, then ask.You're 9 months in. That's still early. But you also need to be honest with yourself about whether this specific situation is set up for you to succeed.",

Be friendly with your interviewer but professional at the same time - they're looking more so for somebody they can see themselves working with more so than somebody flexing their experience, your resume has all that already.",

Think about times you helped junior devs or onboarded someone, even informally.I would recommend preparing with some mock interview tools. I've done the same—at least for someone like me who gets anxious a lot, they really help. There are multiple tools available; I tried Final Round AI's mock interview, and it's quite good.Don't oversell your impact too much, they can smell BS from a mile away.

Just answering the question is not going to differentiate you from your competition. So when you are preparing ask yourself how a lot and be sure to incorporate that into your answer. For example, tell me about a time you couldn’t get consensus on something. You could say, I got feedback. How is by holding a meeting, getting feedback from a doc, one on one questions. Why is because it’s good to offer many avenues of feedback. Etc. Next, if you can, be sure to listen to the interviewer and offer ways to help them if possible. For example, after they ask you this question, you could ask, have you been having a hard time getting consensus on your team? What a coincidence, I got consensus all the time with these strategies, here’s how I dealt with disagreements, etc.",

Things I genuinely cared about.There's a \"greater picture\" that I picked up over time. Talking about what I like and dislike in tech stacks, how we don't always get to use the technology we want, never enough hours in the day to do everything we want, how I've held offshore accountable but no micro-managed them, how I never complained about 5am deployments because I don't want to burden someone else, how I brought new hires up to speed when there's no set program, etc.All stuff I picked up with work experience. Nothing I read on a message board or guide. I don't force any of those topics into the interview but I go into them if related to the conversation. It's a long list.I try to come across as semi-entertaining. The interviewer should like listening to me speak. I sound confident. I also speak more slowly in interviews than IRL to give the interviewer more time to take notes and understand and I can also start an answer without fully thinking it through.

The company was a private non-tech company in non-tech city.The bar was pretty low for entry as we didn't compete for talent hat could get jobs at actual tech companies. I may have been a \"high performer\" at this company, but realistically I was still a pretty shit SWE with 15 YOE when compared to SWEs at actual tech companies.> had disagreements with management that ended up costing me my job. Depending on what the disagreements are management may be in the right. I lost a job because of \"disagreements\", but it basically came down to I called the out on their shit. There as a lot of lip service to burnout and shit like that, but nothing every changed because the \"project is too important\".The project is so important that we were 15 months late getting FDA approval on the medical devices and still got a company party celebrating the victory. Never mind there was 0 effort to figure out why were were late as to no repeat mistakes. It was probably the right decision to just let me go. Funny thing was, after the left me go over the next 10 months 5 out of 7 Senior SWEs left along with 2 other midlevel SWEs. > I am already struggling to get responses since losing my job. I know I need to be prepared to be job searching for 6 months, but other people I talk to that have experience seem to have no problem having recruiters reach out or getting responses/interviews.It's a tough market out there and everybody is different. Maybe you are not marketing your value well on your resume or applying to the wrong jobs. If you are only looking at top tech companies then you have to expect competition for people working at other top tech companies.I have also been looking for a new job over the last couple of years and this year I got very few calls to interview from my applications. I worked on safety critical medical devices for 15 years and have lead teams over that time in addition to being an IC. I'm basically an embedded application SWE working with mostly c and c++ which is not really what the industry wants.It's not even an issue of only wanting remote work as I am more than happy to go into the office, but sadly I cannot just relocate anywhere due to family reasons. That doesn't mean no relocation, but the city needs to be a place the whole family is in on or people are going to have a bad time.>So far, I have gotten nothing but 2 rejections (no interview), and 2 ATS rejections from LinkedIn easy apply jobs. I'm not just using easy apply, but maybe something is wrong with my resume?That's nothing you have barely started interviewing.>I'm not just using easy apply, but maybe something is wrong with my resume? Post your resume in the resume review thread or on resume review subreddits to get feedback. Things like use STAR and show impact is a common comment.>Is the job market just that toast right now, even for people that have a little bit of work experience? Companies are hiring, but the supply of candidates is large and hiring managers are being selective. They feel the need a close to perfect fit because if you are not it then somebody else probably is. >Is it because its the end of the year and about to be holiday vacation time?Probably part if it as hiring slows down around the holidays and picks up in the new year.",

I've mainly learned by trying to write software, failing a few times, and figuring out what works and doesn't.Just break things down into one manageable step at a time, and soon you'll have well written code. One piece of advice - only suggest improvements if you can demonstrate their use. No one wants to hear how a proper deployment pipeline will save time, prevent bugs, etc. But, they will listen if you implement a simple pipeline that shows what you're advocating for.If something is useful, implement it and prove it and report your results to the team. They'll see your worth and possibly be more open to implementing better coding practices.",

I have since interviewed for a few companies that were headhunting for experience in Go, and I will say I've had more inquiries from recruiters because they noticed that experience on LinkedIn over my more extensive experience with JavaScript and Ruby. As I'm sure you've noticed, the more programming you do the easier it becomes to pick up new languages. Python will be but a breeze after Go.

It's fun to teleport across your document and edit entire words with as little as 1 or 2 keystrokes. Start off with online cheat sheets to start off with momentum, after you learn to navigate, you can fill in the gaps yourself by zipping around Vim's help feature.",

        "body": "I have three pieces of advice from someone who has been in this game a long time and who has been in roles where I didn't feel like I was successful.First: If you onboarded at the end of August, then you are less than three months into this job. I have never been at a company where anyone really got up to speed in less than six months. If it's a large company, a fast-moving company, or both, it can take closer to a year.Two: We are all our own worst critics. We see all of our deficits and fuckups. Meanwhile, when we see other people's work, it's because they landed something, solved some problem, gave some slick presentation, etc. Don't compare yourselves to others. You will invariably be comparing your messy practice sessions to their greatest hits.Three: When the great jazz guitarist Pat Metheny was asked by an interviewer how he got so good, he responded \"easy, I made sure I was the worst guy in every band I was in.\" Talk to the people whose work you admire. Ask them how they think about problems. If you see a slick piece of code or a clever solution, give it the old \\`git blame\\`, figure out who wrote it, and message them saying it's cool and asking how they came up with it. Pay attention in code reviews. Get a mentor who is more senior in the same org and role as you. Even if you are the worst guy in the band right now, *that's the position where you do the most improving*.I've been where you are now, and it sucks, but it doesn't suck forever. Stick it out, ask lots of questions, and trust that you'll get better with time.",

Last the year the US graduated [170,000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86rdUhx-b4U&t=532s) CS majors, up from [50,000](https://archive.is/mPNcX) in 2012.No one cares your side projects unless they go viral. No one will look at a GitHub you list on your resume that could easily be plagiarized. HR doesn't code. Can code on your own if you want to learn tech stacks but no need to polish for sharing.You're seeking entry level work. You just have to know the basics. Most of CS is work experience. Your #1 goal is to get an internship in any part of CS. Oh you know this. If you don't, your odds of having a job at graduation tank. You're competitive applying in your 3rd semester for the upcoming summer.An AI job is not an impossibility with work experience but the real AI work requires graduate school education. Can be in CS or Electrical or Computer Engineering. Entry level job might masquerade it's AI to bait and switch you. Oh you can use GitHub Copilot, big whoop.University prestige is very important for consideration of internships and entry level jobs, then maybe never matters again. If you're US, I call Tier 1 a Top 40 or 50 program or #1 or #2 in your state. If you're at shit tier, you need to transfer up. You're not going to have 200+ companies recruiting on campus for CS and engineering students and HR is more likely to not read your resume.For now, make good grades, apply yourself and pursue what you're passionate about, whether in CS or not. Recruiters like seeing passion. I was into camping and hiking. Hackathons are a decent use of your time. Working with others is a valuable skill, both in general and to recruiters.",
