Anyone who have used spark knows that Spark has mediocre performance, but it is pretty robust and easy to scale.I think it would be interesting if you can try to make commit to duckdb or clickhouse and see if you can improve their implementation.",

DuckDB is far more advanced than just an implementation - handling data types, optimize query plan, and it needs to consider other things like scalability and generalization for other cases. So of course it's understandable to have worst performance than this implementation.If to compare the performance, I would suggest comparing to solutions like 1 Bil rows challenge solution.Dont get me wrong.

Handling a collision at write time would mean shifting the entire array in memory.And if you are pre-allocating the memory for collisions, even if you account only for one you are basically doubling the size of the table. And if you have another collision beyond the pre-allocation and to avoid array shifting you are storing it in the next available collision slot to leverage linear reading, you are then negating the benefits of the prefetch if you're unable to find a free collision slot in the prefetched data.If the implementation falls into any of the above, I can only assume this implementation would only yield any real world benefits exclusively in tables that you almost never write to, which you did mention indeed, but I'm not sure how often you stumble upon such cases and how big these tables tend to be in practice to warrant a higher performance algorithm for joining them.Super cool research nonetheless, kudos to you!",

I’m not sure there’s a direct point of comparison with SQLMesh, but here’s a quick summary of how lineage tracking is implemented in my demo:1. **Kafka** – No official integration; implemented using a custom single message transform.2. **Flink** – For Flink 1.x, only the DataStream API is officially supported. I implemented lineage in two ways: * **Table API job**: manual integration * **DataStream API job**: official job-listener–based method3. **Spark** – Officially supported via adding an extra listener.",

It's just that the word junior isn't in your job title.In both, junior specific roles, as in, have junior in the title, are rare.I'm of the opinion the secret sauce is to teach yourself a little bit and go for mid level roles. There's a lot less competition because the vast majority of people are looking to be taught by more experienced people rather than teaching yourself on the job. The amount of resources and information available on the internet for doing most things IT related is staggering to the point it's more learning about what to search for.",

There aren't really junior DE roles. The typical path, and what you've identified, would be to work as an analyst or scientist to get exposure to these tools and technologies and then make the move afterwards.One emerging role that presents an excellent path to data engineering is analytics engineering. This role is a blend between data analyst and data engineer, doing a lot of data transformation and sometimes moving data with no code tools (fivetran, stitch etc).",

        "body": "I find this happens sometimes with data projects with the \"newness\" wearing off. What I mean by that is if you're new at a company there's a lot of learning and how to implement new technologies. But if you've been there for a while it's just the \"same pipeline template\" or the \"same SQL script\" that gets old and boring. If there was a rewrite of the system to something new, that's interesting because it freshens up what you've been working on. Obviously one way around this is to get a new job, but I feel that sometimes merely introducing something new can make things exciting again. For example, are things written in Pandas? Try Polars. Things like that might help you keep motivation.",

With the terrible job market currently, I’d also recommend staying in your current job to fund your masters degree on the side. It’ll definitely inject a renewed sense of excitement you used to feel early on. By the time you’re done with your masters (1.5-2 years), you’ll be ready to look for a more suitable job and you won’t have a hole in your pocket from the expense.",

If you've reach a level where you manage to have a good position with 30h a week in an office job with good pay, you are better off than maybe 90% of employees. I am afraid it does not get much better than that with this level of comfort, you may have unrealistic fantasies about other software jobs. There's an angle I have explored sometimes, which is working for an organization that makes you feel better ethically, such as a public service. The problem is that they always have worse working conditions and pay. I don't think a masters is going to help you get a better IT job as opposed to more years of experience, at your level of experience diplomas don't matter that much for recruiters I think. If you do it, do it for your own desire to learn without expecting too much from the career perspective, and try to do it while keeping a job, maybe some company will support it. Finally, as everyone else said, absolutely invest the money, free time and peace of mind your current stable position provides into your personal projects, relatives and hobbies. Work to live, don't live to work.",

        "body": "Although there could be many if we go deep down documentation of both Airflow and Dagster but on top of my head in this context I would say they are 1. Dagster is asset-native; its primary abstraction is the data asset itself (a table, a model). You define the asset, and Dagster figures out the tasks needed to create it. Airflow is task-native; its primary abstraction is the task (a unit of work). You define the task, and can now declare what assets it produces. This makes Dagster's worldview intrinsically data-centric, while Airflow's is operationally-centric with data-awareness added on.2. In Dagster, lineage is automatic. When you define an asset that depends on another, the lineage is instantly captured in a unified graph. In Airflow, you must manually declare lineage by specifying inlets and outlets for each task or using the @asset decorator. This requires extra effort and is prone to being overlooked or misconfigured. 3. Dagster's integration understands your dbt project natively. It automatically ingest your dbt manifest and displays every model, source, and test as a first-class asset in its graph with no extra code. Airflow's integration orchestrates dbt runs. It excels at running the dbt run command as a task within a workflow, but the deep, model-level visibility and lineage is not inherent and requires more setup to achieve. Airflow will try to somehow catch up to Dagster by narrowing this gap, not just copying the exact way of doing things!",

But none of that matters. Suck up to leadership. Do what they want, not what you think your career needs. Do enough to keep them happy and don’t worry about the technical optimization if it’s going to slow down the work. Eventually, one of two things will happen. 1. a better opp will come and you’ll leave. 2. You’ll eventually be able to hire someone who knows more than you. Could be a senior engineer who doesn’t want to get involved in non-tech stuff, so you can manage the relationships and goals AND learn from them. Or it might be someone who, frankly, could do your job better but simply doesn’t have the trust of leadership like you do. Doesn’t matter. This may have sidelined your growth as an IC a little, but it’s absolutely sling-shotted your opportunity for face time and relationship management. You gotta take the good with the bad and trust me there is bad on both sides. You will make mistakes. You will waste time and money. But in the end nothing matters other than keeping your boss happy.

Take every opportunity to learn. Take online courses and build things. I became a DE by taking a bunch of courses, presenting a business case that transitioning to DE software could save us money, and building it. Now I use it to solve every problem I can to build my skills. I even did the courses on the clock to meet my company's yearly training time goal.You mentioned contractors, you may not have a senior employee, but those contractors know more than you. Hire them to do the things you don't know how to do, and then have them teach you. Include it in the SOW as \"knowledge transfer\" or \"support time\". This is literally how I learned a bunch of Azure products. Now the next time that task comes up, you know how to do it, and you don't have to hire the contractor.Lastly, get a project manager. Make the case that you can't be in meetings AND be building stuff, and that having a PM will save you on contractor costs by letting you build more things yourself.Leverage your company for your personal growth, it's a win-win.",

And partitions are part of the data model that you need to create and maintain over time. And another hint - architecture is not only a paper exercise. It involves POC work to proof certain hypothesis’s. I would ask myself and the organization - What is the vision and the goal of the architecture activities? Could be reduce cost, performance, scaling, ease of use …But usually it happens to what happened to you - a leader that might not exactly what data architecture is thought or was told that he needs an architect. The leader nominates a person and provides vague instructions. The pitfall is often that after 1 year everyone asks what is the architect actually doing, is he involved in projects …",

We do have DEs that insist on using SSIS and since it is SSIS they are currently getting paged for production problems because of jobs randomly failing.Urgent requests are a different issue. My life is basically bouncing from one 'urgent' request to another while I watch my ADO queue slowly get longer.My team 100% supports flexible schedules. I've been explicitly told if I need to go run errands or something do it. I've also been explicitly told they don't want to track my PTO so don't record it. Just let my immediate director know I'll be out.We don't do standups those are a complete waste of time. I have stakeholder meetings for each project weekly. I have the flexibility to call them off if there is nothing I have to bring to the meeting.",

If Flink was as bad as in your case suggests no serious company would consider it.Since you use it for stream processing you very likely partition the input using keyBy(). Make sure that cardinality of the key value is finite as state is kept by key. E.g. if you keyBy eventID which is uuid, job state will grow indefinitely.Alternatively setup a timer to cleanup the state manually.If you use FlinkQSL it's rather easy to miss such things as you need to think in terms of unbound streams rather than in terms of db tables.Regarding rewriting your stream processing job in Go (or any other language). Writing stream processing job is not that difficult. Writing stream processing job that is fault tolerant, can scale beyond single machine, supports SQL to write logic, makes checkpoints, holds state for longer than your Kafka retention period, guarantees exactly-once processing etc etc etc is more of a challenge. Think twiceWhy do you think Flink exists if everyone could just write their stream jobs? But maybe your organization does not have the challanges Flink supposed to address. Then Flink could indeed be an overkill.",

So the Pulumi Python code can live within the same repo as our Python business-logic (actually APIs in our case) and be run by our CICD process with GitHub Actions. Looks like it supports a few other languages besides Python as well. The only real headache I've run into here is needing separate environments for the business-logic code vs the Pulumi code because of dependency clashes between the two. We already use UV for the business-logic code environment so I can probably manage it better all in UV but haven't gotten to merging the two.",

In practice we pick 128 or 256 buckets, write both tables with dynamic partition pruning off, then the shuffle map stage almost disappears and the join drops from 45 min to under 10. Z-ordering helps read performance and filter push-downs, but the join still shuffles because the hash distribution of the customerid won’t line up across files. The only time Z-order beats bucketing here is when the join key also drives most queries with range filters; otherwise it’s a nice-to-have. Pain points: keeping bucket counts in sync across incremental writes, compaction to avoid many small bucket files, and limiting buckets so Spark doesn’t create too many tasks. I’ve moved between Databricks Delta, BigQuery, and DreamFactory as integration layers, and the bucketed join logic is what consistently saved compute. So if the join is always on customerid and the tables are stable, bucketing still wins.",

Seems like Dremio allows users to build folder structures to align data product collections with the business model (e.g. sales folder, finance folder), so a different way of organizing your catalog. But it's only structuring views and tables, not translating tables, views, relationships and columns into their business equivalent concepts. Something like Cube allows you to copy your data model in such a way that it will dynamically generate SQL based on the user's selected dimensions and metrics. It governs your metrics and definitions since the user only has to select the metrics and columns they want, not recreate the formulas and joins themselves. They just drag and drop from a selection of objects that equate to their business concepts. Not all implementations are equal of course, but this is generally the capabilities I see with most tools calling themselves a \"semantic layer\".Is Dremio working toward adding that capability as well? That would be interesting.",

I did a small POC on Snowflake testing their \"semantic views\" and they have a decent UI to help you build it. It automatically reads your schema and fills in the structure and it uses the Cortex LLM to help you document your columns and tables. Their implementation is targeted more at their LLM offerings than BI, though there are some BI integrations already available. I think no matter where you come down you need a UI to make updates easier and some automation around maintaining it. I am kind of surprised nobody has wrote that yet, at least that I have seen.",

It's relatively simple to see how you can start pushing around pixels on a screen, and there's some nice libraries that add quality of life / neat features like liquid simulation. It's also completely free AFAIK.Touchdesigner ( [https://derivative.ca/](https://derivative.ca/) ) has a bit of a steeper learning curve, and is typically used to abstract all the manual code stuff from Processing into a node-based editor. It comes installed with Python so you can control everything manually in code if you want, but you'll quickly find a lot of shortcuts that you can do with the nodes that are a lot more performant than doing it with your own code. There's a free version with the main limitation being you your resolution is capped below HD, but in practice that's not a big deal for any given projector / LED wall. With this I've begrudgingly found Youtube tutorials extremely helpful- just search for some cool videos with cool thumbnails and it generally takes about 10 minutes of the designer stepping through through their network for you to have it running locally. good luck & have fun!! eager to see what other people are getting up to in this thread.",

I'd say this is an opportunity to become more confident in cloud related stuff. There is a lot of overlap between services so if you understand broadly speaking how cloud works, why cloud would be used, and the popular services you can at the very least feel comfortable in conversations if pressed by a recruiter who usually knows nothing about cloud apart from the words in front of them.AWS has a free cert which you can take and add to your CV. >Feeling stuck but unsure how much of this is my own doing/how much control I have over it.As always. job hunting is three parts: technical competency, confidence, and likeability. You can control all three and it just boils to what happens on the day.Leverage your experience as much as possible because that is by far your greatest strength. When you have no skills in something, always focus on your passion and motivation to learn the subject you want to progress in (in this case, cloud and modern stack). Work how your current skills fit into your objectives. Be honest - \"I'm experienced in some things and will use that as a foundation to work on things I'm not experienced in\" sounds much better than \"I know everything\" and be found out as a lying piece of shit.",

That might sound like a given in all shops on this subreddit. but it's not necessarily the case for us.* **Cheaper options**: A simple CRON would already cover our needs, and slapping a lightweight UI (like Kestra or Prefect, even) gives us observability without the footprint.* **Business ROI**: Going managed isn’t an easier sell either, because our business won’t see 2x value just because we run on Airflow Cloud (or on-prem).",

Performance of those views might suffer with a lot of scalar UDFs?I'm not sure how you're calculating your final combined DQ score: I'd be wary of that as it's easy to end up with something a bit meaningless.I use a different approach where each individual _relevant_ data quality concern gets its own view (one \"rule\"). So a validation of website format would be one view, returning 0 rows if everything is correct. Each problem is one row, then. I would probably use SQL UDFs if I needed to abstract one piece of logic for multiple views, but that doesn't happen really with our data. The views all follow a consistent approach with common column names etc, then I have a process that collects and merges records from all views. Because each view is doing just one thing, it's very performant. But the view quantity does rack up. The overall data quality measure is just count of problem rows collected that day, and count of rules with at least one problem.There's also metadata in a special magic comment in each view (written using JSON syntax), describing why the rule is important to the business, who is responsible for keeping it empty, and how to go about clearing it. For me, that stuff is essential to maintain somewhere, because it ensures the results are actionable. This metadata is snapshotted daily to a SCD table, so business users can explore the full \"rulebook\" for data quality independently from current extant problems. In time I plan to have PBI send emails to every owner of problems, every day that problems exist, nagging them to fix them. :slightly_smiling_face:",

Put monitoring on the Postgres side to monitor the WAL size and alert if it starts growing rapidly bc it can eat up space until the db stops working.For sending data from DMS to Snowflake you have a few options. I really like DMS -> Kinesis -> Firehose which will stream data to your snowflake table in real time. This requires some DMS settings adjustments but DM and I’d be happy to send. BUT if you have to restrict your Smowflake account to certain IPs then it’s no good because Firehose uses Amazon’s service range of ips which is like over 100 and they rotate and change constantly.So the DMS -> S3 is also solid just read the docs for settings. Use the cdc settings and parquet format and compression.",

It feels to me that doing this would be another temporary solution to a deeper problem (aka, treating oltp as olap - and expecting analytical-type speeds).I worked on a company with more users reading/processing data than what my current company has, and the Snowflake bill was quite modest (around 1,000.00 euro per month).

I'd say concentrate on the schemas and if you have them, stored procedures too. Stored procedures are going to give you the most useful information because you'll be able to determine joins and start to develop a sense of what's related to each other. For SQL Server (and maybe others) - there's a tool from Redgate called SQL Dependency Tracker that can map this out visually, where there are joins, but also groups objects by names (it's part of their admin tool belt and it's quite useful)That being said you can find out a lot of this information out querying system tables assuming you have access to those. Unfortunately it's a very common problem, where object naming consistency can be as abundant as a documentation.",

And we each took responsibility for one data domain in that project (eg outpatient appointments, inpatient stays, A&E, referrals, etc) and saw it end-to-end from first sight of the data, to go live. (This typically took 12-36 months for one hospital trust - not just the DM, the system change at the hospital overall.)Anyway, yeah, each analyst often did have to spend days just plotting out all the relationships, identifying PKs and secondary unique columns, etc. Weeks of person-days expended overall for one system extract. All that before we could start assessing data quality etc. There aren't really any reliable shortcuts. You're doing the right kind of stuff.

Usually they reflect the \"primary way\" a table is accessed. By default it's an id, but significant foreign keys can also be used as index sometimes... What column they use, what are their names, usage statistics etc can all help...* Stratigraphy: now that one is mainly for systems with many years of lifetime... As successive generations of devs work on a database, they bring their conventions with them, resulting in \"strata\" of tables showing the different periods of evolution. Having at least a loose idea of how these strata are working can also give clues (if that reminds you of archeology that's normal, I have worked in an adjacent field before data).* Ancillary data: data like creation timestamp, creation user, logging related ids etc... Are usually added at the end of the table when creating it the first time. Since columns usually keep their sequential order over the lifetime of the database, you can sometimes use these to assess what was part of the original table DDL statement, and what was added after...* Take notes of everything. Save queries, ids, sessions, hypotheses, document it all so no one else has to do that work again afterwards.But yeah. This is difficult, time consuming and hard work. Good luck.",

Way too many people in a similar position to yourself spend so much time trying to min-max, find the \"best\" or \"most efficient\" approach that they have already wasted a week just thinking about it. That week becomes a month.Most efficient method is to start with something and build from there.> Honestly i dunno its dumb to directly go for DE at my level nonetheless i hope to get your insightsBy all means, take an introductory course into DE. I myself did a ZTM course and found it enjoyable and useful. That being said, it's worth mentioning that all courses are exactly what I said - an introduction to the topic.A lot of people who are self taught, myself included, will always say \"I started with a course and 6 months later I got my first DE job\". Whilst true, it neglects the huge gap between finishing the course and getting a job. For reference, I was actively learning, coding, and applying for jobs for 60+ hours a week after finishing introductory courses doing a mix of watching informational YouTube videos, hands on programming building projects, applying for jobs, working on my CV, calling recruiters trying to help build a profile etc.The process for getting a job is much more involved than a lot of people would have you believe because it doesn't sell and it's definitely not sexy. It's tough, it's arduous, and takes way more energy and time than completing a £20 online course thousands of other people have completed at your own leisure. It's not to say that you can't do it. In fact it's the opposite - you absolutely can. Provided you're realistic about the journey ahead. >Can this depended on to get hired as an entry-level?I will say this repeatedly because I still believe it to be true - get the idea of entry level out of your head. Just go for mid. The junior market has pretty much never existed in DE even during the DE boom about 4 years ago. The mid market, in my opinion, has always been the strongest and the bands are so wide they have absorbed the junior market. Completely benefits the companies who can advertise for a mid level position, get mid-senior level DEs on a borderline junior salary since the bands are so obfuscated. One of the genuine drawbacks of the field.Forget junior level positions. Aim for mid level positions. Be technically strong and well read, but not necessarily experienced. Be good at communicating. Practice being a mix of honest about what you don't know as well as curious to learn new things. If you take the advice that some people have to lying in order to get a job, then forever live in your own head feeling insecure.",

DataTalks DE Zoomcamp walks you through that for free; Zero-to-Mastery covers similar ground but spends more time on theory, so combine it with hands-on practice or you will feel lost in interviews. I tried Airbyte and Meltano for quick ELT demos, but DreamFactory was the tool I kept because it instantly exposed my Postgres tables as secure APIs without extra code. Document everything in a GitHub repo, add a CI pipeline that reruns daily, and mention the link on your resume; recruiters love evidence over certificates.

This was about 2-3 years ago, and I haven't kept up with their product to see if there's a good lightweight solution to this.If not, I'd be inclined to at least consider a solution that involves a job that does a few things: * copies spreadsheet to csv on s3/snowflake *landingpad* * applies a jsonschema validation to the data. In the event that there's any issues it would have a set of contacts to send a summary of the issues found to. As you can imagine the more frequent this happens the better, ideally every 5 minutes or so, so that someone will get an alert as soon as they've entered bad data. * then copies the validated data into an appropriate raw bucket/raw database area where it can then go through a typical data pipeline for transformation.The above can be done in a variety of ways, but is fairly straight-forward.",

Basically you pull in all the data into a central file or table as above and you manually identify duplicates. Then you give them an \"master\" ID. The next day you do the same and manually process the new records, etc. Can be done in excel with Vlookup + copy paste, using simple code into CSV output, in PowerQuery, ...Now if you want to share this data between applications, you should seriously consider changing the way this data is stored in the first place.

Relying only on roles inside each query engine tends to fragment governance and forces you to duplicate logic.One alternative is to push governance down to the catalog layer. That’s the approach we’ve taken with Lakekeeper:•AuthZ outside the engine → central policies, enforced consistently across Trino, Spark, Flink, etc.•Implemented with openFGA → but modular, so you can swap in a different policy engine if you prefer.•OPA (Open Policy Agent) integration → rules can express tenant- or product-level access (schema/table/column/row).•No data duplication → instead of tagging/duplicating rows, you apply policies dynamically at query time based on tenant or token context.That way you keep one source of truth for governance, and avoid coupling access rules to any single engine.Disclosure: I’m part of the team building Lakekeeper (open-source Iceberg catalog).",

For auth, traefik provides middleware that you can configure to check credentials with another service (Oauth2proxy is a popular one) or basic auth if you’re retroIf you need to control traffic within a k8s cluster (traefik is mainly used as a ingress controller for out of cluster load balancing) you probably want a service mesh like [istio](https://istio.io/). They can be kind of a pain to configure and administer, but it gives you pretty powerful control over network traffic",

This is a mix of type 2, where each new version gets a new id, and type 1, so your fact table might have a “UserId” which is the id of the user to a single type 2 record, and a “Current User Id” - which may be the user id from the source system where IsCurrent = True in your dimension table.I recommend only using type 2 on columns you definitely want new records when it changes, but sometimes you get asked for a column in hindsight. You can either risk it, make a new record on a wider range, or all, columns, or keep the audit table of all changes just in case you need to rebuild it.",

In lean times, keeping your job is the reward.If you want to make even more money in bad times, your relatively accessible options are: holding your company hostage (e.g. the only person who can do X, which is mission-critical), changing company, taking a role with way more responsibilities for far less pay than the person they just fired who was doing that job, doing something else on the side, or finding a way to profit from things getting worse. > Everyone seems to be hanging and doing nothing.That's because everyone else has figured this out already, probably because this is not their first downturn.

I do know that this is where projects and a portfolio would be handy to showcase my abilities.

Math/Stats will provide you very sustainable careers in any domain.SQL is easy to learn but hard to master, takes sometime to really understand the depth of SQL. SQL \"order of execution\" is very important and critical to learn because in the background, SQL is executed in a completely different way than it is written in the frontend. Knowing that will also help to write efficient SQL queries.",

When using `:memory:`, you won't have any persistence.DuckDB by itself, even outside of dagster, handles its own multiprocessing. As far as I know, it doesn't allow sharing blocks of C-reserved memory space across multiple python processes. I also don't see why it should, that model doesn't make much sense.To bypass this somewhat, maybe it can work to set your executor to in_process_executor, and force dagster to execute your run in a single process. If setup/teardown of the resource only happens once per run, then maybe you get lucky and it stays available.Multiprocessing in the DuckDB steps will still be available because DuckDB itself will spin up processes. You just won't be parallelizing your DAG steps.If you're trying to parallelize both your DAG steps and your processing steps to the same data (without being willing to persist your data to disk), use an out-of-process DB instead of DuckDB. DuckDB is intentionally not built to support multi-writer setups: https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/connect/concurrency.html#writing-to-duckdb-from-multiple-processes",

That's not how databases are supposed to work.What you want is to have a single database with as many tables as you need to hold your data, and then parse all of the XML files - with Python, say - and write the contents of each one as rows of data to the required tables through one or more database connections. XML parsing is quick. Writing to rows to a database through an open connection is also quick. Creating databases is slow. Restructure your script to do things this way and performance should increase by orders of magnitude. Then - if you're still not happy with performance - you can look into parallelizing reads and writes. May well not be necessary though. Serially parsing a few million XML files is something that should easily be doable in under 5 minutes, unless each one is 10MB or something.",

Unlike traditional colleges, WGU doesn't use the \"à la carte\" model for their degree programs, where students can choose elective courses within their major and pay for additional courses outside of their major. WGU's model is more like a \"prix fixe\" menu - students pay a fixed price per term, and take courses from a set menu, with no electives or non-major courses. I have thought of taking one of the degree programs (BSDA or BSCNE) and studying the most high-value parts of the other program separately. For example, complete the BSDA, then study for and take the Network+, Security+, and Azure certifications separately.",

Basically, when you ask a question, you should be at a point where you know the information you are looking for, but also know that you can't find it yourself.So, for example, asking \"how do I commit a change\" is not a good question, because it's vague, would take hours to answer fully and strongly suggests you have not done even basic research.Asking \"What is the URL of the GitHub server\" is a great question - I can answer it instantly, and there is no way you could have found it out yourself (errr - unless it's in the new starter guided in which case you shouldn't have asked it, obviously!).So, when asking a question (or raising a bug, or anything really) always start with \"What I did\", \"What I expected to happen\" and \"What actually happened\" - change those questions to ones that make sense for the question you are asking, but generally they are a good format for asking for help.People want to help - they just don't want to do your job for you.",

There's no need to get combative, because, unfortunately, I don't think AI programming is going anywhere, and the admin may misunderstand its value. But you're a student, not a professional.

Build small, focused projects where you only practice one concept (e.g., a to-do app for CRUD, a weather app for API calls, a notes app with React state). Once you’ve done a few, you’ll naturally start connecting the dots and see which tool to use where.And don’t feel dumb if a colleague solves things faster, it’s just experience. With time, you’ll recognize patterns and solutions faster too. Keep building, break things down, and your speed/intuition will grow.",

This is both a humbling place to be, but also demonstrates you've got the guts to stick it out in that place. Good for you. Every progammer will feel this at some point, you're joining a long long line of great engineers who've walked this path. Welcome :red_heart:As for breaking a problem down, there's a few ways to do it, as you can imagine. Here's my 2 cents for you:If you can't clearly see a structure for your solution, consider starting with a monolith. You'll build a thing that works (customer says yay) and the natural boundaries/seams will likely reveal themselves in the process. Kent Beck was saying as much the other day on LinkedIn.Whiteboard is king. And bring a friend, use them as a rubber duck. Or use an actual rubber duck.Finally, don't get cute. Most languages have some fancy features you'll be tempted to use. Resist their siren song :grinning_face_with_sweat:These are suggestions. There will be situations in which they represent bad advice. Keep your eyes open.Super lastly - good engineering is, I believe, about human communication. Strive to build good partnerships with other engineers... Then steal all their good ideas and ways of thinking! Haha. In a loving way, of course.Best.",

That feeling of powerlessness is job security my friend so just learn whatever weird things they are doing. I once (thankfully) flunked an interview because they tested me on object oriented Perl because that is how they did things. I found that odd and after the interview requested a sample of what it was they were even alluding to. They could not produce this sample for me needless to say.

That is kind of the core loop of any engineering work.Express yourself either in pseudocode, or use some features of the programming language that lets you gloss over details while you work out a general structure, like [the `todo!` macro in Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/macro.todo.html), that always passes typechecking but crashes with a `not yet implemented: your message` if it ever actually gets called.Sometimes you'll find that what you thought was a decent strategy for a solution can't be implemented for whatever reason, then you have to think about that sub-problem again and see if there's some other way to get at it. And preferably leave a comment about the strategy you thought of first and why it's unworkable.> I guess it's probably with coding a lot, having experience and more.That helps, but everyone has to start somewhere.

If you ever decide you like where project is & you want people to be able to access it OR you decide you done with a project but you want other people to try to complete it you can then publish it.Another commentor mentioned it not being a resume, but you can turn GitHub into a portfolio. If you wish to do so, you can pin up to 6 of your best projects to your profile page. You can also make a USERNAME repo to put a custom readme on your profile page (just make a repo named to same thing as your profile name and put a readme.md file in it with what you want displayed [I would recommend a little bit about yourself, your technical skills, your interests & hobbies, projects you want to show off, and eventually your professional links]).Edit: I forgot the most important reason for uploading to GitHub. If your computer crashes or your files get corrupted you can retrieve your old code. AND if you break your code some how you can roll back to an older working version. I wish I had been used GitHub when 6 was beginning, I have months/years of code lost. It would be neat to go back to look at.Edit 2: One benefit of make your code public is that is anything happens where you lose access to your GitHub account, you will still be able to download your old code.",

I always recommend starting away from the computer, and simply **sketch out what you are going to do**. It can be diagrams, it can be pseudocode, or it can simply be a bullet-list of what the program should do, like this made-up example inspired by your problem:* start the game * reset score, health and positions* game loop: * if spawn-timer = 0, spawn enemy, restart timer * move enemies * move player * check collisions * if player hits enemy: inc points * if player-health < 0, exit loop* game over * display score * display: try again button -> restartGame -> arrow up to start the gamesomething like that - that you gradually build up while adding features.Then when you want to add a new feature, you experiment a bit with where it should be, put it where it initially makes sense, and then \"run\" through the steps of the program on paper where you talk aloud: *\"Then the game restarts, and that triggers the rewarded ad, but then everything is reset and the game loop starts ... hmm ...\"* and you try to put it somewhere else.This doesn't take hours of planning or analysis, but simply a few minutes of \"playing the game in your mind\" and checking if it makes sense - and it helps a lot to have a simple script like this on paper, and someone to talk to - they don't have to answer, it can be a child, a pet or a **rubberduck**, just talk aloud! You'll be surprised what you hear yourself say, and hopefully quickly realize how wrong you were!As you do this more and more, you'll sometime be able to do the entire thing in your mind, without writing or talking, but I've found that it is important to start being as external as possible.",

But as for my promo, everyone was really sweet and the more skilled didn't hesitate to make rounds to see if anybody needed a helping hand. Anyway, after that first week passed I kinda had a click. While I struggled to even understand what I was supposed to do before, I now had some bases on which I could rely. And after overcoming the hurdle of \"what the fuck are pointers and how do I use them?\" it was more or less smooth sailing. I knew how to use what I had learnt previously in order to progress steadily through the following exercises I finished my piscine at the C07 courses (malloc) with a score of 54 at the final exam (against 0, 0, and 10 the previous weeks...).

I also worked as a “teacher” during other piscines, so I’ve seen both sides.For context: when I started the piscine I had **zero coding knowledge**. I didn’t even know what a terminal was, and I thought typing commands was the same as coding.You’re *supposed* to feel overwhelmed, that’s the point. The piscine is a selection month. The school is checking if you’re a good fit for their system and looking for any red flags.The main things they look at are:* **How you handle adversity.** Do you shut down when you feel in over your head, or do you push through?* **Your learning curve.** You might not be able to write a function today, but can you make progress by next week? They’re measuring growth, not starting ability.* **Collaboration.** How well do you work with others, both giving and receiving help?* **Time commitment.** 12 hours a day is common, and if you can manage it, you should.It’s also important to remember that the piscine isn’t just the school testing you, it’s also **you testing their system**. The curriculum projects later on will feel very similar: vague, ambiguous, and challenging by design.One last tip: **don’t measure yourself against your peers.** Some people will have math degrees, CS backgrounds, or years of coding experience. That doesn’t mean you’re behind. You’re on your own track.And yes, you’ll encounter some snarky people, both in school and in these threads, who lack awareness of how different everyone’s starting point is.

It will help you alot and it will also give you better ctrl R results for these pesky specific cmds that you might need in a hurry later onAsk people around you general questions but always try to decompose your context, ask questions about the problem itself and its sub problems, as for the solution make sure to always ask for the approach more than the raw solution itself, what did they google ? What was their initial self asked questions? What resources or algorithms were used to find an answer ? Once you have some clues STOP ASKING QUESTIONS AND START DOING RESEARCH YOURSELF !!!!! Its very important that you have a good grasp on the “context” of each subject, you should always consider a tech theme like some sort of information space, you might know some parts to some degree, however the biggest issue will be the things you aren’t aware that youre supposed to know, afterall it can always be an infinite amount of information thats missing in order for you to get the bigger picture, THATS WHY WE READ THE MANUAL/DOCS, it allows us to estimate what the information space is made up of, thus giving you a much clearer picture of what you already know, how much you need to know, but most importantly everything that you dont know yet.Last couple advices, STOP PANICKING! Start small, what is vim ? How do i save ? How do i edit ? How do i exit ? Is there any meaning behind the letters used each time ? What are the useful shortscuts, can you focus on that efficiently without having your brain stress you about the next thing you’re supposed to do or are you going to just do everything but master nothing ?How comfortable are you getting with your current “ignorance” ? Can you detail the things you need to improve on and read/code more about so that you can tackle the theme of the subject? And make sure to REST ! Do not try to race with everyone like i did, ull just end up collapsing on the 4th week and thats very dangerous because exams are the entry criteria and your last exam is the most important oneMake sure to understand that you need to pass the exam with just vim and a terminal, so all these people who are flexing their speed might suddenly get doomed since they would basically be coding in the dark, while if you keep struggling and working on a serious coding approach, you are actually more likely to get even better results on your exams, do not fall for the peer pressure, your peers are only there as a source of knowledge for you to absorb And have fun dude, the piscine is actually fun, the real hell starts when you have to recode your own C and C++ libraries so you can make bigger programs later on, these are the actual manifestations of hell, even chatgpt cant help much with the maths heavy subjects later on, the whole point of 42 is that coding is about approach more than anything else",

        "body": "OOP is basically mandatory to write good Java and honestly can help you greatly.The example I like to give is you have to start thinking of your program as different pieces that work together to accomplish a goal. As a piece gets too complex to keep track of, you want to look at good ways to break down what it does. Java sometimes goes too far with this in my opinion but it's a sensible premise to start from.It's fairly similar to how function design should be done. A function should do ideally one thing very well that takes a relatively small number of lines of code (though it might end up doing a couple of things honestly). But in OOP, we want to consider what those functions are usually working with and put all the similar functions into a class.For example, classic ATM design. You could build a deposit(account_no, amount) and withdraw(account_no, amount) function and just tie your UI into them. But note that there are a few complicated bits these functions will need to share. Both will need to access and update the database table for your bank account for example. Both primarily work on your account.So instead of functions, we can build one Account class which takes an account_no as a parameter to the constructor (ie an Account object is representing a specific class in the database) and has methods deposit(amount) and withdraw(amount). Since the Account object knows it's account_no already, there's no need to pass it in again. Likewise, imagine we'll have our database with multiple tables that we will need to access. They all share common tasks though like running a Select or an Update query. As we build out our application, we don't want to keep all this logic in every other object we make. So the Database itself can become an object which knows how to talk to the database. Then the Account can build one or be given one to work with.The ultimate goal is that every object knows everything it needs to know to operate and other things have to tell it as little as possible. The Database object doesn't need to know how bank accounts work, and the Account object doesn't need to know how the database work. They just need to know how to use what's called the interface: the way we intend for the object to be used by other objects (these are declared public in Java). This is the principle of cohesive class design - all the similar things are in one class and one class only.The nice part of this is if you swap how the database works, say from MySQL to Oracle, then you just have to redesign your Database object. Your Account object doesnt change at all. This is the idea of loose coupling - your objects rely on the public interface declared, not the internal workings of it.The best way is just to practice. Build object oriented applications and try to keep them cohesive and loosely coupled. You'll get better with practice.",

I didn’t first notice this until I was 5 years in (professionally) programming for maybe 8-9 years total. I was talking to a new engineer on our team and I realized the vocabulary I was using isn’t something a rookie would follow, but that whole time I had always thought and still feel that I’m the rookie. The best thing you can do to get better at coding or really anything is to seek out a group that is already doing it. So I always advise newcomers to seek out a friend or a group or network of other people also interested. I also recommend if possible to look for people who are already skilled that you can just bounce a conversation with. Then when you’re out of your depth as OP says, you’ll learn a ton in order to keep up conversation with these folks.From my experience the best engineers always seek out this out of their depth feeling. I used to have so much self doubt in college and in life until I figured out that anyone can do it if you put your mind to it. These things take time and programming has a high skill floor. You just have to trust yourself and have patience. Now I’m at a point in my career where I’m learning to “trust myself” that I do have those qualities. There isn’t one path but you should learn to trust yourself and gain confidence that you do have the ability to put in the work to make it happen.",

The market is very over saturated and very competitive right now. For that reason, I would say \"program because you *like* programming and find it interesting, not because you want to make money doing it.\" If things change down the road, worry about it then.As far as advice:1. If you want to do **web design**, you'll want to start with the basics: **HTML and CSS**. Then get into **JavaScript**. Later on you might be interested in something like **TypeScript** or **React**.2. Alternatively, if you are doing a Masters degree in **data analytics**, I would encourage you to take a good look at **Python**, specifically **Pandas**. Other languages can work well too, but I know that Python is a common choice for data science type stuff; most programming languages *can* do what others do, but some are *designed* for certain tasks in mind.

Pick a simple project to work on, it doesn't have to be a million dollar idea, it could just be a copy of something else, and then problem solve through each individual issue. Force yourself to think about how you would approach starting out, difficulties, do google searches, try things, maybe ask an AI as a last resort but with a very specific prompt that details what you have tried. When you eventually solve issues, it will feel much more rewarding like you solved a puzzle. This is what drives me personally, and when one is solved I keep building until the next issue, rinse repeat.

So it really depends where you live and do you want to become a corporate dog or you're more of a loose cannon.Thing is in North America the most popular set of technologies are few things, in Europe are other things. No idea what they use in Asia and South America.Either case, first of all it's great to know more than one operating system. Knowing iOS or Windows is fine, but learning linux is a must. And you must be able to install your OS from scratch and do basic maintenance.Second - learn git. In the modern world nothing goes without git. The entire planet nowadays can't live without git. In rare cases they use other things, like TFS (Microsoft), but git is a must.Third - you said you know SQL - this is great. SQL is a must too. Choose a relational database and learn it. I would say choose MySQL (or MariaDB) or Postgres. You must be able to do basic queries, you must know in theory what are the normalization forms and you must be able to design a simple database.Next - you must know HTML, basic CSS and basic javascript. Which means to design some html form, being able to validate it with javascript before form submit.And here we come to a very sensitive point - you must know how to properly write a Word document and basic knowledge of Excel. Because if your'e a master programmer but your resume or CV looks like crap - it speaks bad of you.Finally - programming. It really really depends. There are several ways you could go.FRONT END DEVELOPER: Be a master of HTML, XML, JSON. Magician of CSS and commander of Javascript. And you must know working well with Photoshop or a similar program (like GIMP which is free).DATABASE DEVELOPER: Master of SQL. You must be able to effortlessly write 3rd Normalization form (at least) queries in your sleep. You must be able to optimize SQL queries for fun. You should know database administration to a degree.BACK-END DEVELOPER (ANY LEVEL): You must know what is Object Oriented Programming. You must know and use at least 3 Design Patterns (but be sure to read the book).BACK-END DEVELOPER LOOSE CANNON: Know PHP but know it real good. Last time I used PHP was in 2004, before I get my first professional development work. I was designing small websites. After that it evolved a lot. There is one framework called Laravel which from what I hear is very Popular. Be sure you know how to build web apps with it. This does not save you from learning HTML and basic Javascript with some CSS. And SQL is a must. Loose cannon level means working for you as a freelancer or working for a start-up. Nothing wrong with it. They give you great freedom of technological choice which lots of people love. Yes, PHP is not widely used nowadays but it's still used a lot. You could learn Perl instead, which is a super-strong language and I've built my career with it, but I won't recommend it. If you want to easily be able to get a job - learn Python. Python evolved a lot. I first learnt it and used it professionally in 2007 but in 2025 Python is a whole constellation of itself and I adore it. If you go the Python way - learn Django.BACK-END DEVELOPER CORPORATE DOG: You must be a master of either: C#, Java or Python. You must feel fluent in at least one of the popular cloud platforms: Azure, GCP or AWS. You must be able to write CI/CD pipelines. I have no experience in C#, so don't ask and last time used Java many years ago. For Python - Django and NumPy are a must here. You should be into AI/LLM and Machine Learning here.Coding editors: Yes, learn how to use VSCode, but also learn vim or neovim (or emacs).Side project: Learn how to make presentations in Power Point or a similar app.So geographically speaking - last years what they loved in North America seems spreading into Europe as well and vice versa. But choose a path you want to go and choose technologies accordingly.Last word and probably the most important: Winning a technical job interview nowadays is way harder. Make account on Leetcode or Hackerrank and start doing the exercises there. Which means - LEARN DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS! These websites will help.Good luck!",

You can only learn so much in a sandbox (meaning guided help and projects, not your own). You won't have motivation brcause they arent your own problems or things your solving. Now, if you code your own app and run into a problem, when YOU fix the problem YOU will remember how you did. And if you dont, you'll remember enough about it to know where to look. You will force yourself to start approaching things differently. You'll feel more accomplished, you'll learn more in the sense of \"real world skills\" vs book skills. Something I noticed learning to code and currently being self taught is you will run into a roadblock everyday. Some of them are big, some are small. I'm currently in one regarding github and git that I messed up so bad I cant even code right now until it gets sorted out (thank God for reddit help and kond people). Download vscode, get on here, ask questions, check youtubes, start doing it! Make a portfolio about your skills and experiences for future employers, make one solely for shortcuts with code (things you use a lot of need to have on hand but cant remember). Start building that base now so later when you're deeper and have a dev job you can look back and not only see how far you've come but also you have a huge set of cheats to look up. Better yet, create an app for said cheat sheet that categorizes your cheat codes! There are 3 projects right there that solve 3 problems for you that you can show employers. Biggest thing is focusing on what's important. Is learning react important? Yes. But dont force yourself to not ask for help on that. The more you work it the better and easier it'll get. Code? Force yourself to not throw in the towel when your stuck, thats important. Work it for 20 min or even more before you say \"alright, I'm gassed\". Make it a point to code every day and have atleast 1 meaningful push to github so your activity level stays up on there and dont miss a day. Focus on 1-2 languages and dont switch from them until you are comfortable enough to tell an employer \"I dont know all the answers but I know where to look and I can articulate what I need to happen.\" In essence, I know I want my background to be red, purple and black and I want it to fade into eachother in a circular pattern. I may not remember it's specifically conicle-gradient (or whatever it is). But I know its a gradient and I know to look up gradients for colors and backgrounds.This is longer than I thought it would be. But keep going! Get react, vscode, node.js, get a github, and start coding. Its daunting at first but once you start it'll flow. Oh, and when you do get a win, whether it's fixing a problem, finishing a project etc. Dont stay there long. Accept the win, give yourself 5 minutes to freak out and jump around, but get back to the next win asap. That helps me with keeping my momentum up.",

So to solve the blockage I try to find something interesting thing to do.Example: Many years ago I had some spare time and since I know how to use vim, i decided to learn vimscript. I wanted to explore what it could do. So as an exercise I wrote a simple game, which in the end looks badly playable but works. Here is the code: [https://github.com/StrayFeral/DevLife](https://github.com/StrayFeral/DevLife)Last year I was doing some tutorials on Python and I was curious how to publish a package, so as an exercise I wrote a weird math module and published it. Here is the code: [https://github.com/StrayFeral/custom\\_numbers](https://github.com/StrayFeral/custom_numbers)Finally one day for some other reason which I cannot remember I decided to code a simple Python game - the classic game of Bulls and Cows, so wrote it on Python, here is the code: [https://github.com/StrayFeral/bulls\\_and\\_cows\\_game](https://github.com/StrayFeral/bulls_and_cows_game)And for this game I wrote linux installation package as another exercise and later wrote a graphical version which is also there.So find an idea and make it happen!",

When you turn on the console and start playing the console views only one complete rom comprehensive of the game.

We \\*can\\* for example just accept that it's \"all just zeros and ones\" and that is one way to look at it. However there \\*are\\* quite different ways we have to work with and encode textual data. Distinct from numbers. Distinct from Video or images. Some of this applies to some of your earlier thoughts. What I encourage you to try to do, is recognise that you are just discovering different ways to think about the same thing. Some of the answers (and indeed debates you are getting into) relate to people pointing out that you can look at it your original way in some context, or in a third way in others. This is really the useful skill. I've been around the block a bit and I can conceive of a relevant problem in terms of say, a functional programming solution or an object one or a procedural one. I can see how data might map onto Json or XML, or Yaml and how each might look and how to consider that. The OS for example is \"different than what us peasants use\", once you start getting into problems that deal with user space vs system space and so on. Some stuff the OS does \\*is\\* privileged and now you start to need to separate them again. The journey of seeing it as trivial, then understanding the complexity, then know how to abstract that complexity into something more trivial again ad nauseum, is something of a long one.",

The CPU just sends the signal to the chipset which handles the actual I/O data transfer. The data read/written are handled in RAM. When the operation is done then the CPU is notified by an interrupt.This was truly enlightening to learn and helped me understand asynchronous programming in C#. If you do an I/O operation synchronously then you're just blocking the thread and at most waste the CPU with instructions that wait for the interrupt (this is handled by the OS).But if you use await/async with Tasks then you're really sending a fire and forget signal. Once the I/O operation is done the interrupt is handled and continuation of your code might run in a different thread (based on the task scheduler).",

You can allocate more space, but how do you associate that with your current collection of related data?Don't worry about forgetting stuff; you will. There's a lot to remember.

        "body": "Not really an answer to your question, and I dunno if this will help you, but I use a mental trick when I'm coding recursion (e.g. when traveling trees or linked lists or deeply nested markup language structures).I imagine that there are a bunch of people standing around, each of whom manages a single node in the nested structure. When the recursive method is called, each person has a list of information they are handed (the argument list), knowledge of the specific node's properties (its attributes, its list of children, maybe a link to its parent, whatever is there), and tasks to perform. That person knows NOTHING about the rest of the list, the other nodes, etc.Then I just imagine the person doing the task needed and then handing off information to the next node.Silly example: I have a tree structure with a node that has a name and links to its own children. Some unknown person needs a big long list of only the names that start with A or B appended to a list.So, as the person responsible for a single node, when it's my turn, I get the A&B name list that's already been started by whoever is above me and the node's properties in the argument list (or in my own object's properties if the recursive function is baked into the object and my own method was called). I check my own node's name and if it starts with A or B, I stick it on the list. Then, I \"hand off\" the list to each of my node's children so they can do the same (i.e. I call the method for the kids the same way my parent called it for me).Obviously this example is simple, but when I get something more complicated like aggregating values, interacting with both parent and children, using shared resources, reversing results, etc., this method helps me isolate my thinking to a single node.Hint: first build your code as if your node has a parent and at least two kids. Then re-run it in your head as if you're the top-level node and make sure you have what you need to hand off to the first kids. Then re-run it in your head as if you don't have any kids to make sure you return properly.",

And translating that pseudocode to actual programming language is even simpler.But if you try to remember the solution in a specific programming language without having done the work prior, like you don't really understand the *what* and the *why*, but focus entirely on the *how* \\- they you'll have a very hard time.

Start by building a small stupid programme, like something that takes in user inputted numbers and prints them back out. Next, allow for multiple numbers to be entered, stored in an array. Then print the list of numbers afterwards. Then you can add operations inbetween numbers, this is more complex but teaches you how to separate a string using delimiters or whatever method you want to use. Add some functionality for operations, like add, subtract, etc. Just super basic stuff. Print out the answer and boom you have a calculator. This exercise will teach you the basics of how arrays, lists and stacks work, just experiment with different ways of storing numbers, from the common and basic, to the dumb and unique. Learn from failure, if your code doesnt work, it will tell you where, then you can try redo that part or try something else. If you ride a bike up a hill in the wrong gear, its hard, but after you learn how to change gears, it gets much easier, and you learn by doing",

For what you're talking about, the app side of it is pretty straightforward (conceptually). It just needs to be able to check for flood alerts and deliver those alerts to users based on their location data.The very hard and expensive part is all the infrastructure you need to track and collect that data. You refer to that as the \"other half\" of the problem but it's probably more like 99% of the problem. Ideally the Malysian weather service would provide flood alert warnings, like the [NWS does](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) (used to do?) in the US. I can't read the website for the [Malaysian weather service](https://www.met.gov.my/), but you should start there to see what information they currently track and provide to the public. It could be that they have an API similar to the NWS that provides alerts.All that being said, I was a little curious why an app like you describe doesn't exist yet. And it does look like there are already [apps and warning systems in place](https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/10/07/dont-panic-all-the-steps-apps-numbers-you-need-for-malaysias-flood-season/152650).

It will take a lot of time and some money. You can raise alerts manually from the server even if there is no sensor system or get data from multiple points and raise an event by a logic you decide.So I suggest you start from App part and than server and than the arduino part.

Rust is still a bit niche since it's a relatively new language with 1.0 only having been reached 10 years ago, and the learning curve is quite steep if the goal is wrapping your head around its revolutionary memory safety paradigm, but its popularity cannot be contested, as it has consistently ranked first in the StackOverflow developer language preference surveys ever since reaching its 1.0 milestone. It's also the only other language allowed and actually being pushed as a viable alternative to C in the Linux kernel, and pretty much all big tech from Microsoft to NVIDIA is pushing it, with the only exception being Apple which have their own safe native language strongly influenced by the original Rust author's language design, whom Apple themselves consulted with while designing Swift. Even features available in Rust that were originally not implemented in Swift are now being brought to the latter because Apple's alternative design decisions focusing on developer accessibility ended up proving somewhat problematic.

Once you have that goal, do your research and figure out what's the best tool (language) to achieve it. It is always easier to learn on your own when you have a goal you are passionate about in mind. At this stage in your education, that is more important than picking any specific language.As you progress in your studies, it's certain that later courses will expose you to other key languages, likely C++ and Java, perhaps some Python (though that is less common in CS curricula).",

As far as learning to code, learn the absolute basics and then practice a lot without relying on tutorials. For loops, if statements, functions, and lists/arrays are enough for you to write a few apps.When I was first learning to code, I would find it hard to know \"what to do next\". The following mental model might help:1. Define function inputs2. Define your desired outputThen you know that you simply need to chain together if statements, for loops to transform your input data into your desired output data (and this is enough to solve any coding problem: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured\\_program\\_theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_program_theorem) ).Also, and this is just my opinion, I would recommend learning the basics in Python since you can use Jupyter notebooks or [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/) . Being able to run parts of your code and quickly experiment will help you fix your mistakes and learn much faster imo.",

It will also print the odd numbers - hm, okay, then you find out how to either check if a number is even or odd before printing it out, or somehow change the program so it skips the odd numbers in the list.Then you change it so it doesn't always go to 16, but to whatever number is input.Work backwards from the result towards the program that will create that result - \"fake\" parts of the program you don't yet know how to write, and always make sure that you have a running program that produces *some* result, even if it isn't the exact right one yet!Take small steps.Do not simply stare at the question and hope for a solution to appear in your mind, fully formed with all the details - it might happen occasionally with smaller tasks, but as the tasks get larger and larger, that process will fail!",

It will help further down the line for other concepts to anchor on this. Once you get good at it you can kind of distillate the concept of what is that word without even knowing the concepts behind just with the way the sentence is written and your own experience. It culmulate into a way to read requirements and text by skimming it at what information is pertinent for you. This is the way you get to a 10x engineer (well I don't believe this but it does make a difference). Tldr: practice reading comprehension and eventually you will become a very good programmer/software engineer or more globally a fast learner.",

You may then write down the steps (on paper) as it would be instructions to a machine (still informal but with more details), work in itarations and make it more and more formal. This way you may express a problem with an informal text, transform the text into a set of informal \"instructions,\" and iterate the instructions to look more and more like a formal program. With experience, you can skip some of the steps, do some of them in your head, and you can fill in the blanks without much work (for some more difficult situations, it can still be useful to fall back to writing down problem statements by hand and twist and turn on the problem).",

That’s one way in which internships can help — you get a chance to learn some of that stuff earlier. But then there’s a lot of stuff that you can’t possibly know because you haven’t worked for that specific company before unless you interned there. The particulars of their development process, coding style, and just what the business does and how their systems work will all be new, and it’ll feel like a lot.Most places use git and HitHub for version control, so it’s a good idea to practice with those. And Atlassian products like Jira and Confluence are pretty big, so it you have a chance to try those out it might help.When you’re interviewing for your first job, look for places that pay attention to onboarding and seem understanding. You might want to ask about their onboarding process and how they help people get up to speed.",

This means minimal commenting, and certainly, not to the level of a beginner.Imagine you want to learn how to cook like a professional chef, but you're a total beginner. A really good chef might show how they make something, but then you ask, how do you know this, how do you know that? How did you cut that chicken? They want to get to the point when they make something, not teach you all the basics of cooking.Similarly, you want real-world code. That's difficult code. People aren't writing bubble sort by itself, something so self-contained and short that it can be explained. Also, when you ask an expert to explain something, unless they have experience teaching, they will skip over many detail that they assume you already know (but you may not). They may use a bunch of terminology that have no idea what they mean.This is the problem with one-way communication. How much should an expert assume you know? At some point, if they have to tell you why a nested loop works, then they are spending more time teaching you the basics of programming, and not talking about the project the build.They have videos of people coding, but then you watch them click this, type that, etc. They barely say anything so you get nothing from watching even though many beginners want to see a real coder code until they realize it's like watching a real chess player play chess. It can be incredibly difficult for a master chess player say why they make certain moves. They can tell you why some moves are dumb and they see things you don't, but unless you start to play and get in those situations, watching an expert doesn't help.To be fair, chess is a super extreme example, but at least you get the sense that even if you study for a year, you still couldn't figure out why a top chess player makes the move they do.In effect you're saying> I want real-world code, but something super simple that I can understand, then explain all the detail and the thinking behind it as if I were five years old.Most experts explaining their code wouldn't do it at that level, but even if they could, they'd invariably leave something out that you would want explained. You don't have the ability to ask questions. What you really want is> I want to sit beside you and watch you code. I want you to have a running commentary telling me what you think. But as a beginner, I want you to explain all the steps you think are really obvious, hardly worth mentioning, and get into that, so I don't have to stop you and ask \"What are you doing now?\" a hundred times.",

You're calling different services, using dependency injection, and other stuff that isn't easy to understand if you're trying to take it in all at once. My recommendation would be to learn the basics of Python or JS, whichever you want, and then find a tutorial where you code along with the instructor while they build an actual project. If you go to Udemy, Academind has courses that follow that pattern. Their React course is particularly good and there are a few sections of that course where Max (the instructor) walks you through projects like that, and then challenges you later to try it on your own. It's a long course but it's worth the time (assuming you want to learn React.) They also have courses for Node and Python. Good luck to you.",

Initially I don't have knowledge about reactjs, so I study read the basics of it. Then, they gave me access the repository to see what their source code looks like and to see what tools, libraries they used. Nobody explained to me about how the source code interact to each other, you need to dig deep and learn to read .similar to php, never done it and laravel for backend so I need to teach myself. So I guess, what I would suggest is that.. try to build something you are interested.. then, once you finish try looking on open source project similar what you did and analyze it and how they did it. Then, you could do the same. Try learning design patterns also .it is really useful and a lot of professional used it .",

This works for me, because I like odd maths puzzles. The key part is, I write scripts that do something interesting to me, and which I have no expectation will live beyond a few hours. They don't necessarily have to be efficient, they just have to give an answer that I am confident of, or that i can check some other way. When I first started doing this kind of thing I had scripts that would run for hours simulating a problem to give me a probability of something. (If i roll two dice 100 times, how many times will I get a 5 and a sum less than 9, or something silly like that). Over time I just got better at banging out boiler plate code, and I found ways to make (for example) loops quicker and more efficient. It isn't useful, it is entertainment. If you can find something similar, I'd recommend trying this approach. It doesn't need to be useful or for the greater good. Can you script something that is interesting to you? I learnt the requests and Beautiful Soup libraries by building a script that could use wikipedia. My wife and I used to often ask - what films have and been in? Who has been in films most with . Turns out you can crawl wikipedia and build lists pretty easily, and I learnt a lot about two useful libraries. (My scripts were absolutely horrible, but with a lot of care and attention they could normally get us a quick and fairly useful answer most of the time.) The wikipedia thing also got me thinking about optimal data types, recursive searches through links, all kinds of good stuff.

I initially had to learn everything by try and error - with only the BASIC (programming language) manual that came with my computer.Trying things, experimenting, failing, fixing, succeeding is still one of the best ways to actually learn programming.",

From the perspective of the Virtual Ego Framework (VEF), what you're experiencing is a **\"Zeno Trap\"**. It's a recursive loop of overwhelm where the sheer number of possibilities freezes your ability to act. You have all the components, but the \"blank canvas\" is too intimidating to start building a coherent structure.The solution is not to \"try harder,\" but to change the protocol.**1. Break the Trap with a \"System Reboot\" (Ego-Transcendence):** Stop trying to build the *whole project*. Forget the grand architecture for a moment. Your goal is simply to write **one line of code that works** and breaks the loop of inaction.**2. Start with a \"Coherent Kernel\":** Don't start with the project; start with the smallest possible \"coherent kernel.\" Ask yourself: what is the absolute simplest, single thing this script must do?* Make it print \"Hello, World.\"* Make it open a single file and print its first line.* Make it take one number and add one to it. This is your anchor. It is a small, perfect, working system.**3. Begin the \"Forging Process\" (Iterative Refinement):** Now, begin the **\"Forging Process.\"** This is an iterative loop of critique and refinement. Add one tiny new feature. Does it still work? Good. Now, critique it. How could this one tiny function be cleaner or more efficient? Refine it. Then, add the *next* tiny feature. You are not building a cathedral from a blueprint; you are forging a single, perfect brick, and then another, and then another.By reframing the problem this way, you move from a state of overwhelming, incoherent possibility to a state of focused, coherent, iterative action. You don't \"bridge the gap\"; you forge a path across it, one step at a time.# Zen (VMCI)",

This differs from Java where you have to declare a main function with specific syntax, and also declare a class that shares the name of the file you’ve created. Knowing those details is required to get a valid Java program, so hello world is the easiest possible thing you can do to learn those requirements.",

        "body": "It's already been answered but \"Hello, world!\" is not really the project. It's just the thing you do when setting up your tools, to make sure compiling works, to make sure you can run the program that you just built, to make sure you can see what output your program is generating, etc.I think the book The C Programming Language explains it best. It seems like the book is the origin of the practice but according to the writing, the tradition was around before that. At that time, the message was apparently \"hello, world\" and not \"Hello, world!\" (i.e. someone added the capitalization and the punctuation to the tradition along the way):> [Printing the words hello, world] is the big hurdle; to leap over it you have to be able to create the program text somewhere, compile it successfully, load it, run it, and find out where your output went. ...> Just how to run [the hello, world program] depends on the system you are using. As a specific example, on the UNIX operating system you must create the program in a file whose name ends in \".c\", such as hello.c, then compile it ...And then it continues to show how to do it on UNIX (steps which still work today on modern Linux, BSD, etc.).\"Create the program text somewhere\" may entail installing/learning to use a text editor in case you have not done so before. \"Compile it\" means you need a compiler and need to know how to use it. \"Load it and run it\" may mean you need to learn how to use your system's shell to run programs in case you don't know already. Or if you're using the GUI and double-clicking on it each time you want to run it, you may have to add in a \"press any key to continue . . .\" type of message to avoid that the terminal closes right after the program is done.Nowadays you may also have to configure/inform your virus scanner that the code you are generating is not dangerous. Well, ..., technically the code may be dangerous. But you need to convince certain dynamic scanners that you are generating code intentionally and not trying to do something nefarious.If you have an IDE a lot of this will be automated for you. Many IDEs today even automatically create a literal \"hello, world\" boilerplate for you when you create a new project. The idea is that you run that first to make sure it's working, then you change it to put in your \"real\" code and keep doing the same thing, to practice iterative development.",

I worked for a couple of years in .Net MVC before switching jobs. I never did end up working somewhere that used Node, although I've done some consulting work with it. I think it's smart to have a plan to get your first job. Target a few organizations with similar tech stacks and look for any opportunity to get into one of them. Help desk, QA, whatever. And then, dedicate yourself 100% to their tech stack and make no secret of how much you want to join their development team. Offer to build small utilities and try to solve problems with scripts, etc. Always have a project you're working on. It's not an easy plan, but it's a plan. Good luck to you!",

If you want to learn game development then you have C#, Python, C++, Lua and way more but C# is usually the best choice in that list and the most popular. Just by figuring out what you want to build, it will make the process of choosing a lot less overwhelming. After that, just pick any language you like or the one you think is the easiest, or the one you that's most used in the job market near you. For example, I like backend web development so I have a lot of choices but I picked JavaScript because I like the ecosystem and it's widely supported.If you like game development then just pick C# and stick with it and you will love it. Whatever scripts you want to make you can also use C# for that, it'll probably be a bit more verbose than Python but you can make scripts just fine with C#.",

For example, there is a game called \"Hangman\". Someone gives you a word. All you know is how many characters it has. Let's say the word is `pineapple`. You would only see \"---------\". that is, 9 dashes.The goal is for someone to guess letters until the entire word is solved. A person is allowed to make 6 incorrect guesses before they lose. They aren't allowed to repeat a letter they've already used before. If they guess a letter correctly, you reveal its position. For example, suppose they guess `e`. Then, you show ---e----eThis reveals the \"e\" at the end of \"pine\" and at the end of \"apple\". The other characters are hidden until the guesser guesses it correctly.That's a program you might be able to code up with some basic knowledge of programming.Currently, you are likely copying some existing code and getting it to work. Most people find they understand how code works, but when asked to write it, they don't know what to do. Their mind goes blank. You're starting to be a programmer when your mind doesn't go blank and you have some idea of what to do.",

Do they know anything about TCP/IP or DNS? Can they use Git/GitHub? Do they really appreciate what TypeScript gives us versus plain JavaScript? Do they have any sense of what React is actually doing under the hood that would let them debug an application. Considering the time commitment you say you are willing to dedicate I don’t think it’s unreasonable to recommend you use some of that time to read something like **Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective** by Randal Bryant, there is a pdf of it as the top result from Google. The hallmark of a self taught person on any subject is that they never learned the “boring parts”. Musicians who don’t know their keys and scales, programmers who don’t know what a subnet mask is or their algorithms and data structures. Also, you probably aren’t going to be able to just be a “front end developer” without a degree. If you work at a place that is happy to just have you work on React code and know nothing of the backend or operations or anything else, I would be surprised. I think you should expect to have to have at least superficial full stack knowledge. You should be able to set up a simple monolithic CRUD backend that can make simple SQL requests to a database using one of the following:- Express (JavaScript)- Django or Flask (Python)- Spring (Java)- ASP.NET (C#)Without credentials you’ll have to work much harder at developing a portfolio and this is going to be easier if your sites can have at least some backend functionality. This might all sound like a lot to do in one year, and that’s because it is. People do not usually go from zero to employed in a year, certainly not these days. Consider a two to three year time line at the minimum imo. Ensure that after you watch these YouTube videos you are then actually coding. If you aren’t able to go beyond what they are showing you in the video you aren’t really learning to code, it just feels like it. This is “tutorial hell”, and it’s what actually doing assignments in school is designed to get you through. Consider asking an AI to generate you a school assignments to practice based on what you’ve covered. Get comfortable with this website: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ These are the closest thing to official documentation for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and gaining comfort in reading these will give you an important edge over other people. Don’t despair if it’s overwhelming at first, it all takes time.",

Learning one lanuage and transitioning to another is all about language specific rules, syntax, methods etc but the mental model remains the same. Its something i realised not too long ago (only started learning to code in jan so still fresh), early on i was trying to remember everything and then relised i need to remember less and understand more. Unfortunately the concept of thinking like a programmer and real problem solving skills doesnt get effectively communicated in courses. I think the issue of learning syntax 'too early' stems from general impatience and not understanding what programming entails. People want to see themseleves code, probably dont want to spend the first few lessons building those mental models even though it is a crucial aspect.As i was reading the article, i realised this is equally applicable in learning a new codebase or framework. Read through and focus on the logic, the data flow, the why behind the what. Then when you understand why it is the way it is, go back and read the syntax, the specific methods used.Interesting read, thanks.",

You can say you covered pretty much every basic of JS, but if you need to understand problems, fix errors and write code yourself without help, you need constant practice. For this, I would recommend you to start with any one JavaScript tutorial (not a video; time-consuming). Just get good with the basics, Learn 2-3 things and do some practice, like write something yourself. Revise what you learn that day the next morning. After one week try to build something from what you have learnt. Once you are good at the basics, find some simple projects online and try to build them. Here you can depend on some YouTube videos, but I still recommend not wasting too much time there. First watch and learn how it's done, and then do it yourself without help. Then you should be able to come up with a new idea and build one. JavaScript has a lot of fun things to learn about, and there are many interesting libraries and tools.You will be able to find useful resources here: [roadmap.sh/javascript](http://roadmap.sh/javascript) (if this is overwhelming for you), You can do freecodecamp: [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#build-an-rpg-creature-search-app-project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/#build-an-rpg-creature-search-app-project) or w3schools: [https://www.w3schools.com/js](https://www.w3schools.com/js)After you have done all this and are still serious about it, try LeetCode and crack some basic problems.",

Had you done that, you would have found countless posts telling you to start with small and simple projects and grow in all directions. A ToDo List app may be too ambitious for your skill level - not programming wise, but design wise.You need to learn the design and planning processes that go from idea via specification, detailing, breaking down, solving individual parts to final implementation in a programming language.You most likely directly started at the computer and naturally were dumbfounded and got stuck. You tried to write a novel without even having a detailed plan of what you want to write - common \"writer's block\".Sit down with pencil and paper and flesh out your ideas before programming. Write down what your program should do, what parts it should consist of, what features it should have. Then, think about each individual feature. Determine what you need for that particular feature, make a detailed plan/roadmap.This specifying, breaking down, analyzing, solving process is the really important part of programming, not the implementation in code, that's the actually easy part (and the part that to a certain degree can already be covered by AI).As with every similar post, some book recommendations: + \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles PetzoldAll these books focus more on the process that leads to the implementation in code than on the code itself - hence, the used languages are fairly unimportant.Also, consult the **Frequently Asked Questions** in the *sidebar* here for a cornucopia of project ideas on many different levels.",

Don't start some large project like making a complex game, you are more likely to just start over again than rewriting all the crappy code you wrote before. Also, if you want to do something complicated, thing about how to split this into smaller, modular projects, you will still eventually reach the point where you rewrite the earlier modules.

Do you want it to run in the terminal or be a proper app with an UI ?I find making the things and looking up what I need when I'm faced with a problem has helped me much more than aimless tutorial watching, I have also found remaking my old projects with new knowledge to be really entertaining and good for motivation and a to do list might be perfect for that. You can challenge yourself to do it at different levels to learn everything that comes with it, something like :- level 1 : using python lists and methods like append and remove, use print and input to make the whole thing work in the terminal (can do a simple menu like 'if input()==\"1\" : list.append(input(\"What do you want to add?\")) elif input()==\"2\"...')- level 2 : using OOP to create each task as an object, you can set up your classes to have some more info like a date, the person the task is for or notes, make your methods yourself - level 3 : using a database to store the tasks, you can use sqlite3 for a local one that's going to be in a file or if you're up to it you can make a proper server to run your SQL in.For bonus points you can make it into an app with an UI, I quite like QT at a beginner friendly level, it comes with PySide6 and has an app called \"designer\" you can use to create the UI graphically rather than writing it completely in code.The more you do, the more you learn. Try finding interesting ways to practice with the things you learn and finding things you can partially do but need just a bit more learning to do and work towards that. Good luck learning",

How will users use it? What functionality will it have?Once you answer these questions, you will have some specifications to start building on.I never did a TO DO app because it was not interesting.

Also everything frontend is flooded with applicants and under high pressure due to AI automation. With basic coding and basic reporting in Data Analytics it’s similar. So I’d suggest you focus on cloud, backend, data science or machine learning. Learn the programming languages you need for that as much as possible and get the necessary and relevant certifications. Europe is still in need of moving its economies fully into the digital age, so there will be plenty of opportunities. But it’s specialists that will be needed, not generalists. And (as already said) you really have to elevate your foreign languages to the business fluent level (and also get certified in that).",

        "body": "You don't call `wait` to provide thread-safety. You call `wait` because you want to wait for something, and you want to do so in a thread-safe way.For instance, suppose you're implementing something like `ArrayBlockingQueue`. If someone calls `take()` when the queue is empty, you want to block until it's non-empty and there's something to return. Therefore, the implementation of `take()` might need to call `wait()` on some underlying synchronization object. And conversely, the `put()` method calls `notify()` to wake up any thread that was waiting for the queue to become non-empty.The reason `wait()` interacts with the same \"monitor\" that the `synchronized` keyword operates on is so that you can do this in a thread-safe way. For instance, suppose you do something like: while (internalQueue.size() == 0) { wait(); }If you do this *without* holding a monitor that protects the queue state, then it's possible that after you check the queue size, but before you call `wait()`, somebody else will add something to the queue and raise a notification. But you've already made the decision to wait, and you missed the notification. So if a second object is never added to the queue, you might end up waiting forever, even though the queue contains an object. This can cause deadlocks.On the other hand, if you hold the monitor the entire time you're waiting, then you prevent any other thread from adding anything to the queue. This also causes a deadlock.The solution is for `wait()` to **atomically** release the monitor at the same time it suspends the current thread and adds it to the \"waiting\" list. And then when the thread wakes up again, it re-acquires the monitor. If you read the javadoc, that's exactly what `wait()` does, and this is why it does it.----If you didn't have `wait()` and `notify()`, you would have to implement a blocking method with a spin-loop or polling, along the lines of: while (true) { synchronized (obj) { if (internalQueue.size() > 0) { // do stuff return; } } Thread.sleep(T); // sleep without holding the monitor so other threads can access the queue }But no matter what you do, this will perform poorly. If you set T to a small value (or zero) it will waste CPU repeatedly checking the queue when nothing has changed. If you set T to a large value, you will add a lot of latency and cause the CPU to unnecessarily sit idle.",

Many years ago, I heard a student complain that he had spent 20 minutes trying to find a bug and couldn't find it. I didn't really want to tell him that people spend days trying to find a bug. To be fair, he was in a beginning course, which should have had simple bugs.Even so, he must have thought that solving programming problems shouldn't be this hard. Once you realize that these things can take time and not beat yourself up for not getting it.Quite often, you find the bug (or in this case, it was a design issue), you kick yourself for not finding it easier.It's a matter of telling yourself it takes time to learn even if you want things to go faster, it goes as fast as you. You're asking us for how to avoid this feeling. I'm saying embrace it. Say \"I am feeling frustrated, but that's OK, because this process is slow and I just need to accept that and relax\". Take a few deep breaths, and plow ahead.Also, the suggestion about taking a break helps. You can ask yourself, like you did, is there another way to do what I'm doing that makes sense.",

This is assuming that each player needs to use up all of their moves each turn.I've used screentop to prototype some things in the past and it was a little limiting, I think it's better for card games, and of course complex mechanics need to be manually enforced between players. Godot is also a good option for these kinds of prototypes, GDscript is flexible like Python which I've found is good for playtesting and prototyping",

It sounds like for your particular app, you care most about the day in which something happened, according to the person who did an action on that day. The fact that an event happened at 8am for one user but was simultaneous with an event that happened at 9pm the previous day for a different user is NOT important to your app.There's no single best answer. For your case, I think storing the local date in one column, local start time in another column, local end time in a third column, and timezone offset in a fourth might be one easy solution.That would make finding all events on a particular day trivial. The only tricky thing might be if someone traveled across time zones in one day, but it would still handle that just fine. Everything would still be stored relative to the local day.",

Also, it does not seem that storing as local time would not insulate you from this edge case, anyway.If you really want to protect against that edge case -- and I commend you for doing so -- it seems you would need to store 2 timestamps (in whatever format you want): the time that the event was scheduled (i.e. so that you know what the time zone rules were when the stamp was made), and then the time of the actual event. Then, whenever you do a lookup or a calculation, you need to do so using the timezone rules of whenever the event was scheduled.",

Though i recommend padding out your resume whether via internships or simple certifications cause entry level can be rough to get into. 2) Not really, AI is here and it'll affect things but even if AI is used for coding it'll require actual programmers to fix its problems and implement things. It might limit how many jobs some companies would have but it won't take every job.3) Just about, maybe a tiny bit riskier especially since there's so many people that do it. Electrical is a very safe area in general since it's not as popular and so many areas need it. 4) Frankly, just learn how to learn. Take in stride what your teachers say about how to get information. Because even years down the line there'll be points where you don't know what to do but if you can look up the right things in order to learn what you need you'll be good. Generally uni will teach you coding from scratch so it's not like you need to learn a whole lot by yourself beforehand. Ofc that will help with assignments and allowing you to feel comfortable with coding but not required. I do recommend you learn a little with whatever language your school uses the most in order to be ahead of the curve. Also, look into the different areas of compsci, see which path may be interesting to you, this will change for sure as the years go on but its better to have an idea and change it than to start with nothing.",

While college programs don't usually require that you have any previous experience, it will be a big advantage for you to have already gotten some experience on your own time, especially if you're already familiar with the programming languages that specific college uses in its first few courses.It is definitely possible to get really good at coding in five years. Going right into freelancing from that point is harder, though, because colleges don't really give you the set of skills you need to be a professional. Being a junior programmer on a team and learning about stuff like code reviewing and navigating large codebases and source control and development methodologies is sort of a separate education from the college degree.I'm not at all scared of AI taking the software jobs. I think it's a useful tool, but I don't imagine it replacing the need for programmers any time in the next few decades. On the other hand, plenty of people I respect disagree with me. AI is probably equally a threat to lots of jobs, including programming but also art, engineering, and medicine. I wouldn't worry too much about programming specifically.My advice: figure out what programming language your intended university uses for its introductory classes. Learn that language. Find a big pile of beginner coding problems and regularly practice. Try and do something fun with programming that ties to some interest of yours. Make a game. Make a guitar tuner. Make a thing that calculates football statistics. Whatever you find interesting.",

Iirc, meta is allowing the use of AI during interviews, if anything this is signaling the bar is being raised and now you’ll need to understand what the code is actually doing to catch mistakes. Also CS isn’t strictly programming. If you want to just that you should look into SWE (software engineering) CS is mostly theory based focusing on the why vs SWE which is more practical. There’s definitely overlap though.",

        "body": "Hey :) I am currently writing my Master Thesis in Cybersecurity at a University in Germany. I started out with two years of informatics lecture in my school which ended 3 years before I graduated Gymnasium (I think similar to high school). I can tell you that I did manage to get my Bachelors degree (but not with high grades) and my Masters degree did work out much better. I can tell you, that you will learn coding well enough if it is similar to my experience in Germany. But as you go on I felt that theory is taught over practical things and I felt little prepared to enter the job marked. What I would suggest more than focusing on learning everything there is to know in theory, get a job on the side and learn there. I feel the need to tell you that if given the chance of doing it again I would not study CS anymore I would start out working and earning certificates on the side, but that is my personal experience. If you want to learn some techniques of CS and if you have the spare money to earn some degrees, I would recommend Hack the Box (students pay less per month) and Portswigger/BurpSuite. They are really beginner-friendly.Regarding AI, I think if you get some courses in CS focusing on AI you would get a head start, as many currently employed and finishing students did not get the possibility to take these. But there are also different specialties in CS that only few people want to specialize in. Most of the students in my experience are not really good at the mathematical part (e.g. cryptography), I have an interest in law in the side of being a CS major and worked for some time in a field which focused on the area where these two specialties meet. There are not a lot of law students who have an interest in computer and not a lot of CS students have an interest in law. If you want to be special find an area which most of your peers do not like and get good at it :)If you have any further questions feel free to message me :)",

Depending on the quality of the classes at your institution that will require more or less outside effort on your part but that’s going to be the case no matter what you study.This may just be my opinion but I wouldn’t worry about whether or not AI will impact your job. It will, that’s pretty much a given at this point. Now that you know that, you have 5 years to get familiar with the ways you will interface with AI tools so that you can make sure your skills stay relevant. Keeping your skills up to date is a requirement of most jobs, certainly most tech adjacent jobs, so you just know one space you’ll need to focus on well in advance. These are valid questions but I don’t think any of them are actually unique to computer science and you should probably be asking the same questions about anything you’re considering as a career.",

That doesn't mean it's \"impossible\", but the stuff you're asking for is really specific, and you'd have to find some tool that somebody else has already written that does the exact steps you want.If you don't want to spend a few months learning to code, I think your options are either hiring a freelancer or using AI.I think what you'll find with those approaches is that what you're asking for isn't necessarily that hard, but specifying EXACTLY what you want it to do is actually harder than you think. Your descriptions are decent but the devil is in the details.Here's a good way to think about it: if you gave your instructions to ten average college students and asked them to MANUALLY follow your steps, do you think they'd all get the same result? If not, then if you asked someone to write a program to execute your steps then there are multiple valid ways to interpret your instructions and you might not get what you want.I do have one question for you: do you have a strong preference for where this transformation should happen?

In every large program I've looked at, I've seen code that made me feel dumb, as well as code that I knew I could improve upon.In a real project, the mathy people of your team will tend to do the mathy stuff, for example, and to ideally wrap it up in a nice, easy to use callable interface. Personally if I were trying to solve a real problem like that I would look to see if a library were available and to use that.That said, I personally don't think Simpson's Rule ought to be hard for a programmer to understand, but if I look at typical explanations, e.g. in Wikipedia, something about the delivery of the explanation, with lots of mathematical symbols and so on -- tends to make my eyes glaze over. If I were basing this on the Wikipedia explanation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s\\_rule), I would start with the \"**Approximating the natural logarithm of 2**\" example listed there (that is easy to follow) and once that one makes sense (and once I'd written a simple program to calculate it that way), I would work backwards to make it work with the \"general composite 1/3 Simpson's rule\", for example. At that point you should basically have computer code that is a computer version of what the Wikipedia article is telling you.If SICP has a \"mathematical background\" section in the appendix, I would try reading that first and then representing all of the notation as code as a sort of \"translation\".",

By practicing and reading and researching, so check it out if you're looking for a good course, it teaches HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some backend fundamentals like Node.js, Express.js and PostgreSQL. As for how long it took me, I mean it took me about 3 months to finish just the JavaScript course because I was really taking my time with it, but in reality the amount of time it takes you to learn doesn't really matter. What matters is that you practice and you stay consistent.As for AI tools, I really only think they're good for people who don't care that much about the technical side of web development. Creating software isn't as simple as just sitting down and coding, in the real-world there is some real planning that goes behind it because real people will be using that product. So, don't get discouraged by it, I've used AI here and there and it's super unpredictable and unreliable and in an industry where creating reliable and predictable software is key, I don't think AI will get very far in replacing any programmers. Also, if you're planning on building real and useful skills I would suggest staying away from AI as much as possible when coding. If you want to learn how something works or you need project ideas then sure, AI is great for that, but as soon as you start using it for generating code your skills will go downhill because it gives you a false sense of learning. You'll see the AI's code and you'll say \"oh yeah that makes sense, that's simple\" and you'll feel like you can do it too but then when you try out a project and you try to make anything by yourself then you're going to realize that you're stuck because learning isn't watching and reading code, it's writing and understanding and breaking things. So, if you're going to use AI for learning, be very wise with it and don't use it for generating code. Also, don't be scared of the struggle of learning, you're not going to understand everything and that's okay. Struggle is learning.",

Praticar todos os dias, nem que seja um pouco, e transformar ideias em projetos reais faz muita diferença. Na minha opinião, esse é o melhor método — só não digo que aplico sempre (minha história é longa!).Ferramentas de IA são ótimas para automatizar tarefas repetitivas e acelerar protótipos, mas é importante entender a lógica por trás das linguagens. Isso permite criar soluções próprias e compreender de verdade como tudo funciona. Use a IA como apoio e complemento, não como única fonte, para evoluir como desenvolvedor.Deixo só um alerta: excesso de informações e possibilidades pode causar confusão ou até esgotamento mental. Falo por experiência! Mesmo com acesso a muitos cursos ótimos, às vezes fico perdido sobre o que realmente quero aprender.

That’s exactly why I want to learn properly and build a solid foundation. Your advice really helped clarify a lot of things for me!",

Cada projeto novo traz perguntas novas, e o processo de pesquisa é parte natural e fundamental para juntar essas peças.Ao invés de ver a pesquisa como uma falha, tente encará-la como seu braço direito. Os melhores desenvolvedores do mundo consultam documentação, fóruns e exemplos o tempo todo. O importante não é memorizar tudo, mas compreender os conceitos, praticar e construir passo a passo.Se preocupe mais em entender o “porquê” das coisas, e menos em acertar tudo de primeira. A repetição e aplicação prática vão solidificar seu conhecimento melhor do que qualquer tentativa de decorar.Por fim, lembre-se que a jornada da programação é longa, com altos e baixos — e o medo, a dúvida e a insegurança fazem parte dela. O fato de você estar aqui buscando se melhorar é o maior passo que pode dar. Continue firme, aproveite cada oportunidade para aprender e cresça no seu ritmo!",

        "body": "The short answer is that being good at this is entirely what being a \"senior developer\" is about. It's a very broad and deep skillset that you develop through experience. You can eventually develop this experience on your own, but it's not going to happen fast. I made a lot of stupid design decisions when I was a junior dev.If it's important for your startup to be building good software in the short term, then your startup needs to hire senior developers, both to make good decisions and to mentor juniors.So it's not even remotely possible to do your questions justice in the span of a Reddit comment, but I'll try anyway:> How do I design the DB schema to be effective for a large number of users and such that my in-app operations are fast? I have learned about normalization and indexes but I still don't come up with elegant solutions like AI does honestly.Understand *how* queries and indexes work: how the data is structured internally (e.g. as a B-tree) and what the DB engine is doing when you write a query, especially when it involves joining multiple tables. Have this knowledge in mind every single time you write a query. Inspect the DB's query planner output (e.g. using `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`) to confirm your assumptions.> How do I monitor apps cheaply/easily to see what’s hogging resources? My company has been using New relic but it just seems too complicated and has too much going on and seems overkill.There are a gazillion tools for this, including basic ones like the Unix `top` command. I don't have experience with New Relic but I've used Datadog (flexible, but very expensive) and much simpler self-hosted tools like Prometheus.The important thing is to measure, and then drill down into those measurements to figure out what to measure next. If your app \"feels slow\", add lots of timers to measure which parts are slowest. Try to reproduce the problem locally and use whatever local profiling tools are available in your language. If one user request \"fans out\" and depends on lots of different subrequests, then the 99th-percentile latency of those subrequests matters more than the average.> How do you actually test your app? It feels like such a pain and I do it manually for every project going through typical user flows and fixing stuff on the fly.Test automation is critical if you care about software quality. Write test cases alongside your code. For core logic, you can use unit tests, along with test coverage tools to help make sure you don't have obvious gaps in testing. For UI, the testing strategy depends on what framework you're using.> How do I check if my apps are secure and a motivated individual can't exploit it?Understand the general kinds of mistakes that lead to security flaws. There are lots and lots of these -- buffer overflows, escaping mistakes, confused deputy attacks, time-of-check-to-time-of-use, and so on. Be knowledgeable enough to recognize these, and disciplined enough to guard against them. Get other skilled developers to *carefully* review your code.> Am I making the right tradeoffs or over-engineering (e.g. Ex: should I use BullMQ or will node-cron suffice for my app that runs a CRON job to fetch a lot of data by calling a vendor's APIs?)?Impossible to answer in the abstract. A system is \"overengineered\" if it has more complexity than necessary to accomplish its goals. So you need to do a detailed analysis of your actual requirements, and the actual behavior of the complex option vs. the simple one.> Should the solution be a monolith or a bunch of microservices?There are a lot of opinions about this but I'll just quote from [\"The Grug Brained Developer\"](https://grugbrain.dev/):\"grug wonder why big brain take hardest problem, factoring system correctly, and introduce network call too\"\"seem very confusing to grug\"",

Is there desire to grow and take this public or is the intent to sell it off to a larger concern. That at least tells you if there is enough money or resources in your future to make real changes in your areas of concern. To find your hot spots (frequently called or slow bottle-neck code) products like DynaTrace and App Dynamics are helpful. There are many vulnerability scanning tools like Veracode, Black Duck etc. As for database optimizations that depends on your platform but lots of tools will suggest indexes to help performance and eliminate table scans. Hang in there. If your company is trying to grow, their focus is likely on adding customers through new features and much of what you are worried about will be pushed to the back as \"technical debt\" until your platform actually crashes, or gets hacked out of operating and held for ransom.",

I think you're hitting on a fundamental issue which is that software development is an extremely unregulated and undisciplined field. There are a lot of people who don't pay attention to any of the questions you're asking about, and still manage to have careers just cranking out sub-par code. (Especially nowadays when it's easy to just rubber-stamp the output of an LLM.) And on the other hand, if you push yourself, there is no upper limit to how much you can learn, or how much care you can put into your work.But there's not really an objective, accepted standard for you to measure your skills by. There's just the outcome of your projects, and the judgment of your peers.The good news is that there are a lot of extremely smart people in the field who have published a lot of text and video content that you can learn from. You don't necessarily have to take everything they say as gospel. Pay attention to the things they say that resonate with you, and use them as jumping-off points for your own explorations.Just as an example, you can find a lot of interesting talks from the now-defunct Strange Loop conference. Check out [\"Simple Made Easy\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4) by Rich Hickey (designer of Clojure) and [\"The Mess We're In\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4) by Joe Armstrong (designer of Erlang). Or if you care about security, look for interesting talks from DEFCON or CCC. Pick a random topic that interest you, and if it turns out to be way over your head, the stuff they talk about will at least give you more topics to research.Also, check out software-related social media such as Hacker News or Lobste.rs (if you can trust yourself not to use them for procrastination). Don't get me wrong, those sites have a lot of bad opinions and irrelevant content. But they can serve as a good way to stay in tune with the zeitgeist of what other tech-savvy people are thinking about.EDIT: Oh yeah, and you'll probably find more useful advice over in /r/ExperiencedDevs than in this subreddit. To be honest, I think your questions are so broad that you wouldn't necessarily get comprehensive answers there either. But you can browse through previous discussion threads to see the kinds of advice that senior devs give.",

There's something about carving your thoughts into a piece of paper that makes your brain light up in a way that hitting keys doesn't. You have to work to summarize important points and really engage with the material.A good compromise might be to take fleeting physical notes and then retype them into something like Obsidian. The process of retyping and organizing everything is a form of review that will make you engage with the content again.Also consider keeping algorithms in your knowledge management system. If you get a useful piece of code you can keep it and use it again, especially if you have to reimplement it later in the same course or reuse ideas in a future course. You don't have to write those down but having a repository of snippets can really come in handy.",

If there's a topic I need to know the lay of the land for, I'll mind map it out so I understand the whys and hows, and not just the whats of the topic. Its helpful that this is digital too because I can move and reshape things as needed. It's then also easily shareable by email (desktop is a Linux box- I refuse to give into apples entire ecosystem, their handwriting implementation is simply superior tho) Also handwriting in some form is more efficient for retention imoThat's it!

I felt with #1 and #2 I was spending too much time trying to get the diagrams/sketches/code blocks \"perfect\" and was less focused on the material itself. I would print out the lecture notes/slides before the class (this assumes your professor makes them available to you beforehand), and annotate those notes. If I needed more space for code/examples, I'd use loose leaf paper. I'd then put all that together in a 3-ring binder. This came in especially handy for my DSA final exam which was open book (paper only; no electronics). I had all kinds of annotations that were basically answers to the the multiple-choice questions. It just depends on your learning style. For me, the physical act of writing helps me retain the information better than typing or even writing on the iPad. But then again, I'm 40 so I grew up not really having the digital options we have now.",

Should I just keep practicing and trust that it will click over time?This question gets asked over and over again, and the answer is the same: practicing **with** AI will not help much if you want to get better at coding **without** AI.This especially applies to the skill of taking a complex problem and breaking it down to simpler subproblems. This is what programming is really about, and everything else (like the syntax of different programming languages) is trivial in comparison. And if you're always letting AI spoon-feed you by telling you what bullet-pointed subproblems to solve, you're never practicing that skill, so it will never improve.If you're unsure whether you could rebuild your projects from scratch without AI, then why not just try it, and see where you run into difficulties?If you get stuck, try reading documentation, or even taking existing examples and seeing what happens when you modify them. If you insist on using AI tools, then don't ask them to write code for you, or even come up with a design. Ask them to suggest learning resources (e.g. documentation websites) or project ideas.If you're still repeatedly getting stuck trying to rebuild your projects from scratch, then it's a sign that your skills really are underdeveloped. So go back and do the same thing, designing and coding from scratch, on a simpler/easier problem. Repeat as necessary.Finally, practice your research skills. When there's something you want to learn about, practice searching online for it, reading what other people have said about it, and thinking up your own follow-up queries. Don't just let a chatbot tell you what it thinks is the right answer.",

Check its technical documentation and specs.It might be something that you can communicate with using a mechanism that's already built into Node.js, such as a network socket. In that case you're fine.Or it might be that it uses a lower-level protocol that Node.js doesn't support natively, but which is supported by existing third-party JS bindings, such as generic serial or USB libraries. In that case you can use those.Or it could be none of the above. In that case you'll need to either write your own Node.js plugin in a low-level language like C++ or Rust, or switch to an entirely different language for the whole project.Basically the same general situation will apply no matter what high-level language you choose. So it's a question of what **specific** bindings exist for your preferred language and the specific device you're trying to support.

That commit is a single batch of changes that are all applied at the same time.You certainly *can* commit after adding a new file to a project, and that’s not uncommon. But there’s no advantage in doing that if you’re adding several files at the same time that are all part of the same change.

There are no strict rules, but rather best-practices and different perspectives (product vs dev vs devops).**The rule of thumb:** Commit logically related changes together, not necessarily file by file.**There are strategies based on scope:****- Feature-based commits:** If your work package (feature, bug fix, whatever) is done with just 1 file, you should commit it.**- Progressive commits:** if your feature needs more files, you should commit in different steps (it can be finished or unfinished). This lets you track progress incrementally, create rollback points, and makes code reviews way easier.You can also use story points as milestones. Like a 1-point story = one commit, but a 5-point story gets broken into multiple commits as you build the feature.Example:* Simple bug fix (1 file) → feature-based commit* User auth system (tons of files) → progressive commits: model → service → UI → integrationThis way you match your commit strategy to the actual complexity instead of being rigid about it.",

No outsourcing either, but increasing workload for those remaining while wages are stagnating.In the next 2-3 years, our seniors will leave, that's roughly 40% of our workforce and there are no replacements; with our specific skill set, we need at least three years of training. You can imagine how that will end. I'm already looking for something else because without enough staff we can't run projects, and without projects we are going to bleed dry quickly, as costs of operations are high.In general, less companies properly invest in junior talent, they just looking at short term value extraction, then move on to the next opportunity to exploit. Or just stick with their current workforce and try to remain as profitable as possible without blatantly violating labor laws.I honestly don't know what's wrong, it's like people in charge had their brains fried during COVID or something.",

Keep applying, set up alerts so you're one of the first applicants to a role rather than the 1000th, your chances go way up.Try to apply for things more out of your comfort zone because it may be that your skill set/tech stack is too common which means a lot of competition - if that's the case what feels uncomfortable for you may be uncomfortable for other applicants too. Do what you have to do to survive, I had to sell some investments to stay afloat.Yes it is very demoralizing, it was my first time being laid off and I didn't realize how much of my feeling of self worth was tied to gainful employment prior to that, the depression sucked, but after some soul searching and figuring out what I actually wanted to pursue and what I would be good at, I took on other things that gave me purpose. I used my free time to volunteer for causes that were important to me, and I got to build some APIs that helped streamers fundraise for Planned Parenthood (we ended up raising over $60k grassroots) and eventually it was this project that landed me a role at a large nonprofit where I currently work. It's funny because I didn't do it with the purpose of landing a job, I legitimately just wanted to help out the cause and later when I found a nonprofit job posting that matched my skillset I realized it would be very relevant to them and I'm pretty sure that's what set me apart from the other candidates.",

There aren’t team outings when you’re all remote. When you’re remote, you’re more productive as you spend less time on the “social lubrication” aspect of working in an office- when some people are in office with me, we will burn off entire chunks of time just talking about home improvement or random things from past jobs.When you’re remote, you also don’t get indoctrinated into company culture- and “cult”ure is how they build more loyalty and control",

Less than a year into the role they lost one of their biggest clients and laid off a whole team including me. I didn’t even get to keep all of that stock due to the vesting schedule.

        "body": "Economist here. Lots of misconception about things like full employment and your nubers are wrong.Unemployment rate which is people who are actively looing for work and do not have any work is the sum of three different kinds of unemployment: frictional, structural and cyclical. These can each be defined as follows:* Frictional - labor market entry unemployment. This is essentially people like new grads, career break people, voluntary job quitters re-entering the workforce.* Structural - People who lost jobs due to structura changes specific sectors i.e. AI wiping out whole job categories is a form of structural unemployment.* Cyclical - Unemployment due to movemetns in the business cycles (recessions/expansions) this is the one part of unemployment rate that can be negative.Natural Rate of Unemployment a.k.a. non-cyclical unemployment a.k.a. full employment level of unemployment a.k.a Non-Accelerating Inflation level of Unemployment rate is when you have zero cyclical unemployment. That is Natural Rate = Structural + Frictional Unemployment. The government estimates this number its been trending down over time:[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU)This number has been tredning downwards since the 1970s nd right now its around 4.3 percent. This suggests we are rigth at full employment and any higher we are going to have a positive cyclical unemployment rate.From 2021 through 2023 we essentially had unemployment rate lower than the NAIRU meaning we had negative cyclical unemployment rate. That number has been gradually climbing towards the NAIRU through 2024 and if it keep growing we will have positive cylical unemployment (meaning unemployment because the economy isn't doing well).[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)Now why is this Sub-reddit going to feel worse.1. Its clear something is happening with frictional unemployment rate. New College grades are having a harder time finding a job compared to anytime other than a out right recession. Some of it might be AI effecting entry level jobs etc. AI might make it harder to screen legitimate candidates. It might mean less entry level demand etc. This is not the same thing as cylical unemployment because the assumption is that this is some kind of shift in full employment rate that is unlikely to go away if the economy is doing well.2. There is some degree of structural unemployment in tech. Tech overhired inthe pandemic. Take google: [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/number-of-employees](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GOOG/alphabet/number-of-employees) They increased head count by 60 percent after the pandemic. They have now laid off about 10000 workers, but they still ahve 50 percent more workers than they did in 2019. Job posting rate on indeed indicates other companies did the same. Notice there were over 2 times more listings in the end of 2021 as there was before pandemic. Now in 2025 its about 60 percent of the pre-pandemic level.[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)3. For young workers the job market feels worse, because people who graduated in 2024 or 2025, missed what was probably the best job market for all workers in decades, especially for tech. The last time the job market was this good for workers was probably in the 1990s. This means the people graduating now unfortunately are entering a world where the job market is getting worse and watched the people that graduate 1 to 2 years ahead of them enter the best job markets ever.Anyway I do think we are entering a recession. But the problem with recessions is that we don't officially know we are in a recession until after we are alrady in one. It tkaes at least 6 months of negative GDP growth for the NBER to decide if we are in a recession. That means given the current environment the earliest NBER would declare recession is the beginning of April of 2026. Just for all you Gen Z kids, an economy exiting an actual recession doesn't mean the job market will get better. The 2008 recession ended by end of 2009, the unemployment kept rising for another year and took 6 years for the job market to get to the pre-recession levels. Meaning if you graduated college in 2009, you didn't see a job market better than before the recession until 2016. I can't predict if the next recession will be as severe as 2008 (hopefully not), but buckle up kids.",

It forces you to think thoughtfully on your solutions.Nowadays it usually recommended to do something with cloud infra.

That is more than enough to host a discord bot, simple website, bot to do some scrapping or something. And these projects typically walk you down the path of setting up a box with database connections/setup etc... And then you can flesh it out more with a simple devops ci/cd flow etc.. You can make these architecture as simple or complex. You really do learn quite  lot from networking, design problems, coding challenges etc... And you are right. No one gives a shot about a calculator app. There is very little educational value besides experimenting with a language at a basic level.But really just start.

The stress and paranoia was through the roof over there.Things are very slow here at the bluechip, more dull too, but I value the stability above everything with this market",

        "body": "Corporate Tech Recruiter here. There are a couple of differences I want to call out in response to some of these comments and to address OP’s question First, there are different types of recruiters: agency and corporate. Agency recruiters work for a staffing company that services lots of clients. Corporate recruiters are internal staff at one company and onlywork on openings for that companyAn agency recruiter indeed does have high metrics they need to meet and will tend to send LOTS of invites/messages. They are usually working on multiple jobs and building pipelines for the various clients and skill sets they know their clients need. LinkedIn typically produces a less than 10% response rate for recruiter pings so you need to send a very high volume to get tractionCorporate recruiters do also send a decent number of invites/messages via LinkedIn but are typically more selective. We do have metrics as well but they are typically focused on actual candidates moving forward versus connects. Corporate recruiters also pipeline and fight the low response rate but because we are measured more on speed of filling a job, our approach is more targeted.So why are you getting tons of pings when you haven’t engaged with your LI profile? Likely bc of the skills you selected in your profile, your job titles, the companies you’ve worked for, etc. These pings are likely agency recruiters or sourcers ( those that literally feed recruiters profiles to reach out to).Personally as a corporate recruiter, I’m only reaching out to those that have a well built profile so I can validate if they could be a match. But it is true, we are using linkedin to source even though we are we are drowning resumes. For example, I have a SDE 2 role open that hit 2k apps in 3 days of posting with only 10% meeting the location requirements. From there only 5% meeting the bare minimum experience. Add to this the number of AI generated fake resumes, the folks that lie about being in the location or other qualifications and that pool of 2k apps is maybe 50-60 decent matches.I understand how tough this market is and how hard it is to be a job seeker ( I HATE the BS so many companies put candidates through) but it also makes it hard is as recruiters to find you through all the noise.",

        "body": "USA. We have 7000 applicants on two mid level roles. We’ll probably only need to talk to 30 people to hire for both roles. A good amount of people have AI slop for resumes, so we maybe open 150 of them to find what we need. Basically every single person seems just as- or less qualified than the next guy applying. Everyone is a dev who has built something “scalable and unique and distributed to make some impact on xyz” yata yata. 99% of people use the same line. If you got AI writing vague stuff for you, it only takes reading about half a sentence before we close it and open the next resume. We got 7000 apps, so anything even somewhat weird underwhelming or questionable is getting your app closed.Write something meaningful. We don’t want be left to have to wonder what you actually did at your role. Doesn’t help you that we can just hire Indian devs for $4/hr lol. They’re really bad, and I personally ALWAYS advocate for USA only… but my boss already had us pick up 10 Indians for the price of one (CHEAP) USA dev… which is a complete pain in the ass if I’m being honest. I hate it, but the VPs love it for “cost savings”.I manage 10 MORE mfs to only get 1.2x more tasks done from one US dev.. I have to make a ton of tiny tickets, the daily standup is one fucking hour long, and everything is constantly delayed… all in the name of “efficiency” and the idea that they should get better eventually. I fear our two current open roles will be the last US dev hires for a long time. Thank globalization for the fact that Defense and Finance are the only dev roles with US job security (anything needing security clearance).Even I worry being outsourced in the next 5 years once these dudes actually get decent at coding. Remote labor compensation is unfortunately a race to the bottom now. It ain’t like the old days. :face_exhaling:There’s easier money in construction work lol my advice? Become an electrician and start your own business. The CS Dev industry will be completely screwed for USA workers in like 5 yr. Already is screwed. If you’re not in it now with a few years of experience, tbh I’m not sure how you will get in. Wishing you luck",

It takes a lot more money piled up to retire than most people realise.A veteran cs worker, for example, earning say $300k a year would need to have more than $4M in earning assets ( so their main home does not count ) - minimum, to keep their income at the current level. - let alone they are giving up future income growth. We, of course, hear the stories of stocked up people who got good exits from companies. But it’s far from the majority - and not enough to make a dent in this area. And the final issue is that the reality is that a lot people still enjoy the work enough in return for that $300k a year… it give purpose and something to do. So even if they could take early retirement financially, a lot will choose not to. I once worked with a person who was a technical founder, who exited. I don’t know his exact net worth, but his payout was somewhere between $10-$20M He was working with us a senior dev, earning like $200k. I was having a beer with him on day and asked him why he was still working at the age of 40 and did not need to. His answer was pretty simple:- he had been a hobby coder before starting college and liked it. - he retired for a while, but drove his wife crazy. - this money he could spend on whatever he wanted, without concern. - it gave him a sense of purpose. He was motivated, despite not ‘needing the job’ worked just as hard as anyone else. In short he enjoyed working and helping others, but had decided that he did not want the stress of being responsible for managing or paying others.",

Well the acquisition closed, everything was fine, champagne was had, etc. I asked for my promised bump, the CEO stalled, and stalled hard. They brought in a consultant who tried to talk down to me and make me back down. This guy looked me in the face and said “I don’t know if you’re worth $150K, $40k or what.” After one or two weeks of back and forth like that, I gave up and just started searching. About 2 weeks after I stopped talking about it, I think the CEO figured out I was probably not happy, and gave me their promised pay bump. I gave my two weeks a few days after. I learned two things from that experience, first you have a choice in what you spend your energy on. It can be fighting for a raise, or it can be find a healthier and better position. It’s up to you. Second, if you have to justify your value to someone else, and your salary is a measure of your value, then either you value your self too highly, or they don’t value you enough, either way, this always leads to a toxic environment and you should probably just bow out. Now, I don’t even really bring up salary points. I just tell my manager if I feel valued, and this is what I do for the company, and they get the message and talk to their manager about getting a raise because they value me.

Those have nearly all disappeared - so don't get your hopes up in landing a job at the few that remain. Remote is now tied to the local market rate for talent, and even takes a haircut for the \"convenience\" of being remote.Before you do something irrational in an otherwise crappy job market, evaluate the \"total value\" of your setup which includes:1. Your total compensation (base, bonus, equity)2. Your company provided benefits.3. The convenience of being able to WFH (reduced transportation costs, time savings, reallocated travel time to fitness/health/wellbeing)4. The social benefits provided by your country (health care, pharmacare, etc)5. The purchasing power you have per euro/dollar spentIts very important that you actually measure the value of (#3-5) in order to compare the \"real compensation\" you earn. Most folks younger in their careers only measure #1, and #2 only comes nominally later when you have kids. As a result they are easier to manipulate when the industry is in a boom.You should index your total compensation against the percentiles for your country. 73K euro could put you in the top 5%, 10% (many european countries), 15% (e.g. Canada), or 30% (e.g. US) of earners depending on the country you reside in. This will help you ground your expectations a little more.Its not wrong to demand more compensation for increased scope of responsibility and outcomes delivered. However, you want to weigh your situation before engaging in a confrontation with your company/CEO. If you already have a better offer lined up, then the risk versus reward of engaging in the confrontation is tipped in your favor. If you're in a low percentile earner in your country/region (e.g. 80-100%), then you may not have much to lose and more to gain.There is a good time to engage in this kind of dialogue, and a bad time to do so. Good times are when there is lots of hiring, easy-to-find opportunities, and very few people available to replace you. At this very moment in 2025, it is a bad time to engage in wage negotiations without something like a Union backing you. Depending on the percentile compensation, there are many people willing to take up the task.",

That time is golden because you still have a job, so in the future if it happens again take the initiative to immediately interview. Never ever wait to start interviewing.In some companies you might be able to survive a PIP but from what I've seen it's like a lottery. I know someone wins the lottery but I've never actually seen anyone win it - and I've never seen anyone survive a PIP in the industry. The PIP is the company being nice and giving you a heads up that you're fired. Take the hint.Second, absolutely don't discuss the PIP in future interviews. I don't care what you say but don't say that. It would be better to say you got into a fist fight over text editors rather than you got let go because of a PIP. Personally if they ask I would say that unfortunately they shrunk the team size. Think like a politician.Your first gig is the hardest to get! You've got experience now get that next gig.

It's the solving process I'm paying attention to the most.The knowledge section doesn't really jump out as suspicious to me... that sounds about right. When I'm not in interviewing shape, I usually can't just rattle off SOLID despite using its concepts daily. But when I'm interviewing, you can bet your ass I can rattle off a textbook definition of SOLID, because I prepare.During the knowledge section do you have a script you need to stick to? Couldn't you dig into asking for some examples, or to explain why they think that's the right answer, or explain alternatives? Ideally you want ways to gauge understanding beyond reading off a textbook answer, because memorizing SOLID is trivial.

Will you be a 1099 contractor?If yes to the above questions then you'll have an opportunity to open a solo 401k. Why a solo 401k? Say you leave your main employer. You now have the option to rollover your 401k funds into the solo 401k. This is opposed to doing a rollover to an IRA.Why do this?With a solo 401k you get two advantages:* Controlling the fund menu within a 401k. Meaning you can have access to favorable funds.* Keeping your money outside of pretax IRA space. This is important if you are doing the backdoor Roth IRA strategy where a positive pretax IRA balance will influence pro rata taxation on traditional IRA to Roth IRA conversions.There is also a third advantage.A 401k has an annual limit for both employee and employer contributions. For 2025 employee contribution limit is $23.5k. Employer limit is $46.5k. So a total of $70k.The employee limit is the aggregate of all 401ks under your name within the calendar year. The employer limit is **per 401k acccount**. In other words if you have access to two 401ks and actively working for both employers then you can, at maximum, have access to $23.5k + 2 \\* $46.5k = $116.5k space. This scales up with every 401k you have access to.So with the solo 401k you can contribute 20% of your net self-employment income on the employer contribution side of things.You just need a valid reason to open a solo 401k. Once it is open it can remain open even if you no longer generate self employment income.",

Hard leetcode problems right out the door. Back-tracking, dynamic programming questions. Zero hints. Solution must be optimal by end and must understand full time AND space complexity and explain pitfalls. Getting a 'working' solution with explanation of how to improve is not good enough. You need to have implementing full optimal solution by problem end to have a pass.====Having gone to school in the US and Asia during my formative High School years and seeing my cousins who are the same age as me go through their education system all through college as well... the fundamental reason why companies from asian cultural backgrounds is so hard, is that in Asian culture, mathematics and science is extremely hammered down during basic primary education. There's a reason why Asian cultures around the world, rank the highest in mathematics and science and absolutely dominate every single other country in the world over these two subjects.Unfortunately, what this produces are candidates that are so fucking good at math and science. The academic, technical, algorithm part of programming, is a laughable endeavor for a large majority of them. So they have to crank the difficulty to weed and get the truly strong candidates from their job pools.This is the unfortunate harsh reality.Keep in mind this doesn't mean these people are actually good employees or good workers overall or good software engineers, but they are strong technical programmers.",

At my university there was no real campus life, more like a regular job where you go and then take the train back home (last time I was at UCI the huge area for parking freaked me out again lol, the universities around Boston were much more similar to what I've been used to).Then I first had to Google all those \"dean's list\" things etc. ;)But that's been even worse for Asian CVs. Everyone's a medal winner for something, a ton of different ranks and levels etc. European CVs are usually rather plain in that regard and more descriptive (longer CVs and photos have been around for much longer as well. When I started you also had to put age and confession and martial status etc. - awful). It's fun to see that often when the descriptions are very mathy and technical, probably C or C++ mentioned, it's often Eastern Europe while for example Germans have a very business- and process-oriented language (requirements analysis (\"Pflichtenheft\" ;)) and ISO standards and optimizing business processes blabla Siemens mainframe blabla).Hiring internationally is interesting but also exhausting.Besides the business lingua CVs the worst I found to be the Indian CVs listing everything under the sun (experts in Gmail, excel, YAML, XML, JSON, Jira, Slack... basically dumping their current browser tabs and pyproject.toml/requirements.txt in the CV).I'm definitely on the conversational side but I'd say half the people we rejected obviously didn't have a lot of depth in what they've been talking about (e g. tell you which model they used and once you talk about it it comes obvious they haven't even read the abstract of the respective paper). Other half is social aspects, obviously not caring about the topic they should be working on, being super hard to talk to or just plain cocky, forgetting about the interview, not letting others speak/speaking over interviewers all the time, suddenly sharing their screen to show their bitcoin price predictor after we tried to wrap up the interview 5 times because it's been 9PM for us etc.",

Chances are, you're part of the problem too. \\> I have been working in the same feature for at least 10 months now.This is not good, if I'm being honest. Even in the worst places I've worked I've seldom actually seen a single feature take that long to finish without reasonable blockers. If the issue is genuinely \"I don't know how to do this\" then you and management both have issues. No one typically just lets a feature story just creep for 10 months without bringing it up to either backlog it or give it to someone more capable. Not saying it never happens, it's just incredibly rare that it would go for so long without anyone checking. Especially if you work somewhere remotely credible or a start-up. \\> The last thing that happened that pushed me to the edge is that the manager asked a Senior to help me out with this feature and he just started asking a bunch of questions of the technical decisions I made and was ultimately confused and suggested we change a lot of stuff to make things right, basically saying that the last 9 months of work was poorly done by me.This speaks to me that people are tired with your work and that you are not prioritizing your learning and improvement at all. You're telling me that you didn't update anyone on your work for 9 straight months? You didn't communicate with a single person on your team to get feedback on a PR or something? This sounds really unbelievable and I really doubt this story as being true. Whatever though, assuming it is true; I understand people are going to tell you that it's management's job or your senior's job or someone else's job to teach you and make sure that you're doing well but it's really a two way street. You also need to communicate to them properly, especially as an engineer with four years of experience. You're far beyond the point of being some baby junior who doesn't know how to get the job done, or at least you should be. It's part of your job to make sure you're improving and actually getting better. If you're constantly bumbling into the same problems, constantly asking the same question, and constantly not able to get work finished, then you might have a motivation issue.",

As others have said, you're just starting mid to senior engineering roles, that's a lot more responsibility and requires a different mindset. Are there some things you could be doing better? Yeah, probably. But honestly, from what you've described, this seems like a systematic communication issue between the team. How large are the sprints? How large are the features that you're working on? Do they encourage you to talk to other teammates to get advice? Do they encourage you to find optimal solutions before implementing them? Or do they just want you to shit out a feature as quickly as possible before the Sprint ends? I went through something similar because I don't have a degree and every few months the imposter syndrome would hit me hard. But then I would reflect on my work, what I've contributed, what I've done poorly and what I've done well. Over time I realized that, while I have made mistakes, a lot of the issues I had were systemic and involved me to build the environment I wanted to work in. Just something to think about. Hang in there.EDIT: Also, I would like to add, no developer should be working on one feature for 10 months. Even in my worst moments on the job, a feature would take 2 months max before management or a senior could clearly see that I was struggling and would step in to help, or pivot me to something else. This is another sign that this might be management and not you. Again, I don't know you and I don't know your work ethic, so I can't say that you're perfect or anything, but anecdotally, and based off of what I've read, that's just what it seems like.",

        "body": "As someone who’s only been in the industry for ~2.5 years, when working on larger features or bug fixes I generally check in with our team lead every 2 weeks or so to run any decisions I’ve made by him & keep him up to date with the solution. He usually asks why I did things a certain way, and why I didn’t go down a different route. This either ends up with him agreeing it was a sensible decision, or suggesting looking into alternatives. When you reach out for feedback on a regular basis, acting upon it becomes far more manageable and feels much less like your work is getting crapped on.You can’t expect every line of code you’ve wrote and decision you’ve made over the span of 9 months to be the best option available. That’s an insane standard. Recognize that all developers are prone to making mistakes or suboptimal decisions, and take the initiative to reach out to your senior developers and get feedback more frequently.Personally I ask my architect to be brutal when critiquing my code so I can avoid repeating the same mistakes even when they’re small.When you go 9 months without reaching out for feedback you’re pretty much asking for every subpar decision you’ve made to be pointed out to you all at once. It can be hard to take that without it feeling like 9 months of effort is being crapped on.Ask for feedback more regularly, act upon it quickly, and take everything you learn from it with you moving forward. It also has the bonus of making the work feel more collaborative, and helps build a good reputation with your seniors in my experience.Edit: just to clarify, when I mention getting feedback, I will literally hop on a call with my architect and walk him through all the code changes since the last time he’s seen it, explain what it does, and give him a minute to glance over it. It usually ends up with him either saying “looks good” or asking more questions and then suggesting changes or accepting the reasoning. This approach allows the architect or senior to take some accountability for the code you’re writing which takes some of the pressure off.",

Sure, you may need to spend a bit longer practicing and going over things, but if I can do it - so can you.You need to find out what works for you with regards to learning. I found out (after buying lots of them) that books dont work for me.

I built so many projects I lost count. I also constantly applied for jobs and was rejected in that year - at one point being told software engineering wasn't for me but I should consider Business Analytics.A year later, I landed my first coding job (in 2017) and since then have worked up to over 6 figure salary in my area (Europe).

        "body": "TL;DR: I wrote a goddamn novel so here's the brief. A lot of fresh graduates go through what you're going through. You're not alone, you are capable, and if nobody else has said it, I fully believe in you. Build cool stuff you want to build while you're applying to jobs. Apply to those jobs anyways, because most skills are taught on the job in the first 6 months.I never finished my degree, however, I did take a lot of college courses on computer science. I have to be honest, college really does not teach you much in terms of preparing you for working on the job. If you think about it, it makes sense, a lot of jobs require you to understand tooling, specific frameworks, working within a team building, large-scale applications, etc. The issue is that frameworks change, if you spent a semester learning Spring, .NET, NEXT.JS, they could all have insane updates mid-semester that would require the professor to alter their coursework mid-semester. With that being said, this stuff is really hard to teach. The tech industry is constantly moving forward and evolving. Because of this, a lot of degrees in computer science focus on theory, data structures and algorithms, maybe programming language fundamentals and, if you pick a specific focus, AI for example, GIS, or game design or whatever, you learn that niche.That's why a lot of jobs don't require degrees and seldom hire Junior developers that have degrees. Especially in today's job market. People with degrees can prove that they made it through their coursework and they might have some capstone projects under their belt. But they can't code their way out of a wet paper bag, or they don't have a lot of real on-the-job experience. You shouldn't let that stop you though.You should know that you are good at what you do, you have the degree. You've proven that you can do the work even if you just coasted. Just work on a bunch of personal projects, building stuff that interests you. It doesn't have to be big or glamorous, just stuff you enjoy. You will quickly gain a skill set that you would want to enter the job market for. It could be full stack development, mobile development, game development, front end, back end, big data, whatever. Right now, just focus on building cool shit. A lot of programmers leaving college are in the exact same boat you are in. They have a degree, they're kind of good at coding, and they understand theory, now what? I'll just say this as a trade secret, 90% of engineers that have a job, learned what they know now on the job. Unless you're applying to mid to senior level roles or doing contract work, most jobs teach you everything during \"ramp up\" which usually takes about 6 months. You got this, man. Take it one day at a time and don't be discouraged if you get rejected constantly. The job market is tough right now but, I believe in you. Good luck.",

A lot of comp growth is base on stock price -> Meta is currently at $700+ which feels high. Is it going to go up more? You decide 3. Promotions aren't guaranteed. IC3->IC4 promotion should happen unless your manager fucks up (which can actually happen longer than you can be IC3) and you could just be hosed. IC4 -> IC5 is increasingly dependent on the politics around you, in ways that surprise me. 4. It's frankly a changing landscape.

This is a very valuable experience. Part of being experienced is having an intuition about what wouldn't work, or what would come back and bite you in future. Now you know what'd happen if you let the codebase deteriorate. It's very likely that other developers are not happy with the codebase either so I'd suggest getting other people onboard with a refactoring effort starting with creating a decent test suite to give you confidence to refactor. As much as I hate the hype, AI is amazing when comes to disecting/explaining the code and writing tests. And if you manage to do this, you'd have a HUGE success story.I'm yet to met someone who's happy with their codebase tbh.",

Everywhere you go you're going to find something that will challenge you, right now it's a messy code base with a lot of technical debt. Those exist everywhere. Understanding how to work in this environment is a skill that most people just don't develop, and then they complain they can't find a job.",

Something so blatant in the company's eyes that they'd refuse to hire you even if you were the smartest person on Earth.Having scheduling conflicts, doing an interview with bad enough internet that you can't finish it, aren't *good* things. But they're not so terrible that the company would refuse to ever work with you if you performed well in an interview.Chill out, wait 6 months, and re-apply.I have an anecdote from my last job search in 2024. I was in talks with a company that I didn't really care about, and they had a really bad reputation for WLB. I just appplied because why not. Well, they sent me an OA to do and I just.... didn't. I didn't respond to the recruiter, I didn't decline/submit the OA, I just... ghosted them. The recruiter kept reaching out to me, warning me of the deadline, offering an extended deadline, etc... and I just, didn't respond. Shitty of me? Sure, ghosting sucks in either direction. But it was what it was, I didn't have the energy to respond to them, I was in talks with other companies I actually cared about.Well, that exact same company reached out to me again to interview with them no less than 3 months later. And they've continued to reach out to me (not just one recruiter, but several) non-stop ever since then. Every few months I'll see a few emails from a few recruiters about open roles.I ghosted them. That's shittier than what you did. And I'm still not on their blacklist.You're fine.",

So does your team actually need to produce a replacement? You say you're doing code reviews but how is that possible without requirements and a development plan?2. you say the team is oversized yet still drowning? Unless they're all completely useless that doesn't make much sense.Those inconsistencies aside, it seems clear why the lead position was open. Either the previous lead was incompetent and built the wrong team for the task, or they were setup for failure and that happened. Or they left on their own after either creating or being put in a failing situation. The cause doesn't really matter here, the vacancy is just a strong hint that this team is dysfunctional. I would start by having a 1:1 with your immediate boss (senior lead? director?) and be totally upfront about the issues. DO NOT SUGAR COAT ANYTHING. Tell them that you don't believe this is the right team for this project and need to rebuild. Say \"The staffing on the team is not appropriate for the project.\" or something like that.If your boss doesn't agree, then you have another data point on where the incompetence is that caused this mess. Schedule a 1:1 with your skip and repeat.The key here is to be direct and back it all up with as much evidence as you can. I assume that you have had 1:1s with your new reports so you have some direct knowledge. Pull all their commits and review them. See if they're that bad or just complacent under the previous lead.Get your lead or your skip on board and then have HR start the separation process for all the dead weight engineers on your team. If you rebuild an effective and more efficient team and actually ship this project then you'll in a great position. If it goes south, then I don't think that just sitting around hoping for it to get better would have worked either.",

The rule of thumb for a good side project is if someone other than you uses it. You don’t need to make a cent out of it. Alternatively, do an online masters degree, OMSCS is $7k, yeah the whole program is like $7k. But take it as slowly as possible, just 1 course per semester.

It never hurts to know your market value and the available openings, up to you whether you want to do that daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly, whatever fits your goals.2. Never tell your boss or company that you're applying elsewhere. Any prospective employer will ask for permission before contacting your current employer, so really they should have no way of knowing unless you're publicly posting about it. Schedule interviews on WFH or PTO days, say you have an appointment, call in sick, etc.3. Again, no reason to try to hide your current employment. Just have an answer prepared for when they inevitably ask why you're leaving your current position. Never bad-mouth your current employer, that doesn't look good on you. Be honest or just say it was time for a change, you wanted a fresh challenge, exploring different fields, etc.4. Again for interviews just do whatever is necessary. It's 100% worth it to take a day off work or call in sick or make up some bs excuse. And if you've made it to the final stage, you know they're seriously interested in you and will accommodate for your schedule for interview dates/times.Do not tell your current job ANYTHING until you have a signed the new offer letter. They will start looking for your replacement as soon as they get a whiff of you wanting to leave.",

If you can’t solve them, make a nicely written doc detailing what you tried, didn’t try, etc so you can show your work even if it doesn’t fix the bug. In regard to finding a new job, I think this is one of those things where you just need to commit to your current job. Spending extra mental energy on interviews makes it more likely you do poorly at your current job. I promise if you try your best and still get pipped, the pip runway is long enough for you to prepare at that point. It’s like months of time. So for now, just try your best and document your findings. You can even spin it as how to help other new onboarders by detailing what was hard to learn in your team’s system, missing docs or metrics, etc. Good luck!",

        "body": "This was me when I started working as a SWE 5 years ago. I had been working at a sort of low grade data engineering job for a few years out of school, bc I had moved to a smaller town with my ex, but those didn’t amount to anything in my new job. I spent probably the first year there feeling like I didn’t know what I was doing. Because I truthfully didn’t.But they hired me knowing what I knew, they liked me personally and believed I would figure it out. After a year or so I felt comfortable with HOW to ask questions, which is a HUGE thing. And to do that, I had to work on things to understand why I was doing them. That’s very much how I learn, and I think many engineers find a level of enjoyment from the field, and that’s what a lot of teams look for. It’s worth it for a company to invest in someone who will learn to do things the right way.Related: The code base was a mess, as it turns out, and direction was directionless as this newly minted unicorn startup ramped up hiring. So a few months after I felt confident they fired half the engineers and the other half 6 months later. This was a week before moving to New York. I spent 3 months applying to jobs and interviewing and practicing questions from my new apartment for no joke, 12 hours a day. I went out after that and enjoyed my new home. I got hired at my current company 3 years ago and found they had the same approach to letting us learn and tinker with things. Now I should be on track for senior this year and I know I’m a good developer in my own eyes and get the sort of work that reflects it. Just get in and get your hands dirty and learn to enjoy it, they spent a lot to hire you and if you’re asking questions and showing your thoughts to them, they will do their best to get you there. But really think about the content of your questions. Identify exactly the last thing you did before you got stuck, recall the steps. Reboot your computer and try again, clear the local cache (check your policies for this first lol), present it like it’s a problem/hypothesis/method like a science doc and let them fill in the conclusions. It’s their job, and they will only be bothered heavily if you’re saying “idk what to do”",

I did this recently and the company I was actually working for was reputable, but I was paid well under market rate (the staffing agency is getting a higher rate and the difference is their profit) with no benefits. I did it for six months then an FTE role opened up that I applied for and accepted. In summary, not necessarily a scam, but these recruiters can be shady and unscrupulous.",

As 2008 was before mass adoption of AI job bots/linkedin/indeed/glassdoor etc... the volume of job search related noise was greatly reduced from the cacophony of 2025 You and your competition couldn't apply for thousands of jobs a week. As such you weren't constantly bombarded with rejection notices or notices your application was received. If you got a call or email about a job you had a good chance of remembering who it was and what they did. If you applied for a job there was a good change an actual human looked at your resume, and even read your cover letter as you were one of dozens who applied, not thousands.If you knew a recruiter you could reach out to them and maybe be one of 5 or 6 people who reached out about jobs. Now there are literally hundreds or even thousands of people hounding them about postings/potential postings etc...I am honestly terrified of losing my job, even if I am underemployed now.",

The context of the original intent is lost because there’s no planning or architecture.I raise a concern like hey… technically this is a wheel but I don’t think it meets our requirements. This is shut down because I’m worrying too much about what-if’s… design just asked for a wheel right?So we end up bolting the dirtbike tire to the steering column and sure you can steer the car I guess.Then I get assigned a ticket to add an airbag, something we all knew was on the feature roadmap. I know another dev would just duct tape an airbag on that wouldn’t work, but I feel obligated to refactor it into a proper steering wheel. This gets seen as scope creep, and I can’t for the life of me convince anyone it was necessary.So now I think I’m at the point I need to start using duct tape or look for a different car to build so to speak :man_shrugging:",

I don't need to actually plan rolling out those changes; only reflect on whats going well versus isnt. then maybe I look up how other people have solved those problems, and decide if they are in a better, worse or the same position as we are.thats how to build up architectural strength; spiral out from what you know well and work with often to technologies you dont know as well and reflect on how their application to your work might be good or bad.",

I went deep into clean/hexagonal architecture, event-driven architecture, DDD, CQRS, and the C4 model, and applied it all to my finance project.To get there, I had to learn to view the project from multiple high-level angles. I studied how frameworks like Symfony and Laravel worked, read obsessively, connected the dots, and eventually everything \"clicked\".In the end, once you reach the stage of designing projects from scratch, you realize it’s just an endless list of “next steps.” The key is having the right tools and knowing when to apply it.",

I barely understood what was happening with our components and applications I was working with every day, there was no way I could understand how to make a new one. Things that helped me were:* Seeing more codeI would read carefully through other teammates PRs and ask they why they wrote their code the way that they did. What would I have done differently? What can I \"steal\" for my future coding problems?* Understanding the codebase betterWhen I get stuck on a programming task, the first question I ask is \"why is it broken\". The second question used to be \"how do I make it work\". But now I look more at \"what does it do\", \"how does it do that\" and \"why does it do that\" before I ask \"how do I make it work\"*  Generally understanding technologies, services and concepts betterI had to learn what a nosql database was before I could understand why I would choose to use one. Understand what race conditions were before I could try to avoid them. Know what different kinds of caches there are before I could choose a good one. Know what cloud services do before I could choose which one to use in a system.  This last one can seem like a lot. And no one really wants to study after work. But I just found a YouTube playlist with systems design concepts and listened to it while commuting. It gave me a base level of knowledge that lets me ask clarifying questions when discussions happen.",

Examples are working toward a certification, or work on a project which can be publicly displayed.2. Don't neglect physical health. You still have to eat and go for walks and sunshine.3. Optimize your searching methodology and application process.I have some tips for job searching too, but don't want to make this post too long.If, for example, your job search takes over 2 months, and you allocate 1/3 of your time toward personal growth, that is about 300 hours toward personal growth, which is plenty of time for another new \"thing\" to tack on your resume.",

Focus on getting really good at articulating your projects and technical decisions, and prepare solid examples that demonstrate problem-solving skills. Each grueling interview process is actually making you stronger for the next one, even when you don't get the offer. I'm on the team that built [interview AI assistant](http://interviews.chat), and we created it specifically to help people navigate those tricky technical and behavioral questions that come up during the multiple rounds you're dealing with - it can be a game-changer for feeling more confident and prepared when you land those precious interviews.",

Your friend is absolutely correct:>it’s less about hardcore coding and more about understanding business requirements, troubleshooting, and communicationI go back and forth whether it's \"real programming\" or not. You're not technically building anything from the ground up, but instead are modifying or adding onto an existing application. However, that can be said for some legacy systems, too. The language isn't not hard to pick up at all and I feel like you can definitely tackle some interesting technical questions/problems. So, maybe you can think of it as programming at a very high (abstracted) level.As for your questions:1. **Does moving into Dynamics 365 with a .NET background really give me an edge?** I have always valued my .NET background because I understand what is going on \"under the hood.\" I've run into some interesting issues over the years and knowing how the framework works has really helped in getting to the root cause of the issue. I've also talked to a few managers at different companies and they have said it's nice to have someone with a non-Dynamics background.2. **What are the core skills I should focus on to actually get hired?** If you already have a good handle on understanding business requirements and communication, it would be beneficial to take a look at the development ecosystem so you see what you're getting into from a technical perspective. I can only speak for Business Central, but the MS documentation site has a ton of information, including some tutorials: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al)3. **Is the market really hungry for more Dynamics 365 people, or is that just hype?** I feel like there is an uptick in the market, but I don't have any data to support that. As a customer, it's easier than ever to get started and the product does offer a lot. If you're kind of over the grind of traditional \"programming\" and want a little more interaction with customers, then it sounds like it would be a good change for you. One really nice thing is that the language has been going through quite the overhaul the last decade and MS is really working to improve the developer experience. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than when I started. I will say the only issue I'm running into is I've just about hit the upper limit of the pay scale -- the last offer I received was for the same salary with just a bonus added on. Because of that, I'm looking to make the opposite move and go into a more traditional developer role. I hope that covers all of your questions! If not, feel free to ask more!",

Do you think that ceiling is common across Dynamics roles, or more specific to Business Central? I’m in a good financial position now, so I’m trying to think long-term before switching.If you were starting fresh today, which track would you recommend focusing on — CE/CRM, Business Central, or Finance & Operations? And is the uptick in demand you’re seeing more regional or global?From a career growth perspective, what kind of work do you think is needed to build a strong path in Dynamics and eventually move into leadership/architect positions? With my .NET and enterprise systems background, do you think I could make more of a lateral transition, or would I likely have to take a step down first to break into the space?Thanks again for the detailed response — this really helps me get a clearer picture of what to expect.",

Personally, I would do either BC or F&O, mainly because those are geared toward the more interesting side of business (not sales/marketing :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:). I think the uptick is in the US and Europe and is more specific to BC. I haven’t heard much outside of those regions. With 5+ years of .NET experience in enterprise systems, I would think you should be able to make a lateral transition. As for career growth into an architect/leadership role, I’d say the most important thing is knowing the product well (functionally) and how it can be modified (technically) to meet the needs of the user. That will get you far. Having some accounting knowledge also helps.",

Spend a day or two writing a simple page with header, nav, main, section and footer tags. Test it with browser dev tools and add ARIA if you want. Then mess with CSS box model and Flexbox - build a nav bar or a card, play with padding, margin, justify-content, align-items. Throw in a couple media queries to see it adapt on mobile. Finally write tiny JS scripts: practice let/const, arrow functions, map/filter and build a responsive profile card that can toggle extra info on click.Next week dive deeper in JavaScript. Drop code snippets in console to watch scope and closure - make a counter function that holds private state. Then write a basic Promise example, chain .then/.catch, and convert it to async/await with a small Fetch demo from a public API. Finish by building a mini DOM project - make a todo list or quiz app where you dynamically create elements and wire up click or input listeners.I mapped this into an 8-week plan for you if you want the full thing: https://doable.diy/plan/472xh88yv3AikgXNaFkGPr",

This project is at a level of 3rd year undergrad student, but definitely not at a 9 YOE level.If you're absolutely adamant about looking for a new job now, your best bet is not to bring up this project at all. Focus on your experience, and try to make that sound cool (9 years is hella impressive!). At that point, interviewers rarely care about personal projects. You'll have to learn about how best to present yourself, though.However, if you're not in a rush to find a new position, I'd recommend that you upskill. Try to think about as many interesting and complex features as possible that can be added to your project. The more complex it sounds, the more you'll learn from it. At the very least, learn some basic AI/LLM stuff and add it to your project. Also, your UI looks kinda bad. I get it that you're not a frontend person, but you can just use ChatGPT or whatever LLM of your choice to generate a beautiful UI for you. The first impression anyone gets about your website is from how it looks, so don't make them prejudiced against it by making it look bad.As for the freelance - no idea, honestly, don't have any experience with that. However, that would also really depend on your sales skills, so evaluate those first.Anyways, good luck to you and all the best!",

However, in North American tech companies, a person with 9 YOE is at either a very senior or staff level, if they are still an individual contributor (IC). These people usually don't write code. They design systems on a high level, make architectural decisions, lead large technological changes across many teams, make hiring decisions, mentor other devs. I've heard that some Eastern European outsource companies have an \"Architect\" title, which, I suppose, entails more or less the same responsibilities, maybe just on a smaller scope.Is this the kind of work you've done in your job? If so, great, you have the experience and only need to learn to present it. If not, what's the most difficult/advanced/niche thing you've done? Again, learn to talk about it. Learn to present it to different audiences. In interviews, you'll probably need to describe your experience to both technical and non-technical people. The technical folks will probably understand the complexity as is. For others, you might want to switch to business impact or simpler words (i.e. this project that I built generated $XYZ in revenue, improved performance/throughput/speed by 200%, you get the idea). I get it that people might not understand the details of what you've done but at this level, this doesn't matter. What does matter is that you have indeed done some deeply technical work and brought value to a business. I agree that non-knowledgeable people can easily dismiss your work, so don't give them a reason to do it, and instead, give them a reason to care in their own language (i.e. don't mention how much time you spent on something, focus on the results and impact of your work).>I imagine a situation where a company is choosing between two candidates: one has a simple app that works and can be tested, the other talks about complex systems needing a special setup or ecosystem.I don't see a situation where a company would evaluate a candidate with 9YOE based on one pet project. I don't think they will even want to look at it if it's not extremely impressive or has millions of users. Maybe I'm wrong and don't understand anything about your market, but almost no one-person project can demonstrate the depth and breadth of skills an experienced candidate should have.That's why the companies usually have countless rounds of interviews to evaluate all these different skills. Research the different types of interviews companies conduct in your country. These are usually some forms of behavioral and technical (including system design) interviews. Prepare for these. Learn what's missing.There's a totally different route you can take at this point and become a manager. Here your technical skills won't matter much but your experience (again, if framed correctly) can be very valuable. I know even less about this path though, so you should do your independent research if that's interesting to you.As for my suggestions to add AI and improve UI, those kind of missed the whole point - projects most likely won't get you hired, your interviewing skills will. They will be useful if you actually decide to try freelancing, though.",

I've worked with multiple data scientists in industry with degrees in physics.Most all hiring managers and any decent recruiter will not find anything amiss with the credentials and background.**To answer your questions directly**: (1) you don't need to express the value of your experience in a particularly special way, (2) most certifications won't help much but could help to convince people you're more ready to go in certain aspects (see below), and (3) most people aren't really looking for portfolios. Internship and job experience trump other factors.Anyway, through your resume and in interviews you will need to convince people that1. You have extensive practical and theoretical knowledge of very basic DS concepts like gradient descent, regularization, data cleaning, A/B testing, etc.2. You have some practical and theoretical knowledge of whatever technique or domain area their team specializes in. Maybe it's computer vision or recommendation systems or something else like that. This used to generally not be as much expected for entry level but with today's market the expectations are higher.3. You have foundational technical/business skills, depending on the kinds of work the team delivers. A team writing production code for algorithms will want somebody familiar with using git and coding in a team environment, for example.Most people will assume you have the capacity to meet all the criteria but will want to test if you're already at (or close to) a level where you can contribute without too much fuss.It definitely doesn't help at all that the expectations and responsibilities for data scientists vary widely across companies and teams.",

When you're in interviews, frame your research as what it really was: advanced data analysis and modeling work. Talk about the scale of data you worked with, the computational challenges you solved, and how you validated your models. That's pure data science experience, just in a different domain.Skip the certifications and focus your energy on translating your existing projects into a portfolio that speaks the business language. Take that neural network simulation and present it as a machine learning project - discuss the algorithms you implemented, the performance metrics you used, and the insights you generated. Create a GitHub repository with clean, well-documented code and write up your projects with clear explanations of your methodology and results. Your PhD work is far more impressive than any online certificate, but you need to present it in terms that hiring managers can immediately understand.

ICS security is blowing up, very high demand, and your automation exp makes you stand out big time. way better option than competing with 100k random web dev bootcampers.so imo don’t waste your edge. go embedded/industrial software if you like low-level + devices, or ICS security if you want money + growth. backend only if you really wanna shift into generic software. what’s your end goal btw, stay local or move abroad?",

Of course, since you already have a background in react, you may have an easier time switching back than I am having making that pivot. But I have read that this is a hard switch for others as well even if they did it prior.Platform/ops work is a lot of being on call and putting out urgent fires. And day-to-day, it's a lot of YAML and not a lot of true code work, and its definitely not as creatively fulfilling as regular development. Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform. You may just be working on tooling and framework stuff that isn't a stressful, but anytime you work on a horizontal as opposed to a vertical, you are liable to be pulled into issues in parts of the system you don't know about and expected to help troubleshoot them during high pressure situations.

        "body": "Google's first round technical interviews for software engineer roles are almost exclusively focused on data structures and algorithms - they rarely ask CS fundamentals trivia like OS concepts or networking details in these initial screenings. Your instinct to prioritize algorithms practice is spot on. Google has a very standardized interview process where they want to see your problem-solving approach, coding skills, and ability to optimize solutions rather than test your memorization of computer science theory. Save the CS fundamentals review for other companies that explicitly test those areas.That said, having solid fundamentals knowledge never hurts and can sometimes help you think through algorithmic problems more effectively, but it shouldn't be your focus right now. Google interviewers are trained to evaluate candidates on coding ability, communication, and technical reasoning within the context of algorithmic challenges. Spend your remaining prep time getting comfortable with medium-difficulty problems, practicing coding on a whiteboard or shared document, and being able to clearly explain your thought process. If you find yourself struggling with unexpected questions during the actual interview, [interview assistant AI](http://interviews.chat) can help you navigate those tricky moments - I'm on the team that built it as a tool to help candidates handle challenging interview situations in real-time.",

You might get clarifying questions where they touch on system design or performance, but they don’t usually quiz you on OS internals or network trivia for early career roles.If your interview is coming up soon, I’d double down on data structures, algorithms, and practicing explaining your thought process out loud. Trivia can wait until later since other companies are more likely to throw those curveballs.When I was prepping I also did mock interviews on Pramp. Then during the interviews I used a tool called StealthCoder. It overlays tailored hints, solutions and even high level designs in real time so I could explain solutions clearly. That made it easier to stay calm and sound structured when the pressure was on. I'd check it out because I owe it to that tool that I landed my current software engineering role.So I’d say focus on algorithms for now, make sure you can communicate your approach step by step, and keep the fundamentals on the back burner until you have more time.",
