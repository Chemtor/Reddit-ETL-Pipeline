Those at the senior level, like many of us here, will not have any issue finding work - networking alone being a game changer. Then there is the issue of soft skills versus technical skills. The longer you have been in the workforce, the more likely you are to have honed the soft skills needed for interviews. There are many relatively new DE's that are technically proficient but, due to a host of reasons (don't get me started), do not have the skills to interview well. I've also decided to ignore my impulse to see everything as LLM-generated. I've personally written a few work proposals where I've been accused of such (no silly graphics or bullet points btw), and those that use LLMs are the first to assume everything written now is the same. I also have family where English isn't their primary language, so it can often be used for translation, and the user is left with terrible formatting.",

I left them, with a single query for their dashboard. And yet they struggle to do this and need my assistance. Fine, happy to help, but like, comparatively this is a joke. I think I wouldn’t mind this so much if I knew that I was paid significantly more than them, but it’s the opposite. I found out a while back that the analyst working on this project makes just about the same that I do. So my question is, do you ever feel under-appreciated and how do you deal with that?

        "body": "Well, its important to remember that the Kimball and Inmon standards were developed in the 80s. I think there’s three key trends that have happened in ensuing decades that explain the mess we’re in today:First and most obviously, computing has gotten exponentially more powerful. A big part of the reason people cared so much was because they literally had to. Nowadays, no one gives a crap, and if you’re a conspiracy theorist, you could even argue that medallion architecture is being perpetuated by cloud providers as a way to extract more money from their clients. **Quick edit based on some responses:** I’m definitely not saying there aren’t any positive aspects to medallion architecture and ELT supplanting ETL. But whether it’s *necessary* is a different question and one that, IMO, businesses should really think long and hard about rather than just defaulting to whatever the FAANG companies are doing or whatever the vendor’s recommendation is. Maybe I’m just old, but I can recall a time when the bronze layer lived in an FTP site (lol) and the Gold layer didn’t exist, and yet companies were still able to answer business questions and turn a profit. Second, and somewhat related, technology just moves so fast that you’re migrating platforms every couple years, in some cases. There’s a sense that tech debt is unavoidable, and the Agile/MVP approach exacerbates this as well. So no one really cares as much about getting things right the first time, because you know you’ll have to rebuild it anyway. Third, while the concept of “data” has been democratized and de-mystified quite a bit in the ensuing four decades, the actual database part of it still has somewhat of a barrier to entry. So I think part of the issue is that “Can I get this in Excel to do my own analysis?” has become such a ubiquitous question that you can’t really say no to it, leading to a bunch of bespoke OBTs that aren’t documented particularly well, if at all. IMO modeling is still important, but it’s largely because of BI/Data Viz software adoption and not database constraints themselves anymore.",

Im being serious this is a \"pub\" kinda question that sadly I dont have collegues that share the same spark to discuss with.This industry has evolved so fast that terms have been highly convoluted and become some what meaningless. When I began my career Kimball was king and the data mart with at least star schemas were the expected minimum. Largely because of the limits of what we had (relational databases with indexes). To get things to work you had to thoroughly understand the requirements, plan and model accordingly.Compute and Storage are cheaper than beer (sadly), with that has come with the more lazy approach in favour of quick (although unstable) returns. We follow agile, we don't like long winded projects and if your query doesn't work then just add more compute.With this a generation has been bombarded with buzzword bingo. We have data lakes, lake houses, and other infrastructure terms. We also have data mesh, fabric and other strategic ideas that i always feel are more idealised than realistic. A person can only retain so much and indeed the core ideas of warehousing have disappeared. I asked someone if they would consider implementing surrogate keys, he asked me if I had made that up.It does feel like we are re learning alot of the problems that we had in the 80s just in different guises. I feel that maybe were just old enough to notice the turn of the wheel. What was learned will be forgotten and re learned again.Modelling will always be important, but modelling relies of having some key information.... like what do you actually want to achieve? What are you measuring.... I think most of this sub will admit.... actual requirements are always few and far between. Keeps us busy rebuilding stuff though lol.Id love to see what the modern equivalent of erwin is?Anyway... your not alone...Do you know what would be cool.... a podcast going through the datewarehouse tool kit and data modelling!",

They don't want to talk about it because they don't have a solution to make it more productive. So, instead of admitting that it's a hard problem and they mostly work on the easy problems, they instead just try not to talk about it.They *should* talk about it - since it impacts performance, data quality, query functionality, usability, and operational and development complexity. And practitioners should also talk about it for the same reason. But this field has always been marketing-driven, and data modeling is difficult. So, they don't talk about it like we did 25 years ago.But that doesn't mean nobody is. It definitely still matters when operating at scale, whether that's data volumes, performance and query response time or its the number of fields, feeds, and models.",

        "body": "As a DW professional with two decades in the domain, I’ve lived through the transition data modeling and data architecture have gone through during those times. When I started my professional career in data, a 2-year Datawarehouse build-out project was the norm. We used to do rigorous requirements gathering (for months!), hire a multitude of skilled people to document the business processes, track down data sources and cover every inch of the enterprise reporting needs on paper. Then the laborious phase of ETL, physical data modeling, test runs, and QA will ensue. Finally some BI team would develop the static reports and before you know it, it’s already 2 years gone!Nowadays, every single business comes pre-wired to collect and move streams of raw data all over the place. Costs of data storage have significantly dropped so dumping it all in into a cheap cloud storage is a no-brainer and it’s an acceptable approach. Storage and compute are now segregated so no upfront unutilized servers anymore. I guess the fundamental idea behind serving data analytics has switched from building robust, audited and reliable DW architectures to just-in-time data modeling for a quick turnaround to answer a certain business question ASAP. It also allows for incremental question-answering with the same just-in-time analytics approach instead of asking business stakeholders exactly what questions they’d need answered for next 10 years and expecting them to have an answer for you. I’d say it’s just a paradigm shift that has acceptable flaws with upside advantages that outweigh the said flaws (i.e. lack of emphasis on the traditional DW approaches we built our careers around in the past).Edit: also wanted to mention how the term “datawarehouse” has now been usurped by the vendors to mean “snowflake, redshift or GCP”. Not the Kimball or Innmon style datawarehouses we used to build. In fact, Bill Innmon (he’s in my LinkedIn network) wrote a very expressive LI post about this a year ago. Now I see even him kind of coming to terms with the fact that the old school DW as a industry and a domain is dead.",

With the advent of 'off the shelf' solutions like JDE, Peoplesoft, SAP...etc the need to design your own models fell off a cliff. While a BI/DW model is designed differently, it was generally the people with existing OLTP model knowledge that went down this path as well.\\- As others have stated in this thread, 3NF or better modelling was a means to help squeeze the best performance out of hardware solutions. This is not as much a concern now. \\- The 'need for speed' (AGILE) has caused our industry to get lazy and not worry about design. 'Just get er done'....minimum viable product thinking which created tech debt that doesn't get addressed. Some of this was management issues and some of it overhyped promises of certain methodologies like agile/scrum.",

The follow-up questions are especially important because that's where the complexity will come out.You'll need to back this up with good theory which can come from a few placesFor textbooks I really like T-SQL fundementals by Itzik Ben-Gan. It's focused on SQL Server, but it covers a lot of generic SQL, and it has a really good explanation of the core concepts. Things like three-value predicate logic make a lot more sense with his explanations. I generally recommend people at least read the first chapter. I think you can find a free PDF somewhere but I just bought it on amazon (almost exactly 10 years ago!)Websites like Leetcode CAN be good because of the ability to compare your answers to others, but it's important not to blindly trust that someone else's approach is better. If you see faster solutions, look up the techniques they are using and try to understand if it's actually an improvement or just or just a hack for that specific dataset.For performance, Designing Data Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann provides a lot of the theoretical foundation you'll need to understand how to think about queries, you'll need to supplement this with resources specific to the database you are working in. For snowflake I found some articles on [https://articles.analytics.today/](https://articles.analytics.today/) helpful. But you'll need to find sources relevant to you.",

Data engineers are really really well paid. On the stress spectrum, it’s also on the lower end. It’s also one where a lot of self-teaching is still a valid pathway forward.There are other IT roles where the entire company is down and you’re stuck working days straight to fix it. Or security professionals, when the company is under attack 24 hours a day and everyone is looking at them to fix it and then blaming them for what happened.In your case, I would say much of the stress is coming from layoffs, and a management that does not really understand AI and what it’s used for. Bad leadership looks at AI as a way to reduce headcount. Good leadership looks at it as a productivity tool. It should be helping to get more work done and a more streamlined, quality product.Also, AI should not be replacing the templating and standards. That’s up to the lead to come up with and enforce.I do think AI is giving a lot of people some existential crisis issues. However, I think using it is going to be required for almost all roles. Personally, I treat just like any other tool, like a spreadsheet, or a calculator, or a web search. Not using it means I am gimping myself, so why would I fight it and try and use the old way? The AI can’t think for itself. That’s where humans come in and will never be replaced. Someone still still needs to understand everything at the higher level, figure out what needs to be done, and glue it all together.If it was me, I’d take a step back and take some breaths. Or take a few days off and don’t think about work. Seems like burnout and a perspective check is needed here.Finally, you mentioned you want to quit, but have you asked yourself, what are you going to replace the job with?",

The same thing happened with the blockchain craze, and the people who understood the tech were right to point out that all you need was immutable dbs to solve most of the use cases that were used to hype the trending tech. I feel the same as you do, but companies will need to learn the hard way, because the world of VCs have convinced companies large and small that the only way to be worth more or to enhance productivity is to jump to the next novel tech that is going viral - This works great for start ups attempting to pump up their valuations, but not so great for companies that are larger with processes and governance in place. This sort of behavior continues to degrade products, and Google is a great example of product degradation. Even Klarna restarted it's hiring because their jump in to AI that is still premature hurt their business operations. You're just early in the game to realize this, but the fact is the hype will keep at it until AI matures and is productionized properly, or the next trending tech starts attracting investor capital. It's all a game, but that does not mean that the pleasure you gained from building data pipelines no longer gives you satisfaction. You just need to find other corps that are mindful of assessing premature tech before jumping head first into the latest and greatest - there is a reason companies like Apple and Costco maintained their lead this long.",

It simplifies a lot of the tediousness of using DBT with Airflow (v2.9). It is easy to generate your DBT assets and those can be linked with your other dagster assets.The main difference is the paradigm. Dagster does not have jobs/tasks at the forefront. Jobs are a process to group functional assets together i.e. you have 1 ingestion process and 3 DBT models to generate your analytics table and you can ran all of them at once, on schedule. Dagster uses data assets at the forefront, which are what the name suggests, your data as an asset. You do not think of the process of creating the data as you think of the final data product. I ike the lineage feature, which allows you to see how all your assets are interconnected. You can define a job with a schedule for any cut of your lineage graph.Dagster is also more pythonic than Airflow. You use python's best practices when writing your processes.Testing is much simpler with the integrated 'dagster dev' command which quickly spins up a local instance for you to test your pipelines. Can write a lot more about the difference but I am at work now :-D.To conclude, both are good tools (haven't tried Airflow v3+) but for different needs. Dagster is better for companies where data lineage is vital, whereas Airflow is better for automation of tasks. Data pipelines are good in both (however, in dagster it gets tedious to integrate a random pipeline with the rest of your asset lineage)",

Like nodes should add context that those approaches don't have, but if you are only defining the DB schema with them then are you missing an opportunity to pull more accuracy out of it? I am not a big graphdb person so I don't know, but have built semantic models the other way and had mixed results with AI.In the end though the challenge for me was more about semantics and synonyms than anything else. In a business people say the same thing 10 different ways and it's often hard for the LLM to interpret what they mean, especially in the context of your business. I found we needed synonyms not only for tables and columns but for values as well and sometimes the context that was relevant to the answer was who asked the question. I could make it work if you ask it things in exactly the right way, but that's not the point of a conversational tool like an LLM.",

For them, there is tremendous risk in depending on you. If you leave, fall sick, get bored with your job, they are up the creek. The more you resist bringing in a vendor, the higher their risk and the harder they will try to eventually backfill or replace you. There is also the question of output. They are bottlenecked by your pace of delivery and for whatever reason, they do not want to hire another person to support you.When I was an employee, I would have sided with you.

I don't think winning the competition alone is going to help you without a strong portfolio of other projects, but it would make for good essay/statement of interest material to describe why you're looking for a career pivot.In my experience, unless they've already made the job description with an existing candidate in mind, colleges and universities are good places to start. They aren't super fixated on production-level experience, usually have some super passionate people, and chill workloads. You could start by looking for jobs at local colleges or something like HigherEd Jobs. Best of luck!",

It's just that the word junior isn't in your job title.In both, junior specific roles, as in, have junior in the title, are rare.I'm of the opinion the secret sauce is to teach yourself a little bit and go for mid level roles. There's a lot less competition because the vast majority of people are looking to be taught by more experienced people rather than teaching yourself on the job. The amount of resources and information available on the internet for doing most things IT related is staggering to the point it's more learning about what to search for.",

There aren't really junior DE roles. The typical path, and what you've identified, would be to work as an analyst or scientist to get exposure to these tools and technologies and then make the move afterwards.One emerging role that presents an excellent path to data engineering is analytics engineering. This role is a blend between data analyst and data engineer, doing a lot of data transformation and sometimes moving data with no code tools (fivetran, stitch etc).",

One task that extracts, one that loads and one that transforms. Of course this is highly dependent and it helps to be pragmatic. In some instances you'll need to break these patterns. For example when we need seperate retries, resources or parallelism.For example:- Task one: triggers a lambda to extracts data from an API & stores in S3- Task two: lambda that fetches the file from S3 & loads it into a Snowflake table.- Task Three: Python operator within Airflow that triggers dbt run (could also have this in a lambda).Then on the topic of passing data between tasks. Using the above example, passing the s3 uri from task one to task two would be a great use of xcom. Here, we're mainly passing metadata (row counts, S3 keys, schema versions, URLs, run decisions).We'll typically want to use object storage for larger payloads (CSVs, json, etc).",

All it takes is a single command to add a column to a table, it’s really not hard, especially with the small volumes you are working with. And there are tools like Alembic which someone’s already mentioned to help you version, test and deploy these sorts of changes easily and reliably.So “my Data is going to change and evolve” is really not a good reason to use a document store like mongo.The use case for a document store is really when your data is literally arbitrary. By this I mean that it will be completely different from one document to the next. And there’s no particular reason to expect any record to overlap with any other.Even if there is a subset of your data which really does fit this description, you can still allow for it in Postgres with the use of the jsonb column type which others have mentioned.But from what you’ve described, your data probably is very similar and predictable from one record to the next. All the personnel are presumably going to have names and IDs and other common properties. In this context, you are giving up a lot by using a document store, such as the ability to reliably query the data, to enforce rules that maintain quality and integrity, and to optimise for certain use cases. These things will likely cause you pain down the track that is much worse than what you think you’re avoiding by not having to worry about schema evolution.",

The org culture and turmoil is causing you to second-guess. There are many options here, but I think if you leave this organization for a better DE team, you'll find career satisfaction. I would recommend going back to the Actuarial path if you believe that career path is more enjoyable long term and/or you want to do an internal switch (just make sure that team isn't burnt out either).",

Not JSONL, JSON. I used Claude to write a bunch of Rust to do streaming JSON parsing, then stream it out to parquet so I can process in bigquery. I would not have been able to write that code in Rust myself. I'm a very experienced software engineer, but I had written maybe 10 lines of Rust in my life. But with Claude's help its really very nice.The key to getting good quality code out of Claude is not that different from getting good code out of people:- unit tests- automated linting- manually specify function type signatures where it matters- have Claude run the tests and the linter after every change, and then have it fix all the problems it finds.- actually read the resulting code, make sure it makes sense, and make Claude refactor where it gets messy.In the end it worked great, and the code was very readable. This was very exciting because using a conventional JSON parser in the conventional way was just not going to work at all.But it was a little slow. I told Claude to optimize for performance. It came up with about 10 recommendations. I told it to implement the top 6 that I thought would make a big difference. It implemented those optimizations, made all the tests pass, and the resulting program was an order of magnitude faster.It could easily have taken me a month to do all this by hand.",

I've seen people called a Sr DE with 2 years of experience as a DE, Ive seen someone called a Lead DE because they moved from a Lead DBA role to their first DE role. I know a person in consulting who is just a DE and has been a DE or SWE for 15 years. He is far better at coding that I am, and makes more money, but doesn't have the same level of title as others with far less skills. Myself, I spent my first year writing code, building pipelines, fixing bugs and closing tickets. Then everything changed and I am now running teams of implementation partners to build out enterprise projects. Nowadays, the only coding I do is to review PRs. I draw up architecture, work cross functionally with other teams to solution things, and tell my teams what all needs to be done with some guidance on how to do it. Someone else at a different company would need to work 10 years before being trusted to do what I do now. My job title will change to Sr DE next year per my manager. And I'll have 2 years of DE experience at that point, and a year of that is barely technical. For a standard 3rd year DE, if one even exists, I would start to expect a little more autonomy. Learn to make decisions. Start figuring out and proposing architecture. Start mentoring younger DEs and try to lead some small projects if you aren't already. By this point, you shouldn't need to be told what to do on a project, you should be able to identify what needs to be done, and work to implement it. A big thing is that you should probably at least start working with other teams on cross functional projects. Begin thinking about business value of various projects. I learned, albeit slowly, that maintaining collaborative relationships with other teams is vastly more valuable than transactional relationships. They are more complicated to manage, but it is the only approach I've seen work to actually get things done. Churning out tickets and bug fixes is a good way to inflate your performance numbers, but it rarely amounts to career growth or any of the stuff you work on actually being used by the business as a whole.",

Many folks on this sub will tell you that DE isn't an entry-level position, so you must have done something right to get your foot in the door.Regarding your question, it's smart to focus on the fundamentals. It’s easy to get lost in the sea of specific \"data engineering\" tools, but they all build on a few core IT concepts. My advice would be to focus on these areas for the next six months.1. The first thing I'd focus on is the programming basics. Since you're using Python, I would go deep on that. Don't just learn syntax, but really try to grasp the fundamentals so you can solve problems with it. Do a few mini-projects in pure Python to make the concepts stick. This will be your foundation for everything else.2. Next, you need to become very comfortable with SQL. It’s the language of data, and you'll be using it constantly. Understand what it is, get the basic syntax down, and then really practice with it. Microsoft has some great sample datasets like AdventureWorks that are perfect for learning things like joins and aggregations.3. While you're learning those, the third crucial piece is Git. It doesn't matter if your company uses GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket; the principles are the same. You absolutely need to understand the basic workflow of making a branch, committing your changes, and merging them. It's how all modern tech teams collaborate. As a bonus, look into what a simple CI/CD pipeline does, maybe with something like GitHub Actions.4. Finally, try to get a basic understanding of one cloud provider. It doesn’t matter which one—AWS, Azure, or GCP. I'd probably stick with AWS since it’s the most common right now. You don't need to be an expert, but learn the core concepts. Studying for one of the associate-level certifications is a great way to get a structured overview.If you can get a good handle on these things by your sixth month, you'll have the solid IT foundation you need for this role. Only then would I start worrying about the more advanced, specific DE concepts. Everything will make much more sense once you have these basics down.",

Separately, you can research whatever systems your team is using and break down by categories:1. SQL: Learn how to write SQL queries (use documentation for whatever language you're using and look up videos for that specific langauge).2. Database structures: Whether you're using on premise servers or cloud services, look up documentation for those platforms and look at some videos to get an overview of how they store and process data.3. Pipelines and job scheduling: Learn about which service(s) are used to create data pipelines and schedule jobs and how they work.4. Version control: Learn about the codebase you're working in, what coding standards they have (rules for writing sql queries, DDL, DML, dags, etc....) and how to use github and your IDE (probably VScode).I would start by learning what's most relevant to your day to day work and then learn more about each area as you go. You will also need to understand what the modeling and data in your pipelines represent. Being able to explain data to the business is equally important to technical knowledge of how to store and manage data.",

A few of them got a liking for that kind of work and eventually transitioned into data eng teams to get a deeper understanding and taste of it.

Not everything fits neatly into them. Example, you need to move data from on-prem to cloud, data needs encryption at rest and in transit, how is DBT and Airflow helping? You can maybe orchestrate some in Airflow but actually nope, on-prem is behind firewall with local connectivity and limited egress only, no inbound connection for security and it cannot be exposed to a cloud based Airflow instance due to security team demands. How do you get the data where it's needed? You get into data engineering by starting with analytics roles and learning how the data lifecycle works and gaining experience, you develop your knowledge of the ways things work and progress from there.

It supports both comma/semicolon/tab/etc separated files and files with fixed width columns.The plugin can automatically detect the columns and datatypes, and after that you can do several thing with the data. Like sort, select/rearrange columns, count unique values, validate the data etc. The data validation can check for technical errors, like text value too long, incorrect datetime/decimal formats, date out of range, missing quotes, incorrect coded values etc.",

        "body": "It's interesting feedback Whooster. There was an implementation Arrow2 which I found more ergonomic than Arrow-RS initially, which is now forked into Polars-Arrow and backs the Polars project in Rust. However, that merged work into Arrow-RS, and I hear the team invested time learning from the earlier mistakes.In both cases, without going too far down the rabbit hole - both implementations use a Rust concept dynamic dispatch, which makes typing in the IDE disappear, and Rust type downcasting to be required, which personally, I find awkward to use. This also blocks some automatic compiler optimisations that can automatically inline more aggressively for a faster build. The result is once you get up to a top level library like Polars, there are many layers of objects between the object you are working with and the actual data backing it. Once you are in Python, I found this really doesn't matter - it's like water into wine.However, in **Arrow-RS** (for numerical data) Rust looks like:1. **Raw allocation** (heap bytes)2. `Arc` (ref-counted ownership of allocation)3. `Buffer` (view over the bytes)4. `ArrayData` (ties buffers, length, datatype, nulls)5. `PrimitiveArray` (typed wrapper, implements `Array`)6. `ArrayRef = Arc` (trait object used in generic contexts)So, you constantly need to downcast from ArrayRef just to get typed data, even though you built all the layers.In **Minarrow**, you also have layers, but they are, in my opinion, more straightforward:1. **Vec64 / Buffer** \\- Plays like a normal Rust vector. You can use it like one2. **Typed Buffers**: IntegerArray, FloatArray, etc.3. **NumericArray:** Enum, with accessors, e.g., 'myarr.i64()'4. **Array**: Enum, with accessors e.g., 'myarr.num().i64()'The result is they are composable - you opt-up to the level of abstraction you want and need, rather than being locked behind an opaque object. In Rust, this is particularly helpful, as when building libraries and functions, it means their signatures can be compatible with more use cases, but I'm digressing here.The point is that it was enough that I went and rebuilt my own implementation, as I need it for other projects and didn't like wrestling with the system as the underlying data foundation. Regardless, Arrow is brilliant and it's incredible what the team has achieved.",

I’d suggest asking them for some suggestions as to where to start, eg which tools should you ramp up on right away. Then make a prioritized list and work through some high level, hands-on examples with each tech. Once you’ve done that, you’ll hopefully start to have an intuition as to how to weave them together, which is probably the goal of the job.

In fact I'd suggest that any tool will make the easy 80% easier and the hard 20% harder.Schema evolution only makes sense if you can tolerate data quality errors. Here's a benign example: say that a file you're picking up with a bunch of cost columns suddenly has a new column. Lets call it fab_cost. It's a new column, so can you ignore it? Well, what if this is a new cost element that's being carved out of an existing cost element? If you ignore this fab_cost you're ignoring some of your cost - and your totals will no longer be accurate.So, *guessing* about schema evolution is just sloppy work for most production systems. The right answer most of the time is to define a data contract between systems - and validate it.",

If a column was renamed the data is needed but needs to be mapped to original column name, but at the time of ingestion we cannot determine a column was renamed. There could have been a column added and another one deleted etc. if a new field was added and everything else is the same we can detect it and ignore it in this case, if a column was deleted and everything else is the same we can also detect it, but may has impact if the data was needed for a report. the report is now working with either stale data (in the Gold layer) or could even break the report (depends on business logic).

Depending on the setup this can be done using OPC-UA for most SCADA systems. I've seen in Pharma before that most manufacturing has a gateway so you can pull off the gateway instead which aggregates several PLCs/machines to pull from a common point. Most of that data is pushed to a pub/sub like Kafka or some other MQ. The schema for each step in most manufacturing processes is based on how the cards are programmed on the PLC. Since message queuing systems can handle schema evolution, you can usually combine this with a schema registry so you can see the steps and versions. Now getting it into a structure built for OLAP is not the easiest. There might be controls engineers that already have a common data model for reporting on just the OT. This is needed to understand signals, etc. They might also have a digital twin which represents a virtual system so you can begin modeling yourself. There are decent articles discussing OT/IT convergence but there is no silver bullet ( https://iot-analytics.com/it-ot-convergence-27-themes-define-future-of-industrial-integration/). If the schema isn't defined anywhere, there are tools like Apache Flink that can use schema inference, however you are still going to need to figure out the model so you know what step stage relates to what schema and how keys (columns) are related to each other. It takes some work but again there is an automation and controls engineer that has to have that somewhere.",

        "body": "Thanks for the excellent link.Patient_Magazine has a solid answer. It’s not just in pharma. OT is typically an underinvested and unappreciated area in technology and staffing. It’s like the opposite of sales lol.The software is often just a means to get the manufacturing equipment to work. The engineers in OT are more operational focused and have a different set of responsibilities. They are also very busy most of the time and want to get things working and keep them working. There is typically no laboratory setup where they can isolate data and services out for stuff like analytics.Also, manufacturing is usually a low margin business, so there’s not a lot of spare change there for new initiatives which take time to show value.Good news is, overall I have been seeing lots of push over the past 5 years for more integration of OT with IT, as the link you provided shows. I think this started in security as OT has been a vulnerable gateway into IT, since it’s not been hardened from a security standpoint. Example, there’s a ton of pressure to not touch anything for simple stuff like firewall or patches when the greater risk is perceived as bringing a production line down.Hopefully some of the success stories start getting more visibility over time and we can learn from examples of where value is created from integrating OT data where everyone can access it and use it to improve the company overall.One tip is see if there are any relationships built in your group with the OT group. Usually I’ve found this less of a technology issue but more of a perception and priorities issue.",

Kstreams btw was based on samza, if your interested in the academics. The one thing that does distinguish it, is that it doesn't require a cluster, i.e. it's completely self contained. Which is cool, but it's not with out it's pay offs.Self hosting the clustered stream processors is complex, but there is a lot of very good managed version out there, which drastically reduce the complexity. If you just want to test locally and get some exposure, flink has a in process cluster that autostart etc is very straightforward. Pretty much just f5 from your IDE.Edit: I use the java version of flink, but their python looks good based on the docs. However, I went down the same rabbit hole as you some time ago, and the reality is alot of these tools are java native, so python is a second class citizen.",

We also took part in **MWC Barcelona in both 2023 and 2024,** and while it is a massive event, it offered solid technical content around AI, IoT and digital transformation with live demos and case studies.For developer-focused tracks, **Berlin Buzzwords** is a good choice if you’re into data engineering and search technologies, and the **Data Innovation Summit in Stockholm** usually brings very practical case studies. Since you mentioned **apidays in London**, that one is definitely worth checking out too because it covers APIs and AI with a good balance of technical content and ecosystem discussions.",

Quicksight-level controls are useful at the end of the pipeline, but I’m trying to catch privacy risks earlier in-flight, while still supporting rehydration for authorized consumers.Have you seen any approaches like this upstream of the BI layer?",

( and I don’t think the company has this kind of money considering the 20k user base)If 20k users is your entire base, you can power it off of RDS itself. If you start noticing slower query runtimes you can add in a read replica and materialized views. This can get you quite far than you can imagine. If this still does not cut it, you can use duckdb to accelerate your queries (duckdb can connect to OLTP databases)",

Data Engineers aren't using SQLite in much (possibly a simple PoC or a metadata store but as the person you replied somewhat rudely to has said, DuckDB is usually a better option and most people in the field who do even a marginal amount of continuous professional development would prefer DuckDB over SQLite). Sys architecture might use it for demonstration/PoC but more likely will make a data architecture diagram and have DBAs build in a sandboxed RDBMS engine of choice to allow concurrent users of the PoC.",

For some like Salesforce it's easy as they publish their model and your CRM team get to add custom fields. You can then pull a source entity such as Customer or Case into your data platform. Other tools like Siebel will have 5,000 tables of which 100 will contain domain data, each of those tables will have 100 of columns so the task here is the identify which tables and columns are relevant - depending on how the system is configured. The final example is Success Factors, here they expose data through reports and APIs. The internal schema is their IP and not shared, but you can find out from the API spec or report engine what you can extract. My last 2 projects has kept data for ingestion close to the source with an initial seed load and then the delta loads. After that we current have a raw data vault which is essentially facts and type 2 history tables. Then we have the business consumption layer which applies any business logic that allows the BI team to create their dashboard. If I had asked you to do this then I would not want a generic schema for source but details of what I can get from the source system as raw maintaining their schema. Then its the best way to manage a staging environment that manages the history. If you have a number of the source schema ready then it's best to clarify what your manager's expectations are. What is your environment ?",

Or can I just, lets say, write a json to represent the order and send it directly to the pipeline, keeping the production schema only with `customers` and `products` tables? Would that be too far from what actually happens in real scenarios? I'm afraid I may be oversimplifying things.I'm guessing that, in the \"real world\", an e-commerce needs to write the customer orders first in its production database to keep track of stuff similar to what I described in the last paragraph of my post. Should I take that into account for my project? If yes, for how long the data is kept in production?

Much more memory efficient, and the API is much nicer to work with. Read the Polars user guide, but maybe start this part first: https://docs.pola.rs/user-guide/migration/pandas/PS: Don't depend on external software, if possible.

Well, it depends ;-)Writing data to tempdb is a physical operation, which is costly if you do it for a lot of data. If you already have data in an indexed table that's optimized for your workload, it would be a poor decision to write it to a temp table.If you can subset a (relatively) small amount of data from your big, indexed table, and put it in a temp table, it may be worth it. Especially if what comes next is a long and complex query that would otherwise be hard for the optimizer to build a proper plan for, if it were to run on a big table.Generally, write operations are slow and resource-heavy. That includes writes to tempdb. You should avoid them, unless later performance gain outweight the cost of writing the data.",

This is a mix of type 2, where each new version gets a new id, and type 1, so your fact table might have a “UserId” which is the id of the user to a single type 2 record, and a “Current User Id” - which may be the user id from the source system where IsCurrent = True in your dimension table.I recommend only using type 2 on columns you definitely want new records when it changes, but sometimes you get asked for a column in hindsight. You can either risk it, make a new record on a wider range, or all, columns, or keep the audit table of all changes just in case you need to rebuild it.",

Good point. The main reason is that the person who came before me (who's no longer on the project) just set up everything as an SCD2 pipeline.So now I have to make do with what exists.However, regarding this thing in specific, I think it's because if you just use the CDC append only table, you gain convenience in writing, but lose convenience in reading (e.g., CDC logs only contain the changed rows, so if I want \"current\" records, I need to scan all partitions).",

For example `raw/customer/25/08/01/customer.json.gz`. That way if I ever need to reprocess it’s easy to do so based of dates.For batch processing where you are only consuming the files periodically, I find it easier to have some type of ops or metadata file processing table, which keeps track of which files have already been processed.

And there is no correlation with gender, former education, grades, IQ, nerdiness or all the other factors that people like to count. The only thing I have seen that they all have in common is curiosity, willingness to fail (not fail a course, but like falling of a bicycle, or missing a dance-step and getting up and try again), and a bit of a stubbornness, in that they *want* to fix the problem they currently have!Those I seen fail are mostly those who give up waaay too soon, or those who doesn't care about making something by themselves, but just want a finished result, so they can get on with other things. Like they have no pride in their work, they just want to be done.So those are the traits I see: **curiosity**, **courage**, **stubbornness**, willingness to try again and again and again, accepting even the smallest progress as a win!",

People consider me very weirdI started on basic in the 80s before high school. 1st pc in 85. IBM PS/2. whole 8hz. Pascal and turbo pascal by 93. One of the best languages to learn pointers. C-lang by 95. Html, while not a language a couple years later with css Java and Javascript. Some xml later and c++. Little later, obj-c, this was all prior to 2011 when I grew to hate it all.Guitar. Started in the summer of 88. Piano not long after that. Drums in the early 2000s. It's still my favorite instrument. Can do a bass but never had the finger strength. Spent many years off and on teaching music.1st time at college in fall 96 started algebra 1 and 2, then moved up to trigonometry and geometry. Never got to Calc summer of 98 and beyond was bad for many years. Still absolutely adore physics and cosmology. On regret is never picking up chemistryLinguistics major now focusing on teaching english as a 2nd language or foreign language. Started Spanish in 2004 in Atlanta while working tree service Picked up Chinese in the fall and spring semester last yearThe summer project was revamped for the entire 2018 cryengine for kingdom come deliverance. Ripped out all inverse kinetics animation bullshit. Reverse engineered the entire crisis 2 physics systems with ragdolls, recoil, and hut reactions. Warhorse had ripped out a good 97 to 98% of the system. That is all xml and lua tagged into a full c++ engine. Near total overhaul. Nothing like the original game.I also enjoy modding other games on the nexus. Full overhauls for several games now and a couple more deleted. Some of my hardest programming challenges I have solved in my brain whole I sleep. Can literally see the code roll past, and when I get up in the morning shit gets to work pretty quick.After a while, you start to think in other languagesI have had this happen with music, programming, and Chinese It is awesome Still can't get hired in the gaming industry. Tried for more than 20 years. I ran a mud for 15 years. Rewrote the entire thing. Went from 90kb to 8mb to 6mb depending on what year it was. Had hard-core. Skill based with 20 classes in by 2000. ended with a full random equipment generator and 1000+ skills spells and abilities and a full in game quest and quest reward system by 2003. Oh, and a planet and elemental system. And a complete random event system by 2005But ya know to this day, because I don't have a degree I don't have any experience getting into the industry . I pretty much have a doctorate in game design. Always the same e. Don't call us we will call youYes, it rewires your brain, and it is glorious And so many people will never understand that",

Language, art, music, and cultural identity never really interested me bc it felt very fluid and ever morphing with very grey lines. So coding was always likely a very natural path for me. But I would say ive had a different outcome in life. Instead of coding/programming as a job it'd been more of a passive hobby for me. Ive gotten exceptionally good at understanding underlying factors and influences that have shaped modern cultures, music, language etc. To the point that writing and expressing my thoughts is likely one of my strongest traits. But I think learning how to program ironically really helped with it. Objective oriented programming really helped shape my understanding of repeated actions creating ever growing outcome (loops). Helped me start to compartmentalize and break things down into smaller parts instead of things as a single large thing (objects). Recognizing how two things that are alike can be uniquely different but share a lot of common traits and abilities (inheritance). And lastly the biggest impact, \" if then\" statements. Oh my god it reshaped basic logic for me and how I view people's actions/decisions/fallacies. It made me infinitely more forgiving and compassionate to strangers and their mistakes. I was able to categorize and recognize thousands of what was just instinctive gut feelings into actual logic and language for me. It gave me a weird algorithmic way to categorize the world for me and ground me in a more \"human\" way. It helps me massively predict the outcomes of actions/consequences and think ahead in a way I hadn't considered before.",

Basically, when you ask a question, you should be at a point where you know the information you are looking for, but also know that you can't find it yourself.So, for example, asking \"how do I commit a change\" is not a good question, because it's vague, would take hours to answer fully and strongly suggests you have not done even basic research.Asking \"What is the URL of the GitHub server\" is a great question - I can answer it instantly, and there is no way you could have found it out yourself (errr - unless it's in the new starter guided in which case you shouldn't have asked it, obviously!).So, when asking a question (or raising a bug, or anything really) always start with \"What I did\", \"What I expected to happen\" and \"What actually happened\" - change those questions to ones that make sense for the question you are asking, but generally they are a good format for asking for help.People want to help - they just don't want to do your job for you.",

Internalize their critiques, and make sure you don't do things wrong in the same way the next time and the time after that.

So is reading introductory material that's nonspecific, verbose, and has no immediate connection to something you actually care about. What you can do is make the process more interactive, provide faster feedback, and tailor it to your attention span.Instead of thinking about \"all the cool stuff\", pick one item from the list. Just one, ideally the most exciting one. Then try to make that, and only that. It will probably be way too big and difficult, which is why you need experience building smaller things first. But you don't need these smaller things to be completely unrelated to your project, which is however what you'll get by following standard tutorials.No one dreams of making \"hello world\", but even something incredibly complex can be turned into something simple by removing almost all of the details first. That way, what's left will be directly related to the eventual end result and you can see, in your mind, the next steps that will get you closer to the \"real thing\".Even if you never get there, the process is inherently motivating. You may find that you know exactly what to do, but not how exactly it could be done. That's good, because now you're intrinsically motivated to learn. You need to find out and understand what you don't in order to get further, and you'll automatically know what to ignore (because it doesn't help you go in this direction).If you need specific examples, feel free to elaborate on your project ideas. But don't try to follow popular guidance if it isn't working. Most teachers, and the learning resources they create, are bad and won't work for a large proportion of students. There's no universal solution and no replacement for intrinsic motivation. If learning isn't fun on a regular basis, you'll struggle and not everyone can just \"power through\" until it \"gets fun\". That's not a failure, just a mismatch in strategy.The good news is that the beginning is by far the most difficult part of learning programming. Once you've attained some level of mastery, motivation comes much easier since being good at something is inherently rewarding.",

With a human language, if you know it well, then you can really express ANY IDEA AT ALL with finesse and comprehensibility. But with programming languages it's not really that way at all. Although formally programming languages that are \"Turing complete\" can be used to express any program, in actual practice, some tasks/types of programs are definitely way easier in some languages than others. Programming languages are tools, more like a hammer and a saw. You need to know how to use both of those, based on what task you are going to do. Also there are many types of hammer, many times of saw, just like there are many flavors of some programming languages that resemble each other. When you're first learning, you should learn to use an easy-to-use one, a safe one, etc. Later on, you can learn to use more powerful tools, more specialized tools.It is the same in programming, except the tools change frequently and depend a lot on in what domain you are working.In Web development for example you're likely to use a lot of JavaScript. In other domains JS is making headway with Node.js but to me it's still not used as much. The other languages you mentioned (PHP, SQL) are that way as well. Most people don't consider HTML a programming language because you can't write a loop, there's no real control flow, etc. It is possible to \"modularize\" HTML though, so there's that. Nowadays though it seems like most people prefer to generate HTML rather than to code it by hand.Also SQL is a very specialized language used to query a database. For example, what would \"hello world\" look like in SQL? Can you make a command-line app in SQL? Maybe it's technically possible, but I would not want to maintain such code if you gave it to me. I would much rather maintain the Python version of such a tool.",

If you only ever learn one language, your view of the world will be very limited. But it will also be limited, if all you ever learn is mainstream imperative paradigm.

And when a program runs in machine code, it becomes much, much simpler to understand how it calls other programs that are also in machine code. Calling another machine code program is as simple as asking the CPU to jump to the address of that program. Of course you need to know that address, but that's what the operating system helps with.But the programs (or the compilers that compiled them) still has to agree on a \"calling convention\", like how are arguments transferred to functions. They can for instance be stored in specific registers in the CPU, and then the return value is expected to be in a certain register. Or maybe a single register stores a pointer to the list of arguments, and then the function itself has to extract them from that memory location.Look into \"calling conventions\" if you want to learn more, and maybe take a look at [https://godbolt.org/](https://godbolt.org/) and analyze how a C program gets converted to machine code - but be warned, it isn't simple :)",

This is a primary reason for CSV, XML, JSON, and other data formats. Most languages can read and write any file format, these days (that was less true 50 years ago.)If a running program written in one language invokes a function written in another language, the caller has to set up the stack frame in the way that's expected by the function being called. Different languages have different calling conventions.And when information is transferred over a network, that has its own problems. Often it's done with a text based format like JSON, but Protobufs are designed for the purpose. In the olden days, Sun invented XDR (eXternal Data Representation) and SunRPC, which did much the same thing but a lot less efficiently.In general we call this problem Serialization and Deserialization, and solutions to the problem have been introduced constantly for decades.",

If you don’t use the file system, but want to access data in memory, I.e. have a single app that is written in two or more languages, it gets very complex. Every language usually has an interface library that converts its internal data representation to C. C is the lowest level language that is not specific to a processor.",

        "body": "It depends on what you mean by \"talk to each other\". Let's look at your example. Are you assuming that for Python to open a file, it needs to talk to C? It doesn't need to do that. Whatever underlying mechanism C uses to open a file, Python has that feature too.Yes, it's possible to have a language that doesn't have any features to open a file which means you're stuck unless you want to figure how to do it which might require rewriting parts of the compiler (or interpreter) for the language.Someone pointed out that Python can make foreign function calls to C. Python's weakness is that it's interpreted. Compared to languages like C, this makes it slow. You would think this would make Python and unlikely choice for doing math (which is computationally intensive), but because Python has this foreign function call specifically to C, then you can implement these numerical calculations in C, but let it be called like a standard Python library.But it's because Python has that feature built in. It doesn't have (as far as I know) a foreign function interface to, say, Erlang or Java.In general, languages don't have the capability to talk to each other directly.Someone pointed out that there is the front end (the browser side) and a back end (the server side), and that this is a way that two languages communicate. This is done indirectly, at least, if you're talking about a web browser.A front end is going to send a HTTP request which is a protocol to send information to a server. The server responds with that protocol. This means whatever language that front end is written in (Javascript is most common) has to eventually send an HTTP request. The back end needs to decode that request and then run some code in whatever language (there are numerous backend languages) then translate that to a response back to the client end.Two languages interact through HTTP, a protocol both sides understand. It's a little like someone who speaks Mandarin talking to someone who speaks Hindi by both speaking in English.One reason this happens is the front and back end are on separate machines with separate memory, so this requires some connection, namely, the Internet, and some way to communicate across this connection (HTTP which runs on top of TCP/IP).With Python calling a C function through a foreign language interface, then you're running code in the same memory space together. Again, it's a bit uncommon.You could have two languages communicate via a socket, which can be done via the same file system or via the Internet. You could invent a protocol to do this, but it wouldn't involve one language making a direct call in the other language, unless that was built into the language itself.Beginners often think languages talking to one another is cool and that it happens all the time, but it's not the way most people think.",

Yes, I read that you're a CSE grad, but you need the experience and especially the feeling and confidence that comes with it.And then learn to read documentation and references instead of googling. Your code looks like Python. So go ahead and read through the whole Python reference. You don't need to memorize it, and you can skip through stuff, but make sure you read all the function names and at least a little bit of what they do, and it will help you a lot to get some confidence and a starting point if you're looking for something. After that, pick some \"most used libraries\" (feel free to google it) and read a few examples for each, or the reference docs if you can afford to.There's no easy way, you have to go ahead and invest the time and brain cells. Again, it's not about memorizing everything, but having read stuff at least once will give you a better feeling for a language, what to find where, where to start, and some confidence.Good luck, I think the thing you're most lacking right now is confidence, and there ain't no better way to establish that than knowing that you worked hard.",

That makes the mapping (or function, in the mathematical sense) from inputs to outputs much easier to formally describe and specify. It also makes it much easier to test.For another, when a component has state, then its behavior depends on the order of operations that are performed on it. If you want to prove that a component will always behave a certain way, then you have to prove it for all possible orderings of operations. This tends to give you a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. It's not impossible to prove these sorts of properties, but it's something that you don't have to worry about if the component is stateless.Usually, an application *needs* to have state, in order to do what you want it to do. But by confining the state to the smallest possible \"region\" of the program, you make the both the stateful parts and the stateless parts easier to reason about, compared to how it would be if mutable state was woven throughout the program.Just as one specific example of this, programs that make heavy use of mutable global variables tend to be much harder to understand and maintain than those that pass parameters and return values around wherever they're needed.",

If it's possible to just substitute values into a computation to get an answer, it's very easy (in theory) to see where something is wrong. Once you introduce the idea that time matters, e.g. a value can be different at different points in time depending on what point a machine (of some description) is at in the computation, it starts to get much harder to debug things. Now imagine a large program/system with millions of bits of state, changing frequently. If the code doesn't produce the desired behaviour for some combination of those states, you have a bug, and it can be very hard to track down.2. Following on from the above, in the context of OOP vs Functional paradigms, OOP is (most agree) about associating behaviour with data. Grouping state with the code that changes it, usually modelled after some real-world thing (but not necessarily). In this way it encourages statefulness and mutation of state. It attempts to balance this with encapsulation (usually enforced at compile time), so that only certain code can access certain state. But that code is called by other code, so the positive effect of this can be limited. Contrasted with functional, where we try to write as much of the program without depending on state, meaning functions become \"pure\" (no reliance on state, no side effects, etc.). We need side effects and state changes, it's what we sell to customers, but we can push them to the very edges of the program, and wall off code that handles the messy stuff, hopefully making the rest easier to reason about and less prone to bugs. Just like OOP there is a spectrum. You can dip your toes in, or go full on.Edit, just seen you added 3. Think I basically covered it though so I'll leave it there for now. Also, interestingly, some languages are now turning off statefulness by default and having you opt into it, e.g. Rust with mut to enable assignment (distinct from initialising the value)",

They just need to specify those fields and will get a predictable response.If your function additionally relies on implicit, mutable state, e.g. certain fields being a certain value at certain times that can be updated by anything anywhere, including randomly or by the mere passage of time, then it's way more difficult to use the function correctly because you don't control the inputs directly.No one's saying \"never have state\". People are saying \"write code in such a way that you can read a function invocation and figure out what it does without knowing the rest of the system\".",

But that doesn't hold for the text editor - when you load a text to edit, you don't set the state of the entire application, only the \"data-model\" that it manipulates. All the rules, all the behaviour of the program would be the same as if any other text had been loaded, and thus not directly affecting the state. The state would be like if part of the text was selected, or a dialog window was opened, or a context-menu was active.Statefulness isn't necessarily considered bad - but the more states you have, the higher complexity you are dealing with, and the higher the risk for unexpected behaviour. If you have 32 variables that can all impact the operation of the application in different ways, you have 4 billion variations, and you can't possibly test every single one of them. So the less statefulness the better.OOP can encourage statefulness because it encourages objects to be able to manipulate themselves, and store their data, i.e. their state internally. An object \"remembers\" what happened to it the last time you called some method, and behaves differently the next time, depending on previous method-calls. Pure functions do not alter their behaviour depending on state - they always behave the exact same.Statelessness is preferred because that means that the application always behaves the exact same, and always in a predictable way, thus errors can't suddenly happen when a previous un-encountered state occurs. If new errors are found, they happen because of specific input, and it can be replicated and fixed. Whereas when errors happen in stateful applications, you might not be able to replicate the exact circumstances that caused the error.At least that is what we hope and wish for - but of course states can't be completely eliminated, and errors and bugs still show up from time to time in any kind of application.",

        "body": "2 first: Objects are *data and their operations*. State is the definition of an object in the OOP sense.1 and 3: Stateless operations are trivially parallelizable and for practical purposes obviate the memory bus part of the architecture to focus on control flow and data transformation.Let us back up a little: Fundamentally every program is a transformation of data. At all scales, this is what a program is. From the macro to the function level, a program / routine / subroutine/ function, has input, performs a transformation, and provides output. The \"provides transformation and provides output\" is the key part. This is true even in places where it's somewhat unexpected: Gluing APIs together is largely taking the data from one API, performing a transformation, and then outputting it to a second API.This is the underlying premise for microservices, for instance. They perform a single small transformation on data and output it for the next consumer.Now, let's consider a matrix consisting of all stateful branches. This is a little opaque to think about at first, so I'll give a concrete example: In NetHack you can mix potions, or pour potions on items, drink them, etc, and essentially do any X to any item and any potion that you can do with *any other item*. If you have a matrix where all items are represented as rows, and the behavior of an item interacting with another item is defined by a function entry in that matrix, then you can see that the number of interactions and state transformations of the data grows exponentially with each item (for n-items it's n\\^2 possible state transformations).It is possible to show that all stateful operations in a program can be represented this way, and so the complexity of a program grows exponentially as the number of possible distinct state-branches it can take on a given stateful object grows.Some programs, and some styles of programming (especially game programming) typically lend themselves to managing and processing large amounts of state. With a resulting large amount of bugs. It is difficult and takes a lot of engineering work to parallelize that in a consistent and meaningful way, and there are multiple approaches to doing so (the most ubiquitous in my experience has literally been writing your own IPC layer... jfc I hate game devs).The graphics pipeline can nominally be viewed as a (mostly) stateless series of programs. Ignoring some advanced counterexamples, vertex and pixel shaders inherently take input, provide output, and never operate on state at all. But this isn't quite completely stateless, because the graphics card / driver has a set of states that you have to set for those programs to operate the intended way. It has *minimal* state, but is not entirely stateless.That minimal state affecting control and inputs though minimizes the difficulty in parallelizing shader operations, and once configured globally the programs are trivially parallelizable.So, statefulness is \"bad\" from a philosophy of programming perspective where an increase in state and the number of transformations on that state increases the complexity of a program quadratically and decreases the composability and functional-ness of the program. OOP is by definition state and operations.BUT, the truth is that some programs require state, and/or are easier to reason about statefully. And where the rubber meets the road, you do what you need to do to get the data tranformed correctly and within acceptable external tolerances.Ed: I forgot to address the side-effects problem. State implies functions have side effects to transform persistent state. That's the entire point of functions on persistent state. Side-effects can sometimes be very hard to see or understand, making it harder to reason about complex programs (duh) and breaking data/transformation locality.",

I was at a complete and utter loss, I had no idea where to start. But... the assignment was broken down to small parts. Ask for and take user input. Store the letter choice. Check if the letter has already been used. Pick a word from a dictionary. Check if the letter is in the word etc... It took me far too long to learn that the assignment wasn't about a hangman game, it was a lesson showing how to split big problems in to small ones. Every step was laughably easy and suddenly I had a silly little game to show for it. If you ask me to build almost anything, I'll be at a loss. But I have got a bit better at biting off small chunks and doing those. As another poster said, pseudo code is good. I tend to start fairly high level, and I may even write outlines of what I'll actually need. Load Dictionary from locationPick random word from dictionaryGet user inputStore users letterCheck if letter is in wordIf yestake letter out of word?If notincrement count (decrement towards zero?) (I needed to initialise a counter somewhere) (if the letter had previously been used I should warn the user, and not count the pick) Even if I do those out of order I can make some progress. I'm working on a personal project now to build random playlists from my music library, based on genre, artist, and whatever parameters I can think of. I have *no idea* how to do that. But I know I need to start with reading my music library. And I don't want to do that every time I run, so I want to store that somewhere and rerun periodically (either to a file or database). So I need to think about whether I want to write data to file or database, and figure out how to do that. And I want to take in some parameters for the playlist, but I can do that from a config file of some sort for now. And I'll want to pick a set of tracks which match my params - can't be that hard. Then I need to randomly pick some, and maybe randomise the order. Hmm, maybe I should try and limit the number of tracks from any one artist, or maximise it - that may be a nice parameter. I'll need to know the standard playlist format. Etc etc.Suddenly the whole project seems like something you could do in a weekend. Which makes me wonder why I haven't gotten around to it in the past year... although in that time I have written some code that gives me some nice data on my music library, and lets me do some housekeeping and cleanup on it.",

        "body": "That doesn't make much sense, because there's no single cognitive ability that would allow one to program successfully without being able to understand enough to create your own solutions (however poor they may be at first).If you're talking about actual deficiencies, like those in working memory (e.g., if one has ADHD it is often impaired) then that's a very real challenge, but not one you couldn't work around. I know excellent programmers who are technically learning-disabled, they just take more time and are slower but they can still somehow do if after they gained enough practice.I think it would be worth investigating what forms of representation for information you prefer in other contexts. Usually, a combination of material works better than any specific one, but there are large individual differences. If you're using code as a reference, that is entirely different than using code to understand a concept. In fact, there are (at least) four different types of resources that people may use while programming and they all serve different purposes:1. Introductory material/tutorials: Separates information into buckets, reducing cognitive load (pre-selection and focus of attention)2. \"How to do X\" guides and other instructions: Complete \"recipes\" for how to do something you don't know how to do exactly, like algorithms that can be mixed and matched, or adapted to your actual needs3. References: No explanation, just to remember things that aren't in your memory (syntax, functions, conditions, ...)4. In-depth guides and explanations: Used to form connections and help you understand related details, to gradually expand your knowledge graphSome common issues I've seen are people focusing extensively on one specific type of resource, picking the wrong type for a given situation, trying to understand every detail instead of finding other resources to compare, or trying to do everything at once instead of just one individual step.The second big issue might be the complete lack of visualization. Humans are inherently visual creatures and our visual system is the most bandwidth-heavy of all, it's really fast and (within certain limits) excellent at relaying information to your brain that would be more difficult to get in the ol' noggin by any other means. You can draw stuff on paper, in apps like EcaliDraw, or use oldschool graphics programs like Paint. Diagrams like MermaidJS also work but are usually too much effort for everyday tasks. For some people, explaining ideas in language may be helpful. This takes more time and doesn't work unless you know roughly what you want to do, but it can be a great aid in clarifying your ideas. Even if you later delete the text, you can try explaining what you are doing and what you want to do as if someone was reading it later. Or find a real person/rubber duck and talk out loud instead.Finally, there is a difference between \"bottom-up\" and \"top-down\" learning. Many regular people seem to prefer the latter, where you start with a high-level idea go down further as needed. This has the benefit of reducing the cognitive load as you get to ignore all the low-level details, but this simplification can make true understanding much more difficult than necessary. It is commonly seen in math where the lecturer knows all the details and sometimes \"forgets\" to mention them or just glances over important topics, leaving students utterly confused. The reverse is also possible, and of course you can try to attack each problem from both angles. I suspect autistic people have an easier time with bottom-up approaches as the details are what allows them to really understand, while it may be overkill for someone else (but this is purely an anecdotal observation). You need to find your own preferred style and see what exactly makes it easiest for you to understand the actual problem, before you encode it into an executable program specification.Personally, I found that \"low IQ\" or working memory deficiencies etc. may manifest in that one can't as easily (or rapidly) step through each part of a given problem in their mind, or might make more errors while doing so. But that still doesn't prevent you from doing it on paper or using any other medium, and you might find that someone who seems \"stupid\" is actually quite adept at visualizing graphically in their head instead, or they're great at teaching the material to others and thereby learn it themselves, etc.I would assume that people with severe cognitive disabilities who are \"brainess\", as you put it, have neither the capacity nor motivation to ask for programming help on Reddit. So my best guess would be a mismatch in approach or missing skillsets, not a lack of general problem-solving ability. Abstract problem solving is more difficult than doing it in context; you could try reframing the problem so it represents specific instances.",

Once you have a clear picture, start developing each of the individual parts, the preparation (setup), the start, each game round, the winning/losing conditions, etc. Again be very detailed.Once you have your \"master plan\", start programming. The trick to get out of the tutorial phase is to drop the notion to use tutorials for everything and instead jumping into the water and trying things on your own.

The answers vary - rarely do you see a program or series of interconnected code that has been written by a single individual - if it was, then you learn their structure and approach and it's almost like a distinctive fingerprint. More common, there have been a large number of people maintaining or enhancing the code and they all have different styles, even if there are strict standards from the company. Then, the code is difficult to understand unless they have commented well - here is an example: a1++; // increment countervs. max_error_count++; // Keep track of maximum errors detected during this transaction; vs. foobar++; a1 is a poor example, but foobar++; is worse. No comments, no intuitive name. max_error_count at least gives you some information and the comment helps. I've been called back to a company after 20+ years to work on code that is still running, and it's instantly recognizable to me what i wrote and what others have written - but it's all understandable because of documentation and comments.

I did allot of errors while learning and one of them is to rely on toturials they trick ur brain to think u know stuff but in reality u don't, u have to build stuff on ur own after studying .Sorry for the long paragraph , good luckEdit: I forgot to mention, search for the Odin project, it is very good",

        "body": "Fair warning, this is going to be very long.I prefer the Black Box Method to writing code. I think a lot of developers do this without really thinking about it. No matter what the program is, you should be able to break it down into some smaller steps, some important operations that need to happen for the program to work. The Black Box Method basically just involves creating placeholder functions for the more complicated operations, then coming back later to define the details of those functions. You start with the big picture, make sure it's behaving like you want, then work your way down to the finer details.For example, let's say you need to build a program that can read a bunch of names from an input file and update some data files using the information from that file. It's something I've had to do at my job quite a few times now. Immediately, what are the two big things we know it needs to do?1. Read the input file2. Update the relevant data filesSo you write whatever boilerplate you need to get going, then in your main() function, or wherever your program begins, you simply write two lines (I'm gonna be using Pythonic pseudocode from here on out): def main(): parse_input_file() update_data_files()And the key is that you don't have to define them just yet. I normally just have these placeholders display a message like \"Parsing input file...\" and \"Updating data files...\" to make things easy to debug. You can do a sanity check here and run your new program to make sure the messages are displaying in the correct order. This would be especially important to do if this is being integrated into a larger system. Make sure your program is actually running.Anyway, now you can start breaking down these functions individually. Let's focus on the input parsing. This is where we should start asking questions like, \"how do we know which file to read?\", \"what is the format of this input file?\", \"how should we store the data that we read?\". Immediately, we have some information to figure out and some decisions to make.For the first question, let's assume that we want to prompt the user for the filename (as opposed to passing it in as a parameter to the program, like using argv in Python). For the second, let's assume that the input file is a plain text file that stores each data entry on a new line, and each line contains a username, first name, last name, and email address, delimited by commas. This type of information should be provided to you by your professor/manager/client/lead developer/someone else. The third question is more of a personal preference, and this is where your knowledge of data structures becomes important. You should base it on what's efficient and easy to maintain, but there are often many correct approaches, so do whatever makes the most sense to you. Let's keep things simple and store the data in an array of tuples for now.So, thinking about this logically, in order to parse the input file, we need to:1. Prompt the user for a file (what should we do if it doesn't exist?)2. Read each line of that file, and for each line:a. Split the line using a comma as the delimeterb. Clean up the data (if necessary) and build a tuple with itc. Append that tuple to the arrayYour program might look something like this now: def parse_input_file(): parsed_data = [] input_file = prompt_input_file() if exists(input_file) for line in input_file.readlines(): data_tuple = build_tuple_from_line(line) if data_tuple: # make sure data exists parsed_data.append(data_tuple) return parsed_dataAnd now that we've decided to give this function a return value, we can go back and update the main function: def main(): parsed_data = parse_input_file() if parsed_data: # make sure data exists update_data_files(parsed_data)Note that we also defined two new placeholder functions. One of them is build_tuple_from_line() which takes as input the text from the line and outputs a tuple representing that data. If it fails to parse for whatever reason, we can return an empty tuple, and nothing will be added to the array. The other is prompt_input_file() which takes no inputs and outputs an object with a readlines() member. (There is also the exists() function, but I am assuming that one is imported.) Hopefully you have an idea now of how this might continue. You can start breaking down each function from here.No matter what you're doing, you can always break it down into smaller steps. Focus on the core features and start with the parts you understand best. Leave the more complicated parts as abstract functions until you're ready to get into the weeds. You might find along the way that you took an inefficient approach, but it's almost always better just to get something that works to begin with, then you can always go back and optimize later. Like I know the approach I just laid out is very inefficient with memory. If you know that will be a concern, then this would be the perfect time to make adjustments before things get too complicated.That got way longer than I anticipated, but hopefully it's somewhat helpful. I'm not an expert by any means, but I've seen some decent success as a programmer, and this is the approach that works best for me. Best of luck in your journey! Hope you become a kickass developer someday!",

        "body": "At the beginning I often struggled with translating e.g. homework tasks into code. I then read a beginner programming book which has used C#. The programming language isn't important as the first two chapters were the most relevant for me. The first chapter talked about why you want to learn to program, what possible fields of work are there.The second one was about algorithmic thinking. In general most programming language are built on 3 concepts:\\- Sequence (A sequence of actions that are executed in order of their appearance)\\- Branching (Actions are executed based on certain conditions)\\- Repetition (repeating an action until a condition is met. loops and recursion are different forms of repetition)Most lectures only present you the synthax of e.g. an if-statement or of a loop in a certain language. But they don't tell you when to use these parts of the language. In the book they were talking about looking for keywords in the text or the requirements.For example: If you see the word \"if\" in a text then it is a strong indicator for branching as \"if\" implies there are at least two options to handle. \"As long as\" might be an indicator for a loop. If there are many separate actions mentioned one after each other it is a strong indicator for a sequence of actions that you have to perform to reach a certain goal. For each of the actions you could write one single program instruction or a function to group multiple connected instructions in one place.In the book they give examples like opening a door where you execute an algorithm to achieve your goal. The sequence can't be changed as you can't enter the room without opening the door. In programming you have to think about which steps have to be performed first in order for your code to solve a problem.pressDoorHandle()openDoor()enterRoom()closeDoor()Of course this is easy when you get university homework as most of the time they try to tell you as accurate as possible what you should do. If talking to a client you actually have to find out what the requirements even are.Of course this is programming on a micro-level as we are dealing with the specific steps but you can apply this also on higher levels of abstractions when you describe how a user e.g. interacts with a system like a website when he e.g. creates an account, deletes a post.When programming I often use pen and paper or I write comments (pseudo-code) like this:\\# For each pdf-document do:\\# Open pdf-document\\# Extract values with a regular expressions\\# write them into table\\# close documentAfter writing the pseudo-code I add the real code below the comments. This way I can focus on solving the problem without having to delve into the specifics of the programming language that I use (this is something you can google easily).There are more tips about thinking techniques for problem solving but I have to go do groceries now:)). Feel free to ask any questions. Good luck! EDIT: Book recommendation: Thinking like a programmer by Spraul it's a book on problem solving techniques. It uses C++ but this isn't important. Use any language you want. It's more about understanding the concepts rather than the language.",

Personally, I would start by knowing those 335 repositories as they are the top ones. In addition, if I am stuck using a particular programming language, I would know the top GitHub repositories for that programming language. For example, if I am stuck with C++, I would do \"Written in this language: C++\" and then \"Repositories options: With this many stars: >10000\". That yields 241 repositories. Personally, if I were working on a C++ project, I would know those 241 repositories as they are the top C++ ones. In addition, the Apache Foundation projects are big, especially in the Java world.

Learning takes time, so you must also learn to become process-oriented by finding ways to make that time rewarding as opposed to being goal-oriented and only caring about the final outcome, because the latter gives you very little in terms of experience which is what you should be taking out of your learning journey. Yes, researching how to build everything from scratch takes a very long time in the beginning, but as you gain experience, the need to do that will diminish, you will gain intuition, and over time you will build a strong knowledge foundation that will serve you much better in the long run than the brittle thing that you will build if you keep approaching learning with your current mindset. You don't need to go any deeper than the public instruction set native to your computer as below that one can hardly call it programming, but in the beginning you should really aim at forming a strong notion of how things really work all the way down there.> My question is: How do you usually learn about the tools, libraries, or techniques that already exist, so you don’t waste time building everything from scratch? Is there a strategy or habit for this, or is it just experience over time?I don't. In personal projects I just learn everything from scratch, and enjoy the whole process, because the point is to learn, not to finish the project, and the time spent learning isn't really wasted time. As a beginner to some technology there's also a very high chance that my first approach to solving the problem will likely be a mess so it won't be of much use, so that's never my goal. Lastly it's also very likely that, in the research process required to actually learn how things work, I will come across existing projects that already do it right, but instead of cheating my way by just taking advantage of the existing solution I go down the rabbit hole and try to wrap my head around the rationale of that solution, and don't consider the problem solved until I successfully tackle it myself.My advice to you is to stop coming up with excuses to avoid learning when that's exactly what you should be doing. High-level development might feel rewarding to you because it gives you the impression that you are accomplishing a lot with very little, but in the end you are also only gaining a superficial experience, and without a solid foundation it's very easy for abstractions to create unexpected complex problems that you lack the intuition to solve on your own, so don't cheat your way out of the learning process. With large language machine learning models you have free access to teachers that can easily break down complex concepts for you and never get tired of answering your requests to explain things from different perspectives, which is a commodity that I didn't get to enjoy during most of my career, so definitely take advantage of that, not to write your code ant cheat your way out of problems, but to truly help you wrap your head around the solutions.",

If you're so passionate about software you can't imagine doing anything else, got get a 4 year CS degree, an internship, push hard and I'm sure you'll be successful.

It will also print the odd numbers - hm, okay, then you find out how to either check if a number is even or odd before printing it out, or somehow change the program so it skips the odd numbers in the list.Then you change it so it doesn't always go to 16, but to whatever number is input.Work backwards from the result towards the program that will create that result - \"fake\" parts of the program you don't yet know how to write, and always make sure that you have a running program that produces *some* result, even if it isn't the exact right one yet!Take small steps.Do not simply stare at the question and hope for a solution to appear in your mind, fully formed with all the details - it might happen occasionally with smaller tasks, but as the tasks get larger and larger, that process will fail!",

It will help further down the line for other concepts to anchor on this. Once you get good at it you can kind of distillate the concept of what is that word without even knowing the concepts behind just with the way the sentence is written and your own experience. It culmulate into a way to read requirements and text by skimming it at what information is pertinent for you.

You may then write down the steps (on paper) as it would be instructions to a machine (still informal but with more details), work in itarations and make it more and more formal. This way you may express a problem with an informal text, transform the text into a set of informal \"instructions,\" and iterate the instructions to look more and more like a formal program. With experience, you can skip some of the steps, do some of them in your head, and you can fill in the blanks without much work (for some more difficult situations, it can still be useful to fall back to writing down problem statements by hand and twist and turn on the problem).",

Once you map a real-world scenario into those, it starts clicking.OOP is *very* important in backend Java — most frameworks (Spring, Hibernate, etc.) are built on it. But don’t stress: you don’t need to be a guru on day one. Start small: build a tiny project like a library system or todo app using classes, then refactor it as you learn.Backend sanity tip: focus on one layer at a time (data → logic → API).

As a general rule, a lot distinct Java OOP features, specifically inheritance and everything related to it, are very over-represented in education. Outside of GUI components, code that heavily uses inheritance is a massive pain in the ass to reason about and work with, and is considered an anti-pattern in the industry. When trim down OOP to the actually useful parts, it's fairly easy to understand and work with, and for that reason basic OOP features are ubiquitous in modern programming languages.",

        "body": "Nearly every modern programming language/framework still relies on text files as their input, and that will not be changing any time soon.So, the number one secret when learning to code, is learning how to write these text files.That means, the student needs to type in every line of code by hand, and then try to understand what it is they just typed in. That one skill, the ability to read and write code is a big chunk of what makes a good programmer.Now why students tend to struggle with this is because, firstly this is actually hard to do, so they tend to cheat and just do lots of copy and paste, telling themselves they are learning.But there are no shortcuts. To get good at programming requires being good at reading and writing code and that can only be learned by typing in all the code by hand and then trying to understand what was typed. And this requires weeks if not months of repetition (i.e. write lots and lots of code).And you don't need to go looking for some magic project to code. Stick to the basics and learn to write for loops, if statements, control statements, functions and procedures, read user input, echo that input, read for file, write to a file, access a database, read from a socket, write to a socket, spawn a process, capture its output etc. etc.And even using AI should not be an issue, but if all you are doing is using the AI code directly you will not be learning anything. If you use AI take the code it writes and type all of that code in by hand, then study the code to understand what it is doing. No copy and paste, no shortcuts.Using that process you will be learning to write code and learning to read code. Add to that reading a good book on your programming language and you'll be well on your way to becoming a good programmer.",

We need to read the docs for plenty of things we use, and we forget little details all the time. The tools we use are designed to catch when we goof and tell us.

And translating that pseudocode to actual programming language is even simpler.But if you try to remember the solution in a specific programming language without having done the work prior, like you don't really understand the *what* and the *why*, but focus entirely on the *how* \\- they you'll have a very hard time.

        "body": "Not really an answer to your question, and I dunno if this will help you, but I use a mental trick when I'm coding recursion (e.g. when traveling trees or linked lists or deeply nested markup language structures).I imagine that there are a bunch of people standing around, each of whom manages a single node in the nested structure. When the recursive method is called, each person has a list of information they are handed (the argument list), knowledge of the specific node's properties (its attributes, its list of children, maybe a link to its parent, whatever is there), and tasks to perform. That person knows NOTHING about the rest of the list, the other nodes, etc.Then I just imagine the person doing the task needed and then handing off information to the next node.Silly example: I have a tree structure with a node that has a name and links to its own children. Some unknown person needs a big long list of only the names that start with A or B appended to a list.So, as the person responsible for a single node, when it's my turn, I get the A&B name list that's already been started by whoever is above me and the node's properties in the argument list (or in my own object's properties if the recursive function is baked into the object and my own method was called). I check my own node's name and if it starts with A or B, I stick it on the list. Then, I \"hand off\" the list to each of my node's children so they can do the same (i.e. I call the method for the kids the same way my parent called it for me).Obviously this example is simple, but when I get something more complicated like aggregating values, interacting with both parent and children, using shared resources, reversing results, etc., this method helps me isolate my thinking to a single node.Hint: first build your code as if your node has a parent and at least two kids. Then re-run it in your head as if you're the top-level node and make sure you have what you need to hand off to the first kids. Then re-run it in your head as if you don't have any kids to make sure you return properly.",

The more problems you solve and program, the better you will become at it.The first thing to do is to make sure that you *fully understand* the problem. You cannot solve what you don't understand.Then, sit down with pencil and paper and solve the task *your* way, as a human would do. Track down the steps. Test the steps on paper. Refine the steps until you have a clear, minute description of the solution to the problem.Ideally, your steps should be so detailed that they correspond 1:1 to code statements.Practice is what helps. Practice, practice, practice, and practice more.For your current problem: What does being a Palindrome mean? It means that a word read in both directions is the same, like *racecar* or *RADAR*.How could you detect this? By checking the original vs. the reversed word.How could you reverse a word? There are a couple ways, one of which is to loop over each character in a word and to push the current character into an array from the front.You could also just simply concatenate the letters with the current letter being added at the front of the reversed string.Last, you need to compare the original and reversed strings.What definitely is important as well is to *sanitize* the case, e.g. make everything uppercase or lowercase.",

Just like how you wouldn't go to the gym and do an exercise just once before moving on to a different exercise, apply the same mindset to coding.Once you complete something, whether it's big or small, start from a *completely* blank slate (not a half-blank slate), and do it again. Then, do it again. Do it again in an hour, then a day, then next week.Each time, you may encounter different bugs that challenge you. However, hopefully, each time you do it, it will make a little more sense, you'll be able to do it without as much help, and your understanding will deepen.",

What steps did you do? Can you write it down step by step like you would do in algebra class? Now do it for \"MADAM\", etc. Now do it for a non-palindrome like \"MADMAN\". At what step in your process did you realize MADMAN was not a palindrome?Now can you write a general procedure for doing this? Luckily you have some test-cases already for palindromes and non-palindromes, so you can test your procedure and probably fix many bugs already.If you want to get really \"serious\" about testing, then you can even take a break and write a separate program (not required, of course), that generates long palindromes and long non palindromes, and can use that as input to \"stress test\" your final procedure. For such a problem this is probably overkill, but for building an \"industrial strength\" library or program where there are strict performance requirements this kind of thing is often done.In any case don't forget to test edge cases, for example is the empty string a palindrome? Maybe it's not defined anywhere, but as a programmer you have to handle that possibility appropriately, either by defining a safe default (e.g. \"\" IS or IS NOT a palindrome by arbitrary fiat) or else return an error, saying you need at least one character to determine palindromeness/palindromitivity.",

Most beginner programming problems are like this, I mean really everything is like this.So like, the way you would check if “racecar” is a palindrome (it is) would basically be to look at the first letter and see if it matches the last letter. And then see if the 2nd letter matches the 2nd to last letter (and of course when I say “letter”… I guess I should be saying character, if it should be able to handle anything that is technically a palindrome I guess), and then check the 3rd letter matches the 3rd to last letter and so on.If EVERY comparison returns true, then the result is true (it is a palindrome). If the you ever get a false at any point, you immediately return false, because that proves it isn’t a palindrome.You could of course have to handle all the little details, and make sure invalid things never happen. So like you have to set up the loops correctly to not get any out of bounds error on the string you’re working with. And also you could notice things like how you only have to check half of the word, because you’re checking the first half against the back half. So setting a loop to go through the entire word would needlessly double check everything. But you have to make sure not to mess up and only check just under half the word, so you should do half the word plus one character (just to be safe).Etc. But yea the part you need to practice the most is the first part. Figuring out how to actually solve the problem (forgetting about programming completely. Like literally just figure out how to determine if a word is a palindrome by yourself, or whatever the problem is), this is generally the hardest part. And then figuring out how to translate this solution into code (this is generally the easiest part). And then you have to deal with making sure you’ve handled all the edge cases and whatnot correctly (probably 2nd hardest part).",

        "body": "Breaking down problems into smaller sub-problems has already been mentioned. Another ingredient is trying to make sure you understand the data. All programs operate on information that exists in some form of storage, which the program instructions manipulate (read, write, modify, compare, ...) to implement solutions to the problem you're trying to solve.Therefore, understanding the data means you will understand the problem. That's a requirement to implement any solution. The actual programming work is almost irrelevant in the sense that you might as well do it on paper, or on a blackboard/whiteboard, etc. Only the implementation is language-dependent, but the problem itself isn't usually - unless it's an artificial problem introduced by limitations of the system, programming environment, libraries, tools, etc.Using your palindrome example: What is the actual problem? Well, what is the data? Presumably, you're given a string of text. You assume it has some known encoding, probably ASCII (or Unicode), so that there is a specific number for each letter/code point. There's also the notion of a position because the words ABC and CBA are not identical. A position is just another number that represents where in the word the letter (represented by the first number) actually should appear.OK, so what is a palindrome? Well, it's a word (sequence of numbers + position) that just so happens to not change if you swap two letters that have the same \"distance\" from the beginning and end. But if positions are numbers and distances are required, can't you just use the absolute position for each letter (from *both* sides) and check that it's the same, for every letter? Sure, that is probably one solution - though it may not be what you need, or too difficult to do in a given programming language. Another approach is to just swap the entire word, and check that both versions are the same. This is simpler to understand but arguably less efficient.You may have special cases, where the word has an odd number of letters. What now? Well, one basic way is to add conditionals, like \"if it's odd, do this. If even, do that\". Often it pays to think harder and realize, in this case, that it makes no difference - the same algorithm \"just works\" and so you need not complicate your solution. If the problem is too difficult, remove special cases. In code, you can write `assert` or similar or even just a `TODO` comment, then revisit that part later.A solution is different from its implementation in code. If you can't solve the problem that's an entirely different issue than not being able to implement the solution (\"write the code\"), or writing complicated/slow/insecure/incorrect code, for that matter. How do you solve problems? By transforming data, one step at a time.",

However, you're just stuck when you try to write a program on your own.

Pick the language of your choice3. Finish all exercises. At least try to make 75% progress. By the time you hit that, you should have built some mild muscle memory as well as some creativity and rigor. Believe me you're gonna need all that when you tackle the second step.Second step: \"build your own X\"The FREE way:1. Go to [Build your own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)2. Pick an interesting stuff to build (e.g. Emulator > C > \"Writing a game boy emulator\")3. Follow and complete the introductory tutorial and try to expand with more featuresThe paid way:1. Create an account on [codecrafters.io](https://codecrafters.io)2. Pick a challenge (e.g. \"Build an interpreter from scratch\")3. Pick a language (e.g. C)4. Follow the instructionsIt's 30$ per month though, so you gotta be committed asf and make the most of it: don't just blindly complete the challenges or worse: slack off. Read docs, engage in the community, get your project reviewed by someone, make sure you thoroughly understand the tool you just built (beyond the source code that you write).Third step: personal projectsSurely there are plenty of things you want to do... If nothing comes to your mind right now, then hopefully the 3-6 months you just spent on Exercism+codecrafters gave you lots of ideas. But either way, try to do something without guidance.After all that, try to maybe contribute your own bugfixes or features on a GitHub repo that you love. Maybe during your learning journey, you spotted a nice game engine project and you want to participate in its development. The entire world is yours to discover at this point!",

And outside help is perfectly valid. For most devs, DSA stuff is really just for interviews a way to weed out people that don't know how to code and expose some other traits like how you handle problems. For prestigious companies, it's the same, only more competitive so you need to practice to give better answers than your competitors.

Think about what you can do to move you closer to the solution. Doing this for complex problems requires experience, so start with simple problems that you can solve with your experience. Do it for years and it becomes a natural way to approach problems.This is what you do every morning when you plan out your day. If you have a meeting at 10:00, and it takes you 20 minutes to get there, you need to leave at 9:40. But if you have to stop by the post office on the way, and it will take 5 minutes you need to include that in your time. But, it also changes the time calculation since you need to go to post office, spend five minutes there, then go to meeting.So, IF you go to the post office THEN add time for travel to it, time at it, and travel from post office to meeting. ELSE you don’t go to post office and simply add the travel time to meeting.Have other errands to run in addition to, or instead of, the post office? Similar logic, but applied to the trip to post office instead of the meeting. This introduces looping as you work back from your 10:00 and loop through your errands leading up to it. Get to the point where you would need to have left half an hour ago? Some errand needs to be removed…then you need an algorithm to decide which one to do later, or to reschedule the meeting. That can similarly be broken down.It may seem very tedious, but this is how complex decisions are made. You take all the variables and conditions into account, at whatever level of detail is required to give an adequate solution. Maybe you are just meeting a friend for a walk in the park, and it’s ok to be a few minutes late, whereas for a job interview you must be on time, and add a few minutes buffer in case traffic delays you.It is tedious. Very tedious. Encapsulation helps with this by focusing on the smallest set of details for the immediate problem at hand.Decompose problems into manageable encapsulations and build up from there. Start at the top and keep breaking things down until you can solve the immediate problem, then work back up to the big problem.",

Books can only take you so far; they often shape the way you *think*, but it’s doing that shapes what you *know*.Set yourself an objective, build a program, and learn what you need along the way. That’s the essence of programming: breaking a big idea into smaller ideas, then breaking those into even smaller pieces until you’re left with the simplest possible tasks. Just like many small rivers form an ocean, many small solutions build the whole system.For me, programming has become a true passion. Logic isn’t something you’re born with—it’s something you develop over time through practice. After 30 years, I can hold hundreds of thousands of lines of code in my head. Sometimes I even dream about programming—and often, I wake up having solved problems I couldn’t crack the day before.The key is simple: practice. There’s no other way.

The users were happy, the people who wrote that trash were not. I was never able to achieve 100x RTIs, which was disappointing. One needs to develop a design and methods instinct. The computer is a machine and you need to consider what you are making it do.At the time, the technical computing group was charging served departments for machine cycles, there was complete reorg because that model was blown up. I was challenged by my boss/idiot that the users were not using my software suite, the cpu use was so little. I took him to my desk and beat up one of the memory resident apps and did a bunch of scrolling, sorting, editing etc and pointed to a little bug in the corner of the screen showing session use of a few milliseconds. The data was in permanent swap space, memory resident in permanent disk swap space. The screen apps were actually an interface to edit and manipulate data in address space. There were no database calls which are all subroutine calls. When a app was launched the app instantly had data in its address space. All supported by an optimized library of reentrant code. Many people running several apps were supported by a single instance of the code in memory. RAM was very expensive at that point in time. There were table driven applications generators with terminal screen forms and fields. When doing some complex products built on top of this, the full screen app could be used to examine the address space of the product being developed, an optimal debugging tool. Things like optimizing pen plotters and manufacturing numerically controlled devices, minimizing pen changes and tool transit paths. In the pen plotters, overlapping line vectors were collapsed to one. Vectors were grouped into several regions which reduced pen-up excursions. The problem is that during CAD design, a component would be given a bill of material number and the bill of material in the corner would be completed. During plotting, the plotter would retrace those motions in the order of the drawing development. A hole in a part would have two or more overlapping circles, from each surface that the hole went through. So there were such challenges. The software did such operations in the background, the users did not need to run anything. My background was MechEng.I examined each code component's compiler machine code output, optimizing register use in each subroutine, especially anything data intensive. Without using files for data, I had to produce my own data sorting, printing, select etc. My equal key stable sorting was vastly faster than the OS sorting or SyncSort. The code included terminal drivers and supported a number of different models and brands of terminals within the one code base. Everything was coded in Fortran, however I was coding in other platforms and languages as needed.",

We like to create complexity out of boredom often in this field. I suggest just using Ubuntu for a little while until you become familiar with the basics of using it.Will you learn more with Arch?

Temperature ConverterWhat you'll build: Convert between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin temperatures.Rust concepts introduced:Structs and methodsimpl blocksAssociated functions vs methodsFloating-point arithmeticCommand-line argument parsingModule organization4. Word CounterWhat you'll build: Analyze text files to count words, lines, and characters.Rust concepts introduced:File I/O with std::fsString manipulation and slicingCollections: HashMap and VecIterators and iterator adaptersThe ? operator for error propagationLifetime basics with string slices5. Todo List ManagerWhat you'll build: A command-line todo application that saves tasks to a file.Rust concepts introduced:Enums with data (enum TaskStatus)Serialization with serde and JSONVector operations (push, remove, iterate)Pattern matching on enumsFile persistenceError handling with custom error types6. Basic HTTP ClientWhat you'll build: A simple program that makes HTTP requests and processes responses.Rust concepts introduced:External HTTP crate (reqwest)Async programming basics (async/await)JSON parsingResult chainingOption handlingNetwork error handling7. Log File ParserWhat you'll build: Parse web server logs and generate statistics.Rust concepts introduced:Regular expressions (regex crate)Advanced iterator patternsTrait implementationGeneric functionsAdvanced HashMap usageDate/time handling with chrono8. Concurrent File ProcessorWhat you'll build: Process multiple files simultaneously using threads.Rust concepts introduced:Ownership and borrowing in depthThread spawning with std::threadChannel communication (mpsc)Shared state with Arc and MutexThread safety conceptsLifetime annotations9. Simple Web ServerWhat you'll build: A basic HTTP server that serves static files.Rust concepts introduced:TCP sockets and networkingTrait objects and dynamic dispatchAdvanced error handling patternsBox smart pointersPattern matching on complex typesHTTP protocol basics10. Mini Database/Key-Value StoreWhat you'll build: A simple persistent key-value database with basic CRUD operations.Rust concepts introduced:Advanced ownership patternsReference counting with Rc and RefCellBinary serializationFile locking and concurrent accessGeneric programming with traitsAdvanced lifetime managementPerformance optimization conceptsEach project builds upon the previous ones, gradually introducing more complex Rust concepts. Start with the calculator and work your way up—by the time you complete all 10, you'll have a solid foundation in Rust programming and understand most of the language's key features.The progression moves from basic syntax and control flow to advanced topics like concurrency, async programming, and memory management that make Rust unique among systems programming languages.",

You have to read the original code, type in that code and then re-read what you have typed. You also have to be accurate enough to make sure the code actually works, and if it doesn't once again you have to engage your mind to figure out what has gone wrong. That whole process requires you to think about the code. By comparison, copying and pasting takes absolutely no effort and you certainly don't get the same insight as to what code just got added to the file.",

Always solve the problem on paper first.This is slow and tedious and all sorts of difficult at first. Which is why it works.Later on, you can relax this restriction. But if you're able to solve a problem on paper, then you'll learn problem-solving. Programming consists of problem-solving (this step) and encoding the solution in code (the next one), among other things.Copying code does not teach you [problem solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving). It doesn't even teach you the encoding step, though it may help to refresh your memory. Therefore you will not be able to learn how to solve problems, which is at the heart of programming. You likely won't improve much because you haven't practiced the relevant skills.",

If you want to learn web development your best friend is going to be https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/ I personally would stay away from the bloated frameworks like React. Learn to do web development through vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML. Once you start getting to the point that you think to yourself, “surely there is a better way to do this”, you can start looking into things like Sass, HTML templating, etc. Personally, my stack is JS (Fastify), Squirrelly, Scss, MongoDB, and Redis running on linode servers. If you want to learn web development I recommend going down this route. Start to add things on a need to have basis and don’t blindly follow things because it’s the latest trend. Get the fundamentals down first and then explore. It’s a process to learn these things and I am sure you are in no rush to push out a “product”. Best of luck and don’t give up. Just because it doesn’t click immediately doesn’t mean it isn’t possible. Learning to program is a long process and as someone who’s been working in industry for 4 years now with a non-CS degree, this is the path that helped me become a solid developer.",

For instance we could talk about electrons moving between different atoms, or we could ignore the atoms, and abstract even higher and talk about electricity flowing.In a computer we have the software that controls the hardware, decides how the electricity flows, but it is impossible to grasp all the details - most computers have billions of transistors that can turn on and off, so we ignore the details and talk about the CPU storing numbers in memory, and performing mathematical operations on those numbers. Our abstractions steadily climb higher and higher, moving further and further from the \"world just as it is\" with it's particles and whatnot.In programming we talk machine code, binary patterns, on the lowest level, but again we ignore the details and use higher level languages, where creating a variable hides everything that really goes on.

It involves registers (fast pieces of memory living on the CPU), memory, ways to move the data from memory to registers, and to use two registers to do some math or comparison operation (or other operations). You're limited to the actual resources. But you can hide that from the user so they think they have an unlimited number of variables. Behind the scenes, the implementation moves the data between registers and memory giving you the illusion of unlimited variables.Higher levels of abstraction let you think far away from the actual implementation, usually in a mathematical sort of way, and hide the grungy details.

But you guys have no formal school system so you only know how to count but no writing and no ***higher math***. So one day you discovered that it seems like each T-Rex has about 32 teeth. He realized this because you have been keeping them in holes near the camp ground with each hole teeth from one T-Rex. And since you do not write and do not add, every time you go out to trade with other tribes you simply dig up one whole put everything in your dino purse and go. You know it is enough but not how many. But now you know ***through repeating the same thing over and over*** that it is about 32 teeth. So a hole is 32 teeth and you reasoned a dino purse from a hole is 32 teeth, so you decided to count purses in the future and stop worrying about the teeth and the holes. That is abstraction: teeth -> purses.",

It feels like if the problem is too simple, it can’t be right. Next time you face a problem, try forcing yourself to check the obvious stuff first like, “Is it plugged in? Did I miss a semicolon? Did I restart it?” Give yourself a short checklist before diving into the complex stuff. This saves you time and helps train your brain to go from simple > complex instead of the other way around. With practice, you’ll just learn to cut down the wasted time and build confidence in trusting the easy solution first.",

I've been programming as a full stack web developer for over half a decade now, and I'd still call myself \"intermediate at TypeScript\". Recently I've been play with a lot of local, open source AI models, even though I never technically learned Python (and even though I suck at math).My point being: It doesn't matter where you are in your programming journey, you cannot look at it like \"OMG, there's so many things to learn\". There is ALWAYS more to learn. If you spent 100 years learning one thing, you'd die before you learned \"everything about it\". So you need to just accept where you are, and push in a direction that interests you. Maybe you end up being the programmer that \"only designs buttons\" or maybe you become the programmer that \"builds entire operating systems by themself\". But if you look too far ahead in any one direction, all you'll ever see is \"more to learn\". You can't let that deter you.",

Pattern matching *alone* makes me miss it when I use other languages. Interestingly, it's the most \"admired\" but only the 6th most \"desired\" language.As nice as it is, it suffers from limited practicality - I rarely use it outside of toy projects at home, because practical software engineering leverages ecosystems and the Rust ecosystem is still immature. It can interop well enough, but in my experience doing interop with C/C++ and JavaScript (via WebAssembly) maintaining the interop boundary is more painful than just ditching the language entirely for the project.Python is an \"easy\" language to learn - you cover the important programming fundamentals of control flow and abstraction without having to muck around with compiler toolchains, type systems, static guards, etc..., which is awesome. Those are all important things to learn but pretty overwhelming up front.JS has two pretty massive advantages that make it popular in application development, both which come with its ties to web technology: (1) it works on *every single dang device*, and the installation process for web apps is \"click link, load page\" which is delightfully low-friction for devs and users, and (2) it comes with HTML+CSS, which are *incredible* tools for writing UIs.",

        "body": "**JavaScipt** is most used because it is the built in language of the browser, meaning every website more or less has to use JavaScript. Websites make up a huge portion of what people do with computers so that alone gives it a major place. Asides for that you can use JavaScript as a server side language, and because of its role in frontend web dev people have increasingly used it to make the backend of websites also so they can do it all in one language. **Python** is the most commonly used language while dealing with AI, so it’s so surprised to me that with the AI boom of the last few years it’s being treated like that. It’s also an attractive language to new programmers because of its simple and clean syntax, and it’s long been used by data analysts for its ecosystem of data tools. **Rust** is well loved by its fans (myself included) because it has a lot of unique features which are really elegant once you learn to use them. If you’ve never used a language which treats errors as values using Rust’s Result type feels like a whole new way of thinking about effects in programming. Pattern matching on Enums feels so much more elegant than using a switch statement. For me at least it contains so many tools you can use to ensure that “invalid states are unrepresentable” at the type level, which feels so powerful and means that when you code actually compiles it does exactly what you want far more often than in other languages. It’s also just very cool to see a program you write in Rust run 50-100x faster than the same program in Python. Writing Rust can be painful, and it’s often very slow going, because actually getting it to compile is difficult. Rust is the perfect language for places where you need to be really confident in the correctness of your code and also have very high performance, but not if building things with any speed is the priority. But if you already know Java/Kotlin those are both great languages, no reason not to just keep working on those since you already have a head start. Go is also another very popular language these days.",

Additionally, it shows you're able to pick the correct tool for the job, rather than just forcing a less-good language in.I'd be far more interested in hiring someone who knew JS/TS/C and a little bit of Rust/Golang, than the millions of people with JS/Python/PHP.Additionally, for older languages, where there are less people using them, critical infrastructure still relies on them, with a smaller pool of applicants.

That's the only sort of extension / tool that I can think of but those won't necessarily point out things like tight coupling. I think some of them point out large numbers of imports, but for things like sonar, they just have limits on them like \"no more than x imports\". I don't know of a tool that will actively fix them for you though. Some of these scanners have code duplication detection as well, that might be a good indicator of where you can combine things or reorganize.EDIT: after some quick googling, Ndepend and DGML apparently are good tools for scanning.\\>Some way to reduce redundancy where two variables do ALMOST the same thingNot sure I know what you mean here without an example. My initial thought is you could have some base class which does all the common stuff and implement it differently with the variations. Alternately, you could combine the functionality into one class and add an element to said class that chooses whether to do one variation of logic or another based on what that element is.",

        "body": "It depends. First of all, research what is in demand in your area. By rule of thumb,  you'll then have to choose between native and cross platform. Native: either iOs or Android. In my honest and humble opinion,  Android (and jetpack compose in particular), is more pleasant and less nerve wreaking than iOs.Cross platform: welcome to the jungle! Cross or multi platform developer is gaining in popularity,  mainly because management can save a buck. There's so many frameworks available out there, it's difficult to decide,  but here's my 2 cents:- no-no: Qt framework, Xamarin, Ionic, React Native. Developer experience and overall quality is plain bad.- maybe: Kotlin Multi Platform. It's in its early stages,  and rough around the edges, but I see huge potential. - best option: Flutter. For so many reasons, let me know if you want to know more.At the end of the day, they all work in the same way: your code transpiles to cpp and h, and these are compiled vis cmake. Hence,  you may as well create your own. Worth mentioning: mobile development is not just \"the app\", but the release train as well:- github workflows- fastlane- google play, apple dev portal and store connect- certificates and permissions (see in app purchases, keypass auth, etc etc)Let me know if I can help you further. Edit: I forgot to mention something very important,  that will help you succeed as an engineer,  and not just a developer: architecture. Learn as much as possible about that. Most principles con be transferred to backend development,  and even lower level programming. Read other people's code. When you do it for work it's draining, but when it's not is like learning from the masters. I recently dissected Arduino CLI, for instance,  and I discovered a gem of clarity an structure. The world is full of open source code, just clone it and start reading",

I started with \"Basic4Android\" as my main language back then was Visual Basic and Raspberry Pi and Arduino were the cool guys for learning IoT and Bluetooth communication.2015 I learned Android Studio with Java.I tried Xamarin in 2016 just to hate it.In 2017 I learned Apache Cordova.In 2018 I learned React as my all time favorite language is JavaScript just to love it!In 2019 I learned React Native and it became my all time favorite mobile development tool.Fast forward my first job (Q1 2021) I got hired as an Android Kotlin developer (I was a L1/Junior engineer so they taught me for 3 months Kotlin in a paid internship). I actually hated it hahaha. But Kotlin and Native apps were more popular than cross-platforms libraries back then.Now 2025, I'm a L4 mobile app developer with React Native as a lot of companies moved from native code to React Native apps.From my above experience, starting with SPA and Apache Cordoba (or any other hybrid app solution) is a great start to how mobile apps are compiled.From there I would suggest React Native.Learning Kotlin or Swift is a plus, but not mandatory.Also, perhaps a bit of Flutter would be a great too!",

That's not as clear cut.Just store for each lesson the time it was completed at, and then for the \"next\" lesson you can just get the most recently completed with a single query and suggest the next one as long as it's still within the limits of how many there are. If the queries are taking a while, you can consider denormalizing and having a table that is literally just the most recent completion (or the next lession to suggest) so that you can fetch it more quickly.You may also want to consider event sourcing, it's probably more complex to learn/setup the first time, but you can then retroactively apply different display logic after the fact since the events are all available to reconstruct how the currrent state was reached. HOWEVER, if it's your first app I would just go the standard CRUD way first and maybe consider trying to do event sourcing after to compare/contrast the strengths and weaknesses yourself.",

        "body": "Most of the other answers in this thread are wrong.Some people are saying that the addresses are different because forking creates a new address space. That doesn't explain the output because the new address space has new *physical* memory mappings for the same *virtual* address space, and the address you're printing is a virtual address. Userspace programs can't (easily) see physical addresses at all; they only see virtual addresses.Some people are saying this is due to address space randomization. That's wrong because ASLR doesn't change any of the virtual addresses in a forked process. (Doing that would require also updating every existing pointer to point to a different location, which would be super complicated.) The behavior shown in this example will be the same regardless of whether ASLR is on or off.The answer is really simple: **the variables have different addresses because they're different variables**, even though they have the same name. They are defined in different scopes and their lifetimes don't overlap.Your code is exactly the same as if you had defined `a` and `b` in the \"if\" branch, and `c` and `d` in the \"else\" branch. In that case it wouldn't be surprising at all that `a` and `c` have different addresses.More precisely, the variables are *allowed* to have different addresses. The C language compiler and the C language standard make no promises about the actual addresses that are used for different variables. (If you never use the `&` operator to look at a variable's address, it might never have an address at all -- it might be stored entirely in registers.) The actual results you get can depend on things like your compiler's optimization settings.If you change your example to take the address of the *same* variable on both sides of a fork, you'll see that the memory addresses are identical: https://godbolt.org/z/xPvWanz1dBut even though the virtual addresses are the same, the fork causes them to point to different physical mappings. So changes in the parent won't affect the child, or vice versa. (It's slightly more tricky to make an example that demonstrates this, because it requires synchronizing the two processes so that one process tries to read memory *after* the other one writes it.)",

Therefore the contents in parent and child processes are totally different, as in they are in different physical regions in memory (in reality is a little bit more complex, since usually the Copy-On-Write mechanism will be used). Nevertheless, even if you were using InterProcess (IPC) shared memory, where the underlying physical memory would be the same for both processes, they would still have different virtual addresses, since in general mmap won't map to the same virtual addresses the underlying physical memory region on both processes (unless explicitly requested to mmap to the same specific virtual addresses on both processes).",

Example: we have two arrays array[x,y] and array[index,number] the [index,number] array is what we use to determine where our number is located based on the index we assign in that one. So it's two arrays of tuples basically. Now we just take the two numbers we want to get the time to traverse between from the [index,number] array, use the index from that tuple we defined to then get its coordinate by getting the element in the [x,y] located at said index and subtract the x1 from x2 and etc like i stated before and then divide by 2 and round up.I think this scales for any size that's the same size for the column and rows but idk",

Since, you're given the numbers in an array, you could consider it like this:Gr[0] -> Gr[1] = 1sGr[0] -> Gr[2] = 2sGr[0] -> Gr[3] = 1sGr[1] -> Gr[2] = 1sYou can quickly see that this turns into a graph composition style problem and this graph is also fully connected.

You **can** do machine learning in any language, **but** Python is a really common interface language, **but** the actual computation behind the scenes is normally written in something like C.The real answer is: Python is a good choice of language for beginners and it has a lot of machine learning support. After that, if your future employer wants you to use something else or your future projects require you to use something else, then be open to it. Most programming languages have similarish fundamentals anyway, so it's not time wasted - it's just adding tools to your toolkit, and once you've learnt how to use one, others will come more easily.

You are a beginner so its good to get experience with different tools or programing languages(obviously in the future you can specialize). Its good you have these interests and you should stick with them since that makes learning fun.1. Seeing as you like Python and want a good structured course, I would say start [CS50p on EDx](https://www.edx.org/learn/python/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-programming-with-python). It is free, asynchronous, and you get to practice Python by solving problem sets at your own pace. The class is run by Harvard(no need to apply) with a great professor and its basically the online version of the actual class. Its beginner friendly and I highly recommend this if you want to learn more about Python. I did this course before going to college and felt it aligned well with what I learned in my Python class(make sense since CS50 is also a college level class).2. Harvard has other course under \"CS50\" like one for AI, web dev, cyber security, etc that you can do after you get more familiar with coding. These are also free and you can check them out here: [https://www.edx.org/bio/david-j-malan](https://www.edx.org/bio/david-j-malan)3. You also say your like web dev so I definitely suggest checking out [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)(also free). This one more self learning you need to read about each topic on your own, but the content is curated(I am doing this and like the resources they provide so far). As for content the course goes over HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and in the advanced course more web dev tools like node.js or ruby(there are 2 advanced courses, choose a path you like).4. You can stick with the FreeCodeCamp course as well, that is a good course and you should keep doing it. As you said \"like it better as there is more involvement and actual coding\" this is great that you get to do more hands on stuff.5. W3 schools is alright, you are definitely right to think the problem is you are just reading but are not applying any of the things you learn. As many people have said you learn by doing aka projects even if they are small or simple. The important part is you thought about what to type out and learned something during the process.",

        "body": "# CS50p:Yes good hands on problems to solve, though they are not projects this course still offers a good foundation to expand and cement your Python skills(epically since you are interested in machine learning). To explain, CS50p will cover these topics week by week for 10 weeks aka 10 online lectures:1. functions,2. variables,3. conditionals,4. loops,5. exceptions cases,6. using libraries,7. unit tests file I/O,8. regular expression,9. Object-Oriented Programming & classes,10. recursion.This is more about applying little programming technique week by week. Each week has a few problems to solve using and expanding on the skills you learned up to that point. These of course are not full projects, but still very good practice to learn skills in a controlled and friendly environment. They test problem solving skills as well which never hurts.# The Odin Project:This has excellent projects and to clarify The Odin Project is for front end and back end. It has an introduction course teaching HTML, CSS, and Java Script. Then you can choose to learn ruby or node.js or both and these advanced course are at least 5-8x longer than the introduction course so plenty to learn.The structure is:* You basically read a few curated lessons and external resources* Make a project which is a website such as: * Basic HTML page * Landing page with styling * Making web page games or interactive pages after learning Java Script * Even more advanced pages after learning more tools* This cycle of reading and making projects repeats itself. They have a discord to help you if you get stuck, but the course is pretty detailed/clear. Essentially there are many chances to make projects and if you feel comfortable you can make your own outside of the course.This is heavily project based as you are given a general goal when you reach a project assignment. Other than that you just make your own website following the general theme or requirements. This is also self graded but with web dev its pretty easy to see how well you did by viewing your website based on content, design, and functionality. You also get to learn about version control through Git and Git Hub. This is great since now you projects will be on a repository that you can make public or private as you wish. Furthermore you can actually see your website live and deploy it. For the beginner course they just make these websites hosted on Git Hub, but in the advanced course they show others ways of hosting and using more advanced tools.If you have more questions feel free to ask!",

Keep your school stuff in private repos that only you, collaborators assigned by your professors, and maybe your professors, have access to. Using git and GitHub in school will definitely give you a leg up in professional settings (I met seniors who still had no idea how to do basic git stuff). Tho... I'm pretty certain GitHub is using private repos to train Copilot and other LLMs... So who even knows anymore. When in doubt, check with your school's department head or close enough to get the info you need on the matter",

Your variables give you the location of the \\*start\\* of the data structure, but you have to be aware of how big they are, or where the \\*end\\* of the data structures are.This is particularly important when dealing with arrays. The line: char buffer[MAXSIZE];is telling the compiler, \"reserve a chunk of memory as big as sizeof(char) \\* MAXSIZE in the stack frame of this function\". There is NO PROTECTION to make sure you stay inside your MAXSIZE-sized buffer; if you ask the compiler to do this: buffer[MAXSIZE + 5] = 'x';it will happily do that. which will, of course, go stomping on some other variable in your function's stack, or off into unallocated memory, or who knows what. You are responsible for always being aware of where the end of your fixed size buffers are, and always checking your offsets (or pointers, if you go that way) to make sure you are still in bounds. This is, of course, a pain, and much of the discipline of working with C is about finding easy to manage and easy to maintain ways of dealing with such data structures.I compiled your program and fed it a 5000-byte input, and it segfaulted immediately.

From there, you can move on to Android or Kotlin Multiplatform. With Kotlin, you can even build a backend using Spring Boot for your apps—which is something I’ve done myself—or use it for other projects.If you choose Flutter, keep in mind that (as far as I know) Dart is mostly used just for Flutter. Another option is to learn JavaScript with React and so on, but I personally haven’t worked with it.For me, for the reasons mentioned above, Kotlin turned out to be the best fit. On top of that, the language itself is very convenient. Sometimes I even built servers in Kotlin for my Unity games.",

        "body": "I personally can't speak to mobile development, but if you're looking to get into web development, you pretty much *have* to learn JavaScript. If you're working on any sort of UI application (website/webapp), you'll want to check out a framework/library and do some tutorials. Most of my personal experience is in React, but others like Vue or Elm. I often recommend egghead.io for beginner JS tutorials (I highly recommend [Kent C. Dodds' beginner React course](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react))If you're looking for backend/server-side development, everyone has their own opinions, but generally speaking, you can't really go wrong with Java, Go, or NodeJS (also JavaScript). You could also look into .NET, since you have C# experience. As far as where to start, I like to recommend thinking of a simple app idea (the classic example is a To-do List) and just try piecing it out into bite-sized tasks and plucking away until you have it working. Once you have it working, try and see if you can break it. Enter unexpected characters into an input, put in emojis, try to paste text, try to paste an image. Try to figure out where your code comes up short and then try to fix those issues until you have a solidly working application. Have fun and best of luck!",

Unions don't prevent things like offshoring and very likely change the calculus toward offshoring as it becomes more of a pita to deal with the union. They won't protect against automation. You can put baricades to people being fired but I've seen the real life consequences of that where you have people that do nothing and still cant be fired for ages which is not conducive to having high performing, efficient teams. Pay? There is a reason that other than guaranteeing minimum pay, continuing insurance on injury etc, sports unions have nothing to do with negotiating pay. The whole point of unions is that everyone gets paid \"fairly\" which usually means the same for given seniority. The groups where unions have made a significant difference in pay like nurses for instance, had extreme leverage (a lack of even remedially qualified replacements, and the requirement that duties are performed onsite). Unions just arent a great fit for tech jobs, especially with the increased ease of offshoring.",

Cloud is where things are a bit harder go learn but theres free tiers, just gotta make sure you dont do silly things and end up blowing past the free tier limits. In AWS land I would try to build some demo apps leveraging some of the core AWS services like S3, SQS, EC2.I wouldnt expect a newgrad to be an expert in any of these but any experience would surely be valuable.I highly recommend reading docs on the design and architecture of these systems, that is to me more valuable than learning some APIs. If you understand how Kafka works and when to use it, why it gives you the guarantees that it gives you and so on, that will make you a valuable member of the team from day one.Good luck!",

Doing that successfully will already bring you close to the actually knowledgeable people in the team and management will start to notice that you actually understand/are engaging to understand the business instead of just technical parts of it. This is how you build your reputation and are considered a valuable resource.Then shift into first phase of your real agenda of automation on a drip. Don't make a big splash. Get the minimum creds to do the minimum automation. Make sure to make your boss look good in the process - ALWAYS. Ensure that you are the key person in the automated workflow. Now you are important enough that you are being included in the mid level or even senior level meetings. Stay the course for another year and keep showing results. By now you also have idea of the political camps and power structure. Be balanced politically but start to identify potential allies and adversaries.Now that you have managements ear, switch into the final phase. Get the big players on your side. Show them how much they get to gain by supporting your vision. Because you are ready to fill the big shoes. This is the most political phase and most dangerous. But if you have the main players supporting you, you should be able to wrestle the rest of the keys. By now you have all the knowledge so gate keeping is not possible. You have built a cred and since you made your boss look good, he suddenly can't start to shit on you. The people who he will go to are on your side already because they see their own gain. From here on, it is a balance of pure execution and marketing. This is the endgame, don't screw it up.Or, forget about all this and find another job you like.",

Companies get richer as a consequence of that... sure... but that's not why we're paying for our education. We're paying for our education because we want a job. That's it.But at the same time, a lot of companies do have tuition reimbursement programs. Places like Target, Walmart, etc offer full tuition reimbursement to their employees. The idea being an \"unskilled\" minimum wage employee that gets their education paid for will stay at the company, but move into corporate/leadership roles that require an education.So what you're describing already happens. But, an important part of that whole concept is you need to be an employee *before* you get tuition reimbursement. No company is just gonna pay for a random person's college. But a lot of them will pay for someone's college that is already a trusted employee, with the hopes that it builds a level of trust/loyalty and grows their employees internally.The whole idea of graduating high school, and immediately going to college, and immediately starting your career in a job that requires a degree is just one way to enter the industry. If you choose that path, you're paying for your college. That's your choice. But if you choose an alternative path, where you put in your time at a place like Target, you can have your college paid for. For whatever reason a lot of people don't like that path though.",

        "body": "> It's also pretty easy to create a practical coding test in gitpod, and then do point-based scoring. But most managers never thought of that, nor attempted to do so. They take the easy way out. I had an interview just like this a month ago, it was interesting.I'm too late to the party, but here are my few comments. I am tipsy.I have been an occasional hiring manager/tech interviewer for last 15 years in companies of various sizes. From nough startups to couple of billions in current account. Disclaimer - I mostly mostly work in highly regulated backend area (gambling/fintech) as a senior/staff/principal.* In organisation of any size hiring manager has way less input into how we evaluate candidates than you would think. From the company perspective your CV requires at least a screening meeting (internal), chat with HR (yes, candidate looks promising!) and time slots from at least 2 seniors for at least 2 different meetings + EM meeting (position fit) + executive meeting (culture/ambitions fit).* * We cannot spend time on every single candidate. You really are asked to stand out to proceed, cost of hiring you approaches $100k in time commitment from everyone involved + another $100k for your onboarding. I must apologise, but that is what our in-house recruiters are responsible for.* Good companies do domain specific take home assignment with known gotchas (e.g. rounding issues, how to handle various dimensions depending on domain, performance considerations, ability to join two tables to start with, not even talking about various consistency scenarios). Yes, it sounds like unpaid work, but it is a fantastic filter between those that have a clue and those that copy paste from stack overflow. We are about to invest 12 months in you getting up to speed, we ask for 4-8 hours of you showing off your skills.* * These assignments usually are crafted with great care by rather highly paid engineers in the org. There can only be so many of them prepared, check glassdoor, it usually will spell out what you need to succeed.* LC is a good screener for 99% of candidates that couldn't code their way out of looking up data from users table. Anyone who displays awareness of constraints, different naming nomenclatures, jeez (here comes the dragons) - time zones ... or even utf8mb4 v utf8mb3... automatically a plus.* Always remember that we WANT TO HIRE YOU! Seriously! We wouldn't be hiring otherwise! What seems to be a field of obstacles is not meant to discourage you, but to make sure you get a face time with your peers whose opinion will really count. Please accept that if my week is 40 hours and every day i have 2 hours blocked for hiring (with 15 minutes before each meeting to research candidate background, 15 minutes afterwards to summarize my notes and provide feedback all while actually moving business forward...) Executive or EM discussion fail can very easily be overriden if 2 actual team members says \"5 stars, he/she/they will fit GREAT\".* Candidates should and will be treated equally. Ignoring cases where candidate had a nervous breakdown during interview (has happened, more than once. it's not a showstopper, it's a stop-the-interview and reschedule to start from tabula rasa. One of the few things big tech gets right is to dismiss outlier incidents), we do need to show that we care about results, not about gender, race, etc. And we are pretty objective about it. Except positive bias.---As for your specific comment that most managers are bad. I used to think the same until I became an engineering manager. There's so fucking much politics and shoulder playing between teams and horse trading to just move ahead with the project that is our job to shield you from.Yes, you think your ticket with specification and acceptance criteria is done and easy and you can just proceed. 50% of the time that feature is actually under a chopping axe because someone else in the company wants to take eventual credit for it / is unable to formulate where their API points are expected to be / knows that you are doing null work that will be discarded because corporate strategy has separate team working on replacement. Sucks, but not due to you and not due to your EM.",

        "body": "Hard disagree as someone who is currently an IC, has been a manager, and in both roles have conducted quite a few interviews. I conducted over a dozen last month.For the record, our interviews include some discussion with the candidate on their experience, a leetcode type question, and some system design. The leetcode question is not meant to be difficult, and we use something that is classified as easy or homegrown stuff that is similarly quite easy. One question we often use, for example, has a very trivial n^2 solution (literally try every pair of values and make sure the index of j is after i).When I am conducting interviews everything matters. It's not just a black and white do you solve the question and I check off the box. Here's a list of some things that I am looking at to make a decision that aren't just * How quickly do you start solving and how quickly do you solve it? Does it look like you've seen the question before? Does it look like someone else or AI is solving the question for you?* How well can you articulate what your solution is and how it works? Do you articulate what your approach to the question is before you write code or after?* If you run into problems, what do you do for debugging? Are you reading the error logs? Are you printing things to see?* If you are struggling with the question, do you ask questions? What kind of questions do you ask? How long does it take for you to ask a question when you're stuck?* Our question has one common pitfall (which is honestly quite obvious). Do you fall for this? If you do, when I explain what is happening, can you pick up on where you fell into that pitfall? Do I have to explain it very explicitly or can you pick it up?* Can you even code? Do you run into basic syntax problems? Do you know what help to ask me for on the syntax issues? Does it look like you barely even know how to code?* Are you cognizant of the time we have and what our expectations are?* I specifically ask the candidate two follow up questions every time the answer is solved: what is the runtime complexity and is your solution optimal. This helps me figure out what kind of more formal education the person has (because all of us remember studying big O notation, right?). This also helps me figure out if they're capable of scrutinizing their own code. It also helps me see how they tackle a problem that may not have an obvious answer (or even one at all).Don't conduct an interview with a question that doesn't have a purpose. In fact, don't do things that don't have at least half a dozen purposes. Everything I do has a purpose and helps me evaluate it. I have absolutely no problem letting you sit in silence for 10 minutes as you mumble to yourself about your solution, it will help me see how you think. Heck, if you want to sit there in silence and write no code and ask zero questions it will show me how collaborative you want to be (and I explicitly mention they're welcome to ask me questions, even to ask for help). I very intentionally do not use difficult questions because I very intentionally want to measure other things. I could care less if you remember how to invert a binary tree or the difference between Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms or any of that mumbo jumbo that, as you point out, will never be useful on the job. I do care if you can reason your way through something new and present a working solution, even if it means asking someone for help.",

Yes tech leads are the people SWE's work closest with, but they're not people managers at the end of the day. If they call them, they're going to ask a lot of manager-oriented questions... probably including directly asking \"Were you X's direct manager?\" In which case your tech lead would need to both be comfortable lying for you, and good at lying.Definitely don't ask someone for a reference that you don't know for a fact would give you a positive reference.

And I have done 3 several times in the past.The fact I don't keep in touch and grab beers with my ex-managers doesn't mean our professional relationship disintegrates.

Why would they feel any differently?My last job search I used a manager from 2 companies ago that I hadn't spoken a word to in 3 years. He was thrilled to give me a reference. We had a great working relationship. We don't keep in touch because we have different jobs now, our own families, our own friends... but our professional connection is still there.The job search before that I reached out to a manager I haven't spoken to in 2 years.

You don’t have to stress about learning the latest web technologies3. While there might not be as many jobs available, you’re also competing with a lot less people too (multiple orders of magnitude less). The pool of talent is also getting smaller (and older)4. Your coworkers may be on the older side. That can be good for a mentorship, but also it can be hard to change some of their ways5. You may end up working with much older technology. Which is cool, but also a pain at times. Don’t ever be worried about feeling out of date honestly6.

Each of those are supported by the standard docker images we need to use.For our last project, my team was pretty junior, so we picked Java since a couple people knew it for a few services, and python for another. I've written production code in several languages, mostly Haskell, with a little Python, Rails, and Typescript, and I find SpringBoot really efficient. It's the type of framework where good practices are a pit that you basically fall into by doing things the conventional way. Lots of people rail on Java, espeically the Haskell programmers and the Rust community, but a language like Haskell is a major pain to set up, since there's a million ways to do things, and even though there are plenty of libraries, each has like 5-10 stars on github. Even with Rust, it's not worth it to spend your time on such complexity, when the benefit of better speed or type safety can be mitigated in other ways.",

So they needed *something*. Hybrid really started becoming popular leading up to the pandemic because of that. It was how they were able to compete in the talent war.Those are the companies I expect to continue being hybrid/remote into the future. The ones that *need* it to attract and keep talent. The companies that have lots of money to throw around, or are a household name, probably won't.

That time is golden because you still have a job, so in the future if it happens again take the initiative to immediately interview. Never ever wait to start interviewing.In some companies you might be able to survive a PIP but from what I've seen it's like a lottery. I know someone wins the lottery but I've never actually seen anyone win it - and I've never seen anyone survive a PIP in the industry. The PIP is the company being nice and giving you a heads up that you're fired. Take the hint.Second, absolutely don't discuss the PIP in future interviews. I don't care what you say but don't say that. It would be better to say you got into a fist fight over text editors rather than you got let go because of a PIP. Personally if they ask I would say that unfortunately they shrunk the team size. Think like a politician.Your first gig is the hardest to get! You've got experience now get that next gig.

If a company outright lays you off and hires someone else to fill your position without offering it back to you, you could have a case against them. A PIP is their way to get rid of you and not have to hire you back.You don't have to explain to future companies that you were on a PIP.

I am convinced that \"this market\" is the way it is because of companies being shitty like this rather than because of natural \"market forces.\" Leadership turmoil is absolutely everywhere and for example in my last two positions, the head of engineering was fired within a few months of joining both times. To me it's dumbassery and not some vague idea of a market.The thing with playing leadership Russian roulette is that it creates chaos, and company culture ends up in flux, and you simply don't know what company you're really joining. The company may not resemble the one you heard about in interviews simply because they cleaned out the leadership either during your application process or early in your job there. It's frustrating and it can practically nullify your \"reverse interview\" efforts.I would say this is a red flag for the company and you should think long and hard about working there.

On the other hand, imo getting some random job doesn't really add value to your resume except removing that unemployment gap.Another thing you could do is work for a local business. This could be tough and depends on your luck, the area, and if they are willing to take a risk. I did this route and was paid pennies lmao. But it gave me talking points during interviews and helped me embellish my resume. This is definitely better than putting some random job to prevent resume gap.Overall, I don't know how recent your grad graduated but for like the first 6 months or so, my suggestion is to keep on practicing for interviews and try to be the first few applicants and apply asap to new grad roles, tdp roles, and other rotational programs and hope that ATS doesn't screen his resume out. Then, all he has to do is not fuck up the interviews which is basically leetcode and behavioral like I did and he's in.If that doesn't work out, then I think you really have to consider either masters or find other job like I did.Hope this helps",

Have them optimize their resume a bit more with what they already have, like school projects and any potential club experiences, and also do interview prep so if they get interviews they will be able to make it through.Also tell them to treat applying/making themselves marketable to be a full time job (1-2 hours a day applying, 1-2 hours a day leetcode/interview prep, 4 hours a day working on a marketable startup idea or open source content).",

Wellness fund to spend on fitness/learning. 401k matches, most general holiday schedule ive seen (yea random holidays we get a day off where other companies are working), unlimited pto with no need for request unless out for 3 weeks.Comp: im not a SWE (I work on ML so we get paid on a different scale) so can’t comment too much. But i think we are FAANG level or better. On levels fyi we are consistently ranked top 10-30 most well paid companies. It’s very front loaded stock vest so first year or two will absolutely beat equivalent of google/meta/whatever, but it may cliff fast later on if you don’t perform well. So do well on performance reviews or try to get promo is your best bet to keep refreshers high.Company: We are founded by ex google engineers and we are a tech first company meaning we pride ourselves in extremely innovative algorithms, scalable infra, SOTA ML (we publish a lot in top ml research conferences for a company our size). We are fundamentally different from other companies of similar or bigger size (e.g. etsy, ebay, etc) which do not care as much about their tech.Leadership: can’t comment on details. We are founded by ex googlers, but cofounder left the company recent years. Now VPs and C Suite (CEO is ex Google shopping VP) is all ex google burecrates who are more wallstreet persona supposedly. Not sure if its a good or bad thing but certainly still trying to expand/grow. We are more of a visual search and recommendation system for inspiration expanding into e-commerce and etc but new initiatives are being explored (or is it just wallstreet milking us? We never know)But like others said: we are very hard to get an offer from (i feel like we are more picku than google sometimes). We mostly only hire ex faangs or equivalent. Even ex faangs get denied without interviews all the time. So try to get into the loop first and dont set expectations too high",

People with impostor syndrome always downplay their achievements and layer it with nuances of why its not perfect etc. That will end up biting you. If you're not content with something, it gives everyone else an excuse to not be happy with it. Learn to be proud of your achievements.If this doesn't vibe with you, my biggest advice is just leave big tech. There are many types of organizations that are much suited for your personality and you just need to find the right fit. If you can't find something that fits you, then you'd have to change yourself to fit it. The latter has always been a challenge in my 20 year career as well.",

I wouldn't progress a candidate forward that did this.

I'm not passing that person. \"Correct\" answer or not.I've passed plenty of people that did really good on communicating during the solving process, but didn't quite get the right solution, or got the naive solution. It's the solving process I'm paying attention to the most.The knowledge section doesn't really jump out as suspicious to me... that sounds about right. When I'm not in interviewing shape, I usually can't just rattle off SOLID despite using its concepts daily. But when I'm interviewing, you can bet your ass I can rattle off a textbook definition of SOLID, because I prepare.During the knowledge section do you have a script you need to stick to? Couldn't you dig into asking for some examples, or to explain why they think that's the right answer, or explain alternatives? Ideally you want ways to gauge understanding beyond reading off a textbook answer, because memorizing SOLID is trivial.

Go to job fairs, conferences, reach out to people on LinkedIn (I barf saying that but it helps), reach out to prev uni teachers, etc.Last thing I’ll add, is that looking for a six figure salary job is also gonna make it super difficulty. Engineers are everywhere now in a super saturated market bc we’ve all been fed the same story of engineers being needed and it paying well for 20 years. If you can find a decent salary even if it’s below what a “entry level engineer” should make, don’t be afraid to still apply. It sucks but it’s how you get experience and the potential to move up.",

This is a very valuable experience. Part of being experienced is having an intuition about what wouldn't work, or what would come back and bite you in future. Now you know what'd happen if you let the codebase deteriorate. It's very likely that other developers are not happy with the codebase either so I'd suggest getting other people onboard with a refactoring effort starting with creating a decent test suite to give you confidence to refactor. As much as I hate the hype, AI is amazing when comes to disecting/explaining the code and writing tests. And if you manage to do this, you'd have a HUGE success story.I'm yet to met someone who's happy with their codebase tbh.",

They explain to me that the department I was going into had been totally nuked as of a week or two ago. However, as I had not been told and had technically started work at 9am, they couldn't rescind my offer but as I had not been assigned any tasks, I was in a grey area. They therefore said the best way to deal with it was to dismiss me as an employee effective immediately and in lieu of notice, they would pay me a month's salary + £1000. By 09:06, I was outside the door and walking back to my car.In short, I had about £3400 deposited into my bank account after that little caper, post tax. I mean, £34k per hour isn't a bad rate I think you'll agree. It's a shame it took me near 2-3 months to find another job and the previous job wouldn't hire me back. This was around 2007 or so. I remember as it caused me a huge arse ache of a problem with HMRC who couldn't understand what I was saying and kept putting me into the higher rate of tax with vague assurances that I would \"get it back in April\"... yeah... mortgage is due now though.

Worst case usually is they will just forget about you, and sometimes they'll even wish you well and be friendly the next time you cross paths. That's what I've seen, anyway, but maybe I've been lucky with the places I've worked. I'd say it's a bigger issue on your resume, where if you have a 6-month stint somewhere you had better follow it up with a few years at the next place, or someone hiring will think it's a red flag.",

An anecdote from when I'm started that I'm reminded of when I started. We had one junior (there were six of us) that had this \"don't worry it's just java web development, it's easy.\" Some of us were struggling hard and hearing this actually made one of the devs switch to a QA position.

That said, there's things you can do that will help.Break your team's responsibilities down into pillars or silos of knowledge (your manager can help with what your team specifically works on). Usually, it's these:* Infrastructure/Networking* Application Orchestration* Observability* Internal ToolsTo start, pick one to go deep into, and develop a passable understanding of the rest. You will accumulate a deeper understanding of everything over time, and gain an instinct for what you should understand (principles) and what you can discard (bitrotting technical details). Work with your manager to get projects in the specific pillar you want to gain expertise in if possible. If that's not possible, pick something else for now and come back to it.When you're working on stuff, take notes on things that you learn that could be helpful in the future. Do personal retros on particular projects/tasks that you struggled with and try to internalize the knowledge that you gained. This takes a lot of effort, and some of it may come after hours. That's why DevOps/SRE tends to get paid more though, so...swings and roundabouts.Total honesty here: people will tell you that you don't need to be a hardcore techie to be successful, but if we define \"hardcore techie\" as \"someone who is really into understanding why systems behave the way that they do and is not content with just a surface-level understanding\", then not being one is absolutely career limiting in DevOps/SRE. Because of how fast the tech moves in the infrastructure space (while simultaneously breaking in ways that require an understanding of the underlying primitives - like Linux Networking), hunger and curiosity is a requirement. If I had to add another thing, it would be a deep appreciation for rigorous and disciplined engineering.All that is to say - the amount of stuff to learn should bring you joy, not stress. If all it does is stress you out, it might be best to find a regular SWE job.",

Not every company has a microservice architecture where you can choose to simply write a new feature in Go.On the other hand a lot of what would formerly be written in Java if the project is greenfield Go is becoming very popular. I've worked at two places now that concurrently supported services written in either Java or Go. The benefits of Go are pretty obvious since you don't need to allocate a giant arena for the JVM so cloud costs can usually get reduced using it. So its become more attractive in that sphere. If your company runs on bare metal that benefit doesn't really hold true.So basically I'd say if you're looking to get a job in the near term Java is still the safer bet but I only see Go's usage increasing as time goes on. Luckily Go is a fairly tiny language (which honestly gets people in trouble because they become expert beginners in it very quickly) so its pretty quick to learn. You just need to learn some of the idioms of the language. Though I typically don't really hammer people on the language during interviews anyways. I can pretty quickly get a Java dev up to speed on how to write proper Go.",

Your team didn't get more work or anything, and they weren't looking to hire another person to begin with.But if there's an open role internally that you get *promoted into*, then yeah a lot of the times the role you just left gets backfilled. The team still has an empty seat, you getting promoted just changed the title that's on that seat. It still needs to be filled at the end of the day.",

The job wasn't really an SWE position either, was some kind of weird support gig that was supposed to lead to one.Second layoff was June 2018, after several hops and it was the first startup I ever worked for. Landed my next job exactly a month after being laid off, like to the day. Got back into SWE full time in 2012 so at this point I had about 6 years of experience. The full interview process took about 2 weeks.Third layoff was in February 2023 and also only took about a month. VP told a bunch of us about a colleague of his that was hiring, I recognized the name as a recruiter I connected with at a conference about five years earlier. Pinged the recruiter on LinkedIn and got in the mix quickly. This one took about 1.5 to 2 weeks.Fourth layoff was October 2024, and it took about a month to land my current gig. Went to a local user group meeting I hadn't been to in a couple years, which was having its first meeting in the offices of the place I now work for, also their last meeting of the year. One of their staff engineers was present and ended up sitting next to me. Struck up a brief conversation with him, we connected via LinkedIn, and I sent him my resume the following Monday. Took about two weeks from submitting my resume to getting the offer.",

A lot of comp growth is base on stock price -> Meta is currently at $700+ which feels high. Is it going to go up more? You decide 3. Promotions aren't guaranteed. IC3->IC4 promotion should happen unless your manager fucks up (which can actually happen longer than you can be IC3) and you could just be hosed. IC4 -> IC5 is increasingly dependent on the politics around you, in ways that surprise me. 4. It's frankly a changing landscape. A lot of ye olden success stories at Meta aren't realistic anymore, layoffs seem like they're coming, and the bar is moving. I wouldn't overindex on past success IMC probably fires a bunch, but there's no shame in that",

You are within your rights to be annoyed, and your leverage is the fact that you can look for a different job. If the tasks are sufficiently different from the job req, you might be able to collect unemployment if you leave the job, but I am neither a lawyer or expert in these laws.If you want to bring this up to your manager in a professional way, you should acknowledge the assignments, assure him that you intend to perform your assigned duties to the best of your ability, but then directly tell him you are dissatisfied with this type of work and it does not match the expectations you had when taking the job. As long as you continue to do your tasks well, a good manager shouldn’t hold it against you if you express dissatisfaction. That being said, they might take this as an implicit threat to leave the role as soon as you find something better. Think carefully about what leverage you have and what other options you have. If you are a high performer and aren’t too worried about finding another job, you have a lot of leverage, and you could even consider making your intentions to seek another job explicit. If one or the other of those things is not true, then you don’t have much leverage, and I wouldn’t expect your manager to change anything.",

He then put me on software tasks (in addition to lesser procurement)But this is more difficult as it looks to be full time. You might want to print out the offer letter (and JD) that says you'd be working with C++, Comp. Vision, AI etc. Talk 1-on-1 with your manager about how this is not what you signed up for. It sounds like they have trouble finding integrators.

A backgrounder on what maybe going on. I am sure given they were onboarding you in that position that the intent was to keep you there. A couple things could have happened. I don't have all the details on your particular situation but generically it can be: (1) they really need someone to do the hardware/software integration and you're the new guy so you get to do it or (2) your performance may not be what they were looking for and they're trying you in this role because it's easier & a lot less expensive to reassign vs terminating. Yeah, the second one stings and is a shitty move for the person affected. But it happens and that's often the rationale. I hired someone for a front end UI development job - had stellar references, had really good work in his portfolio, passed our coding exam - and their code quality in the first 90 days was really, really bad. Like do over with the help of a senior developer bad. IDK where we messed up in catching this but after a particularly disastrous demo with my co-founder and our sales team, we had to figure something out. He was a good guy and tried hard and asked for help. We didn't want to just fire this guy 90 days later. So we gave him very small features and a lot of customer support and operations which we needed (and were about to open a role for). The big difference here is that I and my VP of Engineering had a call and explained why were making the role change. He was disappointed but okay with it. I think the big one here is your manager didn't have the stones to tell you why. I bet if he did, you still might be pissed or wanting to leave but at least you'd know. Also, politically, this manager may have been told to fill that software integrator immediately by higher ups. Maybe sales is pissy because the integration isn't done or it doesn't work or whatever. He may not have had a choice. This is pretty common and may be a reason why he didn't want to tell you. Or he's a jerk or a coward. Here's what you may want to consider: 1. Have a conversation with your manager. Be friendly and open. Do not go in there loaded for bear about the job switch and presenting any kind of threat that you're going to leave. You don't have leverage. The manager could call your bluff and you're out a job. Just ask them \"hey, curious why the job role change? Is there a problem?\" And if you can hold your nose and do it, you can say something like \"I get it I'm helping out and I'd really like to get back to my other work. Can you give me an ETA or some idea of when that will happen?\". Do not mention the other job openings, etc, etc - you're going to set yourself up for a fight that now your manager is going to feel like they have to win. 2. If you don't like the answer, vote with your feet. Start looking for a new job immediately. Do a good job at your current role, keep quiet, and get out. I think you've already seen enough signs that this isn't a good company or manager to work for. These things tend not to get better. 3. If your manager gives you a legit reason like \"upper management needs this role filed and you were the new guy/best choice\" or \"we need someone to cover this for 6 months\" then again you'll need to evaluate. You \\*might\\* get to back to your own role but I'll tell you that if you're filling a gap, people aren't going to want to move you. Good luck and happy to DM if you any questions.",

Then they put me on PIP.. so my loyalty quickly vanished and I began filing applications right away.. so been primarily focused on training the team since I wont be here much longer.Ironically, my employer caught wind of me being in the job search and talked with me about how \"They dont want to replace me\" and how \"valuable\" I am, obviously worried about losing their key technical asset.

It's hard to say where they will be 10 years from now but I think focusing on automation in general rather than any one specific technology or tool is a pretty safe bet. Obviously you have to start with just one tool, but try to grow from there. I got started with a no name consulting company that did nothing but RPA and at the time was strictly BluePrism. Lousy pay and a ton of travel (yes, that is a bad thing), but I got a lot of very high quality experience very quickly. With 7 years experience, I'm a lead dev at an oil and gas megacorp you have heard of. So it has paid off in the long run (so far at least). Incidentally, we will be hiring a few more senior RPA developers in the near future, but obviously someone starting just now won't make the cut.",

        "body": "Tech skills transfer to many fields that value analytical thinking and problem-solving. Technical writing, product management, business analysis, project management, and sales engineering all leverage your tech background while moving away from pure development work.Data analysis roles in non-tech industries like healthcare, finance, or logistics often need people who understand both technology and domain-specific problems. Your programming background makes you valuable for automating processes or building internal tools.Teaching or training - bootcamps, corporate training programs, or educational content creation - let you use your technical knowledge to help others learn. Many former developers transition into developer relations, technical recruiting, or consulting roles.The current tech job market difficulties don't necessarily mean the entire industry is collapsing. Many experienced developers are finding opportunities, just with longer search times and more competition than previous years.Before pivoting completely, consider whether you're dealing with temporary market conditions or genuine disinterest in technical work. The job search frustration might be influencing your desire to leave the field entirely.Non-tech pivots often require starting over salary-wise and building new professional networks. The grass isn't necessarily greener in other industries, many of which have their own challenges with job security and advancement.If you do pivot, choose something that genuinely interests you rather than just escaping current difficulties. Career changes work better when driven by positive attraction to new opportunities rather than just running away from current problems.",

Both videos had wildly positive comments thanking the creators for teaching them.I recommend:* The Alex Xu book, just to get a sense of the concepts* Hello Interview articles (I find the videos aren't as helpful)* Kevin Fang's incident videos (not too informative but more fun)* Thinking defensively about failure modes in each part of your system* Remembering that everything is a tradeoff (<- magic word that interviewers love)",

You should use the STAR method as a framework without being too robotic of formulaic. It’s still a conversation. Also, it’s okay to shorten examples based on time; make sure to acknowledge the clock and be respectful of people’s time. For the question above you can do something like, “When I have a disagreement with someone I do [X]. I approach it this way because [X]. An example of me having a disagreement with someone is [X]. The outcome of [X] was [X] which I felt [X] way about because of [X].” Another approach maybe “I had a disagreement with [X] about [X] when working on this project. My approach to resolving it was [X] because [X]. The outcome was [X] which I felt [X] way about. I would do [X] differently in the future because of [X]” Obviously I’m being very general here. Find a format/style that fits you and your regular speaking cadence; but yes, even if brief, you should mention examples of when you came into this scenario they’re asking about. If they ask about a scenario you’ve never experienced you can say something like “I’ve actually not experienced [X] but here’s what I would do based on a similar [X] experience I had.” Show you’re flexible, adaptable and have learned from previous experiences.

For those examples you listed like \"What do you do when you have a disagreement\" - you can absolutely start with your general approach and then back it up with a concrete example. That's actually stronger than just giving a theoretical answer because it shows you've actually dealt with these situations before.The key is reading what the interviewer really wants to know. Questions that start with \"Tell me about a time\" or \"Describe a situation\" are screaming for STAR format. But questions about your general approach or methods can be answered by explaining your process first, then illustrating it with a real example if you have one. The goal is to prove you're not just talking theory - you've actually navigated these challenges successfully. Since you're prepping so thoroughly, you might want to check out [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat) to practice handling these different question types and get real-time feedback on when to use STAR versus other approaches.

You'll have a very hard time getting noticed unless you really stand out in some way.The other problem is that a lot of basic data science/engineering type tasks are something a good developer can knock out in their sleep, and it also doesn't take much before the task needs some custom software written and you basically need to be a developer anyway.

When we would interview people for C++ jobs, we would ask what was one thing they hated about the language, and if they didn’t have anything we could tell they hadn’t really used it in anger. But, it allows a specific balance of access to the hardware and programming abstractions that’s hard to beat. There are various C++ style guides that give advice on what small slice of the language is best to use - Google’s is pretty good, for example. Most of the C++ jobs out there are in interesting and in-demand problem areas, and often pay very well. Very few people are paying C++ devs to make CRUD apps.",

Three months of Spring Boot isn't going to cut it when you're competing against people with years of backend experience, so you need to show depth through personal projects and contributions to open source backend projects.The interview rejections are happening because you can't speak confidently about backend concepts, architecture decisions, and real-world problem-solving in that domain. You need to get comfortable discussing database design, API architecture, caching strategies, and system scalability - topics that only come from hands-on experience. Consider targeting companies that value T-shaped developers or smaller startups where you can wear multiple hats, as they're more likely to let you grow into backend work. When you do land interviews, you'll need to navigate questions about your limited backend experience tactfully while highlighting your learning ability and the projects you've built - [AI interview prep](http://interviews.chat) can help you practice articulating your transition story and handling those tricky questions about experience gaps - I'm on the team that built it specifically to help people ace challenging interview scenarios like yours.",

Every single person who had worked on the system had quit before I got there and there was basically no documentation. Here’s what I did:1. Spent about 1 month reading, understanding, and *documenting* as much as I could. What’s the path of a regular request? What is each backend responsible for? I also drew a massive map in LucidCharts (whatever, pick your favorite drawing site) with arrows and boxes for the different backends and whatnot. I wrote 12 pages of documentation that is likely still being referenced today. 2. Make sure to make absolutely clear how cooked you are. Right now, you are learning how to navigate and understand a large, unknown codebase. Inform your manager that whatever change they’re requesting will take over a month (or however much time) because you need to orient yourself and nobody can help you. It also helps to bring up that you are only here for a few months and want to help make sure that other engineers are able to make fixes after you’re gone. 3. Try to figure out how to make changes, test, and receive feedback on those changes without bricking the system. For example, make custom endpoints/functions/whatever in the relevant backend that only you know of and use those to test logic before pasting it into the actual production code. It may even be good to inform your manager and seniors what error handling/logging currently looks like, and see if you can improve it. If making whatever fix is made impossibly difficult before this, let your manager/seniors know you need to be able to properly debug or you can’t make the fix. This may seem sucky, but it was honestly an excellent learning experience for me. Although frankly, your situation seems worse than mine haha. You have to be bluntly honest about how screwed you are for whatever deadline they’re trying to push for that fix. You’re an intern lol. Making fixes in an unknown, undocumented nightmare with shit logging and shit error handling would take anybody a lot of time. What’s the worst that happens, they get rid of you?

What make me confused in my lead told me that there is no use for making charts or diagrams because it will be outdated anyway.\\- But I do think there is a sliver lining after this is I do learn a lot of stuff that SHOULD NOT BE DONE from this abomination of a codebase. When I first received this a raised some questions about it too like how things are not supposed to be returned but here we are.I hate their smug pikachu face when I tell them that ts gonna take me more time to understand and fix. I hated it more when I received a comment like \"You don't know how to debug?\"Thank you once again.",

Your skip isn't going to say something to them, and everybody rides off into the sunset happily ever after.So let's look at that as a constant. Your manager sucks, and they have it out for you. That's not going to change.Given that constant, we get a 2nd constant. You can't work with her. That's not going to change either.Given those 2 constants, come up with your paths forward. There's not many, and they all rely on your skip.One path that solves everything is your skip decides your manager is not performing well, and they fire them. You have no idea if they'll do this, and they're certainly not gonna talk about it with you, and even if they are going to do it this could easily take 6+ months. Maybe more.If they don't do that, or you don't want to wait for something that may never happen, the next option is to tell your skip to transfer teams. *Tell*. You don't even need to explain yourself, they know whats up.If they don't let you transfer teams, then your final option is to start looking for jobs elsewhere.This won't be the last bad manager you encounter in your career. You won't be able to change this person. There's a reason it's a LinkedIN cliche to say \"employees don't leave companies, they leave managers\".",

Keep your skills sharp through consistent practice and stay updated on relevant technologies in your field, but don't chase every new trend. Having a solid emergency fund reduces desperation and gives you negotiating power during job searches.For quick job placement after layoffs, preparation matters more than speed. Maintain an updated resume, active LinkedIn presence, and professional network even while employed. Document your achievements with specific metrics and keep a portfolio of recent work ready. Many developers wait until they're unemployed to start networking, which puts them at a disadvantage.The harsh reality is that \"quickly\" landing new jobs isn't realistic in the current market for most people. Even experienced developers are facing longer search periods than in previous years. Setting expectations of 3-6 months for job searches prevents the anxiety that comes from unrealistic timelines.Focus on financial preparation over trying to become \"layoff-proof\" since job security has decreased across the industry. Having 6-12 months of expenses saved provides genuine confidence because you can be selective about opportunities rather than accepting the first offer out of desperation.Consider contract or consulting work as bridge income rather than holding out exclusively for permanent positions. This keeps money coming in and often leads to full-time opportunities while maintaining your professional network.The confidence issue often stems from comparing your situation to the boom years of tech hiring. The market has normalized into something more similar to other professional fields, which means standard job search strategies and realistic timelines matter more than they used to.",

Super normal. Your current boss, however, won't like the idea one bit, so better not tell them. If you have to do an in-person or a long remote interview, use your PTO or call in sick. Give yourself breathing room. The big challenge is that very few can manage an intensive job hunt while performing well in their current role. You have to prioritize one or the other.",

        "body": "1. Nobody expects you to quit before looking for a new position. In a perfect world, you should be exploring for opportunities constantly and not just when you feel the need to change jobs or have quit / been fired. It never hurts to know your market value and the available openings, up to you whether you want to do that daily, monthly, quarterly, yearly, whatever fits your goals.2. Never tell your boss or company that you're applying elsewhere. Any prospective employer will ask for permission before contacting your current employer, so really they should have no way of knowing unless you're publicly posting about it. Schedule interviews on WFH or PTO days, say you have an appointment, call in sick, etc.3. Again, no reason to try to hide your current employment. Just have an answer prepared for when they inevitably ask why you're leaving your current position. Never bad-mouth your current employer, that doesn't look good on you. Be honest or just say it was time for a change, you wanted a fresh challenge, exploring different fields, etc.4. Again for interviews just do whatever is necessary. It's 100% worth it to take a day off work or call in sick or make up some bs excuse. And if you've made it to the final stage, you know they're seriously interested in you and will accommodate for your schedule for interview dates/times.Do not tell your current job ANYTHING until you have a signed the new offer letter. They will start looking for your replacement as soon as they get a whiff of you wanting to leave.",
