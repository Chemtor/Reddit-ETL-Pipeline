I used to work in a non-tech related field and had exactly the same feelings. Turns out I didn't enjoy the field I was in anymore which is tough to say about something you have sunk ten years of your life into. Sometimes, it's about work life balance. If you're working constantly and don't get a break, you are going to feel stressed. No time for hobbies or relationships also leads to stress.Take this with a pinch of salt although the biggest demographics are young men from the US and India who prioritise work over everything else and then wonder why they're feeling depressed, stressed, unfulfilled etc. Driven by social media selling lies about retiring at 40 if you waste your entire 20s working. Broader advice to anybody reading this post - retiring at 40 isn't that much different to retiring at 50. Everything in your 20s is completely different than being in your 40s. Dating, travelling, responsibilities, health, what you're physically capable of. You can always prepare to retire whether that's at 50, 60 or even beyond. You can never ever be young again so don't waste it. Don't be that person in their 40s with loads of money and even more regret.",

The time between kicking off the pipeline for it to fail an hour later sucks. Obviously you try to test locally as much as possible but when your working at scale, especially with everyone understaffed, the bosses just want you to go go go only to change requirements and want the data yesterday. I've been dealing with my micro services sucking lately which is hell (and not giving logs, I hate azure functions with a fiery passion and am moving everything to azure container services.)Sorry for the rant, one of those brutal work days haha",

They require a way to store data (should be immaterial, except to performance) and a way to retrieve it (an API, or a query language). There are two flavors, OLAP (On-Line Analytic Processing) and OLTP (On-Line Transaction Processing). On-Line refers to it being \"interactive\" and allowing a user to issue queries ad-hoc (please correct me if I'm wrong).A data warehouse is a database, always. It's a special kind of database that isn't there to process credit card transactions (OLTP, transactional). It answers analytic questions, like how many purchases were made in Harrison County, Indiana within 45 days of a full moon at a Marathon gas station that also sells cigarettes.That's called OLAP (analytical) and involves much, much more complex calculations and operations than does a simple OLTP (transactional) query. An OLTP query generally deals with tracking changing values (account balance, for example) or history (what did this look like at this point in time). Neither of those are exclusive to OLTP, but are examples of common use-cases.One consequence of this is that the API and Storage mechanism may be drastically different for OLAP vs OLTP. OLTP is generally changing very fast, and can't handle the pressure of dealing with lots of data, or large data loads. OLAP, by contrast, isn't meant to be \"interactive\" in the same sense. It's queries can sometimes take hours or days, whereas an OLTP system is often measured in queries per second (or, more precisely, transactions per second, though it's a different kind of transaction).Here's an analogy: I have a shit-ton of CD's. Logically, I can find a CD very quickly if I order them alphabetically. I can very quickly find a single album with the minimum of filters. I can also do that alone, and enlisting a friend would simply increase my QPS (queries per second). That's OLTP.Alternatively, I like to average the song lengths on albums and compare those values. I can do this manually, album-by-album, or I can enlist a bunch of friends and pay them to help. This \"parallelism\" is typical of OLAP workloads, and underpins the entire premise: I need to do a TON of math as fast as possible.It's worth noting, parallelism isn't the only way to achieve this goal, as there exist single-threaded DW's. However, it hints at the difference in problem: Look something up (OLTP) vs calculate a big math problem (OLAP).Hope that helps. It's a fun exercise to try to explain that succinctly.Don't use a single-threaded DW, though. That's mostly a joke.",

Does it work? Sure. Does it cause a lot of problems? Yes...yes it does. Logically you can work around many of the problems, but then you spend a ton of time and effort building solutions for problems that shouldn't exist. Setting aside security concerns of using real data as identifiers when you're passing queries back and forth (let's hope you're not using personally identifiable information like email address or SSN), You also run into problems answering basic questions and summarizing data historically. Take something as simple as a product dimension. Products should be unique in a dimension. The part number stamped on the product is a unique identifier of the product and a natural key. So you make it your primary key. But what happens when something about that product changes, like the way your company categorizes it? Suddenly all of history just reflects the current value in your dimension table. If you had created a surrogate key, you could create a new record with the same part number that has the new details. You can still group things by the part number, but now you have the ability to differentiate between the historical way and the current way.",

All tables should have a primary key, because if you ever need to update or delete a record you need to know how to uniquely identify it.> A surrogate key is an artificially generated key. They're useful when your records essentially have no natural key (such as a Person table, since it's possible for two people born on the same date to have the same name, or records in a log, since it's possible for two events to happen such they they carry the same timestamp). Most often you'll see these implemented as integers in an automatically incrementing field, or as GUIDs that are generated automatically for each record. ID numbers are almost always surrogate keys.> Unlike primary keys, not all tables need surrogate keys, however. If you have a table that lists the states in America, you don't really need an ID number for them. You could use the state abbreviation as a primary key code.> The main advantage of the surrogate key is that they're easy to guarantee as unique. The main disadvantage is that they don't have any meaning. There's no meaning that \"28\" is Wisconsin, for example, but when you see 'WI' in the State column of your Address table, you know what state you're talking about without needing to look up which state is which in your State table.",

There are elements/principles/tools of Software Engineering that can help with Data Engineering.I would say as someone looking to just get started as a Data Engineer, do not study “Software Engineering.” For someone getting started, the only Software Engineering related tool you really need is how to use source control (aka GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket).Second, the three languages any Data Engineer getting started should be SQL (most important), shell scripting, and Python. The core aspect of Data Engineering is the automation of ingesting, cleaning, and curating data. Python and shell scripting are two very common tools.Lastly, I’d get familiar with Data Warehousing/data modeling. The field of Data Engineering is a spectrum ranging from a Data Architect (purely focused on the data modeling/warehousing and how to structure data for ease of management and usage) to Data Platform/Pipeline Engineering where you are focused on writing code/using tools to ingest data, clean it up, and transform it so it fits into the appropriate data model. A lot of people just focus on the Data Platform/Pipeline side but without the data modeling experience, you are only a bit better than a Software Developer at doing Data Engineering work.Edit: spelling",

Recently I was hired to clean up a team that doesn't value Software Engineering principles though my manger was just reorged so I might leave as new manager doesn't see the problems yet. Here's what it looks like if your company doesn't value SE principles:1. Unreadable shit code everywhere. Only people that have been working on the codebase for years can read it. They often value ability to decipher unreadable code rather than write good code.2. Everyone is absolutely paralyzed to deploy code because there is no Unit or Integration testing. The code base is a mess and repo design and linting was not even considered so dependencies are ????.3. Things are constantly breaking and since theres no observability, code is unmaintainable and everyone is paralyzed to deploy on-call leads to making the smallest change possible with poor documentation until your stakeholders leave you alone. This generally leads to unknown tech debt captured throughout your data.4. Everything is constantly breaking, data is garbage and no one understands why so the business requires the only fix they know more QA.5. No one can accomplish anything ever because everything is such a mess but no one knows why. They just decide this is the way things are meant to be and shrug their shoulder as budget balloons due to every project being a completely isolated project. 6. Finally the business decides the problem is Snowflake, Databricks, AWS or whatever platform a VP can blame, so they justify a huge spend to shift platforms without changing the underlying culture.",

Its super handy, for when you need to quickly extract data or validate JSON files.2) **wget** and/or **curl** - These are like your command-line browsers for downloading files, testing APIs, or retrieving data from URLs— super useful, easy-to use3) **Batch File and Symbolic Link Creation** - Make your life easier by automating repetitive tasks, theres a lot of room for creativity here.4) **grep**, **awk**, **sed** - Text processing powerhouses. These are essential for searching, filtering, and manipulating text data in files or streams.5) **xargs** - Build complex command-line pipelines with efficient input/output handling.6) **parallel** - Run multiple tasks simultaneously, it can be a lifesaver when you need to speed up repetitive data processing jobs.7) **rsync**- Sync files and directories between two locations. Its excellent for backing up data or keeping directories in different locations up-to-date.8) **tar**, **gzip**, **ubzip2** - Archive and compress files. Working with data often involves managing large files. So often reinstall Linux packages.9) **watcher** Maybe big files or datasets? No problem, you can use watcher to scan for changes in files or directories in real-time.10) **npm**, **pip**, **brew** - Package managers for JavaScript, Python, and macOS software, respectively. They make it easy to install, manage and Scripting Language for Unix & Linux and install any software you need with just few keystrokes.11) **taskrunner.url:http** - Look, people, automate the hell out of everything. You can schedule even terminal operations or should I say process using a ExpressJS server, that creates a REST API that is a task runner.12) **SSH** - Securely access remote servers or systems. Its a lifesaver for managing data pipelines or databases hosted on remote servers. Another thing, now its more friendly with the OCA Monitor and the broadcast videos and The reditor.13) **vim** or **nano** - A text editor BUT, they work efficiantly work from the terminal. Sure Emac might have been tried a few times but, it comes down to user preference, some I know like Sublime or Visual Studio. Some people will hate me but its the truth.These tools are a great starting point, but dont be afraid to explore more lend that make your data engineering tasks a breeze. Happy data crunching! If you have a question ask, if not IT THERE WOULD BE A DARK PLACE.Also, have fun contributing here we all enjoy helping users out. Thats all I got, let me know if someone has a grumb but no, doubt my expertise, ask, how it helped someone else using it.",

You could have a clean method that applies only to a string:def clean(x: str) -> str: return x.upper()Then you can either apply the function to a single string or to all elements of the series:y = clean(x) if isinstance(x, str) else y.apply(clean)Pandas .apply() will apply the given function to every element in a series/dataframe.

That's not a free operation.\\* The return statement makes the conversion pointless. It's saying \"if x was originally a series, return x, otherwise if x \\*was\\* a string, return the first element of the newly created series.\" The first element of the newly created series is still the string itself. So why then did you do the conversion?\\* No type hinting on the return type to indicate how the different types of inputs (str vs series) affect the return type (str vs series). See TypeVar: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)If one of the pipelines has string inputs why not convert those string inputs to a single pd.Series of strings first? then call v1 on itIf I have missed anything about how you intend to use these, it's probably because you should also add doc strings to your functions.Additionally, pandas is not a great choice for a production pipeline.",

Imagine a hundred data sources (stores) being ingested into one data warehouse (company).What I usually see is someone wrote a script to ingest each table from each store database. That might be a few hundred lines per table across a few hundred tables, and that gets jammed into a single 20,000-100,000 monster T-SQL script file that gets put into source control and run once manually against each store.When they do their initial deployment problems arise at each store. They make a lot of modifications to the script on the fly, forget to check it into source control, and the change isn’t important enough to go back and update the other 99 stores which seem to be working fine…Now you’ve got drift. Times that by a dozen engineers hacking away live in production over the next decade and you’ve got a real mess in your hands. Then I come in. I want to add a column to a database. Can I just edit that script in source control and redeploy it? Hell no; that could overwrite a thousand different changes across the hundred different stores. So now I contribute to the problem by pulling out just the small sections of script, applying them just where I need to, and generating even more drift. That’s a nightmare. And it’s one that I see over and over. And that’s JUST the extract layer.You should plan for redeployment and drift from the get go.If you can’t deploy from source control to all of the stores with a button press then you’ve failed; even the best intentioned people will make changes and miss a couple stores when deploying their changes, resulting in drift. And if that same process can’t detect drift before deployment, then nobody will use the process, because they’re too scared of overwriting anything, so they are forced to do piecemeal deployments which accelerate drift even more.So you need to have source control as the source of truth. An easy deployment process with drift detection so people will be comfortable using it. And then you’ve got to be diligent about using it so it doesn’t just gather dust. Going back and building golden sources and a new process like this years after the fact is painful. Ask me how I know.",

We require every collection (a set of append-only realtime logs) to specify a \\`key\\`, given as an array of JSON pointers, which we use to deduplicate data. We use the key pointers to extract a key from each document we process, and then reduce all documents having the same key. We do this deduplication at basically every stage, capture, transform, and materialize.The way that we reduce is driven by \\[annotations on the collection's JSON schema\\](https://docs.estuary.dev/concepts/schemas/#reduce-annotations). The default is to just take the most recent document for each key, which works OOTB for the vast majority of our users. But there's more interesting things you can do with reductions, like various aggregations, JSON merge, etc.The code is all available \\[here\\](https://github.com/estuary/flow/tree/master/crates/doc) if you want to have a look, though there's scarce low level docs.

One approach we are considering is having a setting on each field that makes it \"shared\", so that any stream that also enables that setting on the same field will use the same value, and editing that value in any such stream will cause the value to change for all streams that have enabled sharing for the same field.While this achieves a fairly straightforward UX, the drawback is that you can only have one \"shared\" value for each field. It sounds like you would like to have multiple different shared values for a single field that are shared by different groups of streams.Would the \"single shared field\" approach still solve most of your use case, or does it seem too limiting?",

And That led me to create a tool that generates an Express + GraphQL API directly from an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).The tool helps to generate :* Sequelize Models & Migrations* GraphQl Inputs & Types & Endpoints easy to customize .* GraphQl Resolvers that can handle complex operations with data validation & file uploads .* Authentication & Authorization (in progress)* And you can Build your backend and download it locally to test it.This approach cuts development time, eliminates repetitive tasks, and keeps us focused on real client needs.I’d love to hear your thoughts!

If they care about you at all, they should set you on a path to success. If they do not, then start looking for internal roles that give you what you want. Then in the meantime, see if you can create your own opportunities if the team or business will let you. No one is going to say no to you going above and beyond even if it's not for more pay.

No one here is suggesting ways to achieve this in your current role but there absolutely are ways.Sounds like you are mostly just using SQL which is fine, it will always be a useful skill. One thing you could try is to use snowpark to build some of your datasets. That allows you to use python, scala, or Java to write procedures. This gives you experience with spark and a language other than SQL which also has the benefits of being more testable, easier to read and maintain etc. If you want to take that a step further you can fully productionalize your snowpark by getting it into version control and set up CI/CD to deploy your snowpark code to snowflake after passing tests. This all allows you to stay in your current role but leverage your situation to learn new skills that I think are valuable to data engineering and really software engineering as a whole.With all that said, depending on your engineering team these options may not be available to you. In which case experimenting in your spare time with relevant tools can be very helpful, but none will be more helpful than a different data engineering role where the tech stack is more to your liking",

If you're strong in Math or Science then go for ML/DS otherwise I have seen people with pure programming background struggle in those fields since they don't understand what, when and how to apply the Math/Stats concepts in the right scenarios. Pure programming is shit for those fields and many are moving into DE fields for that matter coz pipelines are shitty, so DE's needs to clean that up in order for DS folks to do any predictive model. Since you're in DE area, try upgrading your skills to distributed processing like Snowflake, Databricks, learn data modeling or enhance skills in those areas. SQL is here to stay and that is required for any data field. Perhaps look for new DE job where you can find more of modern data pipelines being build but even those all rely on foundations like data modeling, sql, security concepts. I work purely as a Data Modeler doing modeling using Data Vault and Dimensional frameworks. There's so many aspects of data modeling that I haven't touched in terms of building a model for peta bytes of data and so far only worked for mid-scale companies. I want to get into DE space but modeling is extremely hard skill to master and can only get better by experience. Many DE's fail the modeling interview round despite of their strong SQL and DSA skills. I ignore the full AI noise out there coz I know 95% of the companies still don't have proper pipelines build. Only small portion of the companies use AI but they're making the loud noise, like the FAANGM companies and that's scaring people that AI is going to take over jobs sooner but that's not true at all. The current AI is no where close to what humans have been doing for decades in tech field, but surely, we can use that to become more efficient and get suggestions. I use Chatgpt occasionally to get suggestions on sql queries and stuff.",

However, for all that time, I was working in a domain I never truly enjoyed. It was a situation of just showing up, doing the bare minimum, collecting a paycheck, and that was it. There was no interest in deeper learning or contributing meaningfully.But then, a year ago, I discovered Data Engineering, and it sparked a real passion! I took the initiative to learn everything I could about it – taking courses, building projects, and fully immersing myself. And guess what? All that hard work paid off! I just landed a fantastic job in Data Engineering and am absolutely thrilled about this new chapter.So, the takeaway here is clear: do what genuinely excites you and don't be afraid to make a change. It's never too late to switch paths and pursue something you're truly passionate about. Go for it! :winking_face:",

Not a big problem, it's about accepting it is what it is - you are looking to move when you can.In this case, it's fair. MuleSoft \"replacing\" Python is a wild statement and any manager who is as one dimensional as this will make it feel very hard to learn from them, especially if you're in the mindset that you have to learn from others. Eventually, after a bit of time, it gets to the point where you can tell something is poorly designed or well designed rather than counting on other people. Of course, gather feedback, it's more you naturally discover what does and doesn't work when you regularly take yourself out of your comfort zone. For context, I also work with people who only know SQL and good lord do they build some fruity stuff. Even in SQL. I do get the impression it's because they have had a cushy job where they haven't had to learn anything new for the past 20 years so have generated the worst habits alive.> Any advice for a new engineer navigating bad infra, limited support, and a mountain of work would be seriously appreciated.It's always like this at the start, especially if you're self taught, because you're used to being a one-person shop.

It gets easier over time because you have experience of working alone, although when you work within a company, asking for support isn't a bad idea e.g. asking if there's an infra team, speaking up about your workload so you don't get anymore, if they insist something is high priority discuss what you should drop.",

I believe this is the part where SSIS will suffer. If you want to migrate to an another database, you will have to move everything again in SSIS. I don't think that's the case with Airflow.* Python over C#. Python is easy as cake and I much prefer working with Python.* Future Updates. Airflow is getting constantly updated where as SSIS is literally getting zero updates and given free when you buy SQL Server. If it was that good, Microsoft would introduce a \"capacity\" or subscription model and sell it like they did with ADF and Fabric.* Making Marc Lamberti smile. That's priceless.I am not an Airflow nor SSIS expert, but these are just from my experiences and thoughts. Open for any criticism",

Data engineering is a hot field right now, and BigQuery is a powerful tool for handling big data. Its all about designing, building, and maintaining the systems that collect, store, and process data. If you enjoy problem-solving, working with large datasets, and staying up-to-date with the latest tech, you might find it super rewarding. Plus, the demand for data engineers is high, so there are plenty of opportunities out there. Just be prepared to learn a lot about data warehousing, ETL processes, and maybe even some SQL and Python.

It’s great for cleaning, transforming, and modeling your data, making it easier to analyze so that you don’t have to be expert in SQL to derived a policed data warehouse. It’s all about consistency and reusability.Snowflake, on the other hand, is a cloud-based data warehousing solution. It’s designed for storing, processing, and analyzing large amounts of data. It’s fast, scalable, and works well with other tools, like DBT. There’s a lot better to say of course, but in short, Snowflake helping you transform raw data to meaningful insights. They can work together, but they’re doing different jobs.I’ve found DBT really cool because you can version control your data transformations like you do with code; plus, it’s got a helpful community. Snowflake is awesome for its performance and ease of use, and it integrates with a ton of other tools. For example, many people build a solution like Fivetran, to grab the data, Snowflake to store and DBT to process the data. Although it may be an overkill for small sized project.Give ‘em a try and see what you think!",

Does your team have the headcount to do this?[https://imgur.com/a/5ZtQkQv](https://imgur.com/a/5ZtQkQv)Your other warning is that the data frequently changes. How do you handle this with LH, DWH strategy? Even if you isolate the structural changes to an early layer in the processing how do you actually handle this? Are there rules to the changing? Is backwards compatibility ensured? Can you enforce it before ingestion? Can you define \"valid\" data and reject \"invalid\" data? Or does it fall on your team to just make sense of data that doesn't follow any formally constrained structure?The way I've explained this in the past is:**Imagine that you just purchased a cloud vendor, like mixpanel, or AWS, or any other cloud vendor. That vendor exposes a real structured interface into their system. The vendors don't say: \"Just send us anything you want! We'll figure it out!\" but most data orgs are expected to just somehow accommodate arbitrary unstructured data!**What sort of outcome do you think systems like this produce? In my experiences (\\~5 Years in the data space space and 16 years total exp) the outcomes are really really poor. 10's of millions a year wasted in really suboptimal data outcomes. The best use cases for data warehousing I've worked with, establish structured interfaces into the system, through actual APIs. The product submits data to those APIs , it either submits valid data and the data is ingested, or invalid data and the data is rejected back to the product teams.Sorry for the ranting dump but the fact that you haven't committed yet to a solution I think puts you in a really advantageous position :)[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/draining-data-lake-part-1-3-problems-danny-mican-twjle/?trackingId=is9EOqN2CO82XMDL5G2UXw%3D%3D](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/draining-data-lake-part-1-3-problems-danny-mican-twjle/?trackingId=is9EOqN2CO82XMDL5G2UXw%3D%3D)",

Bonus points if you can efficiently build in the various maintenance operations into it because I would say that is the largest barrier to entry for people getting into Apache Iceberg. In the absence of maintenance operations, while Apache Iceberg will work, it won’t be long before it gets costly and performance will become an issue at larger scales (if I were to guess at 100 GB+).",

I then lost my job during the pandemic, so going from a fumehood in a lab to two monitors at home was a really big transition.> I’m anxious about breaking into the industry “later” in life.You'll find a lot of people who are younger are usually really good technically, but lack the exposure when it comes to talking to people, taking on responsibility, not getting rolled by other people in the business etc. not because they're stupid, it's just because they haven't worked long enough yet. Don't forget that experience isn't just technical skills. It's also about handling stakeholders, talking to clients, presenting your findings and the rest of it.Understanding how different businesses work and their different functions adds a lot of value.> And I’m not sure how to best present myself when I don’t have the standard junior dev/bootcamp-to-job pipeline behind me.My recommendation is just be yourself. Be open about what you can do and, more importantly, what you might not be experienced at yet but are *really keen on learning*. A lot of people suggest you should go in dick swinging and try to pretend you know everything whereas I go the opposite way because more often than not, you want to be hired into an environment where you get people who might not be the best, but want to learn and work hard. Because that is you.Lean on some of your former experience if you can. If you have experience working with data, mention it. When I say working with data it is literally looking at numbers and graphs and trying to figure out what is going on in some capacity. That's fine for your first position. I'd also lean on mentioning that because you have exposure to several industries you've seen all kinds of data rather than just one sector.",

I’ll always argue that “working code is the best code” and “it depends on your team skill set.”When comparing approaches, especially when it involves changing technologies, the first thing I want to understand is the following:What is wrong with the current approach that is warranting a change that is as drastic as migrating your existing pipelines to a new tech stack.Once you have established that answer, you can then start exploring new technical solutions and make sure it checks all of the boxes of what is wrong with the current approach. But it’s important to go in eyes wide open because no approach is perfect, there is always a trade off. Such as with your proposed change, while yes, Dagster + dbt could be a better approach if you are wanting to modernize your ETL pipelines and gain better visibility into runtime metrics and issues, but it comes at the cost of now having to use an external service (that your team may or may not know) and then port your Stored Procedures into dbt code (again, your team may or may not know).Also, need to keep in mind other business factors such as you will be splitting your development time between the migration and normal feature requests and maintenance. While you may get some approval to slow down until you get the new system up, it is hard to justify to leadership why they can’t get “x” feature.Lastly, there are always hidden “gotchas” in a migration so always plan for extra time than you would expect to prevent an expectations mismatch between what you expect the migration to take and what it will actually take. And “trust” in data is always key so there will be some amount of time you will have to run both, validate the migration is producing the same results, and then you can deprecate the prior solution. This carries an increased cost because you are running double the infrastructure while mid-migration.",

Essentially it broke typing and caused unexpected behavior. the main places to look out are\\- .submit / .map used to be contextually sync/async based on the definition of the decorated function, now .submit / .map are just always sync (even if the underlying function was defined as async! explicit async methods coming in the future if you need those) - I'd check out the 3rd video in the playlist I shared \\- \\`SomeBlock.load()\\` also used to be a dual/contextual sync/async too, but now there are explicit methods (.load and .aload) - this is a common theme in 3.x, explicit methods for sync and async \\- tasks that you call directly (not using submit or map) will run in the main thread (just like normal python), which is nice in cases where your tasks accept non-thread-safe inputs (e.g. http client)those are the main ones, but in general if you were using normal stdlib python, it should still work. if you were using some specific prefect features, you may need to look out for the gotchas abovefeel free to reach out in slack if you have any questions!",

It has built in support for multi page applications, and the learning curve is minimal compared to alternatives, you can build functional dashboards with just Python knowledge. For handling your star schema with millions of rows, Streamlit's session state and caching features help manage the data flow efficiently. You can load your dimension tables once and filter fact tables as needed, keeping your dashboard responsive.If you need more customization while still maintaining rapid development, Plotly Dash is a solid alternative. It offers more control over the UI but requires slightly more setup time for multi page functionality. The callback system works well for interactive filtering and can handle large datasets effectively. Panel with HoloViews is powerful but has a steeper learning curve that might be challenging given your one-month timeline.For connecting to your data warehouse, consider using SQLAlchemy for database interactions, which integrates well with all these frameworks and allows you to efficiently query only the data you need for each view. If you're working with marketing data as part of your warehouse, Windsor.ai provides pre built connections that could save you significant development time integrating those specific data sources.",

Poor modeling can introduce years of tech debt and increased cost. Even experienced DEs have issues with this so most companies will flat out reject juniors.

Most of the time a background script to perform concatenation has worked for me, even in environments up to 50k \\~1KiB events / second. A single go process can easily handle 1000's of 200KB files / minute. A correct partition strategy will easily scale even further by allowing you to scale the concatenations amongst multiple processes. If you do end up scaling out, it may require multiple \"layers\" of concatenation. But overall concatenating is a very simple operationally friendly approach IMO.Even a script using duckdb to select over the source partition and output all the results as a single file will get you very far.IMO one of the most important things is choosing the output file sizes. A custom solution could easily allow you to concat to 128MiB files, (or whatever is best optimzied for your reading process).You may need multiple tiers of concatenations as data agest out.A concatenation process also lends well to re-encoding the data into a read-optimize format (such as parquet).To illustrate concatenation imagine that you are writing your data partitioned by minute:\\`\\`\\` s3://your-bucket/your-dataset/raw/date=YYYYmmdd/hour=XX/minute=XX \\`\\`\\`Every minute/30minutes/hour/etc you could concat and write to a more-friendly filesize\\`\\`\\` s3://your-bucket/your-dataset/processed/date=YYYYmmdd/hour=XX \\`\\`\\`If you're touching every file it *may* make sense to re-encode in a read-optimized storage format, such as parquet. Duckdb will make this trivial. You can select from the original source, then write out the data to the target partition as parquet. The partition design is really important for what you want to achieve as well, and I'd recommend choosing one that supports the queries and processing and scaleout that you need.",

You need to come up with why you want to simplify. These should all be business reasons, not technical. You need to write these down and get agreement from all stakeholders. This will take a bit of time.**Step 4**Come up with what data products you need. You can start this list by running an inventory of what you currently have and then adjust it. Prune what you don't need (or is redundant) and add what you don't have. We still aren't talking about tools yet so don't put them in.**Step 4**Now creat your boxes based on the outputs and processing you need. Still no tools or logos, just the functionality. Be very clear what each box does and why it needs to be separate. Boxes should be where data lands. Processes and arrows are between the boxes. From what I see here, * You are missing a core layer. * AI models are a data product and not a functional section. * Transform is a process not a data level.**Step 5**Figure out your data flows. Your bi-directional flows don't really make sense. Data tends to flow in one direction. This is also where your SLAs start to come in. Work backwards from when you need the data to when you have to start processing it.**Step 6**Start evaluating tools based on your functional design. The functional design is the yardstick by how you measure the tools.",

In my understanding, Dremio is often billed as a complete lakehouse solution, but here it seems to be a component?* **Scale Requirements**: What's your data volume now and projected growth? Most components here (Kafka, MinIO, Spark) are designed for large-scale operations.* **Operational Complexity**: Do you have the team/expertise to maintain all these components? This is a complex stack with many moving parts. Do you have the on-prem infrastructure to do it?* **Real-time Needs**: You mentioned streaming probably won't be needed. If that's the case, do you really need Kafka in this architecture?* **Transform Layer**: Instead of both dbt and Spark, could use just one of them?

You could definitely do dbt core practice on local and it will help you get ready for deployment but as someone starting out it's not bad to start out fully on rails. And eventually for a portfolio project you should probably deploy the cloud anyways.My actual recommendation is to just use BigQuery, Redshift or Azure Synapse. I used BigQuery. BigQuery's free tier is MORE than enough even once your GCP trial is over. I know because I used the BQ free tier post GCP trial.I'd recommend MotherDuck their free tier is great but you have to get used to working with dbt core to do it, it doesn't work with dbt cloud. I know this because I did a project a couple of months back with DuckDB local and MotherDuck for \"production\" for the project with the DuckDB adapter, that's how I know.

This is the bare minimum. This is an industry constantly changing. You have to be constantly learning to keep up with it. With that said: job titles are not standardized and therefore they're all over the place and the job descriptions aren't much better. This means the old advice of \"it's a numbers game\" with job applications doesn't often apply anymore. You have to be intentional and surgical with the roles you apply for because there's such a wide umbrella of data skills these days. Plenty of jobs out there that don't need ci/cd or cloud experience, but analyst roles as a whole will continue to take a hit as companies try to replace them with self service tools. Data science roles have already exited the market in much of the industry.You should understand the role cloud plays in data and the role CI/CD plays. You should understand the full data analytics lifecycle, how pipelines work, and basic data modeling information. Hope this helps.",

While you don’t need to be a full-fledged data engineer, having a working knowledge of tools like SQL, cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure), and some data pipeline concepts (Airflow, dbt, etc.) can give you an edge in the job market. The key is to focus on the essentials rather than trying to master everything.Instead of feeling overwhelmed, try to approach it strategically—pick up just enough data engineering to be self-sufficient in handling and transforming data without relying entirely on a data engineer.

Junior intern or senior architect, if you're good in this field, you must condition yourself to the reality that you'll never be able to demonstrate 100% competence 100% of the time. There is simply too much to learn coming at us too fast. Get comfortable with saying \"I don't know, but we will find out\". Your colleagues, if they're being genuine, will appreciate this level of candor.Facing this challenge... actually doing the *find out* part, will probably be an ongoing exercise in experiencing the rich tapestry of negative outcomes. Find (or better yet, *build*) a workspace where you can safely experiment. I personally maintain my own homelab and build all kinds of stupid stuff there that doesn't work... until it does. And, once I actually mine a pearl of wisdom there, I can describe the experience in an actual work setting that provides value to my employer. It doesn't have to be elaborate to do this. Most of the tools you mention can be brought up in a Docker container on your laptop. It doesn't matter where you start or what tool you pick first. That initial step will lead you to the next, and build up insight to further guide your learning. Talk about THAT with your team members. They will appreciate the effort and (again, assuming they aren't jerks) eagerly contribute ideas to help you go further.",

This could be a simple Python script using the AWS SDK/Azure SDK that runs on a schedule to consolidate files.Adjust your Spark configuration for better small file handling: Increase `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes`, adjust `spark.default.parallelism` based on your cluster, enable `spark.sql.adaptive.enabled=true` for adaptive query execution.For your specific Kubernetes setup, consider increasing the number of executors rather than CPU/memory per executor, as this would allow more parallel file operations.If this is a continuous workload, you might consider changing your data ingestion strategy to collect multiple records into a single file before landing in your bucket, which would be much more Spark-friendly. Windsor.ai could help standardize any marketing-related JSON data sources, handling the consolidation before the data reaches your bucket.",

Right now because the market is saturated, barrier to entry is really high. But if United States based companies start trying to screw over European companies, it significantly reduces the barrier to entry and opens the door to European competition.That being said, it’d be a terrible long term business decision to alienate Europe and even though the current environment may lead folks to think this could happen, I’d be shocked if it does.Right now all of these tariff wars around physical goods and we are talking about digital services. Unless I’ve missed something (entirely possible since I’m an American Expat that has turned the news mostly off), I doubt it will come to AWS, Azure, or GCP making a decision that will tank their business long term.

Yes, code is definitely better. On the flip side, if you can't make a decent low/no code pipeline, you're going to struggle to make a decent pipeline in code. It's just way easier to write a shitty low/no code pipeline and much harder to write a vaguely decent one.> Just seems like there really I no growth or opportunity in this role.Partially true. You are definitely better off looking for a new role. However:> I guess my rant is just to ask what should I be doing in this situation?It's the same advice when you have a job you want to leave - take what you can from this one, recognise you're fortunate to have a job whilst you look for another job, tidy up your CV/resume, and get applying. Might not feel like it although there's a lot of valuable information you can glean from the documentation as it gives you a lot of oversight on the overall architecture of the system/platform the contractors are working on.",

I recall Apple not offering much of a discount either if you had a corporate account whereas HP or Dell wanted business bad and would give pretty good discounts.

A lot of the internet has caught on to how scraping bots work, and will explicitly implement anti patterns in their front end to cause issues for you. Scraping content isn't even necessarily the actual worthwhile challenge here anyways, the real challenge is getting usable data in the correct format on the other side of the processing pipeline. An LLM isn't going to be able to figure out that the reason your data intake pipeline is exploding is because it can't resolve a Geospatial db reference from a translated newspaper upload from 1970s Yugoslavia because that country doesn't exist in the dataset anymore, or that someone decided to have a div move to randomly generated spots and it's changing its guid id every page load (those are both real issues Ive had to fix on the fly btw).

This, while useful for demonstration and his singular, narrow use case, isn't how software is intended to function in commercial and industrial applications.He cannot debug it, because he does not have the understanding of syntax, DSA, CS, etc.He cannot integrate it, because he does not understand software, requirements or integration.He cannot update it, because he doesn't know what it does. He only knows the output.He cannot optimize it, because he doesn't understand the many, many considerations of performance, which are often unique per use case.He cannot polish it, because he doesn't know what good code looks like. And even more problematic, he doesn't know what bad code looks like.Now, if he does have knowledge and expertise in this area; what you're seeing is not the AI doing all the important things (it's not code!), you're seeing a developer leverage an AI assistant to create code he already knows how to write. He can rely on his knowledge and experience to ensure that the program is specced and scoped correctly. Its design is clean, performant, and modular. That it doesn't just meet his use case, but does it in a manner that meets both the criteria of the prompt but also general programming and design principles. He can also ensure it's not doing malicious actions, which is always a potential issue when executing code you didn't write yourself / from untrusted sources.You're either seeing an AI write a well documented, well understood boilerplate program OR someone with the knowledge and experience to know how to fix the mess the AI built under the hood to meet the use case.Don't think of AI as a replacement to developers. Think of it as an assistant to your coding. It supports your workflow by automation of the tedious elements; repeated boilerplate, propagating a deep change across a legacy codebase, etc.You're still young in your career, so it may seem like code is your main job. But as you rise through the ranks, you'll see code is more similar to paperwork. It's important, you have to get it right and you need a skill set that can get it done. But design, analysis, meetings (so many meetings...), stack knowledge, etc are even more important. If it was all code, no developer would rise above mid-level. But seniority is all about knowledge and experience and using that to get the job done - and we express that through code, just like a writer uses natural language.",

Uni instills this notion of \"doing your homework\" and studying first, but this is not the reality of software development. You will never be done learning as a software developer, and incorporating research into your development process is essential. I am constantly referring to documentation throughout any project I am working on - I don't read the whole manual first, hope everything sticks, *then* start working on the project though. Simply reading the material gives you theoretical knowledge, but you have no expertise until you apply it. Building a project gives you direction and a focus for learning through an immediate application of the information, and gives you actual development experience.",

On the other hand it can be helpful to explain stuff you encounter, but not do your work for you.For learning we did projects - some of these were exercises from our text books others were things we wanted to try ourselves.Exercises included writing our own data structures (e.g. linked lists) or solving mathematical problems (e.g. the traveling salesman problem) or simple games such as high/low (guess a number based upon higher_lower clies), hangman, \"[mastermind](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)\", star trek and others. For the first three, the computer would try to guess your solution as well as the computer would generate the answer and provide you the clues based upon your input. There were plenty of other categories depending upon what we were studying.The best way to learn is to practice. The best ways to practice are to do things that are relevant to you (and not necessarily fancy).",

Another problem is that it's inconsistent. And then there's the problem of copyrighted materials.But let's assume that all problems are somehow fixed (they probably won't).Now you have the problem that no one knows how the code works.The next problem is that AI relies on a lot of training data. Niche problems are really hard to fix through the use of AI. And novel problems are pretty much a gamble.Then there's the problem of project structure. AI can help you with that, but eventually it will fail.As someone working in the field I can say: No, AI won't replace human developers anytime soon.

                "body": "I think coding will always be worth learning—even if you're not a \"developer\" by job title. Having that skill will only give you an edge, even if AI is doing all the coding in the future, I'd be very surprised if understanding what it's doing isn't valued. For example, scientists and engineers need to know calculus, even though they have calculators and tools that do most of the legwork for them nowadays. How can they know if they are getting quality results from those tools if they don't know what those tools are doing under the hood? To be honest I was considering going this route (web development), and decided to break into tech through IT instead. It's not really the same path as a developer, but it's a way for me to have a steady job in the tech industry, and the barrier for entry definitely feels lower. Once I have a few certifications and at least a few months of job experience, I'm going to start focusing on learning coding again. Through it all I'm going to continue learning about AI tools (without depending on them for learning, if that makes sense). Even if I never code professionally, I'm still interested in learning it, and it might come in handy in niche cases or even as a hobby.Basically, once I have a year or two under my belt in IT, I'm going to use that experience to make a more informed decision about how to proceed. Maybe I'll continue with IT, maybe I'll use an IT position to sidestep into a coding role (using non-programmer roles to get into a company that you eventually want to program for is a strategy I saw one developer bring up), or maybe I'll combine the two and go into devops. Or maybe I'll do something new that hasn't even been invented yet (or that I haven't thought of yet).The most qualified astronauts are people who know multiple things (engineering, plumbing, human health, etc), because that role is so exclusive that they can only afford to send people who can do more than one job. Whether we like it or not, I see tech evolving in a similar way. Not to say that there won't be specialization. But you're a lot more likely to be relevant in the industry if you're adaptable and tenacious and eager to learn about multiple things (as opposed to being deadset on exactly one skill).Disclaimer is that if you're REALLY passionate about coding, I'm not trying to tell you not to do it. There is definitely a fine line between being a specialist that is adaptable - and a generalist who knows a little bit about everything but isn't good at anything. I know I want to work in tech, but I'm interested in both operations and development, so between that and the current job market I just decided to take the path of least resistance (at least until I \"break in\"). Maybe you hate ops, so this may not be the best strategy for you, or at all, I'm just sharing my journey. If anything, I'm telling you to learn coding, but maybe understand that job roles are apparently evolving into something new—so maybe it's time to reimagine the way we think about \"traditional\" tech roles and/or our approach to obtaining them. TLDR: It feels like the best candidates for future tech roles will be good with more than one thing, so instead of being deadset on a coding role (or any specific role) I'm just breaking into tech as fast as I can, and hoping that becoming an active player in the community will give me more skills, connections, and insight on how to move forward in the future. Coding is probably still a skill worth learning imo, whether or not it's your official job title. I think it's more important to do whatever you can to get involved, instead of waiting until you have a perfect plan to take action. You'll never have all the facts, but if you \"go for it\" you're more likely to get somewhere (and learn more) than if you wait for the Internet to reassure you that the career you're interested in is still validEDIT: I missed the part of your post that stated you are specifically interested in IT. Sorry about that. The first thing to understand (that I was confused about as well), is that IT generally refers to operations (keeping the system running) and development generally refers to building systems. They are related, but not really the same path. I think knowing about development could certainly be helpful in IT, but if you want a straightforward path into IT, it's probably not web development. Instead, I will recommend the same path my friend with 5+ years of IT experience recommended to me: start with getting your A+, then look for a help desk job. It probably won't be the most fun role, but it's commonly considered a starting point for IT. You don't even need to get your A+ first, but it will definitely make you more likely to get the job. Once you have the A+, continue working on Network+ and Security+. Professor Messer on YouTube is an amazing resource. Make sure to take practice exams for each certification—many people underestimate the exams and it's helpful to use practice exams to get a feel for them. I think either path (IT or development) can get you into tech, but you do kind of need to pick one thing to focus on at a time. So since you're interested in IT, I would probably recommend following a similar path to mine. Just be prepared to stay in that first role for 6 months to a year, as anything less will look bad on an IT resume. After that, you can go any direction you want, and you'll only be more empowered by the experience you gained! Once you have those three certs and a few months experience in your help desk role, you'll be much more equipped to make a decision on what you want to pursue specialization in. It may be web development, or it may be something else. Again, I think the only wrong answer is overthinking it and letting that stop you from taking action. It's totally okay to change your mind later, but if you never start, you'll never get anywhere. Best of luck to you!",

Like working out, it doesn't matter how long you've had a gym membership, but how hard you go at the gym.Build a project. Rewrite it with idea that you're going to improve the code. And then when you're done, rewrite it with the idea that you're going to improve the code with attention to data structures and logic.And then rewrite it again. And once you've squeezed most of the juice out of that, add a new feature. Rewrite your code so that the feature works better with the codebase at large. Then add another feature. Consider a rewrite. Programming is a series of meta-skills. Each rewrite should focus a metaskill -> lets make the handlers better, lets make the tables better, etc. Practice one thing at a time.You're going to find that you're improving each little meta skill which then improves your overall programming skills. And then from there, you can work on implementing larger concepts.",

Do you know physics? Because if you don't, you might not know the math involved to describe the motion? Do you know enough about graphics? Because graphics is a library that is considered an add on to the basics of Java.

This part in the middle focus more on Dart ternary operator.  This part and that part from Flutter. This sets of parts are optional and I need to enable them only when I needed to.Notes structure? I use Obsidian as my note taking app. Structure is how you want it or like it. I use tags. So, for most short notes, I'll add tag that corresponding to the components, such as what language, or what package. I also add tag that describes functionality of the note, such as query, stream, placeholder, post, custom. Anyway it can be a rabbit hole if you use Obsidian.Anyway, the notes that most useful to me is a set of patterns that serve a particular purpose.

You identify what kind of structure you think will work best for fast development, while also being something that will be maintainable and understandable. At this point, you have had enough experience to point out a good general direction for most things, and a good understanding of generally what kind of additional work is to be expected. For example, if a person came to you and said they need you to build a site for their customers to use for buying their product — A few things come to mind:- You might need a shopping cart icon, in which you keep their items. This means you’d either need a login system to keep track permanently of their items, or to use cookies/local storage/etc.- You will need to handle payments, which makes Stripe come to mind- You will need to add search functionality- You will need product names, descriptions, cost, image, etc., in your DB or in a large file.And that’s just the tip of the iceberg, because the more thought that goes into this process saves you from big mistakes. The issue is, if you haven’t done this before, or are more junior, you won’t know how to do a lot of this, because you won’t be able to tell if something gives off a bad code smell or what kind of larger edge cases come into play.

                "body": "Depending on how the solution is structured, you may be struggling with a poor solution design overall. Many teams, especially those in the early Angular 2 days, did not know how to setup the projects correctly due to poor documentation, shifting features, evolving strategies, and a failure to advance as both .NET and Angular grew quickly. I'll come back to this...The absolute best thing you can do first is learn how to log well. Yes, debugging is better than logging, but when you don't understand what's going on, logging will save your ass 9 times out of 10. In .NET that standard is log4net and in Angular you can put as many console.log in-between lines of JavaScript as you want. Log every other line of code if you have to until you get it. There is no excuse for not knowing what's happening if you know how to write a log statement. Doesn't matter if Angular is compiled JS or not, console.log works the same. Is this slow? Absolutely. A means to an end until you get better.If you're smart, in Angular, you'll write a wrapper function for all your log calls to console.log so you can turn it on/off at will. You'll learn over time to leave a lot of that logging code in there, as a special developer debugging mode, to be turned on at a customer site when stuff goes sideways. Now, as far as the solution goes. Is it setup as an all in one, where you just run the whole thing from Visual Studio? IMO this is a terrible way to work. It's much better to run the WebAPI project on its own and fire up a command prompt and launch NPM START yourself to fire up the Angular front end. It's faster, it allows you to debug each part on its own, you can restart each part individually (increasing productivity), and Angular modifications don't take nearly as long to recompile. A lot more to unpack here but digest this suggestion. You may try setting up a new solution using the modern way of doing it to see the differences.",

                "body": "People like to jerk off about certain languages. The reality is each language is designed for a specific use case, eg. python is good for fast prototyping and c++ is good for direct memory management and zero cost abstractions, etc. Don't be afraid to pick up a new language even for a small project, once you know a couple you can pick up the basics of a new language in like a day.Similarly, languages are just tools in your toolkit and then can be combined, in additional to other tools. For instance, you can have a web server in python and a javascript web client. You can have a bash script which automates some server maintenance task, which calls into a python script. You can collect data to a database and use something like SQL to analyze the data. You can use a tool like git to manage the evolution of the code. You can edit text files in an IDE, or in vim, or with bash, or with some other custom app, etc. etc. thinking about what types of problems are solved by what tools, and build a mental model so that when you have to solve arbitrary problems in the future you have a tool mapped to that in your head.Debugging is also a critical skill. The best way to approach debugging is to bisect the problem, meaning cut the program in half, figure out which half works as expected and which doesn't, and then take the half which does not work, and then cut that in half, and repeat until you locate the bug. This will make more sense with practice. Learn how to use debuggers, but don't be afraid to also printf debug sometimes.This is a good set of materials: [https://missing.csail.mit.edu](https://missing.csail.mit.edu)",

                "body": "Programming languages are not like natural languages: They are far more similar. You can think of them more like a dialect in a natural language. So once you know programming (in a certain paradigm, which is like a category / family of languages), picking up a new language is the work of a weekend.There are several schools of thought as to which language you should use to lear programming in the beginning. In my opinion, the three most convincing arguments are:C, because it's simple (not easy) and requires you to understand memory and computer systems, which gives you an advantage down the road. I would recommend to NOT use C++, as it is not simple.Python, because it's easy to read and understand when compared to many other langauges, which could give you a slightly easier start. It will also give you the ability to get \"productive\" faster. You will NOT be able to write production code for a large project or a company, but small automations and scripts to do things on your computer, or writing a bot for discord for example, are all possible quite early. Java/C#/\\[similar language\\], because Object Oriented Programming is the paradigm of choice for most people (which does NOT make it the best, just the most common). This means learning with an object oriented language can make your start into a job and into learning other languages easier.I myself am partial to the advice to start with C. Even old books like \"The C Programming Language\" by Kerninghan Ritchie are still a good way to learn programming, since in C, basically nothing important changed since then. There should also be a lot of courses out there as an intro to C, even some university lectures are up on youtube.And lastly, C is basically the common ancestor of many modern langauges. If you know C, switching to C++, Python, Java, etc. is not so hard.",

My cell phone has a Bluetooth connection to my car stereo. So I listen to the videos while traveling to New Orleans. Each journey to New Orleans requires 90 minutes of my time.While I was obtaining my Security+ credentials, I would play the downloaded lectures while driving.Real Downloader also has an option that allows you to convert these video files to MP3 audio format. These MP3 files can be played on a MP3 player. You can listen to MP3 files while running around the neighborhood. An MP3 player is easier to carry than a cell phone, especially while you are running five miles around the neighborhood.An example of a course found on YouTube that helped me, [YouTube link to a course that I have downloaded ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiEptGbnEBc&list=PLG49S3nxzAnl4QDVqK-hOnoqcSKEIDDuv)I do not pay for a phone plan that gives you almost unlimited internet.Another option, that has worked for me, is to place a voice recorder on the desk of the professor performing the lecture. I will record the lecture on the voice recorder, then copy the lecture to my cell phone for later play. You will see a sea of devices located on the professor's desk, recording the lecture.

If you're at one of the bazillion companies in one of the bazillion roles that still uses Excel for everything, being able to write an *actual* script that does an *actual* thing can turn a three hour Excel workflow into a three second script. Turn hours of manual data entry into workbook -> script -> output can save an enormous amount of time while also drastically reducing errors.Really depends on your goals. Going from zero to FAANG in 2 hours per day is going to be rough. Going from zero to not-only-Excel in 2 hours per day is extremely doable.And a pet peeve of mine: AI isn't a new technology. *Generative AI* is newer, and the explosion into the mainstream over the past two years is definitely new, but \"AI\" (which honestly is kinda meaningless) has been around for a long, long time.

It's open source and completely free. However if you only put in 2h it's going to take you a long time to complete.

But you won't learn to code that way. You'll just learn to follow directions.It's like Legos. The goal is to build your own models. Following instructions for other models will give you ideas, but only up to a point. You have to dump all the bricks on the floor and start trying stuff to see what happens.",

Although there have been newer C versions lately, most people using C will still be using C99 with a few extra features as needed, the concepts used in this course for example (what is a compiler, what is linking, etc.) are kind of universal.I see that Mr. Buckland suggests in Lecture 2 to use Cygwin on your Windows computer to get an easy environment up-and-running.

It's hard to answer to your particular confusion specifically without knowing more about what your confusion was. In any case, suffice it to say that it may help just to try a different course and see if the information is explained better the next time.Or try a different course medium. For \"getting confused about something\", for example, online courses and books are not as good as traditional \"classroom courses\". If you are confused in a classroom course, for example,, you have many attractive possibilities to get help -- you can ask your fellow classmates, for example, or your professor, or your tutorial advisor, -OR- you can just try to figure it out on your own (after which case, probably you will be dubbed the 'dude.ette' whom to ask to \"help out\" from your fellow classmates when they are stumped).There is no guarantee that the first time will \"click\", though. I distinctly remember learning about \"include\" files in particular, in some of my programming courses, for example, and the explanations were really weird and somehow did not make sense to me. And I ended up designing very strange include files that somehow worked (I kept adjusting it until the compiler stopped complaining), but if I look back at them today I will wonder if they were designed by some drunken programmer or something.Much later I learned the \"proper\" way to do it, why we need include guards, why we don't place implementations into the header files, and so on, and now it just seems so 'obvious' in retrospect. I'm not sure exactly what happened that I could have had such odd ideas in my brain for such a now seemingly obvious (in retrospect) aspect of programming in a particular environment. Anyway, the purpose of the story is just to relate that anyone can get confused, given a certain situation. It also depends on you -- some people find certain things easy to understand, whereas other ideas or aspects need more 'effort' to get settled into your brain. Do not worry; you can get \"unconfused\" later if you try to search for a good/better explanation.",

                "body": "It depends. One of the other responders is making a fine distinction between knowing aspects (syntax) of Python vs. writing a program in Python. This is analogous to the distinction of learning French grammar and vocabulary and writing a short story in French. The grammar and vocabulary tell you how the language works and what words are used. The story writing requires some thought about characters and plot. Yes, word choice also matters, but they are in service of the story.When you're asking \"Is it hard to learn Python?\", it implies (whether you realize it or not) \"Is it hard to write a program in Python?\" which includes learning how the Python language works.Most people say it's easy to learn a language's syntax, but it's not THAT easy. An experienced programmer is likely to think \"programming is if-else, loops, functions, arrays...how hard can that be?\". But many people, for example, find it hard to understand pointers in C (or arrays, for that matter). I've heard people that just don't get arrays (mostly, I've learned, because they don't know why they would use it). But I've both taught and seen frustrated posters that do find learning programming syntax to be hard. Python's syntax is easier than most (it lacks the kinds of pointer syntax C has) so it's often recommended.There's a book out there called \"Automate the Boring Stuff\", and you can even find it free on the Internet (search for it) as a bunch of webpages.The book spends the first ten chapters (roughly) introducing Python, and the remainder showing different tasks that can be automated. I would suggest doing the following search `mooc python`. This should send you to a website hosted in Finland for a free Python course. It will resemble a real college course, because it is, but you can go at your own pace. There are no quizzes and exams that you need to take, and no grades given. Those are only for the real students taking the course. And, no, you won't earn college credit (which costs money).Still, it's a good place to learn the basics of Python programming. Once you can write basic programs, you can then move to automation. Of course, you can do both (take the MOOC and read \"Automate the Boring Stuff\"). It doesn't hurt to have a few resources while learning to program.It can help to write down what you want to automate in words, rather than think it in your head. By writing it down, you can then figure out what you need to learn to automate what you need.And it kinda depends on what you plan to automate. Some stuff might be harder to automate (e.g., go through my email, and summarize the key emails that I should pay attention to). Things like doing some task with an Excel spreadsheet is more do-able.That's always the hard part for those new to programming. It's hard to tell what's easy to do and what's hard, and initially, everything is hard. So, even if learning aspects of Python may not be so bad, doing certain kinds of things with Python will be challenging.For example, if you wanted to have a program to drive a car using a camera and other sensors, that would be a difficult to program in Python. It's not that Python is hard, it's knowing how to detect cars, to navigate, to know where you are, etc. All of that is hard, and most working programmers have no clue how to do that.",

Python has weird syntax, such as significant whitespace and a lot of keywords, which I think makes it more confusing syntactically. Also, duck typing is a double edged sword. While it may take less work to write code, having types in your first language really helps you understand how programming works, in that everything is binary at the end of the day, but the system uses variable types to define how to manipulate that binary data.The hardest concept in programming, both for brand new programmers and experienced programmers, is object oriented design. In my opinion this is essential, and fairly difficult to learn with python. Java or C sharp are probably the easiest languages to learn how object oriented programming works.I would view python(and javascript for that matter) as a middle ground between a formal statically typed compiled language, and a completely hacky scripting language like bash.I think learning bash and some typed language, like c, c sharp, or java, is the best thing to start with, and then python is REALLY easy once you know those.

                "body": "Use whatever your course recommends. IntelliJ and Netbeans handle file structures differently. They also handle code packages differenrly. This can largely boil down to preference...BUT if you are taking something like a college course this can make a huge difference. Lets say something is messed up with your file structure, or setting up your file path, or with installing packages. If you are using the same IDE as your professor, it'll be a lot easier for them to help you troubleshoot the problem. When you are first learning to code, a lot of time can be eatin up trying to troubleshoot this stuff (at least it was for me and my classmates in college starting out).If you are just learning on your own then you have a few options.NetBeans is nice because it has a lot of documentation, so you can even find tutorials from the group that runs it on how to do basic projects with it. It also has a really easy to use interface for creating GUI. So if you want to branch outside of console programs its easy. The console for running code is alright. From what I've read Netbeans is used mostly in educational settings and not really professionally.IntelliJ is what most people seem to recommend, it has more features then NetBeans....and it looks pretty. I haven't used it in a while since I got it for free as a student for a year. It sounds like the community version is free based on some other comments. If you can get this one for free somehow, it's what I would go with.Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code. First, visual studio code is not an IDE, it's a code editor. It lacks some of the features that Visual Studio or other IDEs have. But it's light weight, highly customizeable, FREE, and can handle multiple languages (not just Java). Visual Studio is heavier to run resource wise and cost money (unless you do the education version), but it has all your standard IDE features and like VS Code it can run multiple languages.TLDR: If in college, use whatever your class uses. If not in course, start with IntelliJ if free, Netbeans if IntelliJ not free. VS or VS Code are cool, but I would probably recommend learning on an IDE purpose built for Java first.",

If you choose Java that means you could either make a desktop app or an Android app. If you choose C++ but no engine then you could make a Windows app or you could use libSDL for a lightweight, simple cross-platform library.Consider python with pygame. It's actually an excellent choice for 2d games and much easier than Java or C++ for beginners.Good games to start with that require no assets:* Snake* Tetris* PongOr with extremely minimal assets:* Flappy Bird* Space Invaders* Pac Man* Mario BrosYou don't have to make an *exact* clone of any of those games, but recreating one of those classic games is a great way to learn.

These machines are good at what they do. But humans are best at programming. Humans take the resources from AI, Google and Compilers and put these into resources that ordinary people can use. For example, YouTube. YouTube is a service that allows the publishers of video content to display the content to the world. When YouTube first came out, Adobe Flash was already out there for content authors to video content to. The problem is that few people possessed the funds to support a server to stream all of this content. YouTube found a way to allow Adobe Flash authors to stream their content to the world for free. Virus writers later found bugs in Adobe Flash and YouTube was forced to create new formats for publishers to use to stream their content. The format chosen was later standardized in a way that all browsers support the format, right out of the box.YouTube did not originally create any thing new, but created a place for people to stream their content.

It's maybe not so great to look at an 80 line bash script that runs once on startup and never again and say \"this should really be in 5 different files of java code for the sake of readability, it's getting to be too long for a single script- what if someone decides they need the `breaks_the_platform_if_run_after_startup()` code to be run somewhere besides right here?\".",

It'll be about as hard as getting into any other career, but you can do it if you really want to.If you mean \"the whole AI argument\" to be \"AI is gonna take our jobs\", it's not really any closer to doing that for programming than for anything else- by the time AI can actually replace programmers for anything beyond tiny small-scale scripts (which it still can't even do reliably), it'll probably be able to replace a lot more, so I don't think programming is in any specific danger compared to other fields.",

Honestly I think the best way for you to continue is to learn how everything fits together. Thats kind off what my problem was when I started learning myself. Its hard if you dont have somebody who teaches you the important things, and guides you to what is next. cause you will jump around learning about this then that, you will miss something, and not understand why this is important ot not. BUT for now just start learning about databases (learn first about relational databases either mysql or postgres). Databases are basically the backbone of every program. almost every project needs them. once you understand databases you can make a quick dive into html/css/java script. no need to perfect. but it would be great for you to understand how frontend web developemnt works. at this point you know how to make programs and to end. you have a database in the backend where data is stored > data is taken from your backend code written in any language (c++, python, java script, php, java, ...) > then send to the frontend which displays it. thing is, basically every project works the same way, even games. You have data and logic in the backend code and then you need a way to display that data to the user in some sort of way. How this is done can be achieved in pretty infinite forms (thats the code stack, which technologies are we using - which database/s, which programming language/s, which OS, and so on)now you have an overview of how projects work from back to finish which should make things a bit easier, because at least you understand how things are done.I would also learn about linux if you havent.now if you want you could also take a QUICK look into blockchain, no SQL databases, deep learning/AI, just so you get an understanding of these technologies and how they fit into the picture. at this point you have choices. maybe something interested more than something else. maybe you enjoy working with databases, maybe you enjoy creating frontend things, maybe you enjoy doing backend work. so you can decide on which area you want to focus. now you can also learn about programming concepts like object oritented programming, functional programming, dont repeat yourself ....There will be a lot off other things on the way which you should learn, and it might feel it never ends and there is always something else. and the thing is, it will never stop. because there is always something else, some other way off doing things, some other/\"better\"/new way of doing things/new language, database, program, encryption, protocol, things you simply cant even wrap your head around yet. its simply how things are as programmer, you will never learn everyhting and you simply have to deal with it.honestly best you can do is to get an all around knowledge first, you dont need to get to deep knowledge at first. but just so you know how everything kinda works and get an understanding how everything/the puzzle fits together. once you have that base things start to make more sense on why things how they are, which makes it easier to learn, and you wont feel like you dont know nothing, you just feel like well I still dont understand it all but thats ok, because I never will",

To use AI in the real world, there is no need to do a specialized degree, 1-2 lectures as part of a normal CS degree are more than enough. - there are many other interesting specialities in some universities, like biology and CS, and medicine and CS. If you are really interested in any other field, you might try checking out if there is a mixture of the two out there. Keep in mind though, that this will pidgeonhole you as well, and make it harder to get a job in an unrelated field. - if you just want to do programming, look for software engineering instead.

They might seem ahead now, but they're building their knowledge on shaky foundations.Your approach to coding - researching, experimenting, truly understanding - that's how real engineers think. It might take longer sometimes, but you're developing problem-solving muscles that will serve you for your entire career. It'll actually make you enjoy it more too (which will help you through some of the challenging times).Don't measure your worth by how quickly you can implement something compared to others. While at the end of the day what matters is how quickly you can generate high quality work, the industry desperately needs developers who think deeply and understand what they're building, not just those who can cobble together AI generated answers or vibe code the fastest.",

Its main weakness is that it is going to be worse if you have lots of threads all reading random numbers from it, which is probably not something you're doing.Finally, there's ThreadLocalRandom, which is great if you're in the above case. Its main disadvantage is that you cannot choose a seed number, which means you can't run the program again with exactly the same random numbers selected.

                "body": "Yes, they are fundamentally different. Your function there takes a few arguments and prints each of them out, whereas a class like the following would store all of them so they can be used later: class Dog: def __init__(self, colour, breed, weight, name): self.colour = colour self.breed = breed self.weight = weight self.name = nameThe difference between the two is your `dog` function can *only* print out the strings given to it - nothing more. You can't access those strings later, you can't do other things with it, it's just a function. The `Dog` class can be extended with additional methods which can be called at any time, and I can access the data held within it at any time: class Dog: ... # omitted for brevity def say_name(self): print(f\"Woof! I'm {self.name}\") def print_info(self):     print(\"The name of this dog is \", self.name)     print(\"The colour of this dog is \", self.colour)     print(\"The breed of this dog is \", self.breed)     print(\"The weight of this dog is \", self.weight) dog1 = Dog(\"Red\", \"Terrier\", \"120lbs\", \"Dave\") dog2 = Dog(\"Blue\", \"Heeler\", \"50lbs\", \"Steve\") dog1.say_name() dog2.print_info() print(f\"Dog1 is called {dog1.name}, dog2 is called {dog2.name}\")Classes are basically containers which store variables (called fields when in a class) and functions (called methods when in a class). An instance of a class (called an object) has its own data stored in those variables independently of all the other instances of that class, and methods can modify that object's state via the `self` keyword without impacting any of the other instances. Functions, on the other hand, are just a bundle of code which you've assigned a name to, either so you can reuse it or just for organisation.",

                "body": "A function does a specific thing and returns a specific value- think of a power tool or something, they exist for a purpose but don't particularly carry any information or value outside that purpose. A code example is `print`- it prints stuff, and then goes away. You can't reference an old `print` call (generally), it was never meant to be referenced later- it only served a purpose in that it would do something right now.A class can hold many functions or some other data. A real-world example would be like a tool shed or garage- you might keep a lot of different power tools in there, maybe some lists of parts you'll need to buy for repairs, etc. The shed doesn't do anything, but it has many functions (tools) inside that do. A code example is a string. Saying `a = \"my string\"` doesn't print out text or do anything else, but it saves \"my string\" for use later.What you've done is created a class that stores no information and just acts as a function. There's nothing _technically_ stopping you from doing this, it'll work fine, but it looks like an absolute abomination when trying to debug, and has other possible downsides. If you had done something like: def print_dog_info(c, b, w, n): print(\"The info is \" + c + \", \" + b, etc...) print_dog_info(\"Red\", \"terrier\", \"120lbs\", \"Dave\")You would do the same thing as your code, but without storing anything in memory. The way you do it, you're initializing an object for dog1, then dog2, etc. The object is very small since it stores no information, but it is there, and it will eat memory forever until the code reaches a point where the language will clean it up. In your example, it's not a major issue because there's so few dogs and they each store no information, but imagine if you had a million dogs and each was actually storing those values you passed- all of a sudden, you're holding _a lot_ of data in memory, when all you actually wanted to do was print the dog's information.The more practical reason to do it the way I wrote is that if you do everything as a class (like in your example), you can't tell the difference between a line of code that's meant to do something or a line of code that's meant to store information for later. If I read your code and just see `dog1 = dog(\"red\"...)`, I'll probably intuitively expect that later I can pull that information out of `dog1`, maybe by `dog1.color` or something. I also won't expect anything to actually happen besides data storage, so I'll be very surprised when I see that I'm wrong on both counts, and I'll be very confused. If you wanted to rewrite your code to use both classes and functions, you could do something like this (I don't promise valid code, this is just pseudocode to get the idea across): def dog(colour, breed, weight, name): c = colour b = breed w = weight n = name def print_info(): print(\"name: \" + n + \" breed: \" + b +...) dog1 = dog(\"Red\", \"Terrier\", \"120lbs\", \"Dave\") dog1.print_info() dog2 = dog(\"Blue\", \"Heeler\", \"50lbs\", \"Steve\") dog2.print_info() #etc etc etcThe class `dog` now serves to actually hold onto the information for later, and has a function built in to print the information. You could also print the information like so: `print(\"name: \" + dog1.n + \" breed: \" + b +...)`, but the usefulness of the function here is that it prevents you from having to re-write code. There might come a time in the future where you have 5 or 6 different places in code where you're printing dog's information- what happens if you add a new value to your class? If you're using this non-function version of the print, you have to go to all 5 or 6 of those places and update the print statement to include the new value. If you're just using the dog's builtin `print_info()` function that you created, you can edit the code in one place, and all 6 of those places you were printing will magically just work, since they're calling the class function that you changed.",

In C there are no classes, but there are structs, which are like classes that *can't* have methods (or private members), and there are functions (which are all global in C).

The real problem here is that in a game like chess, the graph becomes near infinitely large, so you need AI that can operate in near infinite space to hone in on the prize. \"A\\*\" search (pronounced \"A star\") is a simple and elegant solution that provides the core for a lot of search AIs.

This code from the slides will not even work, it will give an error. print(\"Game over, \" + 4 + \" was your final score\") TypeError: can only concatenate str (not \"int\") to strI think the key takeaway here is the difference between strings and integers. It touches on this at around 20 mins.`4` is an integer. Integers are numbers - you can do number things with them: math, addition, subtraction, etc.`\"4\"` is a string. Strings are not really for doing math, they're more for text. You can do text things with them - make uppercase or lowercase, concatenate (join) strings together, etc.Python (and many other programming languages) use `+` for both addition and concatenating.When used with integers, `+` is addition. `4 + 4` evaluates to `8`, another number.When used with strings `+` is concatenation (NOT addition). `\"4\" + \"4\"` evaluates to `\"44\"`, another string.So `+` does two different things depending on whether it's used on integers or strings.This leads to a good question though - what happens if you try to use `+` with an integer and a string, e.g., `4 + \"4\"`? Well, it depends on the programming language. In Python, it'll just give you an error, because it doesn't know if you want to add or concatenate. Some other programming languages behave differently though.The idea the video is trying to explain is that sometimes you already have an integer variable and want to put it inside a string somehow. There are lots of different ways to do that, the video just happens to show one that kinda looks like Python, but won't actually work in Python.",

The class specifies the rules for how each object is used.Strings and numbers are different kinds of objects. For a string, you might want to find its length (\"ok bro\" has six characters including the space) or add it other strings (\"fizz\" + \"buzz\" = \"fizzbuzz\").In Python, there is a `str` class that defines string rules, such as length and addition:* `print(type(\"hi\"))` shows ``* `print(len(\"hi\"))` shows `2`* `print(\"hi\"+\"lo\"))` shows `hilo`There are also classes for numeric data, such as `int` which defines the rules of integers. They have their own kind of addition (1+1=2, not 11) and other operations like modulo which was mentioned in the video. You don't put quotes around `int` objects in Python:* `print(type(20))` shows ``* `print(20+30)` shows `50`* `print(50%20)` shows `10`The point they're trying to make about not using strings when you need ints is those are different kinds of data even if you could technically store the same number as either one. For example, Python supports both a `4` object of class `int` and a `\"4\"` object of type `str`. (The quotes matter.)* `print(4+4)` shows `8` due to numeric addition* `print(\"4\"+\"4\")` shows `44` due to string additionSome other programming languages might work differently. For example, they might notice the number inside the quotation marks and do numeric addition. They are not all the same as Python.But I'm not sure the video's examples actually all work. Python doesn't really like adding strings to numbers in the same expression.* `print(\"score: \"+4)` gives me an error.* `print(score: \"+str(4))` works by creating a new `str` object from `4`",

Ok, let's start with just getting user input and send it to server and log it from the server.

Now this is an almost trivial task, you might need to google one or two functions for reference. Then once it's done \"ok now we have a connection, we can have the client send a text input to the connection, and log from server\" and again it's easy.So it's really a simple concept but can be challenging in practice.

The good news is there's basically zero chance that C++ will become irrelevant - it gives a programmer more direct control over a computer than essentially all other high level languages. For example, Microsoft remade all of Minecraft in C++ calling it \"Bedrock Edition\" because C++ allows a programmer to make everything way more efficient than Java (though I would still recommend the Java Minecraft for playing because of reasons that have nothing to do with preferring a Java game over a C++ game because I definitely don't).I have a book[ \"Introduction to 3d Game Programming With DirectX\"](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=9781944534554&i=stripbooks&linkCode=qs) \\- I'm not sure you want to use DirectX but it will certainly push you off the ledge into building a game engine from the ground up in C++. I got so far as making a colored cube rotate on a resizable WPF DirectX control frame (integrating C++ with .NET via C++/CLI) which took weeks of work but it sure was a learning experience.Otherwise you can download Unreal and start learning from that which already is a game engine for C++ allowing you to skip all the really hard stuff about using the DirectX API directly from C++.

It's definitely easier for juniors to grow more independent in a workplace setting since they can learn from and confer with peers. Jumping straight into solo consulting as a junior will definitely be tougher.Networking is always key - just because you are more independent does not mean you're not allowed to ask anyone for help. If you have anyone from your previous job that you can keep in touch with to bounce ideas off of, that would definitely help.I think being independent is mostly making practical decisions by yourself. If you are not sure what to do, you'll need to spend time researching until you feel like you have a better sense. When you have multiple options, don't toil over minor differences - just pick one and go with it. In general, if you have decisions that you feel are two-way doors (i.e. it's easy to undo and try again) then just go for the simplest option.

He’s also not a nobody, he is one of the most brilliant AI/ML researchers around (a cofounder of Open AI), but like many non-web people I’ve met, has a very outdated and condescending view of what front end web development is. I fought that perception myself for years in my front end career. I actually tried using some Cursor and Windsurf for the greenfield project I’m doing now and was astonished how quickly I could blow past the kind of tedious boilerplate involved in starting fresh. It does smaller and well-defined tasks well (like for instance breaking out React components into their own separate files). But once I started trying to give it more generic and bigger tasks (“create a React context for this state and replace the prop drilling”), the LLM started generating inefficient and redundant code, and I often just threw out its edits and did it myself. I think we are a long way from LLMs replacing even frontend developers, and that’s the part of coding that LLMs are probably best at due to the sheer volume of React/NextJS etc code out there. When even Karpathy acknowledges that, it makes me breathe a sigh of relief for a little longer :)",

Because those of us in the first generation of modern devs are largely self taught, there arose this fallacy that it is therefore \"easy\". People conflated \"accessible\" and \"possible\" with \"easy\". And then the bootcamps continued to promote the myth. I spent years learning to become a really mediocre dev and even that was pretty hard.Over the last 30 years two things happened: junior devs started being weird non nerds with an interest in a paycheck and not in solving problems and MUCH more importantly non-techs were increasingly put in charge of techs because of course if you can learn it on your own it must be easy. I haven't had a PM or a boss who could write a line of code in 8 or 9 years now. And this was before when there were jobs and stuff.And here we are. In the era where the ignorant have finally created a world as broken as they perceive it to be. It's too bad because working with LLM's to write code is a huge pleasure in a lot of ways and really helps me get unstuck and to work in languages I have less familiarity with. Like - I can make the structure of a function right but having the AI correct syntax or be there for a quick question is just awesome. Also I'll be honest - I kind of like doing what they are calling vibe coding just to see what comes out. Every now and then I find I can write like really small apps for file processing or solving small local problems that are super useful. And other times I get to laugh at the AI falling on its face.

IBM is actually doing better because the current CEO at least was an engineer. Salesforce is the classic example. When I started with them in 2017 there had been no layoffs and it was all Ohana, although I refused to completely buy into it. By the time I left in 2020, they were already doing PIPs and about 3 months after I changed jobs, the first big layoffs hit: Fast forward 5 years and even though they have a great product, all the Salesforce customers I have worked for hate them, the quotas and price gouging, and the terrible customer service, and poor professional services. My company is literally in the process of talking over a failed Salesforce implementation done by Salesforce! The customer spent $25 million and basically got treated badly the whole time. We are cleaning up the mess and happy to do so. If the finance people run the company and own it, the investment people, then the complete focus of the company is how much money they can make in a quarter and will screw everyone, customer, employee, or business partner to get it. “It’s just business”… :unamused_face:",

I haven't worked for them since 2005 and haven't really kept up on what the company *does* anymore, but every so often I hear about them running huge numbers of Linux VMs on their big iron, one of their AIs beating some guy at some game or other or that they just did something or other with quantum computing.Funnily the first time I worked for them, in the early '90's, was OS/2 tech support. At the time one of the managers there did a talk on how they wanted to future of IBM to be OS/2 everywhere. You'd run OS/2 on your PC and your mainframe at whatever scale it was at, so you wouldn't need additional training to move from one environment to the other. It'd all just be OS/2. Seemed like a good idea at the time. A lot of the OS/2 people in the company switched to Linux after they killed OS/2. It kind of feels like Linux fulfilled that dream they had all those years ago in a way that their engineers were simply not capable of in-house. I feel like there's a lesson to be learned there about software development, but it's much too early in the morning for me to go looking for it.",

Let's not forget that IBM's Watson team were heralded as one of the big hitters in AI, with many of them moving to FAANG companies and OpenAI - so GenAI is no excuse for a lack of new releases.Outside of iteration, while many of them still print money, that can disappear super fucking fast. Legislation to online advertising, data law changes, restrictions on social media and devices for under-16's, and legislation on online hate could kill Facebook/Meta. Google seems destined to end itself through inactivity and kneecapping itself with AI. Netflix is a victim of enshittification that'll likely see continued losses over time. Amazon is a shareholder awakening away from huge job cuts and maybe even a culture crisis if Jassy is ousted.The only company that seems capable of riding out the wave is Apple, but outside of the Watch the best thing they've released in years is the Vision Pro, which is essentially a tech paperweight.IMO these companies were successful because they were able to build talented teams on moonshot ideas. While many ideas were actually acquisitions (or internal mergers with acqui-hires) you could join Google and work on the next Gmail, and if it failed, oh well you just join a new team. Nowadays, if you're unlucky enough to be on the next Google Reader or Glass, you're out, while your director and VP are parachuted into a cushy safe role. For this reason, everyone plays it safe, and middle managers are keen to build empires to maintain safety. FAANG can no longer innovate, hence OpenAI dominating GenAI and no FAANG releasing anything of note for the better part of a decade.",

Completely new and unrelated jobs that would compete with it would require a ton of re-education, long hours, and/or drive. If you're your family's primary breadwinner, you probably can't afford 8 years of lost earnings and student debt to go to medical school, for instance, and your work life balance would be absolutely terrible for quite a while if you were trying to qualify for a new career while still paying the bills with your current job.So your best options are probably to pivot to something CS-adjacent, where your technical background is a major asset or prerequisite, but your day to day responsibilities will involve less of the things you don't like and more things that seem tolerable. There are a lot of tech jobs other than being an actual developer, and your experience as a developer will make it easier to qualify for those jobs. Or you could find a software engineering job where they accept you just putting in a 9 to 5 and the nature of the work is more stable and doesn't require you to learn a whole new framework every few years. Jobs like that exist, though 2025 isn't the ideal job market for career changes.",

If you are good with coasting, it's a great gig, but yeah It is basically a career killer if you're not careful.You've probably already done this, but go to aka.ms/careers and look for some internal rolls. A lot of teams dont want to go through the pain of interviewing external candidates since that process takes a lot longer. I went from one team to another in less than 2 weeks doing that. I actually reached out to the hiring manager and skipped the entire loop so there's definitely hope. I know that's pretty rare though so you may have to brush up on your interviewing skills.",

I kept saying I can't comment on something that I do not have the full facts about, but she still kept pressing me for an opinion. When the CTO finally arrived, they went through my resume. After seeing some significant recognitions in my past work, they told me that I probably wouldn't survive in their company as I've only been receiving good feedback about my work in my prior experience. In their view, they think that's a sign that my past employers didn't really bother about my performance if I've never received significant constructive / negative feedback.

Those who have had the highest positions for 5+ years are there for a reason: they co-exist in an echo chamber where they think all their ideas and thoughts are right and bounce off on their CEO's ego. Some amazing people have tried to rearrange the system to be better and kinder, but they have either quit because they've been pushed to their limits by the management oldies. They emblazon \"brutal honestly\" as a core value, but really, it's their way of justifying being cruel to people.We've been called lazy, unproductive, and dumb to our faces. The CEO thinks Filipinos in general are stupid just because he has Canadian citizenship. lol. And yet he couldn't even scale his company or fix retention issues. BTW, he sometimes make lewd comments on people's personal lives there. He once jokingly suggested that my friend was having sexual relations with one of the employees. This friend of mine has a longtime partner outside of work BTW. The company is also a male-dominated workplace, so he would sometimes make \"harmless jokes\" to sexualize the women there. Disgusting. The CTO is none the better. Instead of helping her tech team through bug fixes or tech crashes, she would SHOUT and throw tantrums at employees. This is a CTO who can't code for shit, by the way. \"Ano naman kung mag-resign sila\" is one of her well known lines. lolI want to defend people who are working there as regular employees--I love the team I was with. Us employees would stick with each other just to get through hell. During the peak of the WFH controversy, the normal working people suffered from a lot of hate comments because their CEO and his band of self-centered corporate wannabes wanted their five minutes of fame. Employees have their own reasons for staying in the company. They can be the kindest and most supportive people. But my god, management is where the crazy is. I'm so glad I escaped that place. I now work for another tech company that actually values its employees, and of course, hybrid work. Haha.",

These are companies like BAE Systems, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, etc. Because it is government contract companies, they mostly hire US citizens because they require security clearances. It's nce because that means there wont be as much competition there either. Also alot of people feel weird due to what these companies build so many people avoid working at these companies. I worked at one of these companies out of college. It was so chill and I didnt even know it. I worked there for about 4 years in one of the radars. With radars it's 20+ year contracts so there was never a deadline and even when there was it was never that serious. We were a year late on our deadline and it was still fine. I would work on something for a month and nobody really batted an eye. Plus it's cool seeing how your code transfers to hardware when testing. Also because it's government contrcts they require employees to charge hours. You can also set your own hours. Alot of people did what they call 9/80. Basically in a 2-week pay period you work 9 hours Monday-Thursday on both weeks. Then the first friday you worked 8 hours, and that way on the 2nd friday you got it off. What I had was something called mod time. Basically since I was salary I couldnt work more than 80 hours in a 2 week period but if I somehow did I (for example if i worked 90 hours) I could transfer that extra time to my mod time bank and use it in the future to work less time. What I would do is if I had vacation coming up I'd work a few extra hours here and there, maybe even work on one of my off fridays and store it in my mod-time bank. One time I went on a 2 week vacation, used 5 days from my PTO and 5 from my mod-time. It actually is a nice way to motivate people to work a bit extra during crunch time because that way you can get a day off without having to use your PTO. I will say, You will not get paid the way you get now and the benefits are good but not amazing. I started working there in 2018 and started at about 76k, after 4 years was at 90k. I have friends who went to competitors and make about 120k. Bonuses are alright. Nothing crazy. Raises are ok as well. All of my friends who stayed in that industry say they work 20 hours tops and twiddle their thumbs for the other 20. On-call does not exist. Honestly with your current experience you can probably get a SE2 (maybe senior level) position and earn 6 figures easily. You just ahve to be mostly ok with not earning as much as you do now. You might get the base pay but you wont get the stock. But let's be honest, WLB is something that is almost priceless. I worked at FAANG after I did my time in aerospace, I hated it at FAANG. It was way more hectic than I htought and for a 50% increase in pay I was getting 200% more work and it felt like it wasnt enough. Not sure how you make now but if your compensation is like 160k (maybe 120k in base, 40k in stock) vs 120k with just base. Is that 40k in stock that worth your time to not have WLB? Also comparing between the two is almost like a 1st world problem. I always say if you like CS, but you dont love it enough to work 50+ hours consistently but just want a nice paycheck, go to aerospace/defense industry. It is widely known as chill. You will never make what they make at FAANG but you will make a good living still and if you are smart with your money, working at FAANG shouldnt matter.",

One of the hardest parts of recruiting is *retention*.\"I'm just here for the money\" to an employer means \"I'm going to leave you the moment I find an offer for more money\". You're difficult/impossible to retain in the long-term (20% annual raises is unrealistic for them). So companies are just trying to see if you have interests that align with the company so the relationship isn't empty. It makes sense.But people mis-interpret that question all the time, and think they're supposed to rattle off random BS fun facts about the company that we don't actually care about. In reality they're not really looking for a circle jerk answer like \"I'm super passionate about software that approves/rejects insurance claims\". They're not looking for genuine care for *just* their company, that's insane, and you're probably doing yourself a disservice if you're answering these questions by circle jerking like that.It's not about some fake motivation, the question is actually about your *genuine interests*. You can be honest about your *interests*, while still tying it back to the company. What kinds of problems do you like to solve? What kinds of environments do you like to work in? How does that tie back to the company? I get that we're all interested in money, and a stable job, but that's not what the question is about.For example, take a company that's user-facing: \"I really enjoy building user-facing software and find it rewarding\". Bam. An answer that can be totally genuine, is vague enough to apply to millions of companies, but specific enough that the interviewer feels warm and fuzzy inside and think they have a chance of retaining you. I've legitimately used this answer before, and have gotten the job. I was moving from an internal-tool at a company to one that's used by real humans so it was the truth.Or take a super boring company like a car insurance company (just operating off stereotypes here). \"I really like building things at scale, and the amount of customers Geico has presents some really interesting software challenges\". Again, genuine, vague enough to apply to millions of companies, specific enough to make the Geico interviewer feel warm and fuzzy. I've legitimately used the \"scale\" answer before as well, and again, I've gotten offers from those companies.I've never once lied when asked why I want to work somewhere. I know my interests, and I think about how my interests apply to the company. It's pretty easy when you focus on very high-level things like scale, company size, user-base, industry, etc.",

I've decided to leave for a reason.What you should do is hold down your current job and start job searching. If you don't line anything up... that sucks, but at least you still have a steady income. If you do get something else lined up, awesome, take it and don't look back. Don't just wait around and pray the market recovers.One thing to consider though is you might need to temper your expectations on salary/role. Salaries haven't grown out of control like they were doing leading up to 2021. They've stagnated, and even gone down in a lot of circumstances. So maybe you land some offers that are $150k+, but you also very well might not. That's something you need to consider, is joining a company with a good WLB, and competent management, that will let you keep your sanity worth taking a horizontal jump, or even a slight paycut.I know my answer for that. I'd *happily* take a paycut if it meant a better WLB and I couldn't find anything higher paying. But it's all a balance. If once you start getting offers they're all above $150k, then you know that's your current worth, so you're good. But if all you get are offers in the $120k area... you need to start reconsidering your salary expectations.Your worth in any given market is exactly what companies will offer you. No more, no less. Because you're making $140k now doesn't mean you're entitled to $150k. Just like if you were making $80k doesn't mean you're *only* entitled to $90k. The market is (or should be) agnostic of what you're currently making.And the only way to find out how you'll fare in the market is by applying. The market treats everyone differently. Just because one person can't find a job in 12 months, doesn't mean *you'll* struggle at all.My previous company's culture took a nosedive, and got a new manager that went on a powertrip and was micromanaging everybody, so I decided to leave. This was in early 2024, when the market was just as bad. I just started applying, and had a new job lined up in just under 3 months no problem.",

You know we will get to that point when you start seeing executive boards or others trying to put into the company bylaws that they cannot be replaced by AI. When they start making rules saying only human beings can run the company. However, I got to agree with everyone else, if we ever saw AI make such a leap and bound that it can replace software developers, graphic designers, ux designers, and copywriters completely, then pretty much it will likely replace a lot of jobs out there that don't require as much skill. It could even go and start replacing technical jobs like engineers or even start making its way into the medical fields. And of course, if you suddenly end up with some large percentage of the population now rendered obsolete in the labor market, and yet society still requires them to find some kind of income, that's the recipe for a dystopian chaos. It could either end up being blade runner, or it could get even crazier and people just simply revolt and forcibly take everything from those at the top.",

Your employees are numbers on a screen (this sub hates to hear this, but it’s true. Some shitty employees can seriously damage a company). Constantly restructuring your prices to get the best margins possible. Now, these aren’t bad guys in any imagination, I’m best friends with one of them. But capitalism is not forgiving, especially in a free market. Unfortunately unless you have a monopoly on something you have to be ruthless and always innovating. A lot of you can barely hold a conversation with someone. What if you lose a huge contract and profits are gone the next 6 months? Are you comfortable laying someone off or using your own capital to float the company? Can you remove your feelings from business?",

                "body": "One thing that people always bring up is how people who did academically very well tend to rarely end up as like super wealthy people. And this is supposed to show that you don't need to be super smart to become very financially successful.But what gets missed in that is that the reason that the people with great academics rarely become super wealthy is because those people don't generally have an incentive to take on huge amounts of risk to make money.That is what starting your own business does - it gives you the opportunity of either losing everything and making no money or potentially becoming extremely wealthy. And potentially both.If you're someonw who can get a BS in CS from a top tier school and/or go to grad school, get a job that pays you 6 figures straight out of school, looking at a $300K comp package by the time you're 35, potentially looking at huge stock option/RSUs packages along the way... why the hell would you take such a huge risk to start a business that is *much* more likely to fold and leave you in the hole than it is to make you wealthy?I think the answer is two-fold:1. Some people just like it. They like starting a business and ultimately if it fails, the journey was still enjoyable - more enjoyable than a safe, boring job.2. Some people *do* have the kind of innate ability to find business ideas that resonate with customers. And those people will gravitate towards those types of opportunities. Having said all that - I also think that there's a certain correlation between how \"exciting\" the business is vs. the risk. Like, most people want to start their own software company so they can grow it into some sort of unicorn and become billionaires and get to tell people how you're a tech co-founder. Not as many people want to start like a landscaping business, or a plumbing business, or a trash removal business. Those are businesses where you're much more likely to be able to make decent money without a ton of risk, but you're also unlikely to grow that into a \"fuck you money\" business. It's not impossible, but it's hard.",

The hard truth is, most jobs aren’t deeply meaningful — and that’s not a flaw. It’s just how most of the working world operates. Meaning often comes from what you build outside of work, not just within it.I know the pull of a big company can feel exciting — the brand name, the prestige, the promise of impact. It can feel like you’re leveling up. But be careful: that excitement can be short-lived. You might just be chasing a temporary dopamine hit, driven by the idea of working somewhere “big,” not the reality.The reality could include intense work stress, a cold or political culture, rigid hierarchies, stack ranking, constant reorgs, mass layoffs, lack of autonomy, or even work that conflicts with your values. And once the shine wears off, you may find yourself stuck in something worse — with fewer options to back out.A mundane job that gives you peace, stability, and time to live your life is not a failure — it’s actually a luxury. If your current role isn’t toxic or damaging, and you just find it boring, that’s not necessarily a reason to throw it all away.Now, if there are other reasons — no growth, burnout, toxic leadership, poor compensation, etc. — those are worth evaluating seriously. But if the only thing pushing you out is a lack of meaning or excitement, I’d encourage you to pause. Find or build meaning outside your job first. Don’t trade long-term peace for short-term hype.",

                "body": "IMO ChatGPT is more useful as a 'critic' for your code or as a rubber duck than as a thing to just throw your problem at and ask it to solve it. I will generally write the code in my own style and then throw it at ChatGPT and ask it to look for issues. This is great for identifying things like subtly typos, off by one errors, etc. as well as things that cause inefficiencies but not errors -- e.g. \"don't operate on this variable here because it will force a synchronization between the GPU and CPU\". But it's bad at high-level coherence of code, and coding from scratch it usually takes so much effort to describe your problem and give the proper context that it's easier to just write it yourself.I think it's a super useful tool that you should keep using. If you don't figure out a good way to incorporate it into your workflow you will probably fall behind your peers. But clearly it is also a trap where if you lean on it as a crutch your programming skills will atrophy, and you also won't understand your own codebase enough to find + fix issues that ChatGPT can't. IDK how much better or worse it is from the pre-LLM crutch of copying chunks of code from stack overflow -- at least here you can easily ask it *why* it's done what it's done.I'm in research so our code can be shitty as long as it works, so YMMV.",

Two cancelled on me less than an hour beforehand due to them going with the mystery internal candidate, one was around 300 odd miles but offered remote working, it turned out that remote working was 4 days in office, 1 wfh. The final one excitedly offered progression to a next round with a tech test that required returning within 24 hours. It was to build an e-commerce website with various stipulations with full stack implementation (UI, BL and DB) with proper unit tests. Oh sure, like I don't work for a living as it is, or have other things to do. Managed to arrange a day's A/L, this thing due in for 4pm. I duly sent the github links, the recruiter then called me ten minutes later to tell me that they had gone for an internal candidate.... I burned a day's fucking annual leave making this thing up and even cancelled going out with friends to do this shit, all for them to just casually not bother to tell me that in the first place?

A professor can distribute a <1kb text file that sets up a problem you can't possibly brute force.Numerical problems have similar properties, but graphs also help reinforce object oriented programming skills in a way that is hard to encourage with numeric problems.

High pay2. No professional certification (IE: CPA, MD, P.Eng) required3. Easy interview processwith SWE we have #1 and #2 which means we don't get #3 :(\\----Anyways, hopefully a bit of positivity here, but I felt the exact same way as you. In fact I even made a post about it a month or two ago. I kind of convinced myself that I hated LeetCode and refused to do it.Well, 1-2 months later, I still hate LeetCode but I forced myself to do it. There is just too much you lose out on if you don't. It sucks for the first few weeks but it gets easier as time goes on. You slowly learn the patterns and it all starts making sense.I'd suggest going through something like [neetcode.io](http://neetcode.io) (just go through the free roadmap on the website in order). Spent 20-30 minutes on a problem and if you can't solve it, look at the solution and come back to it in a week or two. If you repeat this enough, you will eventually start to get better at it.I know that's probably not what you want to hear right now, and it's not what I wanted to hear 1-2 months ago either. But the reality is if you want a high paying job in this field, it's pretty much required. Think about it as an investment into your future. A few hundred hours of interview preparation can lead you to a life changing amount of money.",

                "body": "Not fool: if you feel stuck you need to do something to change. Some two cents considerations:1. Career is slow. Evolution/promotion cycles take years (5+, not 2/3 years). The risk of changing too early is finding yourself in the same situation shortly after the change. For example, imagine to accept a junior role and you feel stuck again in three years time, in 6 years you'll have accumulated two junior (3 years), experiences. This might bring your next employer to consider you for a new junior role instead of a new senior role. If you wait another couple of years and push for a promotion, your next role might be directly a mid/senior role (during the interview motivation to change: I feel ready for my next role, but role is not available in my organization. As hiring manager, after 5 years, I would accept this explanation, after three years I will think that you might be rushing and your current manager is not giving a promotion because you're not ready). 2. Changing company for the same role it's mostly bringing your arse over a different seat. You will learn new things, at same level. Ensure that the economical change is worth the stress of changing / learning new things and having to rebuild the trust with your new colleagues (is 30% pay rise worth? what about 10% raise? Define your number first, and validate the figure checking the announcements)3. Everything requires effort and energy. You need to study after work, during your commute, on your weekends, or taking some days off. As you're getting paid to work, everything else goes into your free time. If your priority is changing job, then your free time should be invested there. Some times things have to be worse before they improve. Good luck with your career!",

Why do they need to be combined? Keep your laid back job, and find your people outside of work. In general, when you feel unhappy and think to yourself \"if only my circumstances were different, then I would be happy\", you are probably lying to yourself. Your perspective is what needs to be worked on. From there, you can make proactive judgements about your situation, and act accordingly on the things you can control. Thus, sacrificing your high paying job because you feel unhappy with it *may* be wise. But are you sure its the job? It sounds like you actually feel lonely, and the excitement of changing your circumstances is driving your solution to fix that. Why not use your abundance of time to put yourself out there, learn a new hobby, and set some non-professional goals for yourself? Either option will require hours of work, put you in risky situations facing rejection, and force you to meet new people.

Just protect yourself and be wary of ALL employers, no matter HOW well things are going, no matter how important you seem to be, no matter how good your relationship is.

So if you want 200, the band for L6 is probably 150-250, that’s the role they’d want to bring someone on at that price. The range posted is for the role, not the first year salary for the position. If you’re heading towards outside of the range, you’re expected to be promoted to a new band. That’s the most common case at large companies. People frequently discuss there being a band outside of that, so i’m sure there’s outliers, but I would imagine the bigger companies aren’t going to be able to move the pay band like a smaller company could because of trying to be equitable towards everyone.",

Mainly on whether you're ballsy and give 0 fucks about screwing an employer over (which is the attitude you need to have in order go get what you want as an SWE IMO), then you'll do the minimum as an SDET and begin another job search as SWE immediately. Sadly most SWE hiring managers won't see the crossover between roles, and they're right to be skeptical as most test engineers have fairly limited skills and scope that transfer directly to SWE. The ones who would be cut out to transition to SWE would be the ones who are not afraid to get their hands dirty and do some intense work, like implementing automated testing (the code-based variety, not the low code click and drop UI nonsense).About 5 years ago, I was in same spot as you - in SDET role, on a team of about 6 of same role. Out of them, I was the only one who made it out and into SWE, but I had to job hop 2 more times in 3 years to get into a good salary. And I definitely had to get out of my comfort zone a lot more than the other 5. Other 5 all stayed where they are, interviewed for some other SDET roles but ultimately never had much luck getting into SWE.",

I was a SWE for about 1.5 years then switched to this position to a different company since it was closer to where I wanted to live and had a similar tech stack. To my surprise, my role for a long time did not match the job description. I was manual testing for several months before I got to code at all. I believe test automation was not really taking off yet. Manual testing and documenting test results is important to know how to do, but it (for me at least) is awfully boring and not what I signed up for. I felt like I was not properly utilized at all and felt like I could do so much more. This changed a bit when we finally starting getting test automation tasks. When you actually get going, you're doing typical dev work (which is great for experience) but keep in mind test automation does use slightly different tech stacks than SWE work from what I have seen so that is something to keep in mind if you wanted to eventually get into other positions.The good thing is you are still in a technical position and touching code (hopefully). You are still getting that experience and I have heard people going from testers to devs. For me personally, i've found that I really love test automation and think it's really satisfying. When I first started learning it I was having a blast. Also, the work/life balance feels incredible compared to regular SWE work. For the bad, (this can be subjective) I don't think I ever get taken seriously when it comes to technical issues. Most testers here don't have SWE background and don't have any technical experience. We all essentially have the same job (which is why I was stuck manual testing forever) and I felt out of place. When I make suggestions or explanations on technical issues, leadership are skeptical only to find later on I was correct. I feel lesser than regular developers when I work. Also, being in this position I feel like I am slowly forgetting the technologies I learned in my SWE position. Working on a test automation regression suite and working on webapp backends feel very different.Regardless, I don't think it's a bad idea at all. Many people are leaving do to RTO (I am looking to leave too since I have a 4 hour commute) so it is probably a good time. Go in, see how you feel about the workflow and if it is something you can see yourself doing for awhile.",

But for example a PhD in software engineering or human-computer interaction is not as helpful in the current job market. But a PhD can also lock you out of positions. Almost no company is going to hire a PhD holder for a general junior development position because they \"know\" they'll move on.So if you want to move into a development position, then it is likely overkill unless you focus on particular positions.

Runway notification - The \"no immediate action\" comment is telling. This often means they're giving you a defined window (commonly 30-60-90 days) to either find a project or face potential termination.3. Role redefinition - They may offer you a different position at potentially different compensation if you've been on bench too long in your current role.Since you've been on bench since January (3+ months), this timing aligns with when many consultancies reassess bench employees.My advice:- Ask direct questions about timelines and expectations- Request specific metrics they'll use to evaluate your progress- Start external job searching if you haven't already. A service like Applyre might be helpful here- Accelerate your internal networking for project placementRemember that \"no immediate action\" doesn't mean \"no action\" - it usually means they're setting up a formal process that leads to a decision point.",

Leverage your strengths first and show a willingness to learn and be humble. I'm no coding savant nor do I code during my free time unless if I have to refresh in short bursts, but I found that if people give me wiggle room to learn then I do much better as opposed to the company being cutthroat from the get-go.I do want to press you on why you think casting a wide net is not preferable. For positions especially like Solutions Engineering, they prefer people to have some technical acumen, which can be gained from helpdesk, IT, QA, DevOps, SWE/Dev roles, and even having a strong university background in computer science.",

I felt the same way, and for a while, I was trying to grind out Leetcode, do side projects, etc.Then, one day, I realized I just wasn’t happy. So, instead of focusing on those things, I focused on other things that made me happy, like exploring different hobbies, going to the gym, etc. Doing this allowed me to disconnect, and guess what? When I was genuinely curious about something in tech/programming, I’d explore it! I didn’t feel any pressure to do so.Nowadays, I also focus more on growing at work. I have been in the same company for the past 8 years (the only company I have worked at), and I am heavily watering the grass where you are. I try to find areas where I can have a high impact and focus on what can make me better at work (which ends up making me a better engineer) instead of doing what the rest of the industry “expects.”Also, I realized that I genuinely enjoy helping others in their careers and offering any wisdom I can.

Things like scalability, fault tolerance, etc.In other words, they actually start to produce real outcomes and understand the impacts of their code, they're not just writing code that works.This is a generalization of course, but this is a difference I've noticed in my thinking over the past few years.A lot of engineers are stuck at mid/senior level for good, purely because they don't level up. It's not just about years of experience, but the way you think about the problems.Also about originality, pretty much no code is 100% original. Copying/modifying code is part of the job. The problem arises when you are blindly copy pasting shit and have no idea what you're doing.

You have to complete the course work at the same time as coming up with an original problem of sufficient depth and originality it will make a real contribution to the field, AND you are able to solve the problem to a degree that you can publish a real research journal paper in a serious journal in the field and that you will be allowed to publish your thesis and have your degree conferred. It is the stepping stone to a doctorate.This is NOT something you accomplish by spending a few hours a few work nights a week and then some time on the weekends.2. So given you are in a serious program you will not have time to be fully present at a full time job PLUS doing the continuing education and ramp up on the software and technology associated with your work (NOT the academic work you're doing on the side).3. But given it looks like you are going to complete your Masters and expect to work at the same time it tells your employer that a.) it is not a serious program, and b.) you are not serious about your education.As an employer we are always looking for people who have advanced their education. But we carefully weed out those who are serious about the work from those that just want to punch a ticket because it means career advancement. Lots of BS masters programs out there.

Relevant suggests that's the extent of your experience, maybe you have more!* Minor thing: just axe the \"Available 2025\". Presumably that's vestigial from internship applications or something, but it's just confusing: as a graduate any resume is to suggest you're actively available right now.* Maybe you're accidentally de-anonymizing yourself, but I don't know what the course number is in \"Company 1\". Using the plain-english name of the course (\"Undergraduate Networks\") or something is fine.Hope this helps, best of luck.",

Everything you put there can be used as a skill.The idea is you should always keep the resume to one page. So the more experience you get the more insiginficant things you should remove from your resume. For example, those projects wont really matter in 10 years or what classes you took. So an employer may see the section on college and think \"ok who cares?\". Early in your career it may bat some eyes so I say leave your college there but later on make it smaller and smaller until it basically just says Bachelor's degree at X college in 2025.I would say remove jazz ensemble as that doesnt really say anything about what you bring to the table. You can keep the projects now but like I said before, the more companies you work for you can remove one project in the future. But for now leave it all. Maybe try to make your current positions with more bullet points. For your TA role, list how may students were in the class. It's ok to embellish a bit, just dont compeltely lie about your experience. Maybe even write a cover letter explaining what you learned being a TA or at your Co-op and how that translates to the job you are looking for.",

I'm almost at 350 myself, I probably would be at 400 right now but I burnt out, more like crashed out this week, after finally getting an HM phone screen instead of a recruiter call. It did not go well even though I rehearsed, it's just I haven't had one of these in 3 years so I did not do well. If you feel it's the interview you're failing at, are you interview prepped in your industry (like with LC or System Design)? If so is it the behavioral part? Or it could just be they have super candidates that fit their specific needs like a glove so they can proceed with them, it doesn't have to be about you at all. What's the alternative then? Keep applying. More applications, more interviews. This is how my life has been in February and March (and part of January). Apply everyday for hours a day and mentally fry myself. Do this for as many days as it takes me to hit some mental milestone like 100 or 200. Stop, evaluate the resume and strategy. Take like 4 days to do that. Start applying again. Stop after hitting another milestone, consider yet another strategy change. This time maybe try some networking events either on Meetups or Eventbrite, local and online. Do that for 2 - 3 days and then take another 2 days off cuz you \"feel like you earned it\" but regret it for being stupid. Apply again for another 6 days straight cuz sometimes they post on Saturdays for whatever reason. take sunday off. Another 6 days of applying. Stop after hitting 300, time for another re-evaluation. Talk to your buddy who's just got employed after 8 months unemployed from FAANG, 8 YOE. He tells you to max the LinkedIn. Get your LinkedIn profile to the max, get Premium, fill the about section, put your resume visible to recruiters etc. Use the LinkedIn who's hiring filter to start talking to recruiters and managers. And by talking I mean messaging them wanting to connect. Rewrite your resume again, this time with more feedback from career specific discord, and looking at similar resumes on r/EngineeringResumes for people with the same role and YOE as you. Hate yourself for having to rewrite your resume, procrastinate and put it off, take 8 hours to do something that should have taken 2. Basically burn through 4 days doing this and apply to a grand total of 0 jobs. Start applying again for another 6 days straight. Revise strategy more. Have a hiring manager call that goes badly, proceed to crash out. Now what? Distract yourself. Ask Gemini to be your project advisor as you formulate more resume projects you're never going to get to. \"Hmm yes so does it make more sense to deploy to AWS with my free trial? Should I do managed or deploy on EC2\". Write up the project plan and refine with GPTs advice. Think you're doing something productive, really you're not doing jack shit you should be either A) Applying to jobs or B) practicing interview questions. Another day gone there. Spend a day playing with a new tool you just learned about. Consider learning functional programming with OCaml as you've heard that to truly develop mastery you need to be good at the functional programming principles. So you see, you're in good company. We're all in a process of either Locking In or Crashing Out as the youth would say. Lock in for as many days applying and constantly revising strategies or commisterating with fellow jobless on reddit. Or Crash out and do something that isn't really advancing you to get your job, which is applying to jobs, but doing something else. Maybe something you can pretend is productivity related, or you cast aside such pretense and are hanging out with friends if you can afford it or doing a hobby or watching TV. Feel immensely guilty. Formulate a new strategy refinement, get motivation again, apply again. Rinse and repeat until you get the job. Don't think about the numbers, they may make you go insane. I mean what's the alternative. To those who can afford to, go into a Masters program? Switch Careers if they're willing to let go of something they've worked on for so long? What about those who cannot afford to, who have no such privilege, like I do, where they need a job now and can't pay bills or make rent? Well I can't think about that too deeply, I've got to get back up on my own feet right now otherwise I'll spin out this train will fall off the rails and then NO ONE will have a job. We can only have empathy and support for others in our position, but if we delve too deeply in the pit of despair and get crushed by it, we will no longer have the sanity or ability left to apply and actually get employed.",

Could also look into low code/no code solutions like Microsoft power platform - a lot of companies are trying to go that route - it’s not as sexy as traditional development/software engineering but it’s in the same ball park. Could also look at getting Security+ certification, it’s required for all federal work in the US regardless if the federal workforce is at risk! It could be a potential employment opportunity since not everyone wants to go through the trouble of getting that cert (security+ is kind of a pain and you can’t “fake” through it)",

While it can be okay, historically you've now shown your hand that you are looking around and the company will likely do what it takes to not be in a position to need you as much as they do right now. It just changes how leadership sees you. Right or wrong, they expect loyalty and you have shown that you are loyal to the dollar, not them. That's totally logical, but it often impacts things like promotion, work assignments, etc. Even if it's not intentional, they will most likely work themselves into his position where they don't need you because subconsciously they won't trust you. It's not a given, but that's the prevailing wisdom based on general experience. Best of luck. :victory_hand:",

I have reached the point in my career where I am not learning things for some uncertain future, I am learning them to solve current problems. If my tools are working, I will use them. When they are not, I look for better solutions. I may be at the limits of current technology, e.g., Terraform. If I need to dig deep into something, I will. Hopefully, I will have time, and it won’t be in a crisis.The “Law of Leaky Abstractions” (https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/) influences what you need to know about your platform. You understand what you use every day, e.g., your web framework. When things break or hit resource limits, however, you have to understand the layers below. So, there is an API that you use to talk to the database, as well as SQL query optimization and physical database design.I hear about new things and look into them, at least enough to understand them. If someone on my team wants to use a new tool or programming language, I will read a book on it and give it a try. I have enough experience to judge whether something is too complicated to succeed. You have to choose what is worth investing time in learning. Learning core technologies like Unix/Linux or TCP/IP will be valuable for years. Early on, it’s good to go breadth-first: learn about everything, enough to know what is out there. Read a book on operating systems, networking, databases, etc. Then, go deep to become an expert for your career because it looks like an in-demand skill in a target industry.There is a phase that good developers go through where they want to master a big complex system to “do things properly.” Examples are J2EE, OpenStack, or Kubernetes. These systems are often driven by vendors and consultants. “You should use our big complex platform so you can scale. The platform is open source, but you should really buy our distribution and hire our consultants to set it up.” Sometimes, it’s better to do the simple thing that works, e.g., run an app on a dedicated server.",

Unless you go to an elite school where a company may do some form of onsite interviewing for new grads, I think your experience is par for the course.Honestly, the way \"networking\" is being approached is super wrong imo. Nowadays everyone expects a rubric and to follow a guide to network like this is some sort of behavioral or technical, but human to human interactions are always going to be pretty individual based. The best advice I can give is to organically befriend folks without the intention of asking for a referral, and then have them offer it to you on their own volition. That's what has always worked for me instead of attending a fair and hoping to get an interview round on the spot.",

That's definitely one important part of the job.However, the job is always different when you're learning. When you're learning, the hard part is getting the computer to do what you want it to do. When you're experienced, the hard part is writing it in such a way that other humans can understand and read your code, because they'll probably need to chance it later. Getting the computer to do it isn't always the hardest part.The scale and complexity are just so different. In school you're writing programs between 10 and 100 lines of code, from scratch.In a real job, you're joining a team with a million lines of code written over the past 15 years (if not longer) and all of the original authors have left. You'll spent far more time reading code, figuring out what it does - than writing new code.In school, the assignment is usually pretty clear. They tell you exactly what your program should do.In a real job, figuring out what the program should do is often more than 50% of the work. The customers ask for one thing, the managers ask for another, but once you dig into the code and understand how things actually work you often end up realizing that neither of them actually understands all of the nuances. So the big challenge is interpreting a bunch of contradictory and vague requirements and turning it into a specification that solves people's actual problems, rather than the problems they think they have.That said, there's definitely an aspect to the job that's similar to your first programming class. You will be writing code. You will be fiddling with it until it works. You will get a feeling of satisfaction when you get it to work. And just getting it to work is never enough - someone else also needs to review your code and approve it - both in school and in work. So it's definitely a taste of the real thing.",

                "body": "There's a labor attorney that I follow on instagram that offers some interesting advice regarding situations like this.Two things I would do:1. Send an email to HR and tell them that you're not satisfied with their findings and that you will be hiring legal counsel to help you with this situation as you feel like this is now a \"hostile work environment\" and that you are concerned about \"retaliation\". Use those terms in quotes exactly, as that is the HR legalese for \"you did something illegal that you can get in a lot of trouble for if, as HR, you didn't do anything about it\". I would also ask that if you are to keep working with her, that HR provides some way to ensure that you're not every again working alone with her (if physical safety is an issue for you).2. Start documenting everything. Every instance of any treatment that you feel is inappropriate, write down when it happened, how it happened, what was said, what it was about, etc. Anything you can get in writing (emails, slack messages, etc.) document that as well. If you have a conversation offline with this person, follow that up with an email summarizing the conversation. Anything egregious that happens, continue to send that to HR, but also document what happened AND that you notified HR. Here's the thing: you don't want to just quit. Your goal here is one of 3 happy outcomes:1. They fire you illegally, in which case you hire an attorney (most employment law attorneys seem to work on contingency, meaning they only get paid if they get you money).2. They get their shit together. Sometimes HR just tries to sweep everything under the rug because it's easy, not necessarily because they have any interest in defending an offender. If it becomes clear to them that it's gonna be harder to defend the offender than it is to just fire them for cause... they might just fire your boss. Or maybe they reprimand them and move you to a different boss. In either case, your situation improves AND HR probably still knows that they need to be really careful not to f\\*\\*\\* with you.3. They offer you a severance package to leave. All of those options are superior to just quitting. Which is why I'd recommend not just quitting, but at least making their lives difficult on the way out.Now, I understand that the concern is \"well, what about my mental health? I don't want to keep being berated by my boss!\".Easy - next time your boss starts berating you, leave. You can either tell her something to let her know you won't be treated that way if you can/want to (e.g., \"this is a professional environment and I will not be talked to like that\"), you can be even more insulting and tell her you'll be ready to talk to her when she calms down (e.g., \"it sounds like you're not ready to have this conversation in a professional manner at this time\"), or you can literally just walk away if that's all too much. At that point, go somewhere where there are other people so that if she *does* make a scene, you have witnesses.COuple that with the following mentality: if you're already going to quit, then the worst thing that can happen to you - which is getting fired - is no worse than quitting. So in your mind, you can even just think \"ok, I am already fired. Nothing I can do can make my situation worse\" and therefore start worrying about it. I think that's the trap that people fall into, that somehow a toxic job is something that they still need to be worried that they're going to fail at. Nah, if it's a toxic job and you're being set up to fail, fail. Don't work yourself to death and worry yourself to death trying to do a good job for people who are shit.",

Some are fully scams, so you need to look up the company and do your due diligence. but others are companies that want to hire, but are trying to limit their risk.A bad new hire can cost a company up to $1M in total damages (the more junior the position the less the impact, 1M is for a senior/principal position), this includes base salary lost, HR time, recruiter fees if any, hiring managers time, potential damage to codebase, potential damage to team members skills and morale. and with the upcoming risk of a recession there is the added risk of the company performing poorly and needing to downsize. Contract employees are the way to shift the risk on to the employees head and off the company, it doesn't mitigate all the risks, but it makes it much easier to layoff the person if they turn out to be a bad hire or the company underperforms. My personal example: I was hired for a 6 month C2H from a company that was expecting to get a nice big government contract, this was more than a few years ago so current events were not factors. They were staffing up with contract employees to turn them into full time when they got the contract. a different company got the contract and all the contract employees were let go instantly.Even in At Will states, lots of companies are hesitant to lay off people due to the risk of legal action, so they want to be absolutely sure when they do; I have a story of a co-worker openly lying to everyone on our team and our boss, committing time fraud, and more, he wasn't fired until police were called on him for other behavior. contract employees at most just have to be paid out the last few months, so it only costs the company what is relatively little cash",

Even junior roles generally require some experience in software, analytics, database work etc. The reason often given for this is that being able to code means you can be put to use fairly quickly in a swe position doing incremental changes and bug fixes, but that same coding ability means very little in a DE context if you don't also have some prerequisite knowledge of data infrastructure, and a true junior would need a lot of hand holding to get anything done. That being said, data engineering is a subdiscipline of software engineering, and you can apply if you think you're qualified. To caveat that slightly, the range of roles called \"data engineer\" can range from \"glorified SQL monkey working with a drag and drop GUI\" all the way to \"distributed cloud systems architect developing systems to ingest and process terabytes of streaming data in real-time\". So it's worth looking into the company to see what they are looking for within that spectrum to see if it aligns with your career goals.",

People who spend their whole careers as power users of a niche product will learn the hacky details of that product without actually understanding the technical details of how/why their QoL hacks work.You might need to listen to their concerns and add new features for power users.- Is there a use case for searching on partial values? Like they know the last 7 digits of a phone number, but not the area code? The person has a last name like \"Schwarzenegger\" and instead of remembering how to spell it, you just search for \"Schw\" and expect it to be near the top?- They guessed that \"allusers\" or \"*\" url because what they want is a quick way to see all users. Does your app expose that somewhere? Is there a different URL they can go to to get it? They want it, why not build it? (Probably need to paginate, but might actually get pushback if they just want a full on list)- What does the current process for deleting something look like? Does it take multiple clicks and involve slow page loads? Was the old way of \"just type the exact URL of the thing I want to delete\" faster than the new way? You need to give them a faster delete option.Anyhow, if these tickets are going straight from users to engineers, that's a structural problem in your org. You should have a product manager or somebody doing triage on these, and they should be the one intercepting a lot of that stuff and having the \"what are you really looking to accomplish here\" conversation with the user.",
