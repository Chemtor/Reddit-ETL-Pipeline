Sometimes, it does seem quite ridiculous though and I do feel that many employers actually have unreasonable expectations and are so hostile/skeptical of others' work experience that they want perfection.",

I recently joined a new company and I'm absolutely blown away by the use of delivery teams, lack of anyone doing real work outside the data engineer and dashboard critiques from end users. Then they wonder why they can't find someone or when they do ends up telling them \"I haven't done that before\" and throws off the quarters goals, which is unacceptable. No idea how to deal with it but I really think they're just using the shit job market to expand our responsibilities to save money in the short term. In 5 years when the data no longer makes sense and they need to find another excuse for a redesign we will see the find out part of fuck around and find out.",

But what I think what actually got me hired was that a Senior Engineer at the company who is respected by my new boss vouched for me pretty hard.It’s dumb that we have to do a ridiculous song and dance for employers in the interviews but that’s the metric we’ve all collectively agreed to compete with each other in. When the person making the decision likes you they will scrutinize less over the petty things and hire you for those transferable skills and mostly that they could see themselves actually want to work with you.",

The position is unlikely to go to anyone who is external. Direct competitor has a chance if they are beyond stellar. You are competing with applicants who have connections plus are experienced plus have direct knowledge of the domain.Another company I know put up a fake job posting for DE (the position was already hired, but needed to repost due to a migration to a new hiring systems). They purposely only posted the position on their public website and did not post on any job boards. Received 300 applicants in less than 1 day.Sad thing was, their automated rejection email says: “we have reviewed your background and qualifications and determined that we do not have a position for you” pretty fucked up considering that not a single applicant was reviewed since it was a fake posting.This position did go to someone who needs training though, that person had alot of experience in DA, but none in DE, and since high DA salaries are in-line with entry level DE, they know the applicant is capable and will stay. The company received many stellar applicants, but didn’t have the budget to pay for their asking salaries. Also, they wouldn’t lowball someone experienced since that person will quit the second the market improves.",

But you can be displaced by the perception that one is “good enough.”I think the arguments on both sides of the LLM table are misplaced.Every conversation online about AI replacing humans is centered around looking at it from an individualistic perspective. But that’s not how labor works in the workplace.Essentially, both of the below statements can be true:- AI can’t be a drop-in replacement for Data Engineering- I, as a Data Engineer, can be replaced with AI.If a company begins using LLMs to perform tasks that are repetitive/boilerplate/specific to the strengths of the LLM, and that work makes up a X% of the labor of their data engineering department, allowing for more time from each individual data engineer to perform more work suited for the human DE, then justification for keeping ALL of the original labor isn’t there - assuming the same amount of work is being done.When looking at this from the macroeconomic scale, yes the usage of LLMs to increase productivity in the workplace - whether by agentic automation or simply by using it as a quicker and more efficient task-oriented search engine, WILL have an effect on the number of jobs available in DE and very well could lead to YOU being replaced by an AI, while not replacing all DEs.At any rate, I generally agree with your points on side-stepping being labeled for replacement by embracing and becoming the expert in the business with LLMs usage. It’s what I’ve done and led to me being promoted and now sitting in a much higher position within the company I work for.",

That's pretty straight forward. A data warehouse is just a very, very large database. There are two different database areas, operational and analytic. They are characterised by the SLAs you have on the data. Smaller databases are normally used for operational because you need fast response times. In analytic, the response times aren't normally as critical but they handle quite a bit more data; much of it historic. In a perfect world, if you could do both with the same system, you would. The problem is the cost to do them all in one. Of course, these are gross oversimplifications but it gets the idea across. In addition to the database component, the surrounding data ecosystems are different but they have many commonalities.Data Lake and Lakehouse are both marketing BS. Nothing more. The same is true of \"medalion architecture.\" It is an attemp to make the standard three tier (staging, core, semantic) into to something different by giving it a new coat of paint. Someone noticed that you can store quite a bit of extra \"stuff\" in the staging layer beyond what the database needs. Of course, the marketing folks thought that needed a new name. I think we are at the point now where we just keep adding buzzwords to the names. It's like a technical pin the tail on the donkey. The latest is \"now with more AI!.\" A data ecosystem is a complicated enough of an endeavor without all the confusion that is being pushed on it purposefully. I haven't even started in on Inmon, Kimball, Stars, Snowflakes, the various normal forms, ETL/ELT, etc. Good luck on your journey.",

A lot of decisions don't have a massive checklist of \"all the things I need to know\" that, when you get to 70% acts as a threshold triggering the decision. A lot of decisions rely on knowledge and experience and attempting to quantify that at all ends up falling into the same trap that dashboards do: Qualitative judgements are only loosely connected to quantitative amounts.I don't doubt Jeff Bezos knows what he's doing up to a point but I have my doubts his actual working practice bears much resemblance to the principle he's expressing here. Plus I expect there's a healthy amount of survivorship bias going on when analysing whatever Bezos is doing - 100th idiot syndrome if you will. Just because it worked for him doesn't mean it will work for anyone else.",

Numbers need to be put in context and fit into some kind of overarching narrative before it clicks. The great writers of Substack already understand this. Think Scott Alexander, Noah Smith, Nate Silver. Or go read Wolf Street. MUCH more intuitive than any business dashboard I've ever looked at.But the flip side of that is: when are dashboards appropriate? Should all analysis just be ad-hoc and narrative-driven? My intuition is that you should curate a very small, simple set of business-wide KPIs and put them on an internal website and have them update reliably a few times a day. For anything more strategic or involved, where there is a key decision to be made, you need analysts to put on the researcher hat and go do the analysis (hopefully with a nice clean data model that the DEs have set up). You need them to be opinionated. Dashboards aren't opinionated, they just tell you what happened without any further guidance.",

People usually use Python things for data engineering but in the end, when it comes to high performance and streaming which involve more low level optimization, data engineering and backend dev are closer too. They share similar principles related to system design or distributed computing...I think this would be a good opportunity for you if you want to advance your career into low level stuffs which may help in the future",

There are great books that outline the math and engineering behind it, but the only real way of becoming a data engineer is dipping your toes in keeping data stacks running.3- Most successful way I know: solid stem education. Acquire work experience consuming data as an analyst, data scientist, etc. Slowly transition your work to backend/production systems e.g. making changes to ETL code, finding out infrastructure requirements, doing incident response, thinking about data modelling. Do this for long enough, and you're now able to reason about data along its journey to whatever end-consumer there is.",

But they don’t replace hands-on work. So the best learning path combines both: read to understand the concepts, then build mini-projects to apply them. For example, try building a pipeline that pulls data from a public API, stores it in a cloud bucket or local database, and runs some transformation on a schedule. We have a lot of interactive courses, so feel free to check out our site and browse! And finally, don’t get overwhelmed by the tool soup. AWS, GCP, Azure, Snowflake, Spark, Kafka, dbt... You don’t need to learn everything at once. Start with one cloud provider, one orchestration tool, one data warehouse. The concepts transfer well once you understand them.",

Mostly, I was transforming and consolidating data using on prem tools to automate our processes. After that, I took a BI manager role with our data science team (data science was initially part of BI at my company). Spent a year there until a big reorganization occurred. We moved to the cloud, data science became its own thing, a data engineering team got stood up. I initially moved with data science, but it was clear my skills did not mesh well except for the data engineering, but they wanted to move all DE work over to the DE team eventually. I took that opportunity after just over a year in that position. On day 1 with the DE team, we were building stop gap solutions. I spent that time getting really good with pyspark. I already had a large background with pandas, so pyspark was very easy to figure out. From there, we had consultants build our long term data platform while the full timers worked on ad hoc requests to keep the business moving and start making a name for our team. During this time, I learned I was really good at programming business logic and transformations. I was not nearly as good at ingestion or tools outside of databricks. Eventually our SAAS integration started, and I was working directly with consultants. I was well out of my depth, but I learned the process pretty quickly, patched some early holes in my technical knowledge, and got rolling. I learned that I was really good at functional programming, but pretty bad at DevOps and way out of my league in OOP. Now, I'm working on a project to rebuild our data platform to one easier to maintain, more flexible, and moves data faster. I'm focusing more on architecture, but making sure that these new consultants are training my team and me every step of the way. My manager assigned me as lead for this project. My manager wants me to train to become an engineering architect. Whereas I'm a decent engineer with a lot of potential to grow there, I am kinda a natural on all things architectural. So that is how I'm leaning now.",

Learning rag and llms and what can feed them best (feels a bit like data mining). Possibly data mining (mathematically looking at data and performing tasks such as imputation and quality analysis on numerical variables). Mlops. Helping build agents for llm or buidling semantic layers. Helping find nlp tools for clean data and showing what happens when crap enters the system.

        "body": "Hi Guys, Snowflake employee here & just wanted chime in with a bit more info on this topic so you guys are clear what the new feature is and what it is not.Previously, we had 2 main methods for Spark users to interact with or leverage Snowflake vectorized engine.1. Snowpark Dataframes: These were close to PySpark APIs but (not exact). Initially (2,3 years ago) they were limited in coverage but as of now, do cover most of PySpark functions so if you tried it before, experience is much different now. Because Snowpark was not exactly as PySpark, it did require about 10% code refactoring so some migration effort was necessary. Benefit of Snowpark dataframes was that they were not held back by OSS PySpark Functions so you had access to Snowflake specific ML & AI functions and the newest features. Snowpark Dataframes allowed you to leverage 100% Snowflake Serverless Compute engines for SQL, Python, Java & Scala UDFs.2. Snowflake Spark Connector: This was meant to connect existing Spark clusters to Snowflake to read, transform & write data to/from Snowflake. Driver has some optimization where some of the aggr functions could be performed in Snowflake before delivering the data to Spark cluster but the Spark Compute Clusters did bulk of the work where Snowflake was input and/or output for the data.The new Apache Spark Connect from Snowpark combines best of both worlds Apache Spark code that developers love & use for Data Engineering & ML and Snowpark which gives access to serverless vectorized engine for SQL, Python, java & Scala jobs.Recent innovation from Spark Connect from OSS Spark community was the catalyst that Snowflake was waiting for to integrate OSS Spark in to Snowflake ecosystem the right way.This means you can now run your existing Spark jobs with 0 code changes on Snowflake compute which comes with many added benefits such as unified security & governance, performance, auditability & simplicity as compute is serverless and requires little to no optimization or maintenance.How it works is that the OSS Spark sends the job details to Snowflake, Snowflake generates a new execution plan based on the original details that can run on Snowflake Vectorized Engine (SQL, Python UDFs & etc.) sot he original code remains the same but where & how it executes in back are different.Our initial focus for Public Preview was majority of the customer use cases that we have seen which are Data Engineering & ML workloads that use SQL, Dataframes & UDFs. We are actively working on collecting feedback and build support for other new Spark features supported by the OSS Spark Connect project so definitely would love any feedback that you guys have to take to our PMs.I understand this may not be the right fit for every Spark team. If your team enjoys tweaking Spark params & cluster configs to get every ounce of performance out of clusters then this solution may not be a good fit. However, if the team enjoys Spark code and has a ton of existing pipelines but would rather spend their time building & deploying new projects vs. optimizing & maintaining cluster, it will be a great benefit. Especially if Snowflake is the downstream analytics layer as it would eliminate any Export & Import jobs(time & cost) between Spark & Snowflake environments. The main goal is to meet developers where they are by offering ways for them to leverage advances Snowflake capabilities by offering them different means to work with Snowflake in their preferred language and coding frameworks.If you guys give it a try and have inputs don't hesitate the reach out and let us know feedback.The good, bad & the ugly.",

More like $5k/year tops. Here was my approach:* Sources: AWS Aurora Postgres database, various APIs, potentially Netsuite down the road* Destination: Timescale (now TigerData) database hosted using Timescale Cloud but linked to our VPC via VPC peering -- **this is where the bulk of our budget is going**.* Tech stack: * Pulumi TypeScript to build infrastructure in AWS to support the open source version of the orchestrator, mostly using ECS Fargate for the containers and leveraging existing networking infrastructure * Dagster OSS as the orchestration (went back and forth between this and Prefect before landing on Dagster) * Sling as the core extract and load software to sync data from Postgres to Timescale * dbt core running within the Dagster framework to apply transformations on new data in Timescale * Python scripts orchestrated by Dagster to get data from APIs. Originally wanted to try dltHub but ended up just writing my own scripts using requests (probably not ideal) * Monitoring/notifications via Slack app integration (originally was using [ntfy.sh](http://ntfy.sh) for quick and dirty SNS topic-like notifications, getting Slack approval was challenging) * Dockerized local development using the pre-built Timescale and Postgres Docker images + the same custom Dockerfile I use for Dagster production deployments to keep things as simple as possible.Data is synced from Postgres every 4 hours and daily for the APIs as that's essentially all that's required by our business. The Postgres sync with Sling runs incrementally and is complete in about 20 minutes, which is not optimized by any means but is sufficient for our purposes. For context, our entire source database was only about 330GB and I wasn't replicating the entire thing.Writing YAML for Sling and later for dbt was a huge time slog for 100+ source tables; I leveraged an AI tool (Claude) to help generate a lot of that code after manually building some of the transformation models myself. Bonus to this is it was the generated YAML was pretty consistent for common columns like `created_at` or `_sling_loaded_at` audit columns.I am the lone developer and maintainer of this project -- most people on my team are unaware that I'm even working on a project like this, let alone what its purpose might be. It has been a wild and frustrating ride at times without many others to turn to for help, but it's been a great learning experience as well. Throughout the development, I tried to stress simplicity, modularity, and ease of maintenance as much as possible. Once a larger team becomes available to support something like this, you can make different decisions like moving your data replication tasks to something like Fivetran or using a real data warehouse like Snowflake (again, budget constraints for us).~~Best of luck to you!~~ Edit: I reread the question and realized this is hypothetical but best of luck if this is ever you in the future all the same! Also I feel like my stack is pretty interchangeable with SQL Server as the source, just use different connectors with Sling (I believe SQL Server is supported).",

We used a parsing library to extract those source tables from sql code of the queries (super nice and we got it working FAST. I really thought it would be very difficult). We even got manager-employee hierarchy into the mart, so we can use BI tools now to show things like \"which tables are queried most often by people under director X?\" or \"what is the total attributed cost of running those queries?\"\"... for direct subordinates of X?\", \"... for all subordinates of X?\", \"... for all subordinates of X, who are not managers?\"And since we did good modelling in the data mart, PowerBI, does not need any extensions, or fancy DAX to answer such questions.",

It literally saved them hundreds of hours of manual work in the 5+ years it has been operational.",

That said, I already knew how to do this. I could correct it when it was wrong or sub optimal. But it made it a lot easier. I’m pretty bullish on experienced and knowledgeable engineers making a lot of use of AI. I wouldn’t trust it to do any foundational work/spec creation that drives other projects unless output was verifiable. So I’d rather organize the metadata myself than have an AI guess at semantic meaning, for example. Cuz people will use it wrong without much question. A pipeline on the other hand can be verified - input and output.",

It’s not perfect, but great for first drafts.* **Error triage and alert summaries**: Agents scan logs and Slack alerts, flag likely causes, and group repeated failures so your team doesn’t waste time digging.* **Workflow bots**: Think of agents like wrappers around dbt jobs or Airflow tasks. You can “ask” them things like, “why did this job fail?” and they’ll trace logs and give a quick readout.But yeah—data access and vendor lock-in are real concerns. What helps:* Keep critical logic in your pipeline code, not in the agent* Let the agent suggest, but not act unless a human approves* Keep agent inputs small (e.g., just metadata or logs, not full datasets)Curious what tooling you’re testing?",

We’re using a setup with DataBahn that lets us run enrichment and tagging before anything hits the main stack.

Ideally, your org should set up an AWS Organization (if not done already) and provision guardrails vis tools like service control policies and AWS config rules to enforce standards and prevent people from doing anything too crazy. There should also be a standard for how things go from dev to test to prod. But that might be beyond the scope of your team, so the best way to maintain your sanity in the short term would be to provision a new AWS account within your organization, and provide access to only the data engineering team. Analysts and the like don’t need AWS console access if they’re just making JDBC connections to some data service. If you share details about your planned architecture I can give more specific advice, but I definitely recommend not trying to deploy this in the chaos of any of your existing accounts.",

I don't want to spend CPU cycles testing MS SQL Server features that have been in place for decades.If you don't mean that kind of dupe, then that starts a valuable but lengthy discussion about what we DO mean by a duplicate; the answer for us varies by table/entity, and is generally too complex for any off-the-shelf tool to handle (that I've seen).So in short, for us the only business value is in a much more manual DQ process (manually defining what DQ means, not manually checking it!).

Confluent Cloud and Integrate offer simplified options if you are okay with microbatch intervals and less real time granularity.For schema drift, landing raw JSON or AVRO into a semistructured column (like VARIANT in Snowflake) can help. Then handle transformations in a way that tolerates missing or new fields.

Certainly there are better and worse choices to make but trying to squeeze the square peg into a round hole is gonna suck. Putting unstructured data into a structured database is going to be painful no matter which way you slice it.But the real game is winning the organizational battles required to begin actually addressing the root causes of the pain and bringing everything into a unified stack. Iot has changed, when it first started it simple scalar data like temperature and there was only a couple of things going on. These days there are much higher expectations on what the devices need to do. They expect always on at the edge monitoring of complex sensors and it takes a fundamental change in the org to get that done. You need your ml or data team to get in the drivers seat and make the pieces fit all the way from the firmware up to the customer UI’s and tying it all together. Wanting it to be simple of easy won’t help. Look at the most painful problems you have, and start identifying what the true technical root cause is and then begin working to make it better. If you don’t have a person or people with this sort of cross stack powers to actually drive the platform as a whole towards success it’s just going to always be an underpowered brittle mess.That’s my 2c anyway. But concretely it’s important to figure out what needs streaming to meet sla’s vs what should be done batch wise for streaming. Companies tend to commit hard to one approach or the other and then struggle to make everything fit that paradigm. You will need both and you need to comfortable with that.

First came BI developers/ETL engineers, they built warehouses and reports so analysts could do their work. Later, data analysts became more self-serve and focused on interpreting the past. Then data science took off, using that historical data to predict the future.Both analysts and scientists quickly ran into the same problem: clean, reliable, well-structured data was hard to come by. That’s when the modern data engineer role emerged, not just to build infra, but to make data usable at scale.Early DE work was infra-heavy, but as platforms matured (Databricks, GCP, Azure, Snowflake), more of the plumbing became automated. That doesn’t mean the job is going away, it means the focus shifts. You spend less time reinventing connectors and clusters, more time on things like modeling, scalability, governance, security, cost optimization, and integrating multiple data sources into a coherent system.This is also where analytics engineers come in, they work closer to the business, doing a lot of SQL/dbt modeling and BI integration. In small teams, AEs might cover most data needs; in bigger orgs, DEs still handle the scale, complexity, streaming, and compliance side.If anything, the “easy” DE tasks are disappearing, which makes deep skills more valuable:* Real-time pipelines (Kafka, Pub/Sub, Flink)* Data contracts, governance, compliance* Multi-cloud / cross-platform integration* ML data pipelines & feature stores* Performance and cost tuning at scaleI wouldn’t say DE is shrinking, it’s just changing shape. The safest way to future-proof yourself is to stay close to both the business context *and* the technical challenges. Platforms will keep automating, but stitching them together, governing them, and making them serve the business well? That’s still human work.",

It's closer to that type of work, but you will make significantly more money.

You also have no clue which one you would like in practice, especially if you don't have experience. You're just guessing.

Taking a dependency on this could potentially be very expensive in the future. If you have small data utilization (and plan to remain at that level), then don't see an issue from a pricing perspective.Another thing to consider here is making sure you temper expectations of the wider business. With no data engineers and a single analyst, there is limited investment in the data function (based on the provided information). Given the connector choice, maybe you report to finance? Regardless, it's one thing to get the data from point A to point B, it's another to ensure the data is correct. For example, what happens if they change the configuration of Salesforce objects? How will you handle that downstream?I say the above to warn of the trap of the business thinking that increased access to data easily results in more data utilization.",

This was through truly backbreaking amounts of study, often around technical subjects that were only tangentially related to data engineering (microprocessors, operating systems, machine learning, data science, maths) in addition to spending plenty of time learning about core software engineering (languages, design patterns, best practices, tooling) and throwing time at random new tech constantly (agentic workflows, vector dbs, scalable anonymization techniques, heck even occasionally frontend stuff) *in addition* to the obvious stuff (data modelling, query optimisation, infra/cloud). I read the entire Postgres docs from start to finish at one point. Waste of time? Sure, maybe not the most strategic choice.

I did a lot of data transformation work at first, which is what I love anyways. Eventually, I had to expand and that was painful. But firstly, I gained additional technical skills which is always good. Secondly, I found that I have a pretty good intuition for architecture, and my manager is eagerly supporting that. Thirdly, I made a name for myself working across teams to build data engineering solutions. That meant that I did not always need to be the most technical guy.

I was sympathizing with you a bit until I got to your last bullet, then you completely lost me. The fact you don't care about the domain and you don't want to learn more tells me you belong in the struggle you're in. You put yourself there and you don't care about getting yourself out the whole you dug. Thus, the only advice I can give you as a senior engineer is to find some passion, stop crying about what you did to yourself, and get better.",

I have seen few customers who built their own custom system similar to this but it usually involves a custom middle layer managed externally where the queries are triggered from. Like a python code that fires up series of Data Enginnering jobs in a round robin style on to different warehouses. Havent seen anything that receives a query from an external tool, interject then routes it to different warehouses. It would have to also route the resultsets back to the client so not sure how that will work.Part of the Snowflakes major appeal is the security and scalibility so unless the solution runs fully within Snowflake, the security may be an issue for some as well support if things stop working.I guess hard to say w/o knowing how it is architected.",

A transaction is intended to be a single large block of rows. To wit contention is intended to be low.Taken together, that you think iceberg is a transactional database is your main problem. The design desire of iceberg is to be able to have atomic writes to disk from ephemeral stateless writers for the purpose of retaining and accessing large amounts of data for long periods of time. Any alternative not involving optimistic concurrency necessarily involves a single stateful system that needs to be on for as long as the data needs to be accessible which is absurdly dumb and massively expensive. The only reason databases and database servers exist is to literally provide a lock. To the degree you can avoid locks you can cut massive cost by making the computer independent of the retention process. Don’t get me wrong iceberg is very rough around the edges and leaves a lot to be desired but that you neither understand why it exists or what it’s good for wouldn’t be something I’d publish this widely on the internet.",

They've essentially looked at a sledgehammer and decided that it is 'not a serious tool' because it requires more effort, is more unwieldy, and lacks a claw compared to a regular hammer.The article indicates it is a 21 minute read, so I'm going to be somewhat brief here, but essentially other than various truisms the entire thing can be broken down. The article is also quite sarcastic and derogatory, which gives me the impression that the author is more interested in puffing themselves up than earnestly engaging with the problem space.I'll pick a few things that are emblematic of the disconnect between the author's basis for criticism and what iceberg is actually for.---> It also means that the overhead of each file is large (in the order of 1KB).Iceberg (and DeltaLake/Hudi, I'll not mention again) is intended for storing many gigabytes to terabytes and petabytes of data in a given 'table' -- a few KB of overhead is going to be less than 0.001% of the data you're actually reading or writing. You'll likely have more overhead within the parquet files themselves if they've been split relatively small, and your choice of compression algorithm is going to have orders of magnitude more impact.> Putting the burden on the clientThe entire point of the base layer of 'lakehouse' implementations is to decouple storage from the compute. That is: *there is no server* to even consider to be 'putting the burden on the client'. You may as well complain that trains have to run on rails.> If clients need to write manifest lists that point at all Manifest Files - we have already leaked the location of every single S3 file worth stealingThe path to an S3 file is not sensitive data, it is protected through access control to the bucket. You may as well complain that clients connecting to databases leaks the IP of the database.Iceberg is not intended to solve row-level security for you in the same way that parquet does not solve row level security. It simply isn't in the scope of what it is trying to solve, because it isn't seeking to replace a database.> Did we not learn in CS 101 that if you need O(n) operations to append to a list, you are probably doing something wrong?This section completely ignores something that the author *should* know quite well, that sometimes you exchange processing time for space consumption. For metadata files the repeated data is utterly insignificant compared to all the other reads and writes that are happening, but because we're dealing with remote storage accessed over a network then when reading it is much more efficient to retrieve a single larger block of data than make many individual requests.In fact the author later whinges that a query has to do sequential 2 metadata reads to locate the parquet files it needs - so they *do* understand the benefit of compacting data together, but they just choose to ignore that in this instance so that they can heap more derision on Iceberg.> Optimistic Concurrency - Why it does not work! ... is there ever a point to optimistic concurrency control? ... In Iceberg, two concurrent writes to a table will ALWAYS be in conflict A section in which the author almost realises they may be lacking some perspective, but plows on ahead anyway.First of all, Iceberg is considered about the overall efficiency for readers and writers that are operating in completely isolated processing environments, and when writing data they are going to be writing a *lot* of data and it may take a relatively long time (seconds to minutes). A complete pessimistic lock would prevent concurrent non-conflicting writes, which means you could only ever effectively have one writer to a table, which would be an unnecessary restricting if you have pure-append ingestion processes, and pure-append ingestion processes are very common in lake/lakehouse implementations.And yes, you can have non-conflicting *data* writes even if the metadata writes are conflicting, but as I've mentioned in here the metadata is insignificant compared to the data in intended use cases. Getting a writer to rewrite even a 1MB metadata file is a significantly better tradeoff than having them sit idle for many seconds to minutes, when their compute runtime is costing you money. And that's if they even get a conflict - subsecond timings on completion of concurrent writes is pretty rare for the intended use cases.> \"Tables grow large by being written to, they grow really large by being written to frequently\".Complete bullshit. My largest tables are either full snapshots taken periodically from sources, or they use streaming ingestion with buffered writes. In fact streaming ingestion is directly a use-case for optimistic concurrency - each partition can have a separate writer and they can all write data concurrently and commit periodically.> Did I mention that 1000 commits/sec is a pathetic number if you are appending rows to table?Absolutely unhinged criticism. The target format is parquet and the default row group size for writers is on the order of 100k to 1M rows. To hit a required 1k commits/sec you'd be looking at ingesting >100M rows/sec and 100GB/sec of *compressed* data while having each individual parquet file be committed one-by-one with a thousand independent writing processes.What you would *actually* do is have a partitioned writer that has 1000 concurrent parquet writes, and it commits once per second. The author is just *inventing* problems.> Intermezzo: Iceberg REALLY does not want to be a databaseThen why are you critiquing it like it is one?This is ridiculous. I'm out, and I'm barely half way through the article.",

But it allow your to grow, avoid potential vendor locking, reduce DW cost by doing preaggregation yourself before loading it in redshift, etc, etc. But all of this requires a lot of effort? Which might be slowing you down to achieving you company goals. If you have a big enough data team it make sense, if you are pretty small the loading directly to redshift is very appealing.You’ll always have the possibility to offload the data from redshift to s3 in the futur if that’s needed but you won’t shoot yourself in the foot and not deliver anything for the first 6 months.In terms of pricing, you are analyzing storage cost which shouldn’t be a factor imo. Yes storage is way cheaper in s3. But the size of data you have in SAP isn’t probably not that big. You need to define that first. For example I don’t see a world where you have a terabyte of data to load from SAP to redshift. A terabyte of text files is a LOT of data for things that are entered manually or mostly in SAP. Now let’s say you have a terabyte of data because your company has a lot there (which you probably don’t) then having the storage cost in redshift would be something are 25$ per month for the hole data set. Our conversation here cost more than that. Depending on type of s3 storage you might save a lot but storage is negligible for small datasets.The real DW cost is compute, and that needs to be considered. I know the business wants SAP and ALL other sources, but you should chunk this a lot so you endup delivering things in small chunks. Everyone wants everything yesterday but that’s not how things work. Start with SAP but not all, the most relevant concepts because there’s probably a lot of tables there to sync, clean, transform to make the data usable. The goal of you DW is to make data usable but also to get a single source of truth. If you just load raw data in and let business build dashboard on top of the raw data I can tell you this is going to be a mess in 2 months. Start small, get the table requirements that allow you to clean the data, make the data available, then repeat.To go back on pricing, if for example you think that you have A LOT of data multiple terabytes. And that the storage cost will be around 1000$ a month because you have 40 terabytes to load and that can be an issue, then I can assure you, you won’t like the Fivetran Bill. If you need to think about the storage cost, then you need to rearchitect this because Fivetran is not the option you are looking for. It’s very good to load data quickly. It gets insanely expensive when you start to really use it. Most companies won’t have issue with fivetran cost because most company don’t have a lot of data.Good luck",

See correct config to save processing and make it write faster, as no retention period. You may also apply clustering rules here.Then I would ask, do you really need redshift? I know it exists and basically how it works but never worked since I mostly only move data from staging area to silver and gold areas in S3, using again Delta/iceberg, leaving data with dimensional modeling as needed by business.I generally use Databricks/snowflake to process it,but so far I know, you can also use Glue for it.Delta/iceberg have acid properties/time travel/and others that can be selected and designed as your need, replicating redshift pros.If it is enough, you totally save redshift costs, and got a simpler arch in only one place. If you really need redshift you send only totally needed tables there. And allow silver/gold tables being connected to other tools in future.I am totally opened to comments here and up to suggestions if it works or not.",

Be transparent about costs, but still go with it. More maintainable means you can add more features, fix breakages faster, and have fewer breakages. Your end users would vastly prefer that you don't have outages on critical delivery days, your boss will prefer that you get this finished and off your plate to work on the next thing, your successors will prefer an easier onboarding, and you will look better throughout.

But for now, we use only 50-60 tables, it’s just that we don’t know what tables will we use exactly in the future based on the use cases. For now the size of the data is very less like max 50gb worth 10 years of data.For this much data, direct redshift would be ideal. But considering the future, if data size increases, it will be a problem. Although data honestly wouldn’t spike much. Coming to your point where if redshift is even needed: yes I feel so because we currently have tableau connected directly to sap where the devs created views which consume a lot of compute making dashboards slow. If we use s3 tables, we will have to use Athena for querying and connect that to tableau, and we have a lot of complex queries/views built on top. I don’t think it’s a good solution to use Athena as our query engine.And I am the only DE here so it will be difficult for me to write code for every table and it’s upsert logic if it lands in s3 first. And it’s really too much dependency on me for every new table. Fivetran makes it easy to load data and also handles auto schema changes. But again, it’s expensive.Hence I am at cross roads.",

Data engineers are super useful but usually come in later, when there’s enough data to justify the role. Smaller companies might not even have one.Also, as a dev you can always move into data later. Going the other way is harder.That said, if the data role is solid (e.g. real PySpark work, solid infra, not just moving CSVs to S3), and you want to be in that space long term, it’s not a bad move.But full stack gives you more flexibility and job security early on. Just my two cents.PS: I'm a data engineer, so no hate",

You’re modeling warehouses, designing schemas, choosing tools, fixing broken data, dealing with scale, permissions, costs, putting out fires and so much more. There are tons of tools and approaches out there, and every company does things a bit differently, so you’re always figuring things out. It only gets repetitive if the setup is already done and you’re just maintaining pipelines (that's the only thing that might get boring after a certain time)DE is important for AI, sure, but unless the company is seriously building AI products, that won’t matter much. Most just want dashboards or plug GPT into a chatbot. AI is nowhere close to replacing good engineers. It can speed up parts of the work, but it’s not making the hard decisions or owning the system when things break. So don’t pick based on hype. Pick based on what kind of work you actually want to do.",

What do you mean by this ? Spark is a supported engine by DBT. The two tools does 2 different things very well.If you want to go away from sql transformations that may be your answer. But note that it’s kinda nice to have a language that anyone can easily understand and transform data with rather than a specific one. Even more if you are a very small team of 1.Also this is nice , but doesn’t seem manageable by only you. It’s a lot. Also I think you need some really good argument to change something that is currently working (redshift) with something that slower and would do the same thing. Yes, cost can be an issue, but it seems like it need to be in your case for this rearchitecture to make sense.",

When people need to have a dashboard or something we deal with writing the model for it. As a data engineer I consider it's part of my job.My concerns about DBT is that it's a simple product but not sealable in the future. Especially doing unit tests is very limited as some column types are not supported making testing some models impossible. With Spark jobs I can fully test queries making sure to handle edge cases properly and it's easier to scale jobs when data volume will grow, with DBT running on GitHub actions runners we are limited in performance and from my point of view it's not a clean way to schedule jobs: no clear monitoring, retry policies etc. like with Airflow for example",

Hadoop might only be necessary if you end up working in an onprem legacy system, maybe in banks for example, and you'd really only need to learn how to use hdfs. Although I'd still learn about Hadoop's history as it would help you make sense of where spark comes from.I'd also learn the basics of how AWS works (or its competitors), services likes S3, EC2, IAM. You'll most likely need to interact with one of these when setting up Databricks or working on Databricks.",

They’re powerful tools, but for most of my early projects, SQL could have solved 90% of my problems faster and more cleanly. SQL is easier to debug, easier to optimize, and much more universal across platforms. If I could go back, I’d master SQL-based transformation first before diving deep into dataframe libraries.That’s why, instead of jumping straight into Docker/Airflow, I’d start with a SQL-centric transformation tool like dbt (or Bruin, which also lets you run Python and handle ingestion). This will teach you the fundamentals of data modeling and pipeline design without the operational complexity of containers and schedulers. Since you already use Tableau, learning the “one step before the dashboard” will make the whole puzzle click.Another big lesson: don’t get lost in technical rabbit holes. The fastest way to grow is to chase the highest-impact business problems, things that save your team time, increase accuracy, or unlock new capabilities. If you focus there, you’ll naturally pick up the right technical skills along the way.Also, don’t work in isolation. Get your code reviewed, and review others’ work. You’ll learn more from those reviews than from most courses.If I were mapping a path for you, it’d be:1. Master SQL + data modeling (dbt/Bruin/SQLMesh)2. Add Python tasks in the pipeline only when needed3. Develop a tool in Streamlit and deploy it for the use of business team4. Develop an ML model, and deploy it.You’ll hit Docker and Airflow eventually, but starting with modeling skills will make everything else much easier.",

We are about to roll out Debezium event collector on ingestr as well, which could help you consume them from the broker and land on Snowflake.Another alternative could be openflow maybe?

Dagster does the orchestration for me, as implied, then dbt does transformations after data has landed in Timescale, also orchestrated by Dagster.I can't really speak to how the performance would be with loading data into Snowflake via Sling, but it backfilled about 300GB of data on the initial run in under 6 hours and every 4 hour incremental loads take around 20 minutes (though this could probably be optimized much further). All hosted on ECS Fargate containers.If we had no budget constraints, I'd probably look at a SaaS offering to do the extract and load for me, like Fivetran or equivalent.",

Since you’re using Cloud Run, any stdout/stderr should be captured in Cloud Logging (which gives you access to Log Explorer & Cloud Monitoring for free). If you only want to track specific numeric values, then you can log them specifically in Cloud Monitoring.2. Alternatively, after standardising your event log format/structure, you can continue to export it to GCS and set up a Data Transfer Service to BigQuery. Or, if you want to continue using Postgres, you can setup a Cloud Function or Cloud Run Job (triggered by GCS) to load the data accordingly.",

If they don’t have enough work you get put on the bench and if the consulting company keeps having a hard time finding contracts to put you on then eventually they will fire you because they don’t make money off of you when you’re on the bench. On the flip side, if there is upcoming work then they usually let you up-skill while you’re on the bench and waiting for the new contract to start. So if you get out on the bench and no new work is coming I would be worried…2. From my experience, sometimes they oversell your skills to the client and you end up having to do work that’s probably way more advanced than what you’re used to. This is a bad thing for many younger developers because not everyone can succeed in a scenario like this. Outside of consulting I feel like there’s more hand holding. This actually happened to me when I was a consultant and was the main reason I had to work +40 hours but I could’ve just as easily failed and got fired if I wasn’t at least above average enough to succeed. 3. Sometimes consulting companies want you to get certifications for various reasons and while these may look good on your resume, the amount of study time it takes for some certifications is time that could be better spent up-skilling or working on side projects that make you better at your actual job. Hell, actually doing a data engineer project with Azure will teach you more than the certification will. 4. Pay at consulting companies doesn’t become good until you’re a senior. For non-senior roles I feel like consulting companies pay less but I didn’t care as much because all the different stuff I learned. 5. Sometimes the clients are assholes and have unrealistic expectations and dealing with that is at times harder than any work you have to do. Clients like to micromanage consultants sometimes.These were the main ones for me, others may be able to chime in and add to this list.",

Joining a project group like that was good because you had to learn the concepts of the various domains, and being responsible for analysis and delivery meant you had no choice really. As technology/data roles have become more specialized and commoditized, I think DE teams are definitely more distant from the workings of the business. I think your best bet there is getting some exposure as a tech BA (although this probably means less hands on work), or work in a smaller company where everyone has to do a bit of everything.",

If that’s the case, there’s something missing between the REST API and Pulsar to periodically poll the API and produce topics for Pulsar to ingest (that may be in the microservices). However, from both a compliance and support perspective, it’s good practice to retain a “raw” copy of the data on ingestion so you have a recovery/fallback point that can also be used for audit and lineage purposes, especially if your source doesn’t retain data itself. I’m a bit unclear on how your PM role fits in the mix and where your engineers are, but speaking as someone who has platform strategy responsibilities, I would recommend focusing on confirming the required/desired business and tech capabilities, then working with your engineering leads to determine the right tooling to fit and the appropriate design. Good luck!",

My understanding is that Pulsar is a push-based publish-subscribe model (like if you subscribed to someone’s Substack email newsletter). You therefore need a translation interface to perform the pull from the API and then publish it in the appropriate stream or message queue format to Pulsar. You may need something similar between Pulsar and Ceph as well; I’m not familiar enough with Pulsar to say. Unless your API fetcher has the ability to also write to object storage, your first point of storage appears to be the post-Pulsar Ceph so would be there. Ideally you want to create that archive copy as close to the source as possible, so it’s determining where the storage opportunities are in your flow. I’ve not heard of Aerospike before but a quick skim doesn’t look like it’s for this requirement. I asked about the role as it sounded like you were scoped to design the solution, which engineers tend to get a bit twitchy about PMs/POs doing :grinning_face_with_sweat:. But understanding how it works so you can help steer/prioritise is a whole ‘nother thing of course. SInterestingly though, my place has this type of architecture managed by an “integration services” dept and my data engineering crew are downstream from that… unsure if that’s common across companies.",

The config CI/CD pipeline will copy the files to where your DAG references them, your DAG CI/CD pipeline will deploy to wherever your airflow DAG bag refreshes.The dynamic DAG can be as flexible as you want. For example create all the same tasks but with different parameters, or it can dynamically create different task structures based on the config. Every time the DAG bag refreshes DAGs will be updated or created based on what’s in the config directory. You can then manage each resource separately and see its history in the web portal",

I worked as a chef for 10 years and before that in media and now I transitioned to programming.One thing that was worth it from the bootcamp that helped me a lot was the access to mentors. I have been thinking that it is a shame that a lot of people pay so much money just to access to a weekly 30 min call with a mentor (sometimes even less). The material to learn is already online with even well structured tutorials or learning path, but free mentoring options are missing.I have been planning for quite some time to build a website in which programmers and other professionals can offer free mentoring options for people who are learning or starting. It doesn’t have to be for a long time or long sessions but some guidance or even code review could work. Would you be open to help me build this project? Would anybody be interested in something like this? Does a similar platform exist? It has to be completely free of charge (kind of like freecodecamp but for mentoring)",

OP is offering to commit 2 1/2 hours daily towards 1-2-1 mentoring, for **free**!If you have time and/or energy, it would be absolutely invaluable if you wouldn't mind providing monthly updates to the sub:- progress of 5 mentees- common issues- feedbackIt would also be interesting to understand knowing what you would know 1 month later, what would you have done differently? I personally think that you are heading for burnout with such a daily commitment. Look after yourself, and don't be afraid to changes things if the commitment proves too challenging.Really hope that your mentees are genuinely focused, put the necessary work in, and put your guidance into practice to really propel their progress.You are doing the Lord's work!",

Get a book / go back through all your course material / see a tutor / use all your college/universities resources (ask for help) and most importantly \\*practice\\*, do challenges, do exercises, all of it. If you're in college you're paying a lot of money to be there so...use whatever resources they have - office hours, etc.My guess is you rushed through all the assignments, even the basic ones, and used help / AI / whatever to finish them. And now you're stuck because you didn't do any learning.Completely forget about AI for now. You need to actually \\*learn\\* by doing.

If the AI does or suggests to do something you dont know how to do yourself, ask it what that is or how its done.AI is a great learning tool if you use it as such.I recently wanted to do something and AI suggested using a denounced search and suggested code for it. I didnt knew like 3 methods it was using or what a debounced search actually is, so my next 3 prompts where asking the AI to explain what a debounced search is and how the code it suggested actually works.

I don't know the libraries I should use. So, I let the LLM give me ideas and eventually settled on Python as the language.I've got a 2D array that is supposed to color a cube I'm having the LLM draw. However, it doesn't understand how to associate that 2D array with parts of the cube. It gets it upside down or backwards. I feed it screenshots, and it still can't figure out what's going on. It keeps proclaiming \"this will fix it\" and makes some random changes.Having said that, I did get it to work, eventually. If I had to do it on my own, I would probably have never started. It seemed too daunting, that I had to learn too many new things. So, it got me started, and while I was frustrated at times, it got me a lot closer to finishing than I would have done just by myself.It's the first coding project I've completed on my own since, well, almost ever.I think someone who knows NOTHING only builds really small stuff or has it solve homework problems. I can't imagine they get a real app working.Those who think AI will take over and don't want to learn programming should try it out. It's still far from easy to use, and you'd think it would be easier.",

Maybe that means spending time mastering DSA using Leetcode, or building a bunch of small projects with different architectures (helpful for systems design), or just focusing on acing your classes.How much time you put into your studies and projects is going to be the biggest factor her under your control. Chasing money is a bit of trap, and don't worry if learning X will help you get into FAANG or not, but worry that learning X will give you the skills to be excellent and building software.Making it in this field is a lot more than getting hired at a specific company or two, and requires continual learning and growth for your entire time in industry. The skills you need to do well as a junior, are only part of the skills you need as a senior, and on top of that it's extremely common to switch tech stacks or even sub-fields (like infra to backend, or product eng.)

Be on top of all your assignments and when you have nothing that needs to be done just code shit up or get ahead of the readings. Don't leave before 5, the more you code the easier it is. You can do leet code, making your own app, it doesn't really matter, what matters is you are staring at code so your brain gets better at it.If you do this you will have a bunch of free time and be ahead of everyone. If you don't do this you will be in a rush all the time and that SUCKS. Luckily I got this advice early so I only did like 1 or 2 all nighters in my entire degree.Also make friends with your tutors and ask questions, it might take a few months but figure out who the smartest people in the year are and try and get into their study groups.Also exercise. You will probably be able to take advantage of free classes at the gym and it does wonders for your mental health. To clarify join the classes as they will teach you how to exercise correctly, don't try and figure it out on your own.If you want to get a partner / find a fun social group join the evening student dance classes. There's usually like salsa or something. If you have some social anxiety this will help MASSIVELY!If you want to code in the evenings too see if there's some kind of competitive programming stuff like capture the flag teams. You get to travel on them and it's a pretty wild experience. You will also become friends with more experienced programmers who can give you great advice.Just to highlight again, 9 to 5 every week day you are studying.Good luck and have fun!",

Take a carpenter for example, he has a set of tools that may include a hammer, saw, chisel, etc. He isn’t excited about those tools, he’s excited about the product he’s making, whether that’s a chair, door, etc.Same thing code for programming, the language you pick is a tool I.e. python, JavaScript, C++, etc. Each has their advantages and disadvantages.You want to build something that you love and enjoy, then use programming to build that. You probably have no interest in how dating websites work etc. That is the likely reason you are not excited about it.Pick a subject you enjoy in real life, like Football, cooking, rugby, gaming, etc. Then think of a little idea. Take football for example, you could build a simple hard coded Stadium displayer. Which shows you the top 10 largest stadiums in the world. It can then display facts about each stadium. Keep it real simple, nothing fancy. Make sure you write the project idea down too and break it up into small objectives.For example:* Create array of hard coded data* Create stadium card to display name, image, stats like capacity, facts like famous matches played thereThen once you have a basic version, have a look at it and see what to improve. Things like add a database, authentication, better styles, etc.If you don’t relate programming to what you are actually passionate about and enjoy then you’ll probably just eventually drop it.The people you see that are passionate about programming and love it are actually passionate about the area they’re building in rather than the idea of programming itself.",

I also did the website redesign (although I was building pages based off wireframes and a spec written by someone else, I'm not a graphical person). About a week after the launch the whole company went into administration, so no one really ever got to use my new website.It was a small multinational and I was working out of their HQ. The web team was basically only 2 of us, and my boss spent most of his time working on the ecommerce site, so I got a huge amount of freedom to learn and try new things. Edit: If anyone's wondering how long ago this was, I was working with classic ASP, asp.net 1.1 and webforms (which were all cutting edge at the time). Also Tables were an acceptable way of doing a 3 column page layout",

At the beginning I mainly just reviewed the code for the court app. It was on a much older version of Angular so he had me begin rewriting the entire app in the latest version of angular which accelerated my learning exponentially. Then soon after a new client came in requesting a custom web application for his business and my employer handed it all to me. So I have spent most of my time meeting with that client, understanding his data and building a web app from scratch. It is now in production so now I implement feature request or fix bugs. I also will work on various projects he has with other clients, updating old code or adding new features. We also do IT for the court house and 911 center so I go on site every once in a while and fix network or equipment issues.

You have articles like [https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/) so you definitely aren't faster just blindly using AI",

So I can speed up my productivity too, you know.I tried using AIs to handle basic tasks for me when everyone started saying that AI would ruin programmers' lives and produce outdated, broken, and bug-ridden code. Yeah, it might be faster because some parts are already done and just need tweaking, but that works for small scripts since they are simple and easy to track and fix. However, it's impossible for an AI to create a full app exactly as you want because you can't specify all the details. There will always be things you do through pure automation simply because you're used to coding.Last time I asked an AI to write a server.js to run express, and it just didn’t work. I had to write everything again lol (by writing everything again, I mean going to my GitHub and copying and pasting my last server.js, which was also copy-pasted from my previous project).So no, AI does not destroy programming. There are no AI writing apps on demand, you could use something like Copilot, but it won't make a big difference unless you're doing repetitive coding. And if you are doing that, you're probably coding in the wrong way.People also talk about AI replacing artists, but artists are still working because AI can do some things to represent your ideas. However, it will never capture everything the way you want because your ideas need a brain with empathy to understand what you truly mean and what you want to do it as you wish. An AI can only replicate what you do, and all the details you don't provide, the AI will just do whatever it wants.You can tell an artist, \"I want my character to be like Jhon Wick,\" and they will take your ideas and adapt them to fit Jhon Wick vibes, while an AI will probably do Jhon Wick and just add some wonky details on top of it.",

But where even is my player gold? is it in some array or something? And for adding the gold, maybe I have an add object function. And it needs to check for what kind of object and where it goes.

This goes for programming too. Learn a language, try a new framework, experiment with a design patterns. You'll never have as much free time and energy as you do now while you're young - use it",

Here's thing that i learned: JavaScript engine itself is single threaded, but the browser engine uses threads to do tasks parallel to your JavaScript code, such as XMLHttpRequest/fetch and everything that returns Promise objects. The function that you pass to Promise constructor (executor) is running on the same UI thread so you don't do anything computationally heavy there, instead you can use Web Workers to emulate browser apis off ui thread code execution. While scripts are loading they're parsed but they only execute when the script is fully loaded and parsed, so heavy scripts would delay the web site users from being able to interact with the web page elements. If you want to reference elements in a web page via JavaScript you need to make sure that the is fully loaded, otherwise you will get an error that you can't get elements by that id or class etc. You can also put the at the end of the so that when JavaScript will be executed it will know for sure that the body content is loaded. relative url references that you pass to (\"fetch\" for example) aren't relative to the JavaScript file itself but by the html page that loaded that script. There's primitive types (numbers, bools, strings etc) and object types { } (Dictionary with special abilities)Learn the old way to make classes first, with function as a class constructor, function.prototype as a prototype object. Then learn the new syntactic sugar class definer, what i found out is the code inside it runs in strict mode.",

There are all kinds of ways to solve a problem, but programming includes a required strategy. You must break large problems into smaller, more approachable, chunks.You also have to be able to define the problem explicitly. No relying on another human to intuit your intent. Instructions much be clear and unambiguous. There's a TikTok going around showing a teacher following written instructions to construct a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. With predictably comical results. Most humans fail this, at least the first go. Programmers don't.Finally, and this is a rare skill indeed, you must be able to diagnose problems. If a program runs first go, great. However, it's debugging where learning really happens. Diagnostics, probably even more than solving the initial problem presented, is a valuable life skill.",

You don't focus on what actually leads to the code, on the *design process*, which is far, far more important than the code itself.You need to learn to *analyze and dissect problems*, to *break them down*, to *create individual solutions* to the sub problems that *then* can be *implemented* in any programming language.Learn to plan. Sit down with pencil and paper and start from there. Not from the code. Start from the problem, break it down, solve it *your* way, don't even think about programming. Once, you have a working solution, test it. Track the steps you took. The more detailed, the better. Then, convert the solution into code.Start smaller. Hackerrank and Leetcode are for experienced programmers preparing for interviews.

The knowledge of instructions and other theoretical language parts does not translate into intuitive understanding on how to use them to build functional code. Knowing all Chinese words is still far from the ability to write a poem in Chinese. The proper intuition takes time and practice to train.In the meantime, try to reverse your thinking. Think what your starting with and what you want to end up with. Then, go from the end to the beginning. For example, if I want to write a function that calculates the cumulative age of all the users of the system, the input is the user list, and the output is a number. Then, I know that number needs to be a sum of each age of each user. So, I need to get user age from user entry. So, I need to compare their birth date with current date. You can probably write a function for each of these steps, and stitch them together. Not sure if that helps at this stage, but the idea might come in handy.",

People often try to use the first to reinforce the second, but that's the wrong order imo. I got stuck in that pit for a long time.Take stabs at stuff on your own (ie, watch a tutorial, then put it away and try to recall by coding yourself - bonus points for meaningful variation from their example) and I promise you that muscle will grow pretty quickly.Something more actionable that helps me a ton is writing out the comments for what needs to happen at each step, THEN flesh it out with code.

        "body": "Honestly, there is no such thing as a \"programmer's mindset\". That's a myth and a general excuse for people too lazy to invest the necessary effort, discipline, persistence, diligence, and work to learn.There are things that can make learning easier, such as being a logically inclined person, but even that can be improved and learned.I am a firm believer that most (not all) people can actually learn programming to a certain degree. They won't all be able to reach a professional level, but they can definitely learn it.After all, programming is just creating and translating steps to solve a problem in such a way that the computer can execute these steps.We humans solve problems all day long, just we mostly don't even notice it as it is intrinsic. We work in steps every single second of the day, but we don't realize it.Learning programming is learning to consciously devise steps, to utilize our intrinsic ability to think in steps consciously.Most new learners focus way too much on the *code*, on the *implementation* in a *programming language*, which is only the last part of the process. Sure, it is absolutely necessary to learn a *programming language*, but after all this is just very limited vocabulary and very simple grammar.The real part of programming happens way before the code. It is the process of analyzing, breaking apart problems/tasks and solving them in sequences of discrete steps (again, a skill that we generally are intrinsically good with) that *then* can be *implemented* in any programming language.Here is also the problem with most tutorials and with many, even high quality courses: they focus too much on the code and too little on the design, on guiding the learner to devise the solutions.When I started out with programming, there were no tutorials. There was no internet. There were barely any knowledgeable people in my (rural) area. It was way back in the first half of the 1980s in the advent of the \"home computers\" (Commodore ViC20, C64, BBC micro, Acorn, Amstrad CPC-464, etc.). All I had was the BASIC (programming language) manual that came with my computer and a lot of curiosity. A bit later, we had some \"programming\" lessons (in double quotes because it was more a joke than anything serious) at school - one lesson per week where 8 people were crammed around 4 Apple II Europlus computers where we initially learnt AppleSoft Basic and later UCSD Pascal. Our teacher made us draw flow charts before we were even allowed anywhere near the computer. This seriously helped. Using a visual representation of the steps to solve our tasks made us think more about the actual steps than about their *implementation* in a programming language.Flow charts, Nassi-Shneiderman charts, bulleted lists, pseudo-code, all of these help and are somewhat underrepresented in modern computer learning. If people started out learning these for short time, they would learn much easier and much faster as most learners don't fail at the *languages*, but fail on *programming*.The above is also the reason Harvard chose to start with *Scratch* for their famous CS50 course. It is a visual programming language (in the style of Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams) that lets the learners focus on the *algorithm* on the *steps* instead of on an actual *programming language* with its keywords and grammar. Yes, Scratch comes across as childish because after all it was designed by the MIT to teach young kids programming, but that is actually the biggest advantage of it. Way too many people dismiss Scratch as childish and useless, yet, had they invested a couple hours with it, they would have seen its value.Way too many posts here are in the tone of \"I've learnt programming language X, Y, and Z, but still cannot program\". Why? Because they all focused on the wrong thing. They focused on the *implementation*, on the *end product*, on the completed car, instead of focusing on the *design process, the considerations, the decisions* that ultimately *lead* to the *implementations*.Similarly, way too many people claim \"they can *read and understand* code, but not *write* it\". Similarly, just because one can *read and understand* novels it doesn't automatically enable them to *write* meaningful, comprehensive, fully developed ones.Then, we have the \"I've watched X tutorials, read Y books, but cannot program\" people. Yes, sure, you know the theory, but you have never applied your skills in practice. This is like sitting in the desert and watching countless Olympic Splash Diving videos and reading all about it. Unless you get wet and actually do it, everything will just be plain theory and you will fail miserably in practice.Practice is the key. Even a step further: independent practice. It's not *copying* tutorial code after tutorial code. It's sitting down, thinking about something to program and starting working on it, without tutorials, without AI (don't get me started on that for learners), only with one's own work.There is nothing wrong with tutorials for a *certain use case*, e.g. for small, detailed, specific parts where one is unsure, but not for entire projects, e.g. the typical \"how to build X in language Y\" ones. If you need something special, e.g. \"how to work with SQLite tables in Python sqlite3\" or something alike, tutorials, blogs, etc. are perfectly fine.Too many people fall into *tutorial hell* because they don't dare to just simply start working on their own. They are afraid of not achieving their goals, they are afraid of failure, which is the completely wrong mindset for programming. Failure is an important part of learning. It is *gained experience*. It is equally important to know how not to do something as how to do something.Then, we have the \"do projects\" people who think that projects need to be huge, complex beasts and that instantly get discouraged by that thought. Again, wrong mentality. Every single program, no matter how small, is a project. One can only grow with their projects. People need to start small and simple and then work their way up to gradually larger and more complex projects.Then, we have the people who despair because they see the huge amount that is there to learn and only look at the summit, at the vast mountain of learning ahead of them instead of looking at the *path* ahead. One does not climb a mountain by just focusing on the summit. One climbs a mountain by looking at the path ahead and taking one step after the other.Then, we have the ones who declare \"programming isn't for me\" after investing mere *hours* (couple days/weeks) without much effort. Learning programming takes effort and doesn't come natural.*Fast tracking* in programming doesn't work (it actually doesn't work in any trained skill). There is no 0 to 100 in no time. Learning anything is a marathon, not a sprint. Slow and steady wins the race.> Recommend any books, courses, etc. that helped you most.Here is a knack. The most helpful books have actually fairly little to do with *programming*. They are about the *design*, the steps before the actual programs.The typical recommendations for this are:+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles PetzoldAnd if you're hardcore: \"The Art of Computer Programming\" by Donald Knuth et.al.",

Someone posted a question asking something along the lines of 'What is the most important trait in a programmer?' and the most upvoted answer by a country mile was simply 'Perserverance'. It's euphoric when all the parts of a solution click into place and we get to sit back and watch it fire on all cylinders, but man it's a rough road to get there at times. The ability to stick with it when everythings broken and nothing makes sense is crucial.That leads me nicely onto the second one really - embracing and even celebrating failure. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist that has a few podcasts on how learning works, and listening to him explain that it's repeated failure that triggers the learning process really changed my attitude and I wish I'd embraced it sooner. There's a quote along the lines of 'The master has failed more times than the apprentice has even tried', and whilst I probably spread my interests too thinly to master anything in particular, I'm doing my best to fail my way there.",

But to be of any use to anyone, you'll need to break both of those down into separate smaller problems - how to make bolognaise sauce and how to cook spaghetti. The spaghetti is fairly easy (assuming you're using dried) - boil some water, add salt, add the spaghetti and cook for 10 mins. That's a reusable little skill on its own that can be used with loads of dishes, and at some point could be switched out for a version where you make the spaghetti from scratch, without affecting the other part of the recipe - the sauce.For the bolognaise itself , it's a bit more complicated - fry the onion, brown the meat, add the herbs and tomato sauce etc. Again, each of those steps can be broken down into smaller ones. E.g. the onion - how to dice it and how to correctly cook it is a stand alone set of skills that, like cooking pasta, will be something you'll do in loads of recipes.What's any of this got to do with coding, you may ask. Those smaller steps - cooking the pasta, slicing the onion etc - are small reusable (and potentially replaceable) steps that are the equivalent of how you'd break down your code into reusable functions, and they all roll up into that top level overall recipe/application.",

You can draw rectangles & circles simply as well. If you're coding in OOP you can even make those classes. Since there's movement, and things are updating, you'll likely need a core game loop - easy enough to track. We can then break things down further: To make collisions, you need to know when a ball collides with a paddle. To know that, you need to know1) The Ball's position 2) The Ball's direction (it shouldn't collide if it's not travelling toward the paddle)3) The Paddle's position (should be mostly static horizontally speaking)4) The Paddle's direction (either left or right)So when the ball's at a point where it could collide with a paddle, check if that paddle overlaps with the ball, and if the ball is travelling toward it. If so, calculate the reflection angle of the ball, apply that to the ball - maybe keep track of the paddle's travel speed and factor that in somehow. If the ball isn't colliding with anything, just let it travel on - adding the sine & cos of its direction to its position values (scaled by speed). Then we gotta add the player in. Let them control the left paddle with their W & S keys, or Up & Down, or their mouse, either way. If they move them (i.e. keep track of the last position of the mouse, and check whether it moves between updates), apply the movement to the paddle vertically (not horizontally) and scale that by how fast you want the paddle to move.For the computer, either create some decision tree (like, if the current ball direction would cause you to miss, move toward it. Else, move to centre?) up to you. Or just have it go up and down.",

Since you have some idea of how to do this, then do something much simpler than pong.There is always the challenge, when breaking down a problem, that you won't know how to do some step. For example, if you've never worked with interactive graphics, then you'll be stuck at that point, having to learn what to do.Another challenge is how pong deals with the angles that the \"ball\" bounces. Is this something realistic or is there some pseudo-physics going on? It does seem to roughly obey angle of incidence equals angle of reflection. In other words, figuring out the dynamic behavior is hard.I'd probably try something like Snake where you don't have to deal with those kinds of physics.I think, as people break some of these problems down, they still wouldn't be able to code it up. They would still need extensive Googling or asking an LLM to find out answers they need. I doubt some will figure out the math needed if they aren't that strong in math (and even if they are, but are out of practice).",

OOP and encapsulation are just arbitrary ways of parsing reality that were chosen because the people who first thought of them thought it made programming easier if you thought of it that way. Different people come along with their own ideas and reformulations, but there is no One True Encapsulation that god invented and wrote on stone tablets. There's just people trying to think of programming in a productive way. And sometimes those ways aren't actually very productive, or sometimes those ways are productive for them but only because they think of things in an unusual way, and sometimes someone thinks of a new way that works for a lot people and everyone gets excited about this new way for a while until other people figure out the new way's short comings and go back to looking for better ones.Even in math, it's arbitrary. You only have clarity because you declare it by fiat--you make up some premises and rules because you think they are interesting or they will be informative in some way, then you try to figure out all the consequences of the rules you made up. A lot of math is about just using existing rules to figure out new things within that ruleset, and a lot of different math is thinking of entirely new rulesets that seem interesting and generative.Programming, and trying to define encapsulation is more like the second kind of math.",

At the time these words were coined, Fortran and COBOL were the dominant programming languages, and they were extremely barebones compared to the modern versions of those languages. It's hard to fathom just how much we take for granted with modern programming languages today.In terms of encapsulation, folks were mostly just proposing what we now think of as modules or classes. Basically, the idea boils down to creating public facing APIs that do not expose their inner variables. I like [this source](https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis400/1-object-orientation/01-objects/02-encapsulation/) which quotes from some of the originators of OOP-- Dave Parnas and Alan Kay. > Parnas and his peers pushed for not just hiding the data, but also how the data was manipulated. By hiding these implementation details, they could prevent programmers who were used to the globally accessible variables of early programming languages from looking into our code and using a variable that we might change in the future.Barbara Liskov is another big name in the OOP world, and [she covers encapsulation in this fantastic paper](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/barbara-liskov/data-abstraction-and-hierarchy.pdf)> For abstraction to work, implementations must be encapsulated. If an implementation is encapsulated, then no other module can depend on its implementation details. Encapsulation guarantees that modules can be implemented and reimplemented independently; it is related to the principle of “information hiding” advocated by Parnas [15].Those three formed the basis of all modern OOP concepts. They are the definitive sources. I think much of the confusion comes from the second wave of folks who implemented the popular languages and who each definitely went their own way. Because their languages are so popular, their opinions are almost equally valid despite the fact that they all disagree with each other on minor things.- Bjarne Stroustrup- James Gosling- Brad Cox- Bertrand MeyerAs a side note, when discussing design patterns, there are a few definitive sources:- [Design Patterns](https://www.javier8a.com/itc/bd1/articulo.pdf) by the Gang of Four- Pattern Oriented Software Architecture, most notably volumes [one](https://daneshjavaji.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/sznikak_jegyzet_pattern-oriented-sa_vol1.pdf) and [two](https://archive.org/details/patternorienteds0000unse_u5t3)- [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZoranLi/Books1/master/Patterns%20of%20Enterprise%20Application%20Architecture.pdf)However, most of those were written over twenty years ago, so [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/) is a good resource for putting these concepts into a modern context.",

Then there’s the group that says it’s about combining data and methods together. And so on.And N-O-B-O-D-Y ever cites anything to back up their claims. It’s like: *“Well, I said it, so you should believe me.”*So in the end, I can go to an interview, and the interviewers can tell me absolute nonsense about OOP — and I can’t even call them out on it, because there’s no monumental work, no axiom, no precise definition from an authority that I can point to and say, **“No, this is the correct one.”**Everyone just interprets it however they like, which leads to the absurd situation where: if I’m the lead on a project, then *my* definitions are the truth.

Yes, almost every person that wants to do CS wants a job in CS, because... we need to earn a living. If you want to do it as a hobby, no one minds or cares that you aren't after a job. I am not sure where you think you are seeing that programming as a hobby isn't acceptable? I will say that getting a full on degree in CS and not going into the field would be... an odd choice, as that is a lot of money to throw at something you don't want to get paid for, but you do you.",

More than half of my coworkers in tech actually didn’t have any CS or SE degrees.Degree is always a plus. I also got a degree in SE. But honestly it’s all about how hard you study/code, and how much you know in depth about programming and related topics. I know a guy that has high school diploma, but he started coding since he was 13. He has worked with PayPal, Google, etc. He started from a smaller company. With connection from that small company, he just keeps growing. You can get a degree related to it, and it does help imo. I got a degree, but I wasn’t doing the best when I was in college. I switched from business to SE and it was gonna take extra year in college. I ended up trying to do as many credits as I could in each semester, absolutely regret it. I almost failed in every class. Didn’t have time to actually study what’s going on. And yeah, it sucked when I graduated and needed to land a job. I ended up doing online tutorial to refresh my memories before I was able to land an SE job. My degree helps a lot on resume, but I think your projects you will be doing matter more. Companies want to see what kind of things you’re capable of doing. I could be wrong. I’ll wait for sr dev or someone to give some more opinions about it.",

It shows you're not giving up, and that's a mindset you must keep if you really want to become a programmer - especially a good one.In general, experience > degree. I'm not a CS graduate myself - I actually studied chemistry - but I've still found my dream job writing code. It's absolutely possible.Becoming a good programmer is so much more than just hitting keys and shipping code. You'll need to accept the endless grind. In the beginning, everything feels exciting and kind of easy. Then reality hits. And honestly? There's barely any course out there that truly teaches you how to think like a developer - the pattern recognition, the problem-solving mindset, the \"sixth sense\" for asking the right questions.That said, not studying at all is a bad idea. You don't want to end up without direction or skills that can support you. But studying doesn't have to mean going to university. I'm from Germany, and here many young people start paid trainee/apprenticeship programs for around 3 years to learn a profession. Maybe something like that exists where you are too?If university isn't an option for you - especially if it's expensive or forces you into debt for something you're not passionate about - then yeah, don't rush into it. It could become a trap.Given your situation, there's no guaranteed path. But if I were you, I'd try to find a mentor - even if it costs money. Good guidance can save you a lot of wasted time and effort.Also: besides programming and avoiding university in your city, what else interests you? Maybe you can find some creative crossover - tech isn't just web apps and games. There's a lot of space to combine different passions.Whatever you decide, don't just think about the next year. Think in decades. It's your life - build something that lasts.",

I really just wish there were more companies or mentors willing to offer guidance in the beginning.That said, I’m very resourceful, and I’m not afraid to dive into documentation, learn new systems, and figure things out on my own.

This is also a big thing that separates compiled and interpreted languages. Compiled languages (eg. C) are only standalone (kind of, i’m hand waving a lot).

You download an *SDK* (software development kit)2. You write your code3. You compile/package it (or not, depending on the language)First off, what you're downloading is not the language, as that is more of an abstract concept, it's software that uses the language to build software. That can include an interpreter (e.g. with Python), a compiler (c), a runtime (java), and other tools such as a debugger.Writing your code is what you do with e.g. pycharm, but you can do that with anything. At the end of the day, what only matters is the content of the files, so whether you write it with pycharm, notepad, visual studio, or Morse code doesn't matter (it matters to you of course, not to the machine).And then there's what you're actually inquiring about. This steps is what depends most on the technology you're using. With Python, there isn't really anything more to do: you write your scripts, ...and that's it. You just run them and that's your software. That makes it easy and convenient, but not very user friendly which is one reason why you generally don't use python (directly) for user facing applications. For java, the final step is compiling into jar files, or an exe that will use the jar. That's already what you're doing when testing it while writing the code. The only difference is you might be including or removing some stuff from the final binary that you ship to users. Similarly for other compiled languages such as c and c++, it's the same story. The only difference is, you have to compile for each configuration (architecture, os, etc.), but don't need the user to download a runtime. Then for web stuff like JavaScript, it's a bit more complex since you have to host the website on the internet if you want people to access it. But here it's actually the most similar to what you were describing: you do use a software that brings your software to life, the browser! It's a bit similar to Java's runtime but way more involved I hope this kind of makes sense? It's hard to explain without knowing what you know and understand but hopefully I gave a somewhat clear picture of how it works. And don't worry about not understanding all of it, the world of software is vast and complex and developing software is as much about writing the code than it is about the final steps of deployment!",

There isn't a single answer for every type of thing you want to build.In general if you want to build an app that you want others to be able to use, here are the most popular options:1. Make a website. It will cost you $10/year for your own domain name like Grumpy\\_Gremlin49.com, and $5 - 10/month to host the website. You'll need to learn some HTML and CSS to design the content, but most of the logic can be implemented in Python. The best part about the web is that it's the easiest for end users - they just type in your url and they're immediately using your app.2. Make a mobile app. For iOS it costs $99 to become a developer. You either make an iOS or Android only app using the special languages and frameworks designed for that, or you use a cross-platform framework designed to let you build an app once. There's a framework for making mobile apps with Python (Kivy) but it's not very professional. You upload your app to the play store / app store and then users can download it and use it.3. Make a desktop app. You can do that with Python. The main problem is getting it to users. You'd need a website to distribute it (see #1), and browsers and virus scanners will try to stop users from installing and running it. This is a fine solution for sending to a friend or making an internal app for a business, but these days making a good cross-platform desktop app for end users is a real pain. If you want to make an app for the Mac or Microsoft app stores, that does solve the virus scanner problem but it limits what your app is allowed to do.So your next step is to pick one. The more specific the better. Pick something like web or iOS. Don't say \"all of the above\". Start somewhere.",

This is to ensure that, when running in production mode/env, things continue to work. These steps will include a task that's referred to as packaging. One of the mechanisms to do this is to containerize your application so that all system dependencies are bundled into the container (Docker is one of the easiest containerization tools; if you want, you should research Docker and Dockerfile).After the above packaging step (the usual artifact at the end of this stage is a deployable unit, in this case called a \"container image\"), you will need to then research how/where to host your application. If you are targetting running this code in the cloud (say AWS for eg), you will then need to research and decide whether you want to use Elastic Container Service (ECS) or a kubernetes-based solution. If going with ECS, most of the infrastructure-provisioning will already be taken care of - you will simply sign up for an AWS account, and then configure what tier you want to choose (depending on how heavy your application is and also depending on volume of users). Then comes the actual deployment. I have skipped some steps like unit testing, CI builds, connection to a database, security (both runtime/dynamic scans and static scans). Depending on your comfort level and (I assume) your aim to get to a full-fledged application, you will need to research these as well. Ofc, if your application needs a UI, and assuming your python code is simply exposing API endpoints, you will then need to research react / angular / nextjs / vuejs / etc (javascript frameworks) that will be used to build the UI for your application. That codebase will also follow a similar pattern of running the app, packaging, hosting, testing, etc.",

Those are honestly the things you'll spend most of your time working on - the technology is just the medium you're working in while refining those skills. Which is why people who focus only on the tech they're learning tend to end up not really developing the skills they need.So don't worry about the technical knowledge being out of date, especially for C which is a very stable language. The only thing that might be out of date is the *pedagogy* \\- education is an evolving field and educators are always trying to find better ways to teach - but if the books are working for you, then how they teach is probably fine.The journey from complete beginner to \"proficient enough to get a job as a junior\" is probably 5000 hours long. Don't worry too much about relevancy until like the last 1000 hours honestly, and not at *all* for the first 1000 hours. (obviously times may vary depending on aptitude, drive, etc)",

        "body": "Changing a language is kind of dangerous. Imagine a language changed every 3 years. You write a bunch of code this year. Three years from now, they change it, and now your code is broken. Does that seem reasonable? Many beginners feel code changes and they want to learn the latest, not realizing, using the same argument, that in a few years, they'd have to learn something new because the current stuff \"became obsolete\".Of course, 20 years is a long time, but languages that last time often change without breaking.For example, Java has come out with new versions over the past 30+ years. Still, in principle, code written back then would still run now. The biggest changes occurred roughly 20 years ago when generics were introduced. Yes, there are a some other features that came out, but if you stuck mostly to that technology, you'd still be decently fine in Java. You'd only add to that knowledge instead of throwing it away.Keep in mind that code tends to stay around for long periods of time. Code can last 20 years or even longer. If you had to rewrite that code just to keep it up-to-date, that would be crazy amounts of unnecessary work. Beginners think new code is written all the time. They hear Rust is big, so they think millions of lines of Java code are tossed out, and they rewrite it all, not realizing how hard it is to rewrite code. If it took years to write, it takes years to rewrite.Now, there are things that have gotten old, but mostly in web technology. Even so, some still hangs around. I thought PHP went away 20 years ago. It's still around. People still use it because web sites were written 20 years ago. Sure, everyone tells you to learn React or something newer.There was a posted months ago that wanted to learn Carbon, Google's answer to C++. It's not even been released, had no compiler that was available, and is still (for all I know) in limbo today. If they just learned C or Java, they'd be in better shape.Also, many programmers learn more than one language, so even if you never use C again, learning to program translates (somewhat) to learning new languages, so it's not wasted time even if you think it is wasted time. The fact is, to learn programming, you will ultimately \"waste time\". Avoiding mistakes often means avoiding learning.",

If you've baked a million cakes, you'll have a pretty good idea of what the steps involved will be, even if it's a new type of cake. If you're a beginner, you might need to closely follow a recipe. But each step along the way is something you can work out how to do, and combine the steps into the final result.

It’s free and gives a solid introduction to computers and programming.After that, it’s kind of a “choose your own adventure,” so to speak. Think about what you want to do, web dev, software engineering, IT, etc. Then go to nostarch.com and find a book that matches your interest. Start working through it, build your own projects, and network to land an entry-level job.It’s tough right now since the tech industry’s going through a downturn, but it’s definitely not impossible.If you have the money and the opportunity get a CS degree it will legitimize you.",

It showed you how to make a games, but they are a little too advanced for beginners since they assume that you already know the basics of coding. At an absolute beginner though, I would study coding basics, there are a lot of free sources and videos on YouTube for basics.Being self-taught at the beginning is usually the hardest part about being self-taught. You have no basis on what you have to learn and how well you need to know it, or even why you have to learn it. It sounds like you're going to basically be behind a single semester, which to be honest, isnt TOO bad, even though at the moment it sounds like the end of the world, trust me, its not that much time. My honest advice for you is to try and calm your anxieties for now and build a good relationship with programming. Go and pick a youtube tutorial Playlist you like, familiarize yourself with compilers/code editors, and just practice the basics like variables and loops. Don't try and make it into homework or work, just have fun with it, make it low stakes. If you like podcasts or lofi play some in the background while messing with some loops to familiarize yourself with them. Write a loop, change the variables. Add stuff, if it breaks, oh well, start over, delete the whole loop and write it again and start testing new stuff out. Go into leetcode and try out some of the easier prompts, if its too hard, its fine, just make a point to try it out and get used to the way the syntax works.",

You now have a few months to practice coding and get a feel for if you like it over design/story telling. Also don't be afraid to not get into programming and just stick with what you know (design and story telling). I know it sounds cliche, but you'll never be happy doing things to prove your worth to other people. I wasted a lot of time and opportunities in my 20s because I couldn't learn that lesson. Maybe consider pivoting your degree to design (some uni's have game design specific courses) or to something that would better suit storytelling for game development. My degree was in IT with a focus in programming and software engineering. To me the hardest thing in my program was understanding the \"thought\" process behind solving problems with code. A great way to practice this for me was actually playing the game Human Resource Machine on Steam. It forces you to \"think\" and \"problem solve\" in a way that is really beneficial to coding. The reason I harpe on this is because to me, my C# and Python classes were pretty similar. The foundation of WHAT you were doing was the same, but the syntax you use to execute it is different.",

It tracked the time spent on the answers, and I timed myself doing it sober for about 20 minutes, ingested a shit ton of cannabis and did it again. Then I spent the next few days analyzing the difference in performance using Python. I can never bring that up in an interview but I genuinely enjoyed doing it. I don’t regret it.

If the new size is still smaller than what you originally asked for, it's possible that realloc() might not do anything.* The total amount of memory used will increase with n, but because it's freeing what it had before, at most \"n\" memory will ever be taken up.* You might think 1 + 2 + 3 +... + n is some sort of exponential sort of thing, but it's just n\\^2.

Apply your own thought process. You don't need to understand a programming language or concept to understand the logic behind the topics you are thinking about. Lock yourself in a room and think about the problem from the base case.For example, why do you need a temp variable to store values when swapping in an array? Well, imagine you are organizing a stack of books. You want to move the one in the 5th position to the 3rd position in the stack. So aks yourself, what do you do? You have some options! First, you could pick them up in your hands and move them to where you want them. Or second, you could pick one up, lets say the 2nd one, and shove it in after the 5th book, shoving every other book after it down, then take the 5th book and put it back where the 2nd book was. Or visa versa.So which option is better? It's a lot harder to move a bunch of books after the 5th book just to shove that 2nd book in there. So lets pick them up and swap instead.You pick up book 2, pick up book 5, and swap them. Ok, so if you wanted to do that on a computer, what's different? Well, you used your hand to store the books temporarily, so it's clear you have to put them somewhere when you swap. But actually, we can do better! Because in a computer things don't physically exist and it's all information, we can just pick one of them up, and copy the other into it's place. Now you can ask yourself, what would happen if I didn't pick up that book before copying over it? Well you'd no longer know what the book was, right? You'd lose all the content, all the pages, the title, everything about that book would have been replaced by the book you just copied into its place. This is the thought process you have to apply to *any problem* you don't understand. Stand with the fundamentals. This actually has a name; \"principles first approach\". This is what I employ to most problems. As you gain more experience, you will start to see parallels and abstractions, and shortcuts you can take with the \"base case\".For example, now that you know you need to store a variable temporarily, and you are asked how to swap elements in a binary tree, or rotate it, you can start your base case at the fact that you'll need at least one temporary variable.Best of luck \\~",

From there, the \"pattern\" you seek emerges. But everyone sees this \"pattern\" differently so dont fret if you dont get it or you interpret it differently. You should start a project precisely because you are a novice. No one randomly goes from novice to expert out of thin air. The tools and libraries you see are there because someone sat there and thought \"What is the first solutiont that comes to mind?\" and explored the consequences. When that led to an unsatisfactory answer, they redid it until it was passable. Then someone else came along and tried themselves to improve it, and then someone else came along...You say you have trouble parsing documentation and reading code, but everyone does too. You are not alone in that. Everytime anyone decides to use a new library, its always tough to adjust to the new style of documentation that they have to sift through.

I do have maths chops. But it just never comes up.A few things that do come up that might be tough for a non-maths oriented person:- The 16 times table is useful. We don't use hex much in the front end, but we do for CSS colours. Also, converting from pixel values (`px`) to relative units (`em`, `rem`) usually means dividing by 16. A 32px icon is 2em wide.- Positioning stuff on the screen is just Cartesian coordinates, with (0, 0) at the top left, not bottom left like you were taught at school. But also, your computer is just a fancy calculator, so there's no need to do any of this stuff in your head. Just drop into `node` or the browser console and do the sum you need.",

That's the way to learn.Open Source is an entirely different matter. First, you should only consider contributing to projects that you use and are attached to, not just pick random OS projects and think you can contribute. Sorry to tell you, but it seems that your current skillset is by far not developed enough to be able to follow and to contribute to open source projects with several thousand lines of code and with several modules.You need to gain experience in building your own fairly large applications first (again not through copying tutorials).----When you face a large code base it is usually beneficial to find the main entry. From there, go through each module in the order it is called. You could, if you want (I do it), draw a treemap, use Obsidian with Mermaid Diagrams, etc. to map out the project structure. Get a general overview first and then go into details. Look for *specific* things, e.g. how a certain value is calculated, how a certain part of the code works. Don't try to understand everything at once. This will be overwhelming.This is also the reason not to contribute to random projects. You are not familiar with the product. If you are familiar with an application through use and find an issue, you check the bug/issue tracker, and then go into the code. You try to find where your specific problem happens.",

Sometimes I’m not even sure if I’m solving problems the “right” way, and it gets overwhelming without any guidance.Is there another method you'd recommend to go beyond this stage?Maybe something between tutorials and full independence — like guided projects that explain the why, or studying design patterns or architecture?Would love to hear your thoughts!",

I think a good frame of reference is if something can easily be done by genAI (very small and focused scope), it's probably not challenging enoughthere are many smaller details about how you can approach this, but ultimately what you really have to do is commit to a larger project. in my uni program we already had 2 big (for 1 dev to do in a couple of weeks) projects also requiring UML diagrams and MVC code structure in our first courseI'm also always going to recommend beginners to start out with static-typed languages and NOT something like javascript. languages like these both make it harder to understand what the code you're reading (that someone else has done) is doing, and it potentially lets you skip certain fundamental knowledge that is important and helps you orient yourself with programming. if you really do not want to drop css+html+js I think you should just go on with basic fullstack and use something like java or c# for the backend",

However I’ve worked in backend web dev the majority of my career and while it definitely pays very well it’s not very interesting or challenging to me anymore, 90% of work the past few years is just solving the same problems over and over with a new skin. If I had had the chance to go to school I probably would’ve leaned more towards computer vision, embedded, graphics/media or something else but being self taught I took the pragmatic approach to enter the web dev arena. So my advice would be to pick up whatever interests you most, because that’ll make you happiest in the long run. If you are enamored by the high salaries in big tech then stick to web dev or AI but plenty of places pay highly for specialized and niche knowledge.",

That CS stuff is great to know, but it's not focused around making useful programs to delight users, or at any rate make their lives easier. HTML is used to create web pages. CSS is used to make them look nice. There are some data structures there (headings, paragraphs, captions, images, all that), but it is a stretch to claim you can code up actual algorithms in HTML/CSS. There's a lot more to programming than those. Javascript, for just one example.What kind of programs would you like to make for your users? Web apps? Games? Mobile apps? Controllers for washing machines and microwave ovens? Medical devices? I am not sure how you would know the answer to these questions as a sophomore. Take some more classes. Look at Unity or Unreal Engine for games. Do the web app tutorials in Microsoft C# / Dotnet. As for debugging your life, my response is this: \"It is functioning as designed.\" Keep on learning.

You should think about studying those in the next few years (you can start now on easy level which is actually a bit hard) just for interview practice.If you really want to do computer vision, you may need to look at grad school, but that requires high grades (3.5 or above in the US) and preferably you've taken relevant courses, perhaps done a undergrad research project.",

And while ever company is free to do whatever they want, in the three companies I've hired for, they all viewed portfolios the same way. It's mostly just talking point to bring up during the interview. It's not a huge deal, in the general case.Lots of applicants will have the same degree and a good GPA but, amazingly, some really will be awful at actually producing code. In the old days, whiteboard/quiz type questions were how we tried to see if someone really could code, but then everyone just started studying specifically for the type of questions that would be asked. I'm really not going to spend more than five minutes looking at a git repo or even a live website or whatever because there are just too many applicants and plenty of applicants are just going to clone somebody else's open source project. It's just something I would ask you about in the interview. I would expect you to be mildly passionate about it, because it's your project, and I would expect you to be able to speak intelligently about how you built it, on a technical level. Counter-intuitively an amazing project can be a reason we don't hire you.If we hire you, we would ask you to sign a non-compete and claim ownership of everything you develop. These contracts weren't always enforceable, and it might be different in your location, but the company wants you to give up your project and work full time on whatever they care about. If your project is so good, so impressive, so huge, that we think in 6 or 12 months it might take off and you would quit to pursue it, you would be a high risk hire. We want the applicant who will stick around for a handful of years. Only twice have I witnessed this. The first was a guy who clearly wanted to develop games. He had an indie game he was in love with and basically admitted he just wanted to make games but had run out of money. The other guy quit his full time job to launch his own app, wrote the app, and didn't sell as many copies as he thought. He was looking for a job but he was clearly super passionate about his app and wanted to keep working and focusing on it. As a person, and a developer who has my own side projects, I get it. We just need some money to pay the bills...but as an employee tasked with hiring good candidates... Those people aren't likely to be the best options and selecting a bad hire reflects poorly on me.",

        "body": "Github is a hub for 'git' repositories. Each GitHub user can create a folder (called repository) it contains source code (just textual files for code) for software they're developing. The purpose of \"git\" system is to efficiently store each version of file changes that the user made, to save that change the users make \"commits\" with an optional textual message describing what edits/changes they made. The commits have date time stamp, author name and email address. To not dox your GitHub registration email address in your commits history, there's a setting to generate no-reply garbage email address. Users can add repository to their favourites by clicking a \"star\", there's a counter of how many users added the repository to their \"stars\", so it acts like popularity indicator. There's a so called branches in repositories, there's a main branch called \"main\" or classically \"master\". Users can \"fork\" a repository, it copies a repository to their own collection of repositories and after the forking the repository points to the original one with \"remotes\", it's an url of a git repository. You can make changes to this local version of a repository you just forked and then you proceed to make a commit describing what you just changed, then you create a \"pull request\". It's request that's sent to the \"remote\" repository to approve a \"pull\" from your commit, it means getting those chances to his repository. You can turn your GitHub repository into a visitable web site with GitHub Pages. It servers your web site through a link like this: https://.github.io// It can only respond with a content of your files without dynamic functionality like databases and scripting languages. The git is a program that you can use locally on your computer to version your software (or anything else) projects. It creates a folder in your repository named .git (that's hidden in non-Windows operating systems) where it stores file changes and everything about git project. If you don't want some files/folders to be uploaded to remote repo, you can define them in .gitignore file. You can make git repo locally and then upload it to a GitHub (or other git repo hosting websites) GitHub adds more features to the git repositories than it's supported by a git itself, so it's recommended to manage a repo in a GitHub website. There's also available to download GH program that manages GitHub repo in a terminal window.",

        "body": "\\> What is a github post?Never really heard the term used in regards to github, so I'm not sure what you mean.\\> Is it called a repositoryA repository is a collection of files that are managed by version control. Git is a particular version control software that is very popular. Github is a place where you can store repositories online so that it's not just only on your computer. (To understand the difference, I've heard \"Git is to GitHub as Porn is to PornHub.\" Meaning that porn exists outside pornhub, it's just one place to keep it, which is what makes it analagous.)\\> And is there a way to bookmark and or like a repository just like you would like a Facebook post or something on Instagram?Github has stars, \"watch\" toggles, forks, and you can just use any standard way you'd bookmark a webpage too of course.\\> Could someone just give me a short synopsis of some of the terminology used on the site?If you learn git separately from github, then I think most of the terms you'll understand.The specialized terms are things like a \"pull request\" which wouldn't make sense on just your own computer, but that is you submiting code for someone elses' project and, well, requesting that they pull it into their project. That could be bug fixes or feature implementations or documentation or anything else that makes sense for the project that the original author/maintainer might be interested in. There's also all kinds of options for automatically testing or building, or project management, etc. Frankly no one uses every feature, just the features relevant to their own workflow.\\> I want to use it more but I just don’t understand any of the different things you can do.Most of the things it can do won't make sense without knowing git.\\> Just to give you an idea, I didn’t build my PC just because I didn’t want to mess it up.Entirely understandable (although maybe I'm more reckless than you since I'm currently trying to fix my GPU with a soldering iron lol), and actually tangentially related to one of the problems version control/git aims to solve. By using git you can keep a history of all the versions of a file with a little note about what changed. That means if something gets messed up, you can maybe not \"easily\" but relatively easily go back to a version where everything in the file/project was in a good state and move on from there rather than hopiing you kept your \"known\\_good\\_backup\\_file.py\" actually unmodified.\\> main features someone like me who is not a programmer would need to know to work my way around it.Honestly as a non-programmer probably the main thing to do would be to submit \"issues\" for projects you use that you would notice a bug or miissing feature or whatever in. The exact way to do that varies for every project since everyone has their own preferences, but in general it's appreciated to get feedback from people actually using the tools you make.\\> I have used a couple posts to my benefit but each time had someone walk me through setting it up and after that, didn’t have to revisit it so it’s all a foreign language to me.Unfortunately git is just weird, and it takes a little bit of time forcing yourself to use it to get used to it. Ultimately there's like 5-10 common commands but there's way more than that in the tool so it's more intimidatting than it needs to be. Some non-programmers like book authors sometimes appreciate the \"time travel\" ability that it gives them, so it's possible that even without writing code that there's something youd' appreciate using version control for which would help you build up a little more of a habit of using git.",

Right now you're stuck with all these separate pieces of a puzzle and you're finding it hard to see how they all fit. At times you will manage to fit some together and as you connect more pieces it will get easier and easier to find new connections. Focus on the fundamentals and try to have some sort of own project at the side that you can tinker with on your own when you feel like it.My own experience - I found it hard when I had gotten my degree to structure and design code. Like you I felt frustrated and a bit lost. We had very briefly talked about the concept of Clean Code during one of the courses without going in-depth at all so I ordered and read the book. I found it to be extremely helpful and taught me structure and a bunch of common patterns and idioms when writing code in a very straightforward and helpful manner.Lastly - if there was something that I wish the school had focused more on to prepare me and my fellow students for the real world, I'd wish we'd gotten more time to work with how online services talk with each other, what protocols do they use, how is information exchanged, request/response etc, as well as how you work with web/appservers etc. It was all very hand waved and the only server we had to setup was a light-weight Firebird local server to host our SQL-dbs.So, personal opinion - focus on learning the programming fundamentals, read Clean Code, and check out how apps communicate with each other and get som practice doing that. Good luck!",

The computer doesn't really care about how many variables you use.It is much more tricky to write code other humans can understand. This doesn't really matter in this toy problem, but becomes quite important in larger or longer-term projects.For humans, giving names to things matters. It can be worth pulling outoart of a computation and assigning it to a variable *just to give it a name*. In this sense, variable names and function names serve a similar purpose to comments, but names are easier to keep up to date as the code evolves.Here is how I as a very experienced programmer would refactor that code if this were a production problem (untested): import re import sys EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS = { \":)\": \":slightly_smiling_face:\", \":(\": \":slightly_frowning_face:\", } EMOTICONS_PATTERN = re.compile(\"|\".join(re.escape(e) for e in EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS) def _emojify(text: str) -> str: # see https://stackoverflow.com/a/2400577 return EMOTICONS_PATTERN.sub( lambda m: EMOTICONS_TO_EMOJIS[m[0]], text, ) def main(): for line in sys.stdin: print(_emojify(line)) if __name__ == \"__main__\": main()There are a couple of fundamental differences that you might find distracting – using a replacement table instead of `str.replace()`, or transforming all input instead of prompting for a single line. The regex related stuff is a fixed pattern for applying multiple replacements to the same string.But for the purpose of this discussion important observations are:* I think `_emojify()` is a better name than `convert()`. Converting *what*?* I decided against introducing additional local variables. They don't seem to add anything. In particular, naming a value just to immediately return it doesn't tend to provide much useful information to readers.* No comments like \"get input\". Comments are useful for providing information that's not visible in the code. If an `input()` function is called, I can already see that we're obtaining input. The thing that would benefit from a more detailed comment in my version would be the regex stuff, as this is highly non-obvious for people who don't already know this pattern. Unfortunately, this pattern has no name, but it has a canonical Stack Overflow answer.",

What you have to watch out for is* \"scope\" - the contexts that a name lives in, within a module/function etc., and* functions that change values, vs. return values.In Python, when you assign a new value to the name \"user\\_input\", that is scoped in this case to the whole function. In a larger function body, you might have loops etc., and you can negligently change a name that elsewhere you've been assuming represents its original value. It's OK here, it could be a really bad move in another context. You know, like old school guys like me will use 'i' for an index counter, and then use it again in another loop inside that, and that of course is not going to work right.For the change/return thing ... Somewhat miscategorized as such, because what we have here is a function return. But from an object method. The .replace.replace thing Harvard handed you here, you have to decide what you think about that. It's vaguely familiar as if imported from a \"functional programming\" model, and I think Python programmers commonly get some jollies from doing things like that. But it's a little less transparent what's going on in an OOP object.method model and I personally don't get the attraction. I might split that up into separate assignments to user\\_input\\*. Consider how that would relate to your question - would you want to reuse user\\_input, or have a trail of new identifiers - user\\_input, user\\_input\\_with\\_happy, user\\_input\\_with\\_happy\\_and\\_sad ...?

        "body": "Senior dev from the UK very familiar with UK academic system here.Your 'interesting academic route' isn't at all novel, in fact it's very common. I know plenty of people in the field who did CS and SWE, and similar. It's barely a specialisation really. You will most probably discover that Software Engineering and Cloud Computing undergrad degrees share some kind of \"common first year\" with straight Computer Science degrees and about 10 other \"degree pathways\" at your university, to ensure everyone has the basic knowledge required to move on. After that period, at the beginning of each year, you'll get asked to choose some modules in addition to the core modules totalling the credits for the year. This is the \"specialisation\" aspect. Different degree pathways are just different module choices each subsequent year, which is why many universities allow you to switch between degrees before you get to modules that are only available on certain pathways (essentially change your degree title and pick other modules).Whether or not you will be ahead or behind your peers depends not solely on your degree pathway, but also on how well the *contents* (what you study) aligns with what you would like to do for work. You don't mention this (even though it should be the biggest factor in your decision) but assuming you want to be a Software Engineer, neither CS nor SWE will give you a large advantage over the other, and the module choices available are likely to be very similar. I've never personally met a Software Engineer with a Cloud Computing degree, but this doesn't mean much, as much of the content is likely to be very relevant.You won't save any time, they're the same length. Feel free to skip any work experience years if you're confident in your ability to land a job. Use your best judgement.Note also that employers rarely care deeply about the exact degree title. \"Computer Science or similar relevant degree\" is common to see on job ads. They do often (not always) care that you get a 2:1/2:2 or above. Nobody regards 3rd well. I'll add from personal experience that I've had certain professional opportunities that were only open to people with 1st at undergrad, a full decade *after* getting the degree. You don't know what the future holds so make the most of it. I'm glad I did and richer for it. If you look at how your university calculates your final classification there's often an alternative formula that counts your first year marks (they award you the best mark using all formulas typically), so don't believe any nonsense like \"first year doesn't count\" etc. It might, depending on specifics.Edit to add: **A-levels are not 'instead of' a degree.** **No employer is going to pay much attention to your A-levels alone, and having an undergrad degree is preferred but not a hard requirement, to directly answer the title question.** You just need to take the A-levels that meet the requirements for university courses you're looking at. The requirements are listed on their sites. They usually either don't care about specific subjects, or list one subject they require you to have studied at A-level, possibly with grade requirements.",

If you’re confident in self-study, and you enjoy getting hands-on with projects, then jumping into a more focused undergraduate degree in Software Engineering or Cloud Computing can absolutely make sense, especially now, when many universities are offering very industry-aligned programs. You're not necessarily missing out on much if you take initiative on your own to round out the foundational theory you'd typically get in a general CS degree. Just make sure the specialization you’re picking doesn’t lock you in too tightly. Cloud and software engineering are great fields, but you’ll want some flexibility to explore and pivot if you find something else that clicks for you in your first or second year. Whichever route you go, don’t underestimate the power of real-world projects and online learning. A certification or two (like AWS Cloud Practitioner or Azure Fundamentals) and a couple of GitHub repos where you’ve built something real can go a long way in making you job-ready.",

As a quick description, Java is pretty verbose and specific on how it does Object Oriented Programming, so it's pretty word-y but you may have a strong background of OOP. I haven't learned C++ so I can't say much other than it being a more low level language while still being familiar in terms of syntax. In reality though you would start learning either flow charts or pseudocodes before going to write things using a programming language before Data Structures and Algorithms (at least that's how I started in my college)",

        "body": "It depends on the domain/areas of programming you are interested in. I think both are useful to learn for different reasons. C++ gives you exposure to manual memory management, and Java does not need manual memory management and has a rich standard library and ecosystem. I wouldn’t say C++ is better for DSA, Java has a ton of data structures available, and you can do DSA practice in any language, Python is most common for interviews and things. In the real world, C++ is used for very specific purposes, some big ones I can think of are AAA game dev, fintech (HFT firms), hardware, OS/tools (windows kernel is c++), scientific computing, graphics, multimedia, CPU heavy apps (adobe products, 3d modeling software, simulation software). In terms of backend web which is sometimes made synonymous with software engineering, it’s really only used in deep infrastructure at global scale companies. Java is also applicable for a lot of those domains, Minecraft is Java, many desktop apps are Java, and the backends of many large tech companies are mostly Java (AWS for example). If you want to have a language to take you far and would be usable in projects, internships, and professional work, Java is the clear winner in my book",

Progress slows down, rewards and milestones are fewer and further apart. No more dopamine. It becomes a slog. Switching to a new language immediately fixes this, and the cycle repeats.Unfortunately, \"programming\" is mostly what you learn AFTER you pick up a programming language, just like composing poetry is something you learn after learning a spoken language.This is not unique to programming.

CS50 is no joke, especially for beginners, and the fact that you’re not just watching but actively coding along *and* asking questions shows you're way ahead of just “passive learning.”Yes, it *will* feel slow at first. You’re not nitpicking — you’re trying to build actual understanding, and that takes time. It’s 100% normal to not remember everything or to need to look things up multiple times. Everyone starts that way.If you want to level up a bit without getting overwhelmed, here are a few simple tips:* **Keep a small notes doc** (which you’re already doing — big W)* **After each week**, try to build a *tiny* project using what you learned. Doesn’t need to be fancy — even a simple calculator or guessing game helps things stick.* **Don’t worry about memorizing syntax.** Focus on *what* each thing does and *why* it’s being used.* After a section, try explaining the concept to someone else (or even just to yourself out loud). It’s wild how much it helps.You're doing the hardest part right now: showing up consistently. Trust me, this isn’t wasted time — it’s the foundation that makes future stuff way easier to grasp. You're doing great. Just keep going.",

Its good cuz, I know the thing that I want to code, isn't exactly the same as whats being taught to me in the video. At the end i've gathered bits and pieces of what I like from each piece of content.and then, with AI, i describe my understanding of that thing, and i have it just confirm my understanding. this leads to a lot of back and forth with AI because now i'm able to discuss the topic with it, adjust my understanding, correct the AI where it sounds wrong, and by the end of it, even if its not fully fledged out - i have a planonce i start coding, i have a stronger sense of the separate pieces of the puzzle that i need to build, and it becomes way easier to connect them all together",

        "body": "I professionally work on large codebase (~50+ million lines of code) containing a mix of backend and frontend code. We pretty much exclusively use plain-old dependency injection and do not quite use the service locator pattern.This is partly due to the architecture of our codebase, which is a monorepo containing a bunch of microservices. That is, we have one giant repo where all code lives, and the code contains several thousand smaller programs that are managed by different teams and deployed independently at cadences picked by the owning team. (The monorepo + microservice approach makes it easier for each team to move independently while still making it easy to share + reuse + mass-refactor code, etc.)Given this setup, having a central registry is not hugely useful because:1. If we create just one 'registry library' that everybody adds their thing to, it ends up introducing a major bottleneck to builds and tests. When we make a code change, our build system + CI pipeline tries building and testing only code that ends up depending on that code change in some way; having a single common module that nearly every microservice takes a dep on would add an unnecessary bottleneck.2. You don't really get much benefit out of having every single microservice create their own registry and register deps. If you're going through the hassle of this, you may as well just pass in those dependencies directly into your code and skip setting up the intermediary registry.Beyond this though, I personally think service locators are inferior to plain-old-code and dependency injection because:1. Having the dependencies be statically encoded in the source code instead of created dynamically via some magic framework makes it easier for IDEs and static analysis tools to determine where exactly different snippets of code are being used, programmatically update the code, more intelligently pick which tests must be run given certain code changes, perform type checking, etc. So, the less dynamic/runtime wiring we can have, the better.2. It also makes unit testing easier -- there's nothing simpler then just calling a plain-old-function or instantiating a plain-old-class. The less ceremony you can have, the better.3. Arguably service locators make it a little too easy to add new deps. Code that takes a large number of deps is usually a sign of poorly-designed code -- it should be broken up into smaller, better compartmentalized components. So, having a little bit of friction here seems like a pro, not a con.All that said, it's true that these microservices need a way to communicate with each other -- need some sort of [service discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_discovery). This has less to do with code architecture and more to do with the reality that these microservices need to run on a fleet of many thousands of hosts, and so need a way of discovering which IP address any particular microservice replica is serving from at any given time.To do this, we have microservices register their IP address in a system that's pretty similar to DNS; downstream microservices need to hard-code the specific service address and perform a lookup to talk to other microservices they take a dep on.In fairness, the actual code to do all of the above can end up feeling pretty similar to the service locator pattern in practice -- it's just that instead of registering a pointer, we register IP addresses. So, I suppose we do use a variant of this pattern in practice.> are multithreadedI think multi-threadness is irrelevant here. If your code is multi-threaded, your deps need to be thread-safe, no matter how they're passed around.",

One question I’d ask is if we’re using unit tests to confirm smaller, isolated behaviors as parts of a bigger system, does the method these systems use to communicate matter?Another question might be, do I want/need multiple threads to have (essentially) global access to these systems? Because a service locator provides that. Just as an example with my context, I use service locators in game development to provide convenient access to main systems (audio, saving, scene loading). I don’t care about testing or have concerns with multi threading so it doesn’t factor into my decision. I use DI extensively in many other scenarios where I need to be explicit on my inputs. Definitely would recommend just building with velocity and if you run into a problem over and over again then consider refactoring or reaching for a design pattern.",

        "body": "Dependency injection has some pros over the service locator pattern:1. **No hidden dependencies!** \\- You know exactly what dependencies an object has just by looking at its constructor, and what dependencies a method has just by looking at its parameter list. You don't have to read through all the implementation details, or figure out through trial-and-error, what services need to be registered in your service locator for things to not break at runtime. If all required dependencies are explicitly listed as constructor and method parameters, the compiler makes it basically impossible to try and construct an object or execute a method without having everything in the right place for it to work (at least if the services passed to the client themselves also use dependency injection, etc.).2. **Safer async initialization** \\- If a service returned from a service locator requires some sort of asynchronous initialization before all its methods are ready to be used, then it could easily lead to a situation where a client forgets to check some IsReady property before calling some method, resulting in bugs. Or even if the service is explicitly registered as wrapped inside a promise object, then all clients need the additional complexity of handling waiting for the service to become ready, and unwrapping it. With dependency injection you can naturally always just wait for all services to be fully ready before you even initialize the client and pass them to its constructor. Thus all clients' code can remain very simple and focused, and the asynchronous nature of a few services don't end up spreading around the code base, and causing the whole APIs of all their clients to also become asynchronous in nature.3. **Better support for multiple services of the same type** \\- with dependency injection, you can easily at any time pass completely different services to separate instances of the same client type. You can pass a default logger to most of them, but pass a more verbose logger to that one instance that you want to debug more closely right now. If you use a global service locator, then you might just be completely stuck with all instances of a client class being stuck using the same services at any given time. Or even if you use multiple separate service locators, it'll still probably be much way more complicated to swap the service of one client instance in some particular context - potentially even requiring some substantial architectural changes to pull it off.4. **Clients don't have to worry about lifetime management** \\- if a client pulls out a service from a service locator, how do they know if they should dispose of it once they no longer need it? Did they get a transient service, or is it a singleton shared between multiple instances? Does the service locator have to return some other information besides the requested service, so that this can be resolved? Do clients just always have to return all services to the service locator, just in case? With dependency injection all the complexity of lifetime management is pulled out from all the many clients in your codebase, and can be centralized into a smaller number of composition roots, where the lifetimes of all the different services is probably more clear.5. **Clear initialization order** \\- if services are initialized lazily by a service locator, in whatever order they're requested by clients, then their initialization order can become an unknowable, unpredictable black box, where the order of initialization can change drastically due to small changes in the implementation details of clients. This can potentially lead to random spooky-action-at-a-distance bugs, where a small change to some object causes a chain effect, resulting in some event being raised before some service has had time to subscribe to it, causing things to silently break. With (pure) dependency injection the initialization order is super clear, and doesn't just suddenly change \"by itself\" without you being aware of what has happened.",

There are two approaches. The first is polling, which is fine if updates can be delayed by a bit. iPhone email polls. The second is the CometD protocol which keeps a long lived socket open between client and server that closes after either a three minute timeout or when a “push” update is returned. This is inefficient in terms of open tcp sockets for the server and cannot massively scale but can support client counts in the thousands or tens of thousands.If you control the servers, you would allow inbound connections to the database and secure that point using a firewall and likely a vpn for an internal server. You would also strictly authenticate connections including restricting senders to known ip ranges. A common strategy is to route traffic through the vpn and only permit connections from it unless a device is physically in an office and authenticated on a trusted network.",

But that's if \"public IP\" means \"internet\" and not \"any other PC.\" If you need it so that the database server can't be reached by anybody, then you're in trouble. \"Immediately\" means you want a direct connection between the API server and the database, but \"only outbound connections\" means you need the database to initiate the connection to the API server, and that's a configuration mess. If you have lots of API servers, your database would need to connect to all of them and manage reconnecting to any that die. You could certainly build a solution for that, but why?",

I spent countless hours on it thinking I would make money off of it.The reality is, being a student, you likely do not have the skillset you need to succeed in starting a company and it becoming something that pays you.My advice is use the project you're working on as a learning opportunity, but keep your expectations realistic on what it will become. Having a solution to a problem is very different than taking that solution and selling it to enough people to make a living. If you spend an extended period of time grinding on the project, my advice is that you should be doing it because you're motivated to learn, not because you want to make it your job.I've always learned while passionately building a project that would eventually get thrown away, and I've spent a lot of time convincing myself that these things would pan out, but that's not really how the world works unfortunately.TLDR: Look for a job, build as much as you can, maybe get hired, see what professional development is like.",

You cannot blindly trust that LLMs generated code is correct, especially if you are planning to deploy your app. Code may contain vulnerabilities (e.g. vulnerable for SQL injection, cross-site scripting, cross-site request forgery, etc), all kinds of bugs and missing features. Who know, maybe even real API keys that found their way into the codebase somehow.That means, that we should still know fundamentals. Not sure what you meant by low-level stuff, but learning definitely will not hurt. Just make sure to apply your knowledge in practice and build something. That will improve your understanding of the material and help it stick in your memory for longer. Don't be afraid to reinvent the wheel for the sake of deeper understanding. At the same time, try to build something new, useful and challenging to really stress test your skills and \"level up\".The difficult thing is to focus on cultivating the right kind of skills and fundamentals. There is just so much to learn and to know. I don't know the answer either, besides the obvious: learn 1-2 programming languages well enough, learn data structures, pick a framework, know network protocols (at least HTTP), maybe OAuth, maybe cybersecurity fundamentals could be useful. Yeah, take this with a grain of salt. I actually started reading \"Structured computer organization\" by Tanenbaum. That maybe useful for low-level and system programming, i guess?That said, I would suggest to give these AI tools a try every once in awhile if you haven't done so yet. Just to see what they are capable of.I shared your hesitation at first. Then, I tried it recently and found it quite useful for generating boilerplate code and writing tests. No agentic stuff, just multi-line autocomplete mode. That way, you still are in control and can immediately review the suggested code snippet, but it saves you a lot a hand-typing.As for the AI, I am not gonna be a judge of whether the hype is justified or not. But, people do use these LLM-powered assistants in professional setting, at least to a degree. It's worth to at least keep tabs on from time to time.",

I’ve used it for a bunch of automation scripts and small tools, and the standard library alone gets you surprisingly far.Rust is powerful but a bit heavy for casual CLI projects since the borrow checker teaches you a lot, but it can slow you down if you’re just trying to get something done for fun. Also, depending on what kind of tools you’re building, you might want to check out Gadget. It’s not a systems language, but it’s great if you ever want to take your automation and turn it into a backend or API without building the infra yourself. Nice complement if your CLI tools start needing a server side.TL;DR: Go first, Rust later if you want a challenge, and maybe Gadget if your tooling ever drifts toward backend workflows.",

But it also has a lot of Perl-like CLI convenience stuff, like built in regexp.It has flexible metaprogramming, so you can define little DSLs (domain specific languages) within Ruby. This is how Rails works. Someone famously made a complete x86 assembler as a Ruby DSL:```rubyfisk = Fisk.newbinary = fisk.asm do push rbp mov rbp, rsp int lit(3) pop rbp retend```That's a regular Ruby program that's also x86 assembly! It works by overriding the name resolution system within the block that's passed to `asm`.It's a lot of fun to write, but perhaps too complex -- it's maybe as complicated as C++.

And if you wanna learn these things, that's amazing, but I suggest you do it outside of this project and on its own first and properly.",

The website is ezytoolz.com to give you all a better idea of how easy my current tools are to use. You might be able to determine which of these two options would work best if you see them.Which path, in your opinion, has a more manageable learning curve for beginners?Once again, thank you!",

Alternatively, think about if there are topics your students struggled understanding and see if there's a way to make a tool that helps them understand the topioc better.

I bet I'd make bank by advertising it with a bunch of LinkedIn posts saying how the service will \"take their vibe code to the next level\". Cannot wait for that bubble to burst.Thing is, it wasn't like this even 10 years ago. These are all problems the tech industry has created for itself.Now for the fun part. To people outside the industry, your skills are like magic. And it's not even the complicated CS stuff.Do you have any idea how many small businesses out there are paying marketing agencies to do SEO for them, yet they don't even have access to their own traffic data? And the agencies make up excuses because really they're just Wordpress shops that can't get their tracking pixels hooked up to Salesforce correctly so the data is useless and they can't say that part out loud.The reason so many people are talking about AI (aside from the grifters and enterprise salespeople) is because they want to be able to do the things you can do. They want their tech to work the way they think it should, yet every time they talk to a dev shop about it they end up talking about nonsense like user stories and sprint timelines.It took me way too many years to figure this out. The kicker was when I was working as consultant and somehow ended up on a small side project that was basically setting up a SquareSpace site for a local business. Our sales guy managed to bill it out at $150/hour. For a SquareSpace site. My techie brain thought this was a drastic overcharge because I thought the whole point of SquareSpace was that you didn't have to hire someone to do it for you. But for that local business that sold old muscle car parts, SquareSpace was over their head and it was worth $150/hour to have me do it for them.Eventually I got fed up building the umpteenth enterprise iOS app so I quit working with companies that do anything enterprise-y at all. It's too soul sucking.And you know what? Turns out it's not so hard to sell my skills to non-tech companies. What I think is easy is what they think is magic. That's a win-win.They don't buy unit tests (not that I want to write them), but they're game for anything that helps their sales funnel.My advice for anyone burning out in the tech industry is this. You probably see your skills and dedication to quality as an investment for a company. They probably see you as a cost center. So next time you get stressed by the nonsense, start thinking about how to apply what you know in ways that would help non-tech companies. Think outside the box. Then do the hard part and reach out to a few of them. You might be surprised at what you learn and end up with a whole new perspective on how all this really works.If nothing else, the experience will certainly help you write better Upwork proposals.",

It's asking your interviewer. In my experience, interviewers don't care if you have some dumb syntax memorized, they don't care if you stumble on how to do X in Y language. Those things don't matter on the job, and they don't matter in the interview. It's the problem solving they care about. Usually interviewers make it clear you can ask them syntax questions like that, or other nudges AI-as-a-tool would normally help you with. I've also been in interviews where they're totally fine with you googling, you just have to let them know you're doing that before you do it.If it's the latter though, good fucking luck. I don't know about you, but I always dreaded open-book tests/exams in college. Because they were always made difficult enough to *warrant* them being open book. They were *harder* then closed book exams.

I get that there are a lot of unqualified people applying, and even non-U.S. Citizens applying for jobs they shouldn't, but that is only PART of a much LARGER problem.I'm a very senior, experienced SWE with 35+ YoE. I am looking for new work, and I clearly have a realistic resume with the development tools I've used and where I've used them. I very carefully watch for Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, I have ONLY AWS (not Azure or GCP), I have HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and I am learning React now.When I look at a posting, and they want full-stack, I still apply. I know for a fact I have applied for jobs where I can hit 10 out of 10, or 90 out of of 100. Am I STILL unqualified? Of course, I'll never find out why I was rejected, but I know most of the jobs I've applied to I can hit the ground running, and knock it out of the park. So, I call BULLSHIT on this over-simplification of 'applying for everything is ruining the job market.' If you've ever seen ANY of these job boards including /recruitinghell, then you know there is a lot of shit going on from hiring managers and recruiters. They get NAMED and SHAMED all the time. I'm really getting tired of the rejections. With my many years of experience, it has never taken me longer than a few weeks to find new work, and I've been looking now for 10 months.

A really successful small firm could die in a month if they were to lose two contracts back-to-back. For the huge companies, any sign of work slowing will often result in teams being let go. They're usually done silently, but in this case it's likely to be more noteworthy because layoffs and offshoring are popular right now. From a business perspective it's good, because it makes you look efficient. After all, if everyone else is doing it, it's fine, right...It's also worth noting that in contracting firms, a LOT of people might be classed as technical/service staff when their job is essentially a PM or AM role, basically tracking work, making sure the client is happy, etc.Finally, this is my own personal perspective on contracting, but the idea that a contracting firm will have any advancements in AI is utterly laughable. It's not even a skill issue, but one where work will need to be billed to a client, and there's no fucking way that TCS is billing someone for the time taken to mess around with AI issues. Contracting firms often believe that they're at the forefront of technology, but my experience of subcontracting for TCS was arguing with a PM because I had written unit tests and they viewed it as \"unnecessary work we will not pay for\". When I pushed back, their response was \"well, it should work first time\". It's an environment of shortcuts, and while they probably love the idea of AI doing dev work, it'll end in tears without any shadow of a doubt.",

No, AI doesn’t make you more productive: your gains are illusory, as AI takes easy typing exercises and turns them into hard debugging exercises. Third, Apple has products that normal people actually pay money for, and on which they make decent profit margins. This is not so for Google (an advertising firm in a time when online ads are having an apocalypse), Microsoft (a software firm in an era where people are less interested in paying for software), and Facebook (a scandal-plagued panopticon that provides minimal benefit to the public). And Amazon is and always has been a layoff factory with the shittiest culture in IT outside gaming (and has issues with poor margins on their consumer business).",

This is virtually unheard of at other FAANGs where the average tenure is HEAVILY right-skewed with the mean around a little over 12 months. Their interview process for most of their teams is intense (the ones I’ve done lasted around 7-10 rounds with rejections). They hire very little, and they subsequently fire very little. They also don’t seem to throw the kitchen sink at the newest and shiniest thing. From a financial perspective, Apple sits on one of the largest stockpiles of cash of all companies, they are sitting on about $50 billion in cash. This usually entails that the company is slow to exhaust resources. TLDR; they are conservative with their investments (into new projects and employees) and their hiring process is very selective.",

It was asked repeatedly during the interview process if there would be any issues with me working at the NSFW company with spouse, family, friends, etc. They had employees in the past who either accepted positions and never showed up, or quit shortly after starting because of conflicts with family, their religion, etc. So if you ever think of working for such a company make sure you really want to and are able to take the job and that an angry spouse, family, etc. isn't going to make you quit after the first day.",

Apply for senior roles and include a cover letter explaining that you're intentionally hoping to move away from big tech, and what kind of work/culture you're looking for. Small companies hesitate to hire big tech engineers because they often struggle to adjust, showing that you've thought about this and are looking for this adjustment will make you a stronger candidate.",

So if it's a role that's seen as below your pay-grade and it has little room for upward-mobility within the org, a lot of orgs will assume that you'll get bored and leave within a year or two and they'll have to start the process all over again. With some midsized orgs especially, their bureaucratic process likely means that the cost to hire is going to be impactful for them while they might not be big enough to want to undergo looking for a new person every year or two. With some of the new automated tools too, there's a bit of disconnect between hiring personnel and the people that you'd actually be working with. So the department the role is for might be looking for just a fresh college grad and might not care about experience while the hiring department has their tools set to only spit out the most ridiculously overqualified candidates for the role, which makes the process even more annoying. Source: was dealing with this at my university's infosec lab while I was working there. Basically the only way they could get candidates they actually wanted from hiring was to ask for the top 100 resumes because anything less than that only netted them ridiculously overqualified people or stupidly-keyword/context-heavy resumes (one of the ones they sent up to us was 14 pages long)",

But this also assumes that the candidate is able to consistently get through to have an actual interview with an actual person.In reality, few companies will even respond to your applications. I actually get a little thrill when I get a rejection email (I’d ballpark it at about 10% of my applications actually receiving a rejection). You have layers of AI filtering before you can even get to a human. And I can assure you that the AI filters do not care about the super exciting hike I went on last weekend even if it could create that moment of good vibes with a human that you are emphasizing.The hiring system IS adversarial. It’s turned into a sheer numbers game, a game of maximizing your odds of getting through the AI filters and still coming out vaguely believable on the other side. If I actually got a chance to speak with people regularly, I’d have a much different approach to how I apply, believe me. But I simply can’t afford to spend an hour retranslating my life experience into a bespoke application for every job listing when I know there is a very low chance anyone is even going to look at it and a lower chance I’ll beat out the other 300 people who applied for it within the first 5 minutes of it being listed.And while my heart goes out to all the gainfully employed hiring managers who find pressing a button to blanket filter out candidates a bit distasteful, I can assure you it feels infinitely worse on the other side where there are *actual* stakes (like can I feed my family next month).Again, I’m not trying to trash you or anything. I really do appreciate the tips and plan to make use of them as much as possible. But if you want people to act genuine in the hiring process, then the hiring process has to treat everyone like genuine people. And right now, I am VERY rarely treated like a genuine person.",

Asks me if I understand how public key cryptography works. I say sure, at a high level. He asks me to elaborate. I say something about factoring large multiples of two primes, trapdoor functions. Maybe I mumbled something about the Chinese remainder theorem and Fermat’s little theorem.This is for a genetic backend SWE position, mind you. Not one that would necessitate detailed knowledge of the math that supports public key.So then he asks me if I can lay out those two theorems for him and describe how they make public key possible. I say, “maybe, if you give me half an hour and a textbook”.That satisfied him. Apparently the whole thing was a psychological test designed to drill down on something the candidate says they know until they reach the end of their knowledge. You succeed by saying “I don’t know”. You fail by trying to bullshit an answer. Apparently one candidate was so pissed at being asked such detailed questions about topics unrelated to the role that he stormed out of the interview.",

I ask cause Ive been told by other SWEs to add more hard numbers which I can do, but it does feel hard knowing how to do it without feeling a little fake (capturing these metrics in production is not always clear). I don't really use AI for talking to people or in the interviewing process proper but it does feel like the job market is changing very quickly so it's hard to know what advice is still valid, especially as other people in the thread pointed out the best advice may be context dependent for where you're applying.

AI as a whole has gone from being research-dominated to production-dominated.For example, in the past developing a tailored model and infrastructure for a specific NLP task required significant R&D effort. These days it's much more often about fine-tuning a foundation model and getting that model into deployment. You want someone with strong academic knowledge about AI/ML, sure, but you also want people who can make things reliable and ship products on time. If someone can do both, that's ideal.With regards to the NLP example, the Quanta podcast recently had a good episode titled [\"When ChatGPT Broke an Entire Field\"](https://open.spotify.com/episode/22Q9bVUucdeSK3LDXicjwx?si=-Dpeunr5S6OtUTX4vr-6Kg&context=spotify%3Aplaylist%3A37i9dQZF1FgnTBfUlzkeKt) (based on [this magazine article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/when-chatgpt-broke-an-entire-field-an-oral-history-20250430/)). NLP as a field has been turned upside down by transformers, and the skills/knowledge needed to make an impact have rapidly been changing. Tasks that used to take several years to develop solutions for can now be handled in weeks.",

This is where big tech is amazing because they pay you a lot, you learn different skills and are mostly in forefront to trying to innovate and get business. I interviewed very recently and was getting cash only offers around 400K from startups excluding joining bonus. Yet no where close to what big tech pays. Also the risk is high. With aquihire, unless you are in the inner circle, chances are very high you can get royally screwed. I would rather build my own startup than put my trust in some founder whose motivations are unknown. With startup offers, unless they have a history of buying back stocks like OpenAI, stock grant is 0 for me.",

I think firms on Wall Street are just really excited to lay people off because that prospect is so wildly profitable for them.

Nobody in history has been able to predict the future of innovation with any kind of accuracy. There are periods of history where there is massive continuous innovation in a given field in a short amount of time and then there are certain problems that nobody can solve for decades even hundreds of years. The next paradigm shifting innovation in AI could take another 100 years or it could happen in a dorm room at Stanford next month. None of this is predictable.I think with the AI we have now its clear there is some use cases that are very valuable and the tooling around it will get better. Which should increase productivity.

To get to senior+ you need to hone in on your non-technical skills like communication, how you take initiatives, how you build alignment etc. these are absolutely crucial to be seen as someone with authority, and something most engineers neglect and plateau. I personally heavily leveraged these and went from junior to senior in under 2 years, getting promoted over solely technical engineers with 3-4x my experience. for these soft-skills (the real game changer), I would recommend focusing on good documentation (and I don't mean writing docs that no one reads, but being strategic with it) like writing summary docs to summarize complex discussions, writing well-thought-out design discussion tradeoff analysis docs to promote healthy, structured discussions and building alignment, etc. Speech is equally important - the phrasings used, the tonality used etc can immediately set an authority apart from a noob - this also translates 1:1 into slack threads, and code reviews as well. Small tweaks like that can instantly make someone come off as authoritative and knowledgeable.Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss more. I am an open book!",

But at 4 years, idk. I’m in a similar position to you, 3.5 years in and officially considered mid, but I know I offer much more than that. But I’ve got a pretty good deal all things considered, so I’ve let go of any resentment and just contribute as much as I need and not extra, unless absolutely required (I’m not very visible, but sometimes I might be when other teammates are out). Basically, I prefer being an IC vs. leading projects because there’s much less scrutiny and the routine is much more chill. I even talked to a teammate who is leading a project, and they’re questioning whether the visibility is worth it lol. I’ve had the chance in the past and I knew that it’s not something I’m into. I also keep up with the latest advancements in the field, primarily in terms of AI.

It's also going to be a lot of messing around with UIs, Salesforce is not exactly a developer first platform, it's very much a management / business people first platform.So yeah it's probably a pigeon hole, but it's a very high paying pigeon hole",

Build a system of marketing yourself for example sending 10 job applications a week. Whether you do it yourself or pay someone else to send the job applications, having other job options would keep you secure. If you have more time, learn another skill that you can make a craft or \"retirement job.\" Personally, I trained weightlifting and martial arts and while it's my hobby now, I see myself maybe teaching this when I get older. I also explore digital marketing in the form of blogs, email, social media and video, so I could technically start a business or digital marketing agency or consultant if push comes to shove. Once you're comfortable, try your hand selling something based on your expetise so you have a test business. Your therapist, according to your comment responses is saying \"your feelings are valid\" and I'm reading it as since it's valid, your brain is probably detecing signs that you're going to actually become destitute. There are signs and writing on the wall that's why you're screaming internally and theres something you need to do about it. And I think you need to take it seriosuly. Be around people solving the problem. Be around people in higher positions within your career track. Be around people who are more successful and ask for their advice. Then do something. My suggestions are just examples. As I've had that thought since I entered the marketplace.",

I can get no references, everyone probably hates me and I have no other skills than being mediocre at coding.I can relate as I have the same fear. I think this is a healthy fear that one should directly address. My advice is to reduce costs and save so that you can live off of a decade from your savings if you lose your job. Work on your technical skills, interview constantly and get job offers so that you always have other options if you get laid off.> Everyone keeps harping about trades or jobs involving interacting with people and I am bad at both.I would stick to CS.> I am in terrible shape, am on the spectrum but not enough for psychologists to care about it, so I am basically someone who has no friends and no relationships in his late 30s. Should I through myself off a bridge?This is a separate mental health issue. Get in shape. Work on getting a relationship. Talk to a therapist or read a self-help book.

On average I did 2-3 job applications per day. Cover letters, sometimes change the CV, answer their application questions and explain what I have worked with and how it can be relevant even if I don't exactly know their tech stack. The job I got was for a tech stack I never worked with.In total I had 3 interviews but I was preparing hard for them, spending days learning about the company and preparing questions that they may ask me (I cheated during the interview I had bullet points on the side so I can remember stories etc.). They don't want you to be professional especially for grad roles. They want to know that you are interested in their company (show your research) and tell them what you have been working on and learning. Keep your github profile public and show your repositories they want to see you are doing something.Another thing that helped was looking at some leetcode easy questions, Iearned some very simple yet important patterns that they didn't teach me at uni and I am usually able to solve the pair programming coding interview parts. During such interviews show your thinking, break down the problems, find a solution iteratively.Was I lucky? Probably, but luck is where opportunity meets preparation.",

        "body": "50-70 applications per day seems like not a lot of bang for your buck. I'd focus in more on specific roles using specific skillsets, then have templated, tailored resumes for those roles. Right now, your resume seems a little scattershot. As an example of what I mean, in your language skills section you have Java listed first, which tells me you'd be most comfortable in Java, but none of your projects or experience mention Java anywhere, so I don't have much to go off of regarding how skilled you actually are in Java other than current coursework from mthree, which doesn't tell me much.I was in a similar boat as a new grad, and it took me 10 months to get a job (2 months after graduating). I would have 2-3 resume's with the same or similar information, just re-ordered to fit the job description. Is the job a front-end position using React and TypeScript? You better believe I'm putting that first on the resume. If the job is enterprise Java, then Java, Spring, JUnit are all going to bubble up to the top. Normally I'd suggest having a cover letter too, but it just so happened that all my callbacks came from applications with no cover letter, so your mileage may vary. Last thing I will absolutely recommend is to **bold** the **relevant skills** in your **experience** and **personal projects**. So things like **TypeScript, Tailwind, etc.** should be bolded. HR people don't have a lot of time to sift through applications, so the easier you make it for them to find the technologies they need to see the better. Don't go too crazy with it though. If around 15% of the text in your bullet points are bolded, I'd say that's good. That's just the path I took though, there's other ways to go about this. My job hunt was from November 2024 to this month and took about 300 applications sent total , but I got the best results most recently when I was only sending 2-3 applications out per day to places I was 100% sure wanted new grads with little to no experience. I'd also like to know what your application-to-interview ratio is. For me and the people around me, it was normal to get 1 interview for every 50 applications or so. If you're not hitting that (or anywhere close to that I'm guessing) then you might be applying to places too liberally. That's all I've got! Good luck, going that long without a job is rough. P.S. if your personal projects fall on the gaps in your employment, it might be worth putting the timeframes you worked on the projects. That way it would at least show you're doing something between your internship and mthree, but idk how effective that would be.",

I think here's where you can be a bit ambiguous and say you worked in a software developer capacity but not specify or limit yourself to their perception.\\- Maybe I'm just dumb but I basically don't understand what any of the projects under Key System Implementations do at first glance. Recruiters with even less technical experience and patience, might glaze over it or hit the reject button when looking for buzzwords. I'd either try to simplify the language or concepts of what you actually delivered or just tailor this section to specific types of jobs (like how in these projects you used Python etc. to deliver).\\- Probably remove the EE degree in progress as it's not really relevant or use it in your EE-only resume.\\- The undergrad teaching assistant role sounds like fluff, and no employer really cares about how many assignments you graded etc. you should probably write something along the lines of what you taught and areas of focus you excelled at teaching like red-black trees or something etc. Or try and take a look at other undergraduate TAs on Linkedin or something and see what they wrote. To me, at least it seems very \"I want a TA job.\"Last point is you probably want to tailor your resume to each of those roles you listed that you're applying for. At best this looks close to an \"EE major that used to be CS looking for an internship/jr role\" to me, but has some mixed signals so you'd want to orient the resume better towards those kinds of jobs if so.",

You can apply for Graduate level internships which can help you get that resume experience and will have a smaller competitive pool compared to undergrad internships. You can and should get involved in research because that’s such a low bar to get involved in and will immediately add experience to resume and will be a good bonus if you get published and graduate level internships will like this. There is a lot of good paying science based computer science jobs (especially in defense since you are domestic) that will see that as a big plus. Also I think finance also likes people with a more academic background since they do a lot of advanced mathematical analysis for trading strategies. So if you just want to be building apps then maybe drop it? If you want to do something that requires at least a masters like ML/AI, data science or something more math focused then it could be worth it. If you decide to stick with it you should apply to national labs for internships and you can probably get those internships pretty easily as a domestic graduate level student. But to “seal the deal” you should really get into research",

I have published a mobile app that has 1,500 monthly active users, but that didn't seem to help my chances at all. No one cares about or looks at projects. HR doesn't code and is the first line of filtering resumes. Hiring managers have 30 hours of meetings a week. They probably don't even read your resume before the interview.For every 1 person who says they look at projects, there's many more who don't. My hiring manager in banking said projects can only hurt the applicant because you can't defend yourself when someone good looking to judge you. I don't list my GitHub. Projects are fine to teach yourself tech stacks but no need to share the code.Oh 1,500 MAU app, like that's different, that's not some crap project copied off the internet or weirdly coded with AI. Is there not a website or App store listing you can link? But yeah, you're still entry level with 300-1000 applications for every job. You say \"top public school\" but that needs to be #1 or #2 in your state. Then you need to be willing to relocate.Consider forming an LLC to look more legit for self-employed status and mention revenue if over $500. I'm not a lawyer, not giving legal advice.Your resume, you underestimate how lazy HR is. **They read your resume for** [7-8 seconds](https://www.hrdive.com/news/eye-tracking-study-shows-recruiters-look-at-resumes-for-7-seconds/541582/). You need to say what languages were used in your first two projects. Most people don't know what Flutter is. Then you need to expand your Technical Skills. Don't just say Java, add Spring Boot, Postgres with JDBC, Hibernate mapping, other Spring modules, any IDEs used. If same info is within your Java project, that's fine, have it in two places so HR is more likely to read.Then consider an MS to \"reset\" your work gap and be eligible for internships again. [OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech is legit and cheap but you miss out on in-person career fairs where I got all my entry level opportunity.",

Say you have been offered a place with a 20% raise, give your job the benefit of the doubt too (assumingyou like being there) and say that you prefer to stay but you have to do what's best for you and see if you can come to an agreement. Maybe they give you 25% more or maybe they give you 15% more. Would you stay if they didnt match the 15% but gave you around the same ballpark (10-15%?)?",

In 5th grade we had to write a report and publically present it about \"What I want to be when I grow up\". A bunch of kids picked things like professional baseball player, firefighter, cop, \"business man\", etc.I wrote my report on wanting to be a \"Computer Scientist\".I wasn't even pursing SWE specifically. I wanted to get a CS degree, and find *any* technical job that utilized my CS degree. So from day 1 I was ride-or-die CS/tech-industry.But around 10-12 years into my career, my mind has started drifting to simpler times. When I was a teenager, I worked in fast food, and it was one of the best jobs of my life. I literally met life long friends through that job that I still keep in touch with. It's what really brought me out of my shell as an awkward teen, it was pretty formative for my life.The pay was shit, dealing with customers is god awful, but the job itself was very \"zen\". I go in, I sling some burgs for 6-12 hours, and I go home. There's no week/month-long projects, there's no quarterly objectives, there's no product managers, there's no on call, there's nothing to think about after work. It's just burgers. The only thing that followed me after my shifts was I always smelled like beef.But around 10 YOE? I already got my bag. I literally have enough money stashed away that I could afford to work a full time minimum wage job for the rest of my life and not sacrifice anything about my current lifestyle. So when my last job went south, and I started looking for my current one.... I kept thinking \"what if I just... went back to fast food\". I made a spreadsheet to forecast my runway.Ultimately I'm glad I stuck with it and landed my current job.... but I am at the point where if I get laid off, or this job goes south, \"soft-retiring\" is a very realistic option for me.My passion in CS and computers is still as strong as ever. But I don't need to work in the industry to enjoy that side of my life anymore.",

In hindsight it was a good option because if worse comes to worse I can pivot from SWE to EE or CE. Perhaps I would be more competitive in SWE jobs with an SWE degree, but an EE degree is still very prestigious as it was the default for programmers up until the late 90s or perhaps even early 2000s. For example the CEO of Microsoft has an EE bachelors. The CEO of Google did his Bachelors in Metallurgy and Masters and Materials Engineering.I would definitely do something engineering though. CS is less challenging (4 courses vs 6 in engineering), more saturated and offers less flexibility. And even if AI does automate most human labor, licensed Engineers still have state granted authority to sign off on safety critical projects (this matters more in an age with powerful AI, because powerful means dangerous). The reason engineers are sometimes grouped with doctors, lawyers etc. is because they all need to go through stringent licensing and all have serious legal considerations when they sign off on something. Getting a degree that enables you a path to such a license would be extremely valuable, and CS won't give you that option.",

But my advice as someone with a few career regrets would be this:1) Only go to college if you feel ready to give school your full attention. It is relatively easy to fuck around for 4 years and walk out with a degree. But if you limp your way through a STEM degree without fully internalizing the content and setting aside time for relevant clubs and student associations, you're not getting much more than debt out of school.There are plenty of things you can do in the mean-time if you want to focus on being young for a little while.2) Only go into a major you actually have some passion for. Engineering is a lifelong grind. You need to always be learning new things, taking classes, and skilling up. A lot of people in software burn out or decay because it's too draining to grind something you hate.3) The most important thing your college gives you access to is not the degree. It is professional work experience through internships and co-ops. Your entire college career should be centered around securing as much work experience as possible as early as possible. A college degree without at least 9 months of work experience is borderline worthless.",

        "body": "> are even the small companies inundated with applicants, doing 4+ rounds of interviews for mid-level positions?I was unemployed and on the market for *ages*, as a senior engineer, and recently accepted a position where I had three interviews + recruiter screen. Two were with engineers, each technical but only pretty basic coding and mostly conversational. Then a final call with the engineering department director. It's a <100 person company, maybe 30 engineers.It's by far the shortest / least intense interview I've gone through, and I pretty much only interview for companies around that size or smaller. Most everywhere does 4+ rounds if you're including the intro call, but more than 5 is pretty unusual, and I am including \"take home exercise\" as a round.Most typical interview loops are:* Recruiter screen* Hiring manager screen* Technical round (often a take home)* Deeper technical round (common if last was a take home)* Final call with someone important (CTO, director, etc)Step 3 is *super* common when compared to 2020-2022, but sometimes rounds 2-3-4 there are combined in some way. Occasionally there will be no final round and it goes right to offer stage after the big technical round. It's also pretty common for the deep round to just be a discussion of the take home.Shortest I've ever had was screen, conversational with HM, then a technical. After that was offer phase. 3 rounds was more common in 2015-2020, I think, but I've found that losing the in-person technical round to remote interviewing has made the process longer pretty much across the board.",

        "body": "The small company landscape has definitely changed since 2023, but there's some good news mixed with challenges. Many smaller shops are still struggling to find solid mid-level developers, especially those willing to work with \"boring\" stacks like PHP, .NET, or legacy systems. The AI hype has actually created opportunities since many devs are chasing trendy roles elsewhere.However, even small companies have tightened their hiring processes. While you might avoid the FAANG-style leetcode gauntlets, expect 2-3 rounds minimum and probably a small take-home project. The 200+ applicant pools are more common now, but your experience and realistic salary expectations could set you apart from fresh bootcamp grads demanding Silicon Valley wages.Regional markets vary significantly. Smaller cities and non-tech hubs often have less competition and more reasonable processes. You can use a service like Applyre to do a passive job search while you're still in your current situation. Local consulting firms, government contractors, and established businesses modernizing their systems are good targets.Your timing might actually work in your favor. Many companies are pulling back from over-hiring and focusing on steady, experienced developers who can maintain existing systems rather than rockstars building the next unicorn. The boring work is still there and still pays decent money.",

Plenty of people end up stuck in roles that don’t match their strengths just because they’re afraid to pivot.As for those comments from managers warning you about AI replacing software engineers. Honestly, take it with a grain of salt. Most of the loudest voices predicting the \"end of software engineering\" aren’t engineers themselves and are often coming from a business lens where disruption = fear. But if you’re in engineering, you can already see what’s really happening. AI is changing the way engineers work, not eliminating the need for them. Sure, some lower-level tasks are getting automated, but that just means the bar is shifting toward people who understand AI systems, prompt engineering, model integration, performance tuning, security, ethics, etc. You’re positioning yourself exactly in that space.Also, the fact that your new role is in AI software engineering? That’s one of the most resilient and high-impact areas to be in right now. There’s still a massive shortage of engineers who can build, scale, and fine-tune AI products responsibly.",

After that considering working with Claude Code (or one of the desktop apps), adding some MCP servers, and configuring some sub agents. I find this useful for taking a first pass on tasks which I then tidy up manually / in cursor.If you work on UX working with Vervel, bolt, or magic patterns can be useful for vibe coding prototypes to spin things up.If you want to get fancy you can try running a model locally or using open source alternatives (eg Qwen) to get some of these capabilities without having to pay - with the assumption you have a place to run the model.Second what others have said. If you want it learn something you have to do it yourself. Offloading to AI does *not* help you learn though it may enable you to do things you couldn’t otherwise do. Eg we have PMs at my company who are able to prototype their own solutions and even moon light as devs on simple tickets when short staffed. They aren’t learning how to dev. But they are learning how to get things done and, assuming they are given appropriate parameters to not create extra work for everyone else, this has been valuable for the team",

If you copy and paste then I’m already 10x you. Agents can work inside your IDE and directly read and write code. There’s no more copy pasting. You can point it to specific files for context but you don’t even need to do that, you just literally ask it to make your updates.So while you go back and forth copy pasting, my agent is already reading my project files and updating whatever for my feature. THIS is where the problem happens. It’s going to make a lot of mistakes.You work with it by giving it clear directions, the proper context, guiding it along the way, making sure it doesn’t break everything (it will).Learning to use AI is about finding the best way to get the most out of it with the least risk. How can YOU use AI to work on enterprise level software SAFELY? We all know it still can’t be trusted. What happens when this little devil can modify 10 files and write 5k lines of code in a single request prompt? Very quickly you have no idea what’s even going on anymore. Bugs spike up.Worst of all when you get AI in some really complex stuff, unless you have architected it with excellent separation of concerns or provided it excellent context, it will stop working. STOP WORKING. When you start something new with AI it’s all sunshine and daisies but when you start getting really complex it just doesn’t work anymore.For example, if you let it, Claude Code can happily make some 5,000 line file eventually. Well, it won’t be able to understand it top to bottom at all at some point when the tokens get larger than its window. Then it starts to do stupid shit like make methods that already exist, break models, etc bullshit.You gotta work with it to make sure that you can ride the lightning without fucking the pooch. There’s a million AI startups throwing up garbage that’s not secure and doesn’t scale. Learning how to use the tools and work with AI means moving crazy fast with this amazing tool but not being a fuckup like the fucking Tea app",

Work on those, ask quesitons, etc but at the same time: \\- Learn the version control system / branching strategy / release schedule / rollback policies etc better than anyone else in the organization. You'll find that most people are fuzzy on large parts of it and you'll be able to solve and prevent many problems simply by not being fuzzy.\\- Find out where all the documentation is and start reading it. It will be of varying quality and often out of date but get comfortable with the org's business, architecture, network infrastructure, personnel structure, etc.\\- Talk to as many people as you can, in all roles and departments. Learn what they do. You will eventually save someone from a million dollar mistake because you will have awareness of things that no one else does. Make people like you and see you as useful. You will get many more opportunities that way.\\- Learn your tools and technology stack deeply. In the AI era it's more important than ever. It just takes a few books. Learn everything about Java, be able to talk about the major features that were added at various milestones and why you would use them. Same with Spring or whatever else you're using.",

Companies should see you as someone who can build APIs that actually make sense for the consuming applications, not just someone learning Java from scratch.The interview struggle you're facing is real and frustrating, but there are ways around the traditional leetcode gauntlet. Target smaller companies and startups where you can often get in front of actual engineering managers who care more about your ability to solve real problems than your ability to reverse a binary tree under pressure. Focus on companies that do practical coding exercises or take-home projects instead of whiteboard sessions. Your strength in systems design and high-level thinking is incredibly valuable, especially for backend roles where understanding architecture matters more than memorizing algorithms. Some companies do hire based on these skills alone, particularly in more senior positions where they expect you to learn the specific technical details on the job.I actually work on [AI interview helper](http://interviews.chat) to navigate exactly these kinds of tricky interview situations where you need to showcase your transferable skills and handle technical questions that might be outside your current wheelhouse.",

Identity patterns and solve 2-3 mediums and 1 hard leetcode a week3. Get good at architecture. Buy the Alex Xu book and do some mock interviews. Maybe set up a server at home with redis since you're primary a front end. Cloud certs are just an extension of this. The AWS solutions architect exam is literally 65ish system design questions with an Amazon flair. 4. Get good at soft skills. I recommend \"Grow: the essential guide to get promoted\". It's a 2 hour read and has been Invaluable to my career. Simply being active in meetings and sending follow up emails in the format of this book allowed me to lead projects early in my career 1 and 4 can be done in a few months. Getting good at DSA is a lifelong skill unfortunately. Everything you mentioned (devops, cicd, etc) is built on this foundation. It's not sexy at all but being good at the fundamentals is more important than learning the latest framework.",

Soft skills have carried me through the early parts of my career.Being someone who's even remotely competent and NOT an asshole, NOT someone who people need to constantly check up on to make sure they're doing something... someone who communicates effectively and often enough are at least half the battle.I've worked at 3 different companies in that span. The two universal truths are that your largest raises come when you change jobs and outside of someone being the only one who has critical domain knowledge.... no amount of being a technical powerhouse will offset being an asshole. I've seen some insanely talented devs get shown the door because they were just absolutely awful to work with both directly and indirectly. Just having them on the team was like a cancer. In one case, it took a lot longer than it should have, but eventually they were let go. In the others, it happened pretty fast.The people I work with now are all very strong devs. They are very happy to help me when I need it, explain things to me so I can learn and grow, and are patient with me. That's because I try, I put the time and effort in and I communicate. A lot of them have said they'd rather teach a great team mate to do the job than work with an asshole team mate who can knock the work out of the park but you can't stand being around them.TL;DR - Don't be a dick. Do your job. Be polite, friendly and communicate often. Be personable. Those things plus half of a clue as to what is going on technically will get you far.",

If im in the ball park and my explanation as to why I got there is correct, i've impressed the interviewer. There's def been times I didnt get the answer but I also realized my mistake or didnt and said \"my next idea would be to do XYZ since this didnt work\". For me all 3 are just as important but the more Jr you are the more the coding interview should matter. The more Senior you are the more leadership and system design should matter. Because as a Jr it's important to know how to code and learn system design within the company, as a principal it's more important to know design/leadership over code. Seniors and mid-level need to know more about leadership/system design than Jrs but less than principals. So for percentages id say:Jrs - 80% coding, 15% System, 5% leaderMid-level - 65% coding 25% system, 10% leaderSenior - 40% coding 30% system, 30% leaderPrincipal - 20% coding, 40% system, 40% leaderThe higher you go in this career the less you code so for a principal coding shouldnt be important because at that point it's assumed you already know.",

It depends on how well the automation is. I have only done it for 1 project. It wasnt great at first. Most of the automation wasnt built and most major issues came up from the same few things. Because it wasnt automated, we didnt notice until the customer complained and once customer complaned theyd wnat to get on a 3 hour call because they wanted an explanation. Then wehad to write a report to send to them. It sucked.We could get 20 tasks in a day of on-call. Once automation got better, there were less customer complaints and less tasks in general. Most days Id have at most 5, one time I had no incidents and it was like I hit the lotto. But this project was also a major big tech company with customers worldwide. My current company has on-call I have yet to be added to. From what I hear it's one week long. Unless it;'s major incident there is no requirement to fix it until the next business day.",

        "body": "With MSCS, i agree with others. It's not rreally that necessary for us. It does help to make your resume look a bit nicer and might get you a slightly higher role and pay off the bat, but to me it's not worth 2 years of missing out on experience to do for an extra 5k-10k in pay you would've just likely had if you started to work. The key really is if you can get a job to pay for your masters degree. So in summary, it's not worth the MSCS unless you get someone to pay it for you or if you can escape paying minimal and not having to get loans. I had my job pay it for me and I grinded for 2 years as a part-time student and only had to pay 5k out of pocket those 2 years. But I also did summer courses as well to finish on time. As for your leetcode grind. I am not someone who really thinks you need to \"grind\" leetcode to get a job. You can and might be good at it to land the job, the problem is that many people think they can just grind it and dont care to learn the ins and outs of what they are doing. So they basically are hoping to get a similar question where they can think \"omg that's leetcode question #100 or similar to it, i just need a map\". But they dont care to learn why they need the map, or if there's a slightly different approach they could take. I have been in the job market twice in my career, never had to grind leetcode and I got into two big tech companies (one of them a Mag7 company) by just following a google DSA guide I will link below. It has videos from cracking the coding interview author that explain DSA very well. Also links free leetcode study guides with example questions to practice on. Companies dont care if you get the questions right, they only care if you know what you are doing and explain your thought process well in the questions. I got both those jobs and didnt do 100% well on the questions. A few times I got stuck but because I explained my thought process well they liked my approach. They know you wont get it 100% off the bat, they just want to know where your heads at. So for me i like to say \"hey i think I can possibly use a map here because of XYZ possibly a set\" and then I try it. I also go step by step. So usually the first thing I tackle is the return cases. I.e. if I am doing a array traversal the first thing I write is the return case if array is empty. It sounds dumb, but they appreciate when you tackle the small things first that could easily be forgotten. Also it's one of those things of once you start coding your nerves go down even if it's a simple lin. Then at the end I write test cases and try to go through multiple different cases (empty array, edge cases, etc). If any of them come out wrong, then I quickly refactor.Google DSA link is: [https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/data-structures-and-algorithms/)",

Most tech companies care way more about your ability to solve coding problems and demonstrate practical skills than they do about advanced degrees. A master's degree might open some doors at research-heavy companies or for certain specialized roles, but for the majority of software engineering positions, you're better off investing that time and money into sharpening your interview skills and building a portfolio that shows you can actually code.That said, the interview grind is real and can be soul-crushing if you're not strategic about it. Focus on understanding patterns rather than memorizing solutions, and make sure your projects actually solve problems or demonstrate technologies that companies use. The market is tough right now, but candidates who can confidently navigate technical interviews still get offers.

There's no way for us to know where that stems from. If you're confident you're communicating clearly, you should start getting instructions in writing as much as possible. If that's not possible, start making your own notes about your conversations with your lead and manager. That said, you claim to be finishing your work, so it's presumably not like you can't program. Give it time, and if you can't get along or communicate clear with the lead and/or manager, look elsewhere. No need to throw in the towel on your career.",

Completing all your work without defects or carryover while being told you're struggling is contradictory feedback that makes no sense. Your tech lead sounds unprofessional and possibly threatened by having to mentor someone, which is literally part of senior roles.The fact that you study outside work, use proper question etiquette, take notes, and have certifications shows you're doing everything right. Good developers ask questions, especially early in their careers. A healthy team would encourage this, not punish it. The \"vibes-based\" performance reviews are particularly concerning red flags.Don't let one dysfunctional workplace convince you to abandon an entire career. Most tech teams aren't like this, and your methodical approach suggests you actually have good instincts for the field. Your current situation is damaging your confidence unnecessarily, and the longer you stay, the harder it becomes to remember that this isn't normal or acceptable.Start job searching immediately while you still have income. A service like Applyre might be helpful. When interviewing, ask about mentorship programs, team dynamics, and how they support junior developers. Good companies will have structured onboarding and patient senior developers.",

Also links many LC study guides that have example problems. For me, it's more important to understand DSA than actuall just grind and hope to get a similar problem. Gridning can get you the job but good interviewers will really test your knowledge and if you fall down the wrong rabbit hole you wont understand how to get out of it. For me I try to do coding questions step by step and when I speak loudly I say \"Im thinking about whether a set or map makes sense here\" and say why. It's not about getting it right it's about showin gthem your mindset when you are presented with a problem.

Choose 1–2 roles you’d genuinely like, and let them drive your prep direction. Focus on high-yield patterns (like sliding window, recursion, trees) rather than solving random 300 problems. Your goal isn’t to become a LeetCode machine it’s to show structured thinking under time pressure. You already solve harder things at work.

I dont mind being called out but it seems like he's going out of his way just to do it to me is there anything you can suggest that I can do to best approach this. I dont mind talking to him but I felt it may be best to bring it up to you so to avoid the wrong approach.\" Something like that.Unfortunately in this career there are always hostile devs. Some you can learn to co-exist with them, others it's impossible. I've worked with 2 guys like that. First guy, was a screamer. His way or the high-way. I was terrified of hij when I first go tthere. Then I had to work with him. Funny thing was, he ended up being the nicest guy. I learned how to work with him basically. I noticed that if I had a difference of opinion I had to back up my words. Most of the time I was still wrong lol, but sometimes I was right and he gave me credit. I think he liked that I did my own investiagation and even had my own points. I wasnt just taking his word as the god given truth. Now in my second job, I could never figure out the hostile dev. He had no people skills that I could crack. In a lot of ways I compare him to Michael Jordan. He was the guy that knew everything of the project. He produced in his sleep. He didnt mind working 12 hour days. He told managers how to do their job. I fhe didnt like your work ethic, he didnt want to work with you. And I think he realzied early on he didnt like my work ethic (Im more of a9-5 guy). I worked with him on a major project he had created and it went terribly. I kept finding erors and had to change my design like 20 times because each time I came up with a design, another problem would come up. Then he gave my manager a list of his complaints of me. My manager kind of walked on eggshells for him tbh. I will admit some was fair, but others just seemed unfair. The biggest one I remember that I felt was unfair was that my manager said that I have too many commits in my MRs. That happened once and it was because the design changed so much. I fought it but my manager even 6 months later was still using that against me. I ended up getting fired. I dont blame that dev but it defintelty felt like the beginning of the end when I wasnt on his good side.",

        "body": "So, I’m a senior and we’ve dealt with devs and senior devs like this on my last few teams. Sometimes they do this to cover their own mistakes using a highly visible chat. Sometimes they are completely clueless people that don’t understand that using a wide audience chat is not how you deal with things.So, we’ve fixed this a few ways. First step is to document every single time they call you out on a wide audience chat of any kind. If this person does this to others, probably should document that as well. The more records you have the better. Screenshots are also preferred.Second step is to let your manager know that you don’t appreciate being put on blast by this other dev in a company wide chat especially when they you’re not at fault for the issue. Include your record of every time they call you out specifically and what the actual issue was that had to be resolved. Ask your manager how this should be handled. The wrong answer is “nothing”. We had to do a meeting where all the devs agreed to not individually name people even in our team only chat for issues. Senior Devs can ping people directly and handle it not in a chat.Third step is if this behavior continues and your management doesn’t do anything, notify HR with your documentation. Make sure you have save this documentation somewhere you have access to in case they retaliate (manager, HR, senior dev).On most of my teams, we never had to get past step 2. Only once did we have someone get to step 3 and HR talked to the offending dev and manager. Behavior stopped for a few months and then started up again. In that case, the guy was gone in like 48 hours after he started again because he started blaming people who weren’t on our team or didn’t work on the project with issues.",

If you hear about someone working on cloud migrations, network configurations, or server maintenance, ask if you can shadow, help, or at least learn what tools they’re using. You’d be surprised how much access and insight you can get just by showing curiosity and initiative. Outside of work, keep building your skills around cloud fundamentals. Since you're studying cloud computing, start applying what you're learning in small personal projects. Spin up a website using S3 and CloudFront, automate infrastructure with Terraform, or play around with IAM policies in a sandbox AWS or Azure environment. The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner or Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) are great early on. You don’t need them to get a job, but they can show recruiters you're serious. Then, stack on more practical, intermediate certs (like AWS Solutions Architect Associate or AZ-104) when you feel ready. Definitely apply to internships as much as possible, but also start building a presence online. Maybe a GitHub with your cloud projects, or even posts on LinkedIn showing what you’re learning. Follow your interests too but with intention. If you're curious about DevOps, play with CI/CD pipelines. If security piques your interest, try setting up least privilege access or configuring network firewalls in the cloud. Over time, your interests will naturally start guiding you toward the kind of engineering roles you’d enjoy most.",

When you're employed and job searching unsuccessfully, your mind begins to think \"If I could just do this full time surely I'd line something up quickly and that'll solve all my problems!\"The problem is that's not how it works. If you're getting 0 interviews now, job hunting \"full time\" will continue to get you 0 interviews. When you're not even getting *interviews*, that's not a problem you can solve by just buckling down and committing more time to the search.If you were struggling with leetcode, or performing well in interviews, that argument would hold more weight. More interview practice means better performance. But you're not even getting the interview. That's not something that'll get better if you \"practice\" 8 hours a day. There's nothing *to* practice.I'm not invalidating what you're feeling at all, I'm sure it absolutely feels like quickand, and that you're stuck in your career.But want to know a worse feeling? Being unemployed, draining your savings, while still having all of those exact same negative feelings. That'll be way worse. Getting into that hole is how a lot of people spiral into a deep career-ending depression.Quitting your job will not be a magic fix. If anything, it will make your search *harder*. It's always easier to find a job while you're employed with an income. An important consideration a lot of people don't think about is because you have an income you have the power to reject job offers that aren't good fits. Imagine you get another offer for a role *just like* the one you're currently in. Obviously you wouldn't want to accept that, right? That's the whole reason you're job searching, to get away from this kind of role.When you're employed, you just turn down the offer, and you continue the job search. There's no rush.When you're unemployed, you feel an intense pressure to accept *anything* because you need to put food on the table. So you accept a bad offer, and inadvertently end up back at square one.Hold onto this job, and job search on the side. This is how most people change jobs.",

It's a mindset issue more than a skill issue (I've seen many talented devs bogged down by this).I'm generalizing for the sake of the discussion; I've heard of *some* healthy-er workplaces, but generally engineers aren't valued as much as other countries and the culture is pretty top-down when it comes to management.There's also a huge divide between north and south when it comes to compensation and quality of life.The main problem is; swe is a team sport, often with collaborating teams. I could get lucky, but what use is it to be doing well while everyone else is struggling? I'd be a layoff from being miserable again and could have to work with people that don't have the privilege of a good workspace and thus are stressed and struggle with good practices.I've had a discussion with some entrepreneurs telling me to go work in the X region, but what's the point when a couple regions are the exception? (I don't mirror said mentality, I'm just questioning its logic).",

Section 174 revision allows for alot of the cash flow issues involving dev salaries to be softened but it's sunset in 2029 pending another congressional budgetary hearing. 2. Foreign Visas - Joseph Edlow was recently confirmed to USCIS director. A major hawk when it comes to h1b and opt, F1 etc. Only good for domestic stem. 3. The fed rate - Naturally if debt becomes expensive, labor becomes expensive. This situation is still unravelling. Only time will tell So the answer is: Possibly. This situation is sticky. On one hand salaries in tech are great. But the market itself is volatile. Like anything it's a calculated risk. If you want to mitigate it and still remain in tech. Id consider a double major in math and target quant roles. Be warned, those devs comprise of some of the best engineers in the industry. Goodluck",

Most companies today are shipping products faster via LLM APIs, so roles that once demanded model training and debugging have been flattened into integration-heavy workflows. That said, the deeper work still exists just in more focused places: research teams, model pre-training groups, infra/startup labs, or proprietary AI stack builders.If you’re not seeing these roles on portals, it’s likely because they’re less advertised and more network-driven. You’re not burnt out you’re underutilized. Consider targeting orgs building from scratch (e.g., open-source foundation models, RLHF stacks, or custom embedding workflows) where your skill set is still a competitive advantage. Happy to point you to a few such paths if you're open.",

I'm not sure what infra you are working on, but when I took an infra job, I ultimately left because I was frustrated with the shit code we wrote and the lack of any sort of real development work. I did all sorts of stuff with cloudflare tunnels, DNS migrations, and dealt with TLS certs, plus on call. The work I really wanted to do, on the database engine, was just not a priority for us, compared to cloud operations.I've seen juniors and new grads do well on infra teams, so it's definitely possible, but all things career progression depend on how much you excel in your roll, and the opportunities your org has to promote you. I'd say that's equally true as a junior engineer trying to make senior in 5 years, as it is for a senior trying to make staff and looking for projects with company wide impact, at least under the system of stack ranking that will average on the organization level.I basically left infra to go back to product, and am trying to make staff now as a team lead. There's no shortage of impactful projects, especially if you can step up and be a leader. I am hesitant to think one domain mints more staff engineers than another, and I'm staring down a company wide rollout of our project for next year, so that hasn't been the case with me.In my experience, the biggest factor is just what you want to do. I tried infra, didn't like it, so went back to product. If you like infra, do it, the amount of work is pretty much insane, and when you don't like it, you'll really struggle to outcompete the equally smart people who do. Most of the job is simply showing up everyday, moving the ball, and stepping up when you need to. If you're looking for opportunities, there's no shortage of that in either domain.",

Product engineering relies heavily on quick iteration, optics, and easily marketable impact which can be hard to do with infrastructure and legacy systems. You can have a harder time getting promoted and may need to spend more time on painful parts of the job instead of pure coding experience.",

        "body": "I landed on an infra/platform team as a new grad at a f500 household name fintech. I was misled and thought I'd be doing mobile, it was a miscommunication during the team matching process. I've been on the team for 3 years. To be honest, it has been pretty miserable, and I actually think it has hindered my career.My team is very top heavy, its all senior and staff engineers. We maintain the service mesh, the problems are all pretty abstract and challenging and require a serious knowledge of the *entire* system, and every item we own is a tier0 critical service meaning zero room for failure. It requires both breadth and depth of knowledge. So finding junior-appropriate tasks was really difficult for the first couple of years. Most of our time is spent putting out fires and handling incidents, and dealing with horizontal asks. The work is hard and the on-call toil is extremely stressful, the work life balance is bad, and the work is simply not fun. It is more of a devops/sre role than SWE, and I am not actually building or creating anything, the work is not fulfilling. I expressed some concern to management that I was not writing enough code and was missing out on vital early-career experiences to hone the basics, but everybody always changed the conversation to tell me how lucky I was to have the opportunity to learn system design and get exposure to kubernetes (sound familiar, OP?). Unsurprisingly, when I finally decided I wanted to switch teams, I was told that I couldn't because I don't have enough experience writing code and other managers want to see evidence that I have worked on substantial projects with object oriented languages. So at my company, I am basically stuck. I worry that if I look for a job elsewhere using another stack, they will think I don't have the skills they are looking for (or that I will land the job anyway and then struggle to ramp up). I do not want to work in similar roles in the future. Going from devops back to SWE is hard - so choose carefully.I think that infra/devops is something that people tend to do when they get tired of app development and are seeking more complex challenges. Some people really just enjoy this type of work, as well, but my experience is they tend to embody the negative stereotype of misanthropic back-end developers, more-so than regular SWEs. That is anecdotal, admittedly. I also think that having a background in regular SWE work will help somebody do better with devops once they eventually get there - it is hard to maintain a platform for service owners to develop microservices on top of, when I have never really done it myself. I do not believe in the idea of \"take on something extremely challenging as a beginner, and rise to the occasion\". Science has shown that this is not the most ideal pedagogical approach. It is like weight lifting: give me a 300lb weight, and no matter how long you let me try, I won't ever get strong enough to lift it. Give me multiple plates and let me progressively try heavier ones, and I will eventually get to the heavier ones.This is just my experience. I struggled to find mentorship and that is a big part of it. The team is constantly busy with high-severity urgent incidents, nobody wants to make time to answer questions and help me. It's been a really shitty experience and I burned out very quickly.tldr: I advise against it, but in this labor market, it may be wise take what you can get.",

Sometimes the skill is also in realizing that they've asked the wrong question and proposing an alternate question with a more useful answer.Unless you've very recently answered the same question for someone else, or the question is related to the work you were doing moments before the conversation began, being able to give a deep, accurate, off the cuff answer is not expected. Give the best answer you can in the moment, be clear that it's a preliminary answer, tell the person you'll get back to them with a more complete answer soon, and then follow through on that promise as quickly as possible, e.g. via email or chat. (In my position, the real challenge is having time to follow up on question A before I get questions B, C, and D coming in...)The other senior engineers you see answering questions off the cuff are either answering about their current work, or giving a rehearsed answer to a common question, or (worst case) bluffing about how complete/correct their answer is. You might occasionally encounter someone with a near photographic memory for technical things, but it's not the norm. I don't expect it from my team, and I don't feel like others expect it from me.",

Or if you leak sensitive company information and it causes damages to the company.It's still a scary clause, and one I don't recall ever seeing. Talk to a lawyer first. Most lawyers would be happy to have a quick consult with you for cheap, some might even do it for free. And I mean a *real* lawyer, not a reddit one.2 - NDA's aren't unusual. *Especially* for a paranoid startup that's still in the stage where they think everyone's out to get them. You leaking their big beautiful startup idea even a couple years after you quit could cripple the company.

So I think the answer that I would have here is to think about what you're doing to set yourself apart from others and how you're showcasing this to potential employers.Other than that, I'd say that software engineering jobs seem harder to come by than usual, even for those with experience, and the first job people find after college in their career field is typically the most difficult job search they have, so finding a job will probably take a while. TBH 100+ job applications really isn't that much and I kind of think you have unrealistic expectations on how long and how much work goes into finding a job as a new grad. Also, in addition to the resume advice others are giving you above that you should listen to, your resume also seems to be missing a skills section which generally should be included for a software engineering or other technical role.",

Leadership experience in extracurriculars looks just as good, maybe better.You have internships right, you should be getting callbacks. I looked up the university given the non-4.0 grading scale, TCS in India had [big layoffs](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mb7cxe/offshore_services_giant_tcs_is_laying_off_12000/) and that's not a good sign for the industry as a whole. Still, you should at least make it past the initial screeningOne of those companies should have wanted to hire you or offer a second term to come back. It's not a big stretch to think you were just resume boosting and didn't really want to work for them. Better to have 3 internships than 0 by far but you really only needed one. I'm not saying take 1 or 2 off your resumes, just that 3 isn't all upside.",

It's fine to be motivated by money, I check stock price all the time, but the challenging nature of the work means folks that are passionate really hold an advantage.As far as concern over getting PIP'd. I've found that the people on the PIP shortlist are the same ones that are more motivated by money than actually becoming better software engineers. In a workplace like a large company with stack ranking, you're not only competing against smart people, but smart people who are highly motivated and ambitious to move ahead.",

        "body": "I think a great way to approach this is really taking some time to understand your needs and where you want to grow as an engineer, then doing your best to communicate that to your mentors. A lot of the best mentor/mentee relationships don’t actually feel super formal, and are a two-way street where both parties proactively communicate with how they can support and help one another.For yourself, I think some questions to think about are - How do I want to be supported in this role?- What areas do I want to grow in as an engineer?- What communication style works for me and for my mentors? How can we facilitate this so it works for both of us?On the mentor side, I’ve been working for a little over 5 years now, and I’ve always liked asking a lot of questions to my mentees to figure out how they would like to be supported, and then go from there to see what I can do to help them. This can come as direct advice from my side, sponsoring them to pick up or lead projects that can help them reach their goals, or putting them in touch with other folks within the team or company that could help them better than I can! Good luck!!",
