You'll be faster using Prefect or whatever other python orchestrator than you will with n8n. Why? Because n8n wasn't built for complex data pipelines. Your boss can choose; would he rather you spend your time building out more exciting use-cases or grappling with trying to force a square peg into a round hole.As someone who has built a declarative saas Orchestra-tion tool (I am not saying what it is but you can guess which one!) I've often struggled conceptually to define why we're better than something like n8n for data use-cases, and I think fundamentally it just has to do with the level of abstraction. It's the same as any orchestrator reallywhen you bake in the things data engineers need it's a lot more than just firing off an API request, which n8n does exceptionally well ;)",

        "body": "Let me focus on data products. I have a data engineering background, and yes, these terms often get thrown into the buzzword bucket.But I actually like thinking in data products. A little story time: Our team once had a major pipeline outage (fun fact: it was when we upgraded our Hadoop infrastructure to a new major version, what a mess :man_facepalming:). Suddenly, everyone in the company understood our value, because they saw what broke when our tables and processes went down.Up until that point, I often struggled communicating our value to stakeholders. Then, during a sales call with a third-party company, they asked me, \"What are your data products?\", I heard it the first time and thought it was just management speak. But actually, it became quite a useful tool for me.While software engineers ship visible features, data engineers build invisible infrastructure. Our work powers decisions, reports, and systems behind the scenes. That makes it hard to demonstrate value.Technically speaking, I'd define a data product as a composition of assets that, taken together, deliver a result with business relevance(!). Assets can be anything involved in the process: input tables, queries, processes, models, intermediate results, etc. If we're talking Airflow specifically (because this is well known by most), that means tables, Dags, tasks, everything involved in delivering the outcome.From a data engineering perspective, data products are a communication framework to make our work visible. Simple concept, but powerful for explaining what we actually deliver.From a management perspective, a data product is a measurable business asset with clear ROI and accountability. It's something you can point to during budget discussions, assign ownership to, and track performance against defined SLAs.However, not every table, task, or Dag is a data product, but it might be part of one. It's a good exercise to identify them by looking at: Business impact (if this disappeared tomorrow, would executives notice? Would customers be impacted?), orchestration complexity (we had a super Dag triggering lots of other Dags, that was a clear sign for a data product), and high-value consumption (multiple teams depending on it, feeding executive dashboards, etc.).Look at all your data assets, try to group them together as data products, and also learn what value those data products generate (e.g. what are the tables, reports used for? Is there any measurable impact like revenue, cost savings, increase retention times along the chain?). This will help you to communicate the value of your work, be it internally or when applying for a new job and it helps understanding what needs monitoring and observability.**Basically: When they work, they're invisible. When they break, everyone notices.**",

So you make your API call, then cut down what it returns to you to only keep the parts you need. You then take the result of that and load it into your warehouse.

I don’t think I’ve really heard of going to HR because an individual wasn’t happy with their review. Depending on the size of the company and your relationship with them, talking to your boss’s boss is an option but could backfire if you don’t already have a working relationship there. Having been on both sides, depending on how frequently you’re trying to get clarification/how it’s being done I could potentially understand the manager’s side. I’ve had employees who seem to reach out with questions whenever there’s any kind of decision that needs to be made or they run into any kind of roadblock, rather than trying to figure it out themselves first, and it can be draining when it ends up being a regular interruption. Ideally a manager wants to be able to point you in the right direction, answer your questions up front, and then generally let you do your thing. I think it’s also worth acknowledging the difference between effort and results. If I have an engineer who is “lazy” but gets things done without issue or automates things to make their job easier, and another that is always working hard but seems to struggle a lot, I’ll take the lazy one every time. Not trying to doubt what you’re saying or anything, just some things to consider. All of that said, if you think your review did not reflect your actual performance, and the company doesn’t value you, then absolutely find a job somewhere that does value your talents. It can also be the case that your manager is incompetent or a jerk, and there’s no obligation to stick around.",

Honestly a lot of times managers are just overworked themselves and/or incompetent so I really would try not to take it personally even though I’m sure it feels like it is This might not be what you want to hear but if it was me I’d probably start looking for a better place to work. Sounds like they really do not value your hard work and won’t even hear you out which is a huge red flag. And it sounds like they’re disorganized if they have this new manager that’s only seen you for a month and has no context of your past. Sometimes companies just suck",

And the source of all of our problems was always data. And so I just became fed up. I thought to myself, “fuck it, how hard can this be? AI can write SQL queries. Wtf are we doing here?” I grew up abroad and went to an international school. When I got to college in the USA I realized nobody ever bothered to teach me calculus in high school. And then I had to take calculus in college, and I was so far behind. I was failing the class. It was the same thing this time as it was that time. I said, “fuck it, how hard can this be?” I ate tons of adderal, chain-smoked cigarettes, chugged coffees, for months until I taught myself calculus and caught up to everyone else. Same thing this time, including all of the stimulants and adderal and coffee and nicotine. I just “no-lifed” AI & DE & automation for 9 months until I figured it out. I go into the same SLT meetings now, and I’m like a God :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:. The same people are there with the same problems they were complaining about 9 months ago. They’re bumbling around in the stone ages, and my team is landing rockets on the moon, metaphorically speaking. My experience? Almost anything you do that matters in life starts from the thought: “Fuck it, how hard can this be?”",

Furthermore, it's semi-structured data so unlike a relational DB, you aren't screwed when a schema change has to be made and if you are using Confluent Cloud you get a schema registry for backwards compatibility.

The thingnis, those queries were slow when they ran it in US, close to MySQL server, and totally collapsed, when I had to run them in Europe. I, a beginner with databases reverse engineered those messy queries, cleaned up the logic and rebuilt them so that they ran faster here, than they used to run over there. My boss said \"It's so... clean.\" And to this day it's one of the best compliments I got for my work.",

I started plopping down SQL server/ssis everywhere, because I can fix whatever your problem is in a few days and you can take however long it is you need to build out XYZ and you have a control system you can run in parallel with and when you can demonstrate that you can reliability replicate my numbers, we can migrate over. Over time a lot of these initiatives died off because it became harder and harder to justify the man months spent reinventing the wheel and these comically large cloud bills for really simple tasks.I'm sure that's an unpopular opinion, I like cool tech too, but I just want something I can trust to work and move on with my life.",

What you're describing sounds typical, maybe even kinda good? Don't expect to find a job where you are free from dipshit architecture and handed up to date documentation of your data assets in day 1, maybe those roles exist somewhere but I haven't seen them.If you think in terms of business value, I'm wondering if your org's move to the cloud was a bright idea. If you're not a fortune 500, a not-terrible on prem warehouse is perfectly adequate, and a better investment in data might have actually been to document what you have and work towards a medallion architecture just within the dwh, which would have given you the opportunity to systematically unpick the sources and transformations, embedding business logic and documenting it as you go. But dipshit architects with a vendor in their ear are far from rare, anywhere you go.It feels universally accepted that if you're on prem you're not a real DE and execs and architects believe it's a fundamental truth that the cloud will unlock value. In your case it sounds like your org had a not-terrible thing going already, and fucked yourselves with a lazy lurch into the cloud that just lifted and shifted your existing problems.Maybe the question to ask is what it is that you like about DE. Today you've got big problems to solve and lots of business value to unlock, a management structure above you that's floundering and will think you're a wizard if you help them by implementing some common sense basics, and a pretty typical set of issues that will be familiar in any role.",

I worked with a Microsoft MVP (recent MVP), author of several books, and expert level. His academic training is religious studies.It’s also true that a non-computer science background puts you at a disadvantage you should consider. It would be wise to strategically plan how you will overcome this gap - and which areas you need to cover in what order. Surely, you don’t need to go back to school and major in it - but you also can’t ignore it. It sounds like you are approaching this in a very logical manner. I suggest you spend some time looking at real colleges, reviewing their requirements for computer science (classes) and look through some syllabus’s. The outcome of this exercise is to gain visibility in what you are missing - essentially benchmark. Then you can look at this and see what you think is relevant to you. For example a class in TCP/IP may not be so important for data engineering. This should all your anxiety by helping you to understand how you fit. Once you find some classes you think you are missing, just look at the syllabus, find the book, and buy the previous version of the book on Amazon for $10. Read it, study it, master it - move on. I really don’t see computer science degrees teaching data warehousing - so keep this in mind. You might be better off starting with Kimball (follow my same instructions). I would prioritize star schemas over compilers!Edit: a computer science degree isn’t a finish line, it’s a piece of paper. Looking at my peers, 20 years later, some of them were brilliant and really accelerated in their careers. Others got A’s on tests but couldn’t do hands on. They didn’t survive in the real world. I did very poor on tests, well on labs, and great post university. It’s all about how you apply your knowledge - the piece of paper only gets you the job interview.",

That 4-hop multi-call process you're shoe-horning into place is fundamentally broken from an architectural standpoint - especially since you have to pay for each hop, all while cementing your business into a deep dependency relationship with an untrustworthy AI startup. The emperor here has no clothes. Most of the same problem could be solved with some traditional coding, and if you absolutely \\*have\\* to make it \"AI\" (in order to get that sweet funding) then maybe tack something right on at the end to provide a conversational interface. All of the other stuff (agents etc) is far better achieved using traditional coding and data management. If you don't have good data understanding/management, most of your projects are going to fail.",

Move the early steps, such as intent parsing, task planning, and tool calls, to smaller models like gpt-4o-mini or claude haiku. Keep gpt-4 for final synthesis. That shift alone can drop query cost from around $0.75 to roughly $0.30.Then tighten the workflow: cache outputs, remove duplicate sub-queries, and resolve data conflicts before the LLM using a simple source hierarchy (billing wins). When conflicts remain, show them to the user with context.Langfuse is great for tracing, but you’ll also want per-tenant caps and cost alerts at the orchestration layer. Once you hit about 5,000 users, that’s a must.That $75k/month burn is real, but with routing alone, you can get it down to $35-40k.",

A data platform is understood as the set of services and tools necessary for data teams to be able to develop whatever is necessary to meet business requirements. Looking at the Databricks context, Terraform can be used to standardize cluster deployments, catalog creation, permissions and access to these catalogs, among other things. In the project I'm working on, there are hundreds of clusters, it's impossible to manage, track and make the necessary changes manually. When we use Terraform, these tasks are abstracted using Git. And there is also DABs (Databricks Asset Bundle) which is based on terraform to manage the databricks assets.",

It's not really about Terraform, but whatever platform you're working with. For me, working with Snowflake is easy enough so the Terraform is ok, trying to build complex things in AWS with all the right security and stuff with the right designs is a bit of a non-starter.I've found that the Terraform provider docs are generally pretty decent, and they can help highlight how things work.

SSIS can handle on‑prem migrations, but you’ll write more glue and own the failure modes. If you stick with SSIS: use the SSIS Catalog (project model), environment variables, SQL Agent with retries/alerts, CDC components, bulk-load to staging then MERGE, and a metadata-driven pattern (BIML helps). I’ve used Informatica and Talend for this; we also used DreamFactory to expose legacy DBs as REST so apps stayed decoupled during cutover. Bottom line: you’re buying guardrails and support; if your team’s strong, SSIS works.",

A lot of people like me are using Spark because when we transitioned to iceberg it was the reference implementation and things like pyiceberg didn't support writes to partitioned tables or something, even though we don't have the kind of scale that actually needs all that Spark can do (I often run ad hoc jobs from a standalone spark on a single vm). If you do feel the need to use spark I would highly recommend serverless EMR over trying to run your own cluster since it sounds like you're already in AWS and have modest scale.",

Traditional databases and especially oltp databases quick become storage bound in both the trivial sense but also in terms of query performance.Even if you have fairly minimal throughput it’s not that long before the accumulated data begins to slow queries or you simply need to scale up to accommodate the extra data. This is at the very least literally a finops problem if it doesn’t also actually become a performance problem. Another reason is that ML is very dependent on having very reproducible data which often looks like versioning data pipelines and basically duplicating the entire output multiple times in order to ensure reproducibility. This again can very quickly become a storage problem but operationally iceberg tables and the parquet files they are built on make precise duplication of what amounts to an entire database much easier as storing them is cheap. Imagine if every time the downstream pipeline ran you would setup a whole new database and you’d keep it alive from then on just in case someone needed to reproduce some run? It quickly becomes basically impossible.",

One day you will want to add unit tests for the transformation, for corner cases, etc. and having logic in pure functions (functions that takes DataFrame and return DataFrame) will simplify things, because you won't need to mock i/o, but can just write tests.2. Move configuration logic away from transformation logic. You can create a singleton \"context\" class or an abstract class for the \"job\" and re-use it everywhere. When I say \"configuration\" I mean things like partition dates, input schemas or s3 paths. Again, it will simplify both maintenance (anyone who wants just to check a path or a config do not need to dive into transformation logic) and testing (you can test config and transformation separately).3. Do not write a very long chain of pyspark transformations, it is really hard to read. Instead separate logical parts into small functions. Simplify reading the code, transformation and testing.Overall: the main benefit of using PySpark DF API over SQL is that you can benefit from all the Python tooling for working with growing complexity of the codebase (functions, classes, imports, objects, tests, etc.). So, such a migraton, imo, makes sense only if you are going to use this benefits. In other words, you should start thinking about your ETL as about the software product and use the correspondence best practices. If you just convert SQL to DF API calls it will be much worser: you won't use benefits of DF API, but you will suffer from downsides of DF API.",

Many companies are not big enough to have a team dedicated solely to EDI, but I have seen a lot of companies outsource it.As a DE, I’ve only worked heavily in EDI at one company, but that’s because I was the “go to” tech guy for just about everything. I basically setup up the field mappings to our ERP, did some testing with vendors/distributors, and handed off to the respective department. That department then owned the process from there.EDI could be a nice to have on your resume if you come across it in the wild, but I don’t see a lot of companies asking for it for DE roles. I certainly wouldn’t go out of my way to learn it.",

Ideally once a year so that you can can use the latter one to look for improvements or failures.I've found this to be extremely successful, with comments from users like this priceless one: **\"the metrics aren't well-organized or very accurate so whenever I need a metric I look for multiple redundant metrics and just average them together.\"**I then took the survey results, formatted them into insight categories, and used them to create some projections, like:* Query writing cost: 20% of the 200 users provided survey responses, we'll assume that this is a representative sampling. Based on this it appears that new queries take an average of 2 hours to validate we're using the data correctly, given X new queries per month this translates to Y total time and vast friction. Given improvements in the data model & data catalog we believe that we can get this down from 2 hours to 15 minutes - which saves us Z total time.* Data quality cost: same approach* ETL & modeling cost: same approachGood luck!",

If you can't really measure the impact of cleaning up the data model and there is no organizational pain from the current mess, it is kind of hard to justify spending time on the activity when you could be spending time on more measurable revenue generating or cost cutting items.My suggestion would be add an additional 20% of effort to each initiative on your roadmap that the engineers can use addressing technical debt. Specifically, my suggestion would be for them to simplify the model as they work on delivering on the roadmap initiatives and focus on decluttering one entity in the model during each initiative.Also, a nice side effect will be downstream items consuming the model will break as you make the updates. Some of those will go unnoticed and will give you more visibility in to what is actually being used. This will help you prioritize your work in the future.",

I don't really have the bandwidth to get too involved, but if you want to DM me and connect, I'd be happy to review whatever approach you get recommended by said freelancers and give my thoughts.In all data projects, the most difficult part isn't so much the technology, but rather understanding the inputs and outputs. To hire a freelancer or get some better feedback from us here, you'll need a comprehensive list of all the platforms you want to source data from, the available methods of extracting that data, where you want to send it, and how you want to interact with it. For example, do you just want to run consolidated reporting from the various platforms you've mentioned? Do you want to push data from one into another?

It has helped us accelerate onboarding time, reduce debugging, optimize pipelines and rationalize compute. Instead of provisioning multiple large personal clusters on databricks for each contributor, we can do the same with a single SQL warehouse serverless and some k8s, for a cheaper infrastructure cost.I witness a lot of poor Dataiku deployments with poor architecture choices, relying on the underperforming DSS engine for most task.

Environment and Deployment * Poor Environment Isolation: Requires cross-environment connections (e.g., Staging to Production). * Manual Bundles: Deployment is a manual, proprietary \"Bundle\" system. It ignores standards repository like Nexus/Artifactory and consumes a lot of disk space.2. Kubernetes Use * Inefficient: Dataiku-built images are large and vary by environment. * rigid : It's difficult to set accurate resource requests and limits for efficient cluster operation.3. Vendor Lock-in * Value Trapped: All core data science/analytics value is locked inside the platform runtime . * Despite being Python-based, best practices steer us toward using Dataiku-specific libraries, making migration very complex.4. Operational Overhead * High Boilerplate Tax: Significant custom coding is required just to make the platform reliable (e.g., managing logs, users, and bundles).Note that Dataiku is API-driven, and a lot is possible with the api, but solving these issues requires an insane amount of custom engineering effort.",

For the sites where there's no API and you're stuck with raw HTML, an LLM can still help extract structured fields from the scraped page.

Try to understand how they represent their data and transform it into a common schema that you upkeep yourself.For change detection it's kinda hard, we scrape over 500k listings every day at my workplace and when one vendor changes something we usually don't notice until someone complains downstream and we look into it.

I understand there are a lot of good reasons in favor of being opinionated by default, but that's a separate matter. Re performance, I suspect if duckdb is using indexing or parallelization, which is not yet implemented in zsv, it could be much faster in elapsed time where core/CPU is not maxed, but I can't see anything from these quick tests suggesting that DuckDB is faster in total CPU time or in a single-threaded environment, or in an environment where all CPU cores are otherwise being maxed out. I'm not even sure DuckDB's output is correct when it doesn't report an error (see above example with the extraneous text in the output)-- I see plenty of recent issues reported that DuckDB does not handle double-quotes correctly, though at least some seem to have been resolved. That said, I'm very interested in any evidence anyone finds to the contrary of this brief dive!",

Once I have done that, I will update the zsv home to provide more clarification per whatever those findings are.In any case, I appreciate the comments!",

Easiest way to deploy if it needs to be very fast is probably as a python script somewhere linked up to Snowflake with an Orchestrator.",

For some legacy dependencies or reporting need or just functionality, you still can’t turn off the old one. Now you have to pay upkeep for n+1 data warehouses.The funny thing is when you present to the purse keepers, “hey do you know this ONE legacy app is costing 6 figures in infrastructure?” they usually decide pretty quickly that that feature is not important enough and to dump it. But then someone else will chuck a fit that although sounding unimportant the uplift costs of changing it or the impact it has on their job as linchpin to the business is too great, and so it has to continue indefinitely. Until… someone suggests another data warehouse to fix it all! And then cycle continues.All kinds of data warehousing and reporting is a nasty and costly business, frankly. The data sucks and is almost always demonstrably wrong. The tools fucking suck and cause endless friction. The technical debt is ginormous. And changing from any platform to another is both required as tools get acquired and stop being supported, while also being utterly impossible to change because they back thousands or tens of thousands of reports that have no migration path and that nobody could possibly understand.",

        "body": "If you want this to run in near real time, the classic route is CDC out of Postgres with Debezium or logical replication, pipe those events into something like Kafka or Redpanda, and do the denormalization in a stream processor like Flink before writing to ClickHouse or BigQuery. That setup gives you second-level latency, but it’s a lot of infra to maintain and debug.If you’re okay with a few minutes delay, it’s usually easier to land raw CDC tables in a warehouse using a managed connector and build an incremental dbt model that joins them together. You can re-materialize the wide table on a schedule, and it’s much simpler to manage than a full stream topology. For 500M rows, ClickHouse will handle this fine if you pick a good sort key; BigQuery works too, but watch out for costs on frequent MERGE operations. I wouldn’t rely on triggers in Postgres unless you have a very low write rate. they’re painful to debug and can slow your OLTP side.What kind of latency do you actually need, and are those 7 tables small dimension tables or all large fact-like tables? As a fully managed solution, you could check out Estuary. It can handle log-based CDC and any of your destinations + a bunch of cool features like schema evolution. I work at Estuary, so take that into account.",

You run snapshots of your historical data (e.g. data one month old) so it's pre-deduplicated, denormalized, aggregated and you deduplicate and denormalize at query time the fresh data. You union both data sets at query time.There are some guides on how to do this with more detail, let me know if you need help.",

Since it requires the downstream system to understand the transactional data model in a way that leads to frequent failure: * Due to upstream changes made without coordination downstream * Due to a need to understand what might be data representations optimized for the transactional system. * Due to the challenges of getting schema evolution rightThese data volumes aren't that bad - especially if you do the work incrementally rather than say 500m rows once a week.The generally better approach is to publish a domain object whenever any column within the domain changes, and then lock that down with a data contract: * Determine which tables and columns constitute a domain object: users, invoices, customers, whatever. Create a denormalized representation of this, and then describe it using something like jsonschema for the data contract. * Whenever any one of these attributes changes, generate the domain object and publish to something like kafka/kinesis/etc. * The consumer can subscribe to the feed, redirect it into a file or table, etc. And from there are in a better position to perform additional transformations on the data.",

Déjà, au tout début de mes études en informatique, je me suis formé sur la data science, mais j’aurais du rapidement m’orienter data engineering car généralement + de besoins selon moi (avant de pouvoir faire des modèles prédictifs il faut avoir accès aux données). Ensuite, j’ai fait l’erreur de vouloir « choisir » le projet sur lequel travailler (secteur, localisation, stacks, salaires, etc.) alors que je n’ai pas d’expérience, hormis une expérience en ML chez ArcelorMittal. Grosse erreur, je te recommande de ne pas faire cette erreur, au début, prend ce qui vient, si tu n’as pas des projets ultra concrets, si tu n’as pas fait une grande école, etc. ne te concentre pas sur le salaire ou les stacks par exemple.En fait, j’ai mis du temps à m’en rendre compte, mais les stacks évoluent très rapidement, et ce qui va te permettre de te différencier, selon moi, c’est ta compréhension des besoins métiers. Donc pour faire simple : dès que tu as une offre ou une opportunité : saisis là, garde contact avec le plus de monde possible, et une fois que tu as un peu d’expérience, alors là tu seras déjà un petit peu plus libre. Continue de te former sur des techno que tu aimes aussi en parallèle c’est toujours utile.Je ne sais pas si ce sont de bon conseils, on est presque au même stade (à 1 ou 2 années de différences) mais bon, on doit persévérer et pas abandonner! Je te souhaite bon courage, attend de voir s’il y a d’autres conseils sur mon poste.",

The real challenge with SQL is that schemas live in silos, so your prompts must reflect knowledge of each specific schema.Beyond SQL, LLMs also work well with SPARQL, GraphQL, and other query languages. With SPARQL, the use of ontologies significantly reduces the schema-knowledge burden while increasing expressive power — especially compared to SQL.In practice, combining SQL and SPARQL yields an optimal approach. I’m happy to share examples if anyone’s interested.",

Also tried to work with AWS's Bedrock equivalent, which was abysmal (so we had to roll our own and it was also not great). It's fascinating to see that to really make this work you almost have to do more work than if you just had an Analyst tasked with making queries on an ad hoc basis.

But now it looks good but doesn't do anything, so you learn JavaScript...>Many people don't know how to imagine what goes into some complex multi-region live streaming platform like YouTube or Disney Plus, but what they can do is imagine what the UI looks like and what their imagined idea of it would look like. So they just start there...Since I'm so new, I think it might help if I do a lot of small tutorials (Github project-based learning/build your own x, big book of small python projects, or automate the boring stuff) to get exposure to what projects look like and what I'm capable of.*I'm currently doing things that I find fun (learning DSA and reading books like Eloquent JS), but I plan to incorporate your advice soon. I think it's a matter of taking one big topic, breaking it down until you can't, researching those broken down topics, then breaking it down more until you have something actionable. I just haven't done that for personal projects much yet, so it's easy to feel overwhelmed. .*Perhaps since I enjoy learning how things work, I can use what you said and learn how to make something like YouTube (or whatever else works) until I can recreate a crappy version myself. I won't be building my \"own idea\", but I'll learn the skills needed to do so (similar to what my initial idea of learning from those other materials, but framed in a different way). Idk, I'm just rambling.

I find most resources for learning when it comes to programming to be quite frustrating, and they don't explain enough. I was only able to do a semester of computer science, but I was attending a university generally quite well regarded for their computer science / cybersecurity programs. I ended up having to stop attending for financial reasons, unfortunately. Anyway, what I LOVED about their program is that it broke everything down to the fundamentals. It's been a few years so some of the following may be incorrect. This is just an example, but they had us learning C++ and started us off by learning how a computer works. Then they had us learning how a variable is basically just assigning a name to a block of memory, and storing data in that location. Or how arrays are sequentially assigned blocks of memory, so if you know where X index of an array is located in the memory, you can find the other indexes. How you can't dynamically increase the size of the array due to how C++ is reserving memory, how typing works, etc. I find that with most learning resources, they just don't even *attempt* to explain how a particular thing works beyond a basic level. But then when you try to wade into the waters of reading documentation, it's so filled with technical jargon that it's often incomprehensible to a beginner. I don't want to build legos and just slap stuff together. I don't want to know how to USE a particular programming concept, I want to actually know how it works. I recall when I was younger, attempting to build some small projects. Inevitably, I would write a bit of code that I thought understood in one project, and try to re-use the same concept in another project with a slightly different use-case, only to find that it fundamentally was not doing what I originally thought it did. When that happens now and again? Not a big deal. When that's happening pretty frequently? It becomes frustrating, and it makes me think that even when I can re-use a concept in multiple projects successfully, that I still don't totally get what it's doing. That's the issue that I have with trying to learn by just trying to make something. I care a lot less about making any one particular project, and a lot more about knowing how everything I'm doing actually functions. Anyway, huge block of text over. If anyone has any advice for where/how to learn things in a way that is more complete than \"this is X, use it like this.\", I would love you forever. I've currently just been working my way through boot.dev's python course.",

Effective communication helps iron out *so many* unclear requirements before its a problem, helps me guide them towards appropriate technical solutions before they've already made a decision in some direction, and allows me to convey knowledge about our complex environments and systems so that they can be better informed without it coming off as condescending. It encourages an open and honest dialog. All of that directly correlates to figuring things out efficiently with less confusion/chaos, which is the main efficiency vampire in my corporate world. Building rapport, aka having people actually like and trust me, makes people feel comfortable. When they're comfortable, they'll listen and take advice much better. They'll pay attention and appreciate my input instead of being like \"fuck, we *have* to talk to the engineering team\". They'll be more willing to be forgiving and understanding if there is some issue, because they like me and know I generally do my best to get their stuff handled properly. And, when I inevitably have to rain on someone's parade/be the bearer of bad news, they take it better because they intrinsically trust me and my judgement. They know I'm not bullshitting them (at least too much) and are more willing to resolve by moving forward instead of by escalating or complaining.",

Get that thought of \"letting anyone down\" out of your head right now. It will kill you mentally and will lead to burnout eventually. Just do the best you can in the time and the resources you are given. It's a job and you and your job are replaceable, your mental wellbeing is not replaceable. There is no point in beating yourself.2. As a lead developer it means honest communication towards your boss is paramount. Do not lie and be real. Don't be afraid to say \"I don't know.\". If you do not know something, your answer also should be \"I will try to find out.\". If you land in a dead end for a problem, just be upfront if anyone asks. It's also a learning experience for you, no one was born a master and mistakes happen. The best employee is someone who is honest with his bosses so they can make the best business decisions. When you are stuck do not be afraid to ask for help.3. Build prototypes and MVPs (minimum viable product) if needed to test things out before diving deep into frameworks or libraries. That way you mitigate the risk of making bad decisions, which are only noticed weeks or months later.4. Since you are working alone you need to be really self organized. Write notes, write documentations, make todo lists for yourself (e.g. a small scrum project management, a kanban board). That way it's also easier to get a grasp on what your goals are, what you are doing. This also has the advantage if someone asks you, you have everything in your hand.",

I had to learn to observe negative space, proportions, values, and all sorts of details that I wouldn’t have even noticed if I hadn’t trained my brain to think that way. It is a completely different way of thinking (and seeing the world) from programming. Switching between the two ways of thinking I found to be incredibly difficult and mentally exhausting.

AI, at least right now, is prone to bad coding style, prone to bugs, prone to weird decisions. A person who lets an AI do his task for him and does not oversee the result, he also will leave such nonsense in his project. And it will be visible to recruiters. Some recruiters for sure will leave out such people.2)interview stage: when a person does not know what he is doing it will be much more apparent during the interview. He can't explain why he wrote his project the way he wrote (well, the way his AI wrote). He is unable to make changes when asked. Sometimes the interview will give him Leetcode exercise. As he did not solve his assignments on his own, he will be unable to solve these Leetcode exercises on the spot.3)probation period. First 4 months or so. Then the team is testing if the person is even suitable for the job. A person who just relies on an AI will generate more nonsense to pull requests. He will have more issues with his task. Perhaps the internal team blocks certain AI-tool-related communication and he can't even use the AI tool. Because some projects are proprietary and the client has not given permission to use cloud-based AI tools. The person most likely will fail in these 4 months and has to leave.So, do not care much about such people. Concentrate on your own studies. They will not have an easy shortcut to a paycheck.",

Not for the love of it, not because they like to create, not because they're working towards self-fulfillment. Nope. They only do something because it *might* make them money. This then plays into everything I do where I also enjoy the process and learning and creating. But nobody around me seems to care unless I am doing it with the intention of starting a business and making money selling it. While some times that is my goal, sometimes I just like to make stuff. If you do happen to make something cool, inevitably most praise will come in the form of a sentence like \"these are so amazing! You should sell them!\". This is actually why AI is so popular. People see a shortcut that they don't have to fucking learn anything anymore. Just type in a bunch of words that your brain vomits out and the AI will make it for you. These people don't realize that they're being lobotomized of their creative drive. I hate everything about the current AI stuff that is being pushed. I'm not a luddite. I've used them all. I have yet to find a situation where I am not just better off doing it all myself. It can't even gather the relevant documents I want for a project. I gave claude a list of the components I planned on using and asked it to gather the datasheets. It was successful with only 60% of them. In the time it took me to get that 60% and then realize the other 40% was not related and find those, I saved -30 minutes. If I can't trust it to gather datasheets, what the hell can I trust it for? Don't even get me started on using it for programming if you're not already a good programmer. All the forums are drowning in posts where people are asking humans to check their AI outputs because \"it doesn't work\". You can't even post your own stuff to get opinions without these brainless chudz dumping it into an AI and posting the always wrong outputs.

It’s pretty easy to go to C++ with an uunderstanding of C, but hard to come back to C when you’re accustomed to things like vectors, stdlib functions and so on.I urge you to have atleast a minimal amount of pure C programming in low level fundamentals like memory, containers like arrays and so on. You can continue using C++, but you’re still being abstracted away from low level, just that you still have an option should you choose it.By extension, learn a tiny bit of assembly as well. It’s generally impractical and isn’t seen as a general use language, but it comes in handy some times.

Though you might also do quite a bit of C if you focus on embedded systems. CS and SE are both software-focused, but CS focuses more on the lower level infrastructure and usually applies more computational mathematics and algorithms to make complex computations faster and more efficiently. SE is more higher level and focuses on architectural patterns of larger complex systems and making them more scalable and maintainable.Source: I was a CE major that switched to SE major during the second half of my studies.

        "body": "I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering.Computer Engineering is a sub-discipline of Electrical Engineering that branched off in the 1960s and 1970s. It focuses heavily on electrical theory and its application to digital systems. Main focuses are electronic components, signalling systems, control systems, circuitry, embedded and integrated systems, logic design, and system programming. Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering students will typically have a high degree of common courseload.Computer Engineering students at most universities will do a lot of VHDL/Verilog programming, as well as a lot of C programming. CE programs often include a number of compulsory Software Engineering courses focuses on operating systems and data structures; at some institutions these courses may fall under Computer Science.Computer Engineering is not for the faint of heart. It is brutal, but if you enjoy the guts of computers, you will love it.Software Engineering is a fairly new Engineering discipline and is still not as widely accredited as Computer Engineering. Software Engineering is an endeavour to apply the principles of engineering (ethics, public interest, safety, principled design, etc...) to what has historically been a tradecraft.Purist arguments aside, Software Engineering focuses almost exclusively on the practical aspects of programming and software development with a light dusting of multi-discipline studies.A spate of high-profile and high-casualty structural failures (bridges, buildings, viaducts, waterworks, etc...) during the early 1900s taught us that traditional engineering disciplines needed to be carefully regulated to ensure that members of the public weren't put into danger by people who had no idea what they were doing.A spate of high-profile and sometimes high-casualty software and/or control system failures (Therac-25, Cherynobyl, Three-Mile Island, the entire company of Boeing, Mars Climate Orbiter, etc...) during the 1970s through 2000s taught us the same thing about software development. Everyone involved in critical design and decision making needs to have their eye on the ball at all times; failing to do so can result in death.Computer Science is a field of applied mathematics and is more concerned with theory and abstract concepts than practical application of those concepts. I once worked with an individual with a PhD in Computer Science who hadn't done *any* actual programming; his interests were largely data driven business analytics.Whereas Computer Engineering and Software Engineering are accredited Engineering programs with a fairly standardized level of instruction across institutions, Computer Science is not. A Computer Science program at one institution may be radically different than a Computer Science program at a different institution.In Summary,If you think you might enjoy Computer Engineering, buy yourself an inexpensive FPGA development board such as the [Terasic DE10-Nano](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=167&No=1046) or ask for one for christmas. If you enjoy mucking about with that, then Computer Engineering is the field of study for you.If you think that you might enjoy Software Engineering, start biting your teeth on C and C++ if you haven't done so already, do some tutorials in Qt (or any other application development framework), and get familiar with POSIX operating systemsIf you think that you might enjoy Computer Science, study the differences between binary search trees, B-Trees, and B+-Trees. Read up on the latest AI craze. Try and understand what a Quaternion is and how it is used in 3D graphics.Feel free to throw any questions my way.",

You'll still take some upper level mathematics, but you aren't going to need to know about how to solder components or do any physics beyond the intro level. Software Engineering generally removes even more upper level mathematics and caps you out at Calculus or Discrete Mathematics. It is focused the most on coding and software development as a field. This is what most people actually want. Special mention goes out to the IT and Networking degrees that will also introduce coding classes, but also focus on other aspects of how computers interact with the world at large.",

It's useless to just have knowledge if you can't \"run\" fast enough, or \"jump\" high enough, mentally-speaking, to do actually code at an effective level. That's why using generative AI to help too much is basically shooting yourself in the foot, as you're wasting all that time and money for no actual gain.Computer Science mostly involves math and logic. Computer Engineering adds electronics to math and logic. Software Engineering adds a little \"business management\" to math and logic.

With the rise of YouTube and platforms like Udemy, etc. everybody thinks that they can be a teacher.Teaching is hard. Setting up good quality tutorials or courses is difficult and tedious. I've done that. I've authored and taught several courses. It not only requires good, in depth, knowledge of the subject but also certain communication skills as well as the ability to fall back into one's own beginner stages.It is very difficult to find the balance between becoming too elaborate (like I did in this comment), depth of content, and handholding too much or too little.",

If you buy a book like “Working Effectively With Legacy Code”, there will be plenty of tips and tricks for debugging code you don’t know.Also, debugging itself is a wishy washy concept. You can learn some concrete tools like what your debugger can do and some techniques for investigating code, but at the end, debugging is the result of you applying logic, mostly deduction. So, if you want to learn about debugging, learn the fundamentals of logic and then practice until you get used to the thinking patterns. The learning part is rather small, practice makes everything.",

Debugging is a pretty vital topic, but most tutorials skip it, and here's the reason:It's not fun to talk about.A *lot* of programming books and tutorials are written by software nerds who are really into algorithms and coding concepts; this is why so many tutorials fire hose information to the reader. Programmers like to write/talk about the parts of coding they like. This is why you'll find recursion or other advanced topics in introductory materials.Writing about debuggers and coming up with follow-along exercises of using a debugger for a non-contrived program is tough and tedious and programmers don't like doing it. So often, they just don't do it.(The same applies for documentation and testing.)",

When I’ve been trying to find a bug for 4 hour straight it’s usually because I’m so deep into the zone that I barely realise I’m actually no close to figuring it out than I was 4h before. I just see nothing else, keep prodding and poking, commenting and uncommenting stuff in circles, completely losing track of what I tried and have not tried…. Time flys… and as frustration increases I get dumber and dumber… still … the grip the zone has on me won’t let go, now it’s a one* way trip, either I solve it or I’ll never be able to sleep again.No, coding isn’t lonely for me….

I got pretty good at it and wrote a ton of code with it. Then I moved to Python. After a few years I looked at Perl code I had written and didn't understand a good portion of it. Sometimes you do what you have to given your current job, project, environment, etc. Just remember that the fundamentals are usually pretty consistent across many languages but also that each language has its own quirks and pros / cons.If you are feeling overwhelmed with a new language that a job requires you to use, just know it isn't a foreign feeling - many of us have been there.",

If the curriculum is not listing the courses then contact a dean office or a student councilor and ask from them. It is their job to guide students and people who want to start their studies in given university.But going purely by a guess then better pick software engineering. It should cover more than just a development. Because real life software development is not only writing code but more than that. Software engineering curriculum should be more relevant. But that is just a guess based on the names of curriculums. When you want a real answer then contact the university.Game development does not mean you'll be making a game from start to end. Even in games there is a backend, frontend/design, infrastructure, devops, data science, cyber security, QA, etc. Different roles. And, let's say you will pick game development. Are there any jobs in your area for game developers? And when it comes to web application development and being a backend side developer, then again, decide it based on the job offers in your area. Are there right now jobs for juniors? Where I live, the job market is not doing well. We are living inside an AI bubble. Non-IT people (HR, managers and such) are investing more into AI tools because they think that the AI is better than a human developer. And they are not hiring juniors that much. As a software developer I say, the current AI is performing perhaps worse than some junior developers. Yes, it can generate code but it requires a constant overseeing. Or it will generate nonsense that a)does not compile, b)deletes existing functionality, c)introduces bugs, d)does not cover all the required use cases.When the bubble will pop then there will be again more openings for juniors. Juniors so far should learn their specialty AND should learn how to use the AI (to be competitive) and how to NOT use the AI.",

And it doesn't get easier. I *think*, but I'm not sure, that we get faster at it.My steps.1. Reproduce the problem, if possible. Get to the point where you can make the problem happen every time. If possible. Understand the inputs and other things that cause the failure. There are some bugs that are intermittent. Those are the worst. You can learn about [race conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) someday, but not today. If it's your thing write a test case which generates the bug.2. Try to figure out exactly which line of code caused the bug. If you get a traceback or other error message, it can tell you this. The top line of the traceback (bottom line in Python, why, Guido, why, did you do this backwards?) probably shows you the source file and line number where the problem occurred.3. Eyeball the code and the error message. Read the error message three times carefully; it often tells you exactly what is wrong in a language you don't quite understand.4. Learn to use a debugger to step through your code line by line. Start stepping (set a breakpoint) a few lines before the suspect line and do step step step. 5. Try putting in a fix to the problem.6. Repeat these steps.7. If you get frustrated after doing all this, take a break. Get a good night's sleep. Sometimes the answers to my bugs have come to me in dreams. Seriously.Most importantly:**Always remember that debugging is harder than programming. Don't use all your cleverness programming something, because you'll never be able to debug it.**You got this.

Yes print line debugging is great and useful but it totally pales in comparison to a full blown debugger that lets you set breakpoints and jump through the code function by function, line by line, or breakpoint by breakpoint… Combining that with the skills/intuition that come from reading error messages will be extremely valuable for you and save you an absolutely unreasonable amount of time throughout a software career compared to not having those skills.",

Only thing I don't like is the time line of 2 weeks per assignment for my DSA class then moving onto another data structure when I've just barely grasped the previous one.Another thing is, try to play with it as much as you can.

If you decide it’s “Client/Server” then great, you’ve got two top-level components you can start with. Maybe it’s MVC or EDa etc. Whatever it is that choice should lead to some obvious top-level components. Then you can start mapping them to Use Cases and decomposing them into lower-level components. Some design principles should also guide your selection. Don’t duplicate code in multiple places. Keep implementation details abstracted. Don’t mix unrelated functionality in the same component. Etc. With a little practice it will all start falling into place naturally.",

You can't deliberately study system design and software architecture - while there are some general rules you can study the core skill itself comes from having seen and done many different things, having seen the advantages and slowly building that \"intuition\". Even the most senior engineers are not fully sure about many architectural decisions and a lot of times it is still a bet, but at least you become better at figuring out the pros and cons of each choice.A good architecture is one that's simple, easy to understand, easy to maintain, reliable, flexible and not prone to bugs. Often times you won't know if your architecture was good until it's too late - it's not always an exact science. I wouldn't rely on AI to build the structure / architecture, but I would chat with it about different options and the pros & cons of each.

So if you have some definition like data Tree t = Node (Tree t) (Tree t) | Leaf tthen you don't really have a way to represent tree containing no values, but if you define it like data Tree t = Node (Tree t) (Tree t) t | Leafthen you can have a practically empty Tree consisting of only `Leaf`.",

( if there are no Household tasks left )Sometimes i really get into something and i spend every hour on learning/coding/reading and other weeks only a few. I try to setup my tasks i want to do in the morning, on low energy weeks i try to at least repeat some of the things i learned in the last few weeks so it does not get lost.But my main take away is don’t force it as studying that needs to be done but as something fun you are doing. Most of the times i’m proud of what i learned and feel the energy to go on. Use what you learned, automate something, build a useful little app that makes your life easier. In this moment i’m learning python, but i really hated the dependencies and setting up the venvs and the testers and testing. So i went a little deeper to really understand that part and automated it. So now if i start a new project i run a makefile and it sets up the venv, main dependencies, linters, and a basic unit test. So i can start a new project or tutorial without worrying. While i learned a lot about dose parts. Next up ( i’m a devops engineer ) is setup the same thing for a basic CI/CD to eventually get my python code up into docker on my local homelab. These things i spend about 20/25% of my time on, i learn something for my job, i learn more about python and in the meanwhile i make my own life easier.Main get away is, enjoy the process! Have fun! Build things you like or miss. Then you can do a lot without burnout. Burnout does not really happen when it’s fun, it mostly comes from forcing your self to do things X amount of time while not enjoying it.",

Depending on how exactly you define this problem, those are between 1000!/900! to 1000\\^100 sequences, which is about 2\\^1000. There must be one number (seed) for every possible sequence. So that seed would have to be up to 1000 bits long, so around 125 bytes (octets). This is about 10x longer than the \"10-15 characters\" that you were hoping for, more if you were hoping for ASCII characters.In general: there is no free lunch for compression. All compression techniques rely on the data having some pattern that can be described more compactly than just using the raw data.Further reading:* Shannon entropy is a concept for describing how much information is in a piece of data. This measures how \"surprising\" the data is. Compressed data cannot be shorter than the Shannon entropy in bits. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory* Kolmogorov complexity describes the theoretically most compact representation of data, i.e. how long a program would be that reproduces the data. In your model, the seeds would correspond to programs that generatea sequence. The seeds cannot be shorter than the sequence's Kolmogorov complexity. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity* The Pigeonhole Principle is a useful technique for thinking through these kinds of problems. Here, I used this principle to notice that the size of the seed (pigeon holes) must be at least as large as the number of distinct sequences (pigeons) I want to generate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle",

To \"go backwards\" you just mark off each 3-digit group.- You can store a number from 0-999 in 10 bits.- You can store a number from 0-999,999,999,999,999 in 50 bits.You can combine several smaller numbers into a bigger number. This can capture a few fractional bits of savings [1] but you can't magically convert an arbitrary 100-number sequence to a single 32-bit int.To actually compress data (losslessly), your compressed form needs to be variable-length. Then you assign more likely inputs to shorter compressed forms. (This only works if some inputs are less likely than others. If all possible inputs are equally likely, the average compressed output will be at least as long as the input, regardless of the internal workings of the compression function.)[1] Information-theoretically, a number from 0-999 contains log(1000) / log(2) = 9.966 bits of information, assuming each number 0-999 is equally likely. You need 10 bits to store such a number because a block of actual memory is always a whole number of bits.For example, if the maximum number is slightly larger than a power of 2, say your numbers range from 0..1099, then each one is log(1100) / log(2) = 10.103 bits. You need 11 bits each to store your numbers separately, wasting 0.897 bits. You could store 5 numbers in a single value ranging from 0..1100^5 - 1 which would only need 51 bits. The \"theoretical\" savings is 0.897 x 5 = 4.485 bits; in practice we only get 4 bits. Again, we \"waste\" 0.485 bits because a block of actual memory is always a whole number of bits.",

Like when you play tic-tac-toe, you both see the actual board with Xs and Os, and you imagine how the board will look once you place your next mark.That is also how software works, there is some sort of output, if not explicitly graphical or visual, at least observable in some way, and there is an invisible internal representation, that you can't experience, but that the program \"knows\" and uses to decide its next move, or determine who won. And in both games and programs there's input that manipulates the internal model - often with very different results, depending on the previous state of that model.And of course, games have rules - often you follow an actual algorithm when playing a game, or at least you have some fixed pattern of steps to perform, and there is, if not an algorithm, then a fairly strict way of determining a winner or loser, or if the game should continue.And most important of all for learning - there is a lot of repetition in games, both as a player and a developer you are iterating a lot, gradually improving, and always trying various combinations. So often you work a lot more with a game than any other program you are creating, you actually enjoy playing your own game, and try to beat it - whereas with a CRUD system for Student administration or a Car Rental, you'll just build one feature and get quickly on with the next one as soon as it seems to work sufficiently.So there are a lot of similarities between playing games, creating games, and building programs.And they are often fun to create and use!",

But be careful, because you may accidentally find yourself with a career in devops. I'm not even joking. The best way to learn is to look at what other people have done and ask questions. Hopefully, you work somewhere where you have the ability to do that. I'm not sure how you would do that on your own.I think the best place to start is Docker. Learn the basics. Then Kubernetes, if your work uses that. Get familiar with the essential commands and start poking around. That should get you a long way down the road.",

It serves no purpose and makes the code less readable. One would want to break something into separate lines when in one line it becomes too long. Or things like Builders. Instead of what you did, write \"System.out.println(....\" in one line. The same way how you wrote \"keyboard.next() in one line not in two lines.2. Give meaningful names to your variables. What is a? What is b?3. Read about methods. Your main method is too long. You can take out the quitting part and separate mathematical operation parts into separate methods and then use these in your main method.4. Move the definition of your variables after the quitting block. Because there is no point to define these variables when you never set a value to them with your quitting. Here it has no effect but in larger programs defining variables you don't use wastes system memory. Also, in your case there is no need to define a variable and set a value to it, separately. You can do just \"double a = keyboard.nextDouble();\" And the same goes for other variables as well.5. Don't add comments unless necessary. Your code should be self-descriptive. I suggest to read about Clean Code standards. Add comments when the code itself can't explain the existence of itself: why the code is there, why it does what it does, etc.",

So you could ask it about equations or proper conventions.Some great starter languages if you're coming from nothing would be python or JavaScript, but if you want to do other languages, you should learn about static typing. Additionally, I'd stay away from languages like c due to the amount of concepts that need to be learned opposed to python, js or Java.Another tip is to start simple. It may seem redundant, but it's going to help with motivation immensely. If you can mark something done, you can feel good about it.",

But I always use AI for brainstorming sessions in solo projects(since I need an opinion on my work too) asking if my idea was right, to rate my idea, talk about the limitations of my ideas.Using AI for discussing on optimizations is the best part of using AI(But the prompt must make it clear to only discuss but not to code) .

But they don't understand or aren't aware of the problems the AI is trying to solve. So when it implements a solution, it looks correct, it technically does what it said it does, but it's often not actually correct...even when it looks like the code is working. - AI will happily reinvent the wheel. Not only that, it will reinvent a slightly incorrect wheel and each wheel will be slightly different, even though it's supposed to be the same wheel. - The best way to have no bugs in your application is to delete all your code. AI will happily delete your code. We did a review where a guy was having problems with authentication. He just kept feeding the errors into AI. What did AI do? It deleted the entire Authentication system in the front-end and hardcodwd an API key in it's place. Problem solved :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:. - I am constantly finding race conditions in the code these guys submit. Why? Because they aren't aware of the implications of the code they are submitting.Now I work with another guy who does know what he's doing. He has AI write a lot of the code. But he is constantly correcting AI. Telling it that what it produced is garbage. He can make AI iterate to a correct solution a lot of the time. Other times, it's just quicker to write it yourself because the AI just doesn't get.When I was learning, I recognized that I didn't know what I didn't know. Knowing thst this class problems even exists in the first place is 99% of the battle. What separates experienced developers from junior developers is knowledge of what types of problems exist. Now as far as learning, I relied a lot on YouTube tutorials, books, Google, stackoverflow etc to learn concepts and how to make something. In my case, there was a project that flipped the switch for me. I went from not knowing how to do anything other than stupid little college programs to \"holy shit...it makes sense now\". That was a project that I actually made for a group and they actually used it. And in using it, they ran into all kinds of problems.

Some C devs are married to C89 (yes even today), others to C99. In C++ people use C++11-17 mostly. But if you aim to make new software you can target C++20 or newer without any issue.The best paid jobs are probably performance-based C++ for banks. Can aim to half a mil if you don't shy away of hard problems.Or go for functional. Elixir is a cool language that tackles on web dev in a different way (concurrency-first). Good thing is that the language is mostly done since a while back, they are only adding types without any language shifts. It's pretty innovative too as they are also opening doors in AI and security. People who can work on elixir are surprisingly happy.",

Mind you, historically programming was always taught from books, as it is a text based medium. You also develop the skill of being able to parse through documentation, so its the approach many people take. If you are totally new to programming, what I have been doing is first identifying what I want to gain from said language, (for me it was Golang, I want to build software, develop \"engineers\" mindset, and get hired). The one thing I have learned overall about programming, is that fundamentally it is the skill of problem solving. I have used python before and when I solve problems, I don't even see the language anymore, I see the problem. I have 3-4 different resources I am using for go specifically. Learn go with tests, learn go the hard way, and Exercism. Each resource fills in gaps for the other. Exercism helps you develop the problem solving skill that is fundamental to programming, Learn go the hard way is a total beginners book on programming with go. Learn go with tests is a more intermediate book I go through after I finish the same topic in both exercism and LGtHW. Its allowed me to immerse myself and not just \"learn go\", but develop the problem solving and engineers mindset. All this to say, find what works for you. If it is a text based courses and books, then great, if it is a video course, then great, if it is building something, then great. Just experiment around with a 3 different resources max and see what works for you the best.",

But your priority is whack.Optimise for productivity first, and get something out there. If you get to the point where the language performance is the bottleneck, then count yourself as successful. At that point you can afford a rewrite.Scalability is not really a language feature. That is more related to architecture. Scale can be done in whatever language, or be hindered in all languages given you do the wrong thing.> I’d love to hear your thoughts. Which language/framework would you recommend for high-performance APIs? Again, I disagree with the question. Go is a solid and pretty safe option IMHO. I've never been a fan of Python, so of the two, I'd choose Go.But beyond that, I don't really think the choice matters.

Scaling the number of users, the number of requests, the frequency of requests, the number of services involved in each request? Scalability isn't just a word you can slap on the entire application, you need to be more specific. Also, it has more to do with the chosen architecture than the programming language - every language can scale to billions of objects without issues.What should the AI do? And why is that part of the REST API? There is usually no AI in REST, on the contrary, REST is (mostly) supposed to always return the same responses to the same requests - something AI doesn't really do.And finally - what do you actually mean by \"build my own REST API\"? Every single time you create an application that accepts HTTP requests, you kind of \"build your own REST API\" - it is literally just accepting requests and returning responses. Are you perhaps confusing an actual application with the interface to talk to it?",

You get good scalability with this approach: nodejs's Cluster functionality lets you run multiple long-lived server processes in parallel.It also offers robust database connection pooling, which helps with getting good performance under heavy concurrency.By the way, you need to choose a language, a server stack, a database, and a web framework, not just a language, for a project like this. I suggest Typescript, nodejs, Linux, PostgreSQL, and either Express or Fastify. If you really want to scale up to black-friday volume, take a look at the HAPI framework. I worked with a guy who supported high-volume production with that at Walmart.com, and he spoke well of it.My suggestions. Other people obviously have other suggestions.",

I find a tutorial.I skim trough the chapter and try to just find out what is expected of me in the end off the chapter. And i just write it down something like : user input into an array.I open a new file and i just write in english/native language what i think the basic steps would be.# Ask for input# Put input into array# Output arrayThis above is a simple example, this not enough. Then i start breaking down the pieces into smaller pieces like declare array etc. Until when i read the comments it looks like the program or lines of code i try to build.Then i start building lines of code for every comment, if i forget a step i write a new comment etc. I investigate every line and just write what i think should work. I do not think about perfect code or the shortest or cleanest. By going line be line i encounter errors, fix them. Till i have the output i want.Then i read/watch the tutorial. Apply what i learned on that code. If it’s part of a bigger tutorial i go to that project and apply it there. Then scan the ret of that code and see if i can apply it there. While most of the time cleaning up the code as well.Then i feed those parts to claude, to see if it is by best practice if not i google around and find out the better ways. After all of that is implemented i go to my own side project and apply it there. This way in learn to think about problems and solve them, after that i learn to apply it and hopefully save it to memory a little bit.I make a simple not about what i learned and add a code snippet or useful links to my wiki.Simple stuff takes about 30 minutes, sometimes it takes me all evening. But i’m actually writing code instead of copying. So it’s about understanding instead of producing.",

Work in iteration, add more complexity as you gain confidence. Explore, experiment, break and fix things along the way, be prepared that you will make mistakes (that is part of learning).",

You’re asking about a data structure, i.e. a specific implementation detail, while the text you’re referencing is explaining an architectural detail.In this case, a stream processing system just means a system that is continuously processing data as it is produced - in other words, the job is never “complete”, the system may just be idle at some point waiting for the next chunk of data to come in. Data is pushed to this system rather than the system pulling data into it.The implementation of this can certainly use a queue, and in reality a system like this will likely use multiple queues and/or stacks along and way.TL;DR a stream and a queue are really just different things, not necessarily a replacement for each other. A stream is some data coming from a source which may or may not have an end, whereas a a queue is just a FIFO mechanism for processing data. Consider an example outside of programming:- A “stream of people“ would describe many people passing through some point at some rate without necessarily defining a start, end, or quantity- A “queue of people” would describe a line for people to wait in a FIFO fashion. There may not even be any people in the queue at some point in time- A stream of people may be entering a building to go wait in a queue, to go wait in one of many queues, or do something else entirely- A long and fast moving queue might be described as a stream",

You can rig, I dunno, RabbitMQ or MSMQ or whatever to provide that kind of service too.But a message queuing system can generalize beyond that. You can have many producers and one consumer of data. You can have many consumers, and distribute the messages to them to balance a load. You can have lossy queues—that makes sense for some applications. You can replay events from the recent past. And on and on.Either one can handle data in near real time. A stream is systems-architecturally much simpler than a more generalized queuing system. Your Saturday night production incidents will be easier to sort out with streams instead of queues. (Unless you build custom software to do what a properly configured queuing system product does, thus re-inventing the flat tire).For these engagement events, a message queue design involving multiple producers makes sense. We’d have to know a lot more about what you are trying to do before suggesting lossy queues, replay features, or multiple consumers.",

You don't need C++ to make a paint program.Let me break it down for you:- Pick a programming language.- Figure out how to make interactive programs and draw your own graphics (canvas in JS, Pygame in Python).- Figure out how to draw a pixel on the screen.- Figure out how to get the position of the mouse, and whether a mouse button is pressed.- Draw a pixel under the mouse when the mouse button is pressed.You now have a very simple drawing program.You can add UI elements for changing colors, clearing the canvas, drawing lines instead of pixels, different brush patterns, etc.Saving and loading may be a bit...complicated. You will probably end up using a library to convert pixels into a PNG file. If you struggle, you can always come back here with a more specific question (\"I'm writing a drawing program as a webpage in JavaScript. The user puts pixels on a canvas with the mouse. How do I convert those pixels on the canvas to a PNG file for the user to download?\").It's up to you how far you go into the details of graphics drawing. For example, whether you use the line-drawing function provided by your graphics library, or you [convert a line to pixels yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm).C++ can be helpful if you want high-resolution, high-performance drawing code for fancy effects, or you want to interface with existing C++ libraries. But you don't need it to make a simple drawing program for learning purposes.",

Until then:* write down inputs,* write down givens, * write output(s), * write down **edge cases.**The third problem is **lack of language knowledge.*** In order to _learn_ a (programming) language you need to not just read code but _write_ code (preferably daily) **without** having to look up FUNCTION names provided by your language's library. You need to know the basic libraries provide by your language.* NOTE: **It is fine to lookup PARAMETER order** (we all do this, even as professionals) but you _should_ be familiar enough with basic I/O and string manipulation _function_ names.Let's take a small example:Write a program to read a text file and count the number of unique lines. * Do you know how to open and read a text file? * Can you read one line into a string? * Can you read all lines into strings?* What type of container for lines will you use? * List? * Vector? * Array?* Do you know how to test if a line is unique? * How do you do string comparisons? * If they are case sensitive? * If they are case insensitive?* What kind of searching for duplicated lines will you do? * Linear search? * Binary search? * Hash map?Start with _small_ examples.Hope this helps and good luck!",

Go vack to writing again. Got stuck? Repeat the process. Do it again in an hour or the next day.As you're doing that, try to take time and understand *why* things are laid out that way. Edit things to see them break and understand why it broke, and try to build up a mental image of what's going on under the hood. Reverse engineer the algorithm. .I really like drawing out psuedocode and pictures/diagrams to simplify this thinking. It's a lot harder for me to code, say, binary search by simply memorizing the code structure given to me vs drawing out some numbers in an array and what the process I need to follow to get my solution looks like. The former is rote memorization. The latter is understanding the algorithm in a human way. I use a bit of both to solidify it in my head. .You'll likely not be able to undesirable the algorithm well and build a mental model of what's going at first. This might happen for every single example you see.That's ok. Have AI (or an assistant? Peers?) walk you through the code, line by line, and help you understand what's going on. Tell it to give analogies to help you build up that mental model. Watch a few videos on the topic if needed. Then recreate that mental model either explaining it out loud to an invisible class or by writing it out in a picture, diagram, or some other form of psuedocode. .These mental models turn abstract and distinct ideas into things that build off of each other, helping you not only memorize the solutions, but help ease the learning of new solutions. .I'm going through a DSA course that's about 9 hours long. It sort of speeds through topics. I think I've clocked several times that amount going through it? That's because I'm regularly doing the above. I think that's because these topics he's talking about actually take a much longer time to actually learn properly, but despite it being aimed towards beginners, it's assumed I'm already at the point where these ideas are easily understood. The curse of knowledge if you will. Which is fine, AI fills in the small gaps of knowledge and I can always research a topic if it gets too confusing.",

You can use the epsilon-delta definition of a limit to prove a ton of stuff in Real Analysis. But you can revisit those same problems later using the lens of topology, and make some of it easier and some of it harder.Additionally, functional programming typically comes with some very strong guarantees on mutability and which operations are dependent on each other, stronger than can be made in *arbitrary* non-FP contexts. This enables a different class of compiler optimizations. But of course, immutability has many of its own performance downfalls, so it’s incredibly application specific.TL;DR: functional programming is useful because it’s another tool in your toolbelt for solving very hard problems.",

In the pursuit of the unachievable goal of \"being the best programmer I can can be\", I find FP to be a decent next step.I don't plan to \"hop on the functional programming train and never look back\". I think it is an interesting tool in the same sense that a screwdriver looks interesting to someone using a hammer. Sure you can't screw in nails, but screwing in... screws can likely hold better than hammering them.",

Sure, you can have the URL but without being authenticated, you'll get 401 error.3. Authorization. Fine, you figure out how to get authenticated. You make a new user. You are using its JWT token. But you are not added to relevant access groups. Maybe you can access your guest / new user related endpoints but nothing else. You might find an admin endpoint but as you lack access rights, you'll get 403 error.4. Rate limiting. You get this funny idea that you start scanning the host or start brute forcing or something. Your requests per second will be used up and you'll be either banned or timed out for time being.5. Hosting it behind some weird port. You'd expect a website to sit behind 80, 8080 or 443 port. What if I put it behind 49157? You typing in the URL without correct port will default to 80 and you will get either 404 error or some default placeholder webpage or something. My real service sits behind 49157.6. Region blocking/whitelisting. Let's say our client gets scam calls and emails from India. He has no business there. Then we can a)blacklist the whole India from accessing the service and Indians will get 404 or b)whitelist only these countries where our client makes his business. Many US services are blocking traffic from the EU because they do not want to comply with European cookie policy. Yes. you might say \"But VPN. I will use my xxxVPN account to appear from Uganda instead!\". Well, a list of IP addresses can and will be associated with certain VPN services. These can be also blocked.7. VPN blocking. One can use deep packet inspection tools to block people using VPN even when the traffic is encrypted.8. Honeypots. One can set up a fake environment. Go ahead and scan it and hack it and try to do whatever you want with it. Either you gain nothing with it or you'll leave traces about you behind. Honeypots are there to attract script kiddies and such.9. Throttling. Alternative to point 4. Instead of getting blocked or timed out your requests will slow down to an unusable level.10. Security services like Cloudflare. One can leave all the protection to such services. They will deal then with attack detection and mitigation and such.",

There’s effectively no real way to guarantee that and anyone dedicated enough would be able to defeat it.What you should likely do is create a user auth system, where users create/log in to an account and that’s validated by the API before the backend processes it. The API layer should also have some rate limiting/throttling to prevent spam or abuse. I do again want to stress that this doesn’t limit someone to only making requests from the extension, someone could just as easily make HTTP requests and include the auth token and pretend they’re using the extension. The point of the authentication layer is that every request is now tied to a user which prevents bots from just spam requesting and lets you ban abusive accounts. You should also likely have some form of IP blacklisting to ban suspicious IPs, for your case where this is just a chrome extension it makes sense to also preemptively ban the IP blocks used by the major cloud providers, regular users won’t be using those and it’ll ban bots that are running on servers hosted by them.",

Even the people who dig you out of holes, because even though they know that specific piece of tech, or are familiar with the project, they would be stuck too when dealing with something new.I am an experienced engineer and I am getting people out of holes when it's the tech stack I'm very comfortable with, but as soon as I work with something new, I'm back to being a beginner constantly scratching his head.",

What people are going to hire you to do is solve a specific problem, and it's up to you to figure out how to do that.Honestly, you'll have better luck learning something technical that doesn't necessarily require any coding at all - like learn to set up a Wordpress site, or a Shopify site. There are millions of small business owners that need a website and don't even know how to use a no-code drag-and-drop website builder. You could learn to do that in as little as a few weeks.Part of the trick is learning about various options and steering clients to the right one. Someone with a blog with several different authors would be a good fit for Wordpress. Someone selling handmade jewelry might be good for Shopify. A small number of clients really do need a custom website built from scratch with a React frontend - but most probably don't need that.If you want to go that route, though, more than half your time will be spent running a business: marketing, advertising, talking to potential clients who never pay, chasing down payment, and even things like doing taxes and paperwork.

However, as you get into more advanced stuff, each database is different and has its own dialect of SQL you'll need to master.Microsoft SQL Server is one option. If you had to pick another popular one I'd recommend considering PostgreSQL. Note that Microsoft SQL server has free versions but for commercial use it has license fees, while Postgres is open-source so it's completely free, no strings attached. And that doesn't mean it's worse - Postgres is actually quite a bit more scalable and used for some of the largest databases in the world.I'm not sure you downloaded the right thing. Go here:[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)Pick \"SQL Server 2022 Express\", that should be ideal for getting started.Find a tutorial on how to set up SQL Server Express and create your first database. That will be specific to SQL Server.Once your database is set up and you know how to type a query, you can now switch to just about any SQL textbook or tutorial, and all of the basics will work the same as any other SQL database.Alternatively, pick your course first and then choose the database they recommend.",

They are worth doing, just for doing the work, and trying using the concepts, but not something you'd ever want to look back upon.And there is no real value in sharing them with others - you can get the solution with any AI, simply by typing something like `/* K&R Exercise 1-16 - solution */` in a comment in your AI-enabled editor, and the code would pop up.And, all the exercises are so small and simple, that they hardly let you exercise using git add and commit.So I'd recommend putting your actual projects in GitHub repos - and leave the exercises as well, exercises!",

If you don’t like asking for help, ask your manager, if you can have a weekly meeting with a “mentor”, to make sure you are understanding the code base and on the right track.

Better to get ahead of it and be proactive. If fact this might even be praised. Be shamelessly curious at the start of a new position. Now some personal advice, if you are asking for help, bring a list of what you have tried and what you think you need to do. Makes it seem like you are genuinely trying and not asking to just be walked through something. Senior developers generally don’t like holding your hand through every step of a process if you haven’t tried.

Getting a degree or a diploma does not mean that every job is for you. I have been in the industry for quite many years. But it does not mean that I could pick any job. Even not every entry level job is for me because the tech stack is completely something else than what I studied. For example I can't write stuff in C++ or in C# because I never studied it. I will be able to read it and perhaps try something with trial and error, but I would not be suitable even to work as a junior C++ developer. But if the job would be for a senior Java developer then that would be suitable for me as I know Java.In that case you should either learn on the go to survive your current position or face the reality and pick a suitable company.c)You cheated through your IT studies or were lazy. Having a degree or a diploma does not automatically guarantee that one is suitable for the job. In that case better leave the job and learn until you get to the expected level that your diploma or a degree should represent.So, based on a), b), and c) you can decide how to proceed. Either it is fine to not know stuff and you should ask others, or you might be either in a wrong company or even should not have applied to a job, yet.",

If you use AI last, that's fine. But it is very important for you to not use AI as much as possible as early as possible as it sounds like you're just learning Java for college.I suggest that you review the fundamentals again. You can even use AI to create a guideline for you. Just double check its output for accuracy. Then you learn how to debug. Then once you get the fundamentals down, you can go with more complex lessons like OOP, Java-specific things, etc. You'll know you understand it enough when you start paying more attention to what AI outputs, and you go \"wait, why is it done this way instead of this?\".Also I haven't mentioned it yet, but people would agree that another method to learn faster is to find a mentor or ask in Reddit or Discord communities. I don't really know any Discord communities, but I know Java enough, so feel free to ask me questions in the DMs. I'm good to help whenever I'm available.",

Debugging code is where you actually start to build your diagnostic muscles.Any programmer will have tales of woe of the time they spent hours, if not days, hunting down something as trivial as a badly declared variable. However, that suffering will have made them better programmers and probably taught them innumerable things they didn't realize at the time.> I ask AI what I can do too make the program better.While an LLM can barf out code that does stuff, it achieves this feat by stealing all available code from programmers it can find. Fixing code is something an AI does far less well. They will, of course, offer suggestions with complete confidence; which is kind of worse.Computer generated code has always sucked. Now it's more clever about it, but a human can still put the bots to shame.A \"better program\" is also rather subjective. Do you want clearer, faster, or smaller, all of which tend to fight against each other. It should be what you think is better.

Have you seen the problem or a similar one before? How kind were the interviewers for that particular loop? How desperately do they need a role filled?However, I reject that there was ever a problem with testing how someone does under the pressure of being reviewed by another. In practice, that's what professional development is all the time. Pair programming, collaborative problem solving, and explaining your reasoning to people who are both technical and non-technical. If you freeze up during an interviewer because the interviewer is seeing the code you write as you write it, that's not a problem in the interview process. It's working as intended. Could interviewers do a better job of putting their candidates at ease? Absolutely, but we shouldn't write that skill set off as 'not relevant'.It's been a while since I've conducted an interview. But given the recent advancements I'd be inclined to allow my candidates to use coding assistants. A good interviewer was never testing if you solved the problem in the perfect way. They were testing your reasoning and communication skills. And the coding assistant doesn't change that in any way. If you can use the AI in a way that is simply beyond asking it to solve the problem for you, show me that you're capable of reviewing and understanding the code it produces, then communicating that solution to me clearly and engaging in a thoughtful discussion about the solution you'll get a pass in my interview.",

First, find out how to read from the keyboard - usually you'd then get a variable representing which key was pressed.2. Then you need to determine what should happen for each key - no matter what you decide, it is probably going to be rules that only you know, so you have to find some way of telling the program what the rules are. But begin by writing them out on paper for yourself. e.g. \"A\" should add 1 each time, \"S\" should add 10, \"D\" should subtract 1, and so on.3. Begin by writing a program that only understands two of the rules, like \"A\" and \"S\" or whatever makes sense to you. Probably something like a set of if-statements.4. When you have that basic program working, it is time to expand with all the rules - but writing 102 if-statements are going to be annoying! Hopefully you can see some sort of pattern, like if key 'x' is pressed, add value 'n' to the number ...5. Maybe you can use a data structure like a `dict` in Python to pair up the key 'x' and value 'n' values, and then find the pressed key in that `dict`, and add the matching number. This will take a bit of research into dicts, but it will be time well spent!",

So you have to make sure the URL is correct, *and* that your server properly resolves that URL to the file path that you want it to.Use the \"Network\" tab in your browser's developer tools to see what URL is actually being requested, and whether it's succeeding.",

They're very different things, even though they look similar.Your web server is responsible for looking at incoming URLs, *translating* them to paths in the filesystem, and serving those files as a response. The details of how it does that are part of the server's code and/or configuration, which you didn't show in your post.Typically, you specify a \"root\" directory somewhere, so that e.g. a URL like `https://mysite.org/foo/bar.png` gets translated to the file path `$PROJECT_ROOT_DIR/foo/bar.png`.The network tab will tell you what URL the browser **is actually** requesting, which is vital information. But it won't tell you what URL it **should be** requesting. You have to determine, based on your webapp's configuration, what URL it **should be** requesting to get the correct file. And then you have to specify the correct URL accordingly in your source code. The network inspector tab is a tool to help you check whether this was done correctly.",

So in general it’s good to keep them separate.That said, there are tools that integrate a language and GUI framework pretty seamlessly, and languages that are meant only for use within a particular platform. Logo defines its own drawing environment and has a lot of built-in drawing functions. HyperTalk (from the late-80’s) was meant mainly for defining UI within the HyperCard environment.

Like in the beginning, there was just the console terminal, and people had to write programs that moved the cursor, colored parts of the screen, wrote text on the screen buffer. Then framebuffered graphics cards became a thing, and then all of a sudden there were window managers and bitmaps, but the languages pretty much stayed the same. Libraries of course helped create an interface between the language and how data was represented visually.There will always be a separate layer between the general purpose language and the UI. Also, people have different ideas of how a UI should be represented. For example, the Win32 API lets you call the OS layer to draw windows, buttons and style them according to the OS, but that means you can't use your program code as-is on another platform like Linux.Libraries like GTK and QT attempt to solve this problem by creating their own API, which calls the underlying OS to create some of the OS-layer objects like windows, but does the rest of the display stuff itself, in order to have a consistent cross-platform experience.So most language rely on separate libraries or frameworks, like C#/.NET having WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) that is Windows-only, or AvaloniaUI which is cross-platform, and MAUI, which is... well...Then different libraries have different ways of abstracting the layout, so WPF uses XML or rather XAML, Kotlin has it written as code.",

There are frameworks for building GUIs with imperative code, but they're not great to work with. Declarative languages, however, are great for building GUIs. For example, HTML. A UI is basically a hierarchy of components, and a declarative language like HTML is a perfect way to declare or describe the UI.For this reason, most development stacks involve one language for processing, and another declarative language for the GUI part",

True, not all the knowledge gets put into projects but projects are still a way to see where you are in your journey.Let's say you can build an A. But you can't build a B yet. Which sets you a milestone. It can be a milestone in a linear line (simple HTML page -> static webpage -> dynamic webpage -> a web service -> etc.) but can be also on all kinds of directions (a home automation system, an MMO game, a Java applet for a smartcard, etc). For example I feel comfortable with Java. I use it in my daily work. I can build web services that consist of separate microservices/monoliths and communicate with each other via Kafka or via some MQ tool. That is my position on backend web application development line. Yet when I add frontend side to it, then I have to take many steps back because I do not feel comfortable with stuff like React or Angular. I can get my tasks done but it is out of my comfort zone. I am yet to reach a point where I do not mind a Jira task that tells me to work on our frontend side. Or, a totally different direction: I'm still quite a beginner when it comes to creating mobile apps. I can get something done on a hobby project level. But I can't work as a mobile app developer. And programming a remote control? I can't do it. Probably can figure something out by reading documentation and using trial and error approach, but it is totally out of my specialty. And implementing a post-quantum cryptography algorithms? No idea at all.I use different stages/levels of projects to measure my knowledge and skills. What is easy for me, what I am fine with doing, what I can teach others, where I'm struggling, and what I can't reasonably do.",

But if they lack the mental horsepower and abstraction skills to take what they've learned and add to that knowledge easily, they're still beginners.Anyways, you can keep a checklist of things you want to learn if you want, but it doesn't really show you anything about your progress towards becoming a decent programmer.

If you want to go solo indie, you may also want to start by learning to program, but it's really not that much more important than story telling, art, sound, game design, and 20 other skills. Some big indie games rely heavily on clever programming, but some successful ones (like undertale, according to it's dev) are really a mess internally. You cannot excpect a large payday in this field. Programming is more of a specialist field. You obviously need programming skills, but most people underestimate how important organization and people skills are. I mean, otherwise it's pretty self explanatory / the FAQ explains it better than I could how to get started. The pay is a little higher (mostly because there is more money in B2B than in selling games) but getting hired without a degree has become much harder nowadays.",

Definitely you should do some research into how the game industry is doing. How many new games are made every year, how many remain there 5 years later. How many startups even survive. Game development, in my opinion, is more risky. Yes, people DO play games. All kinds of games. Mobile games, PC games, VR games, AR, online games, etc. But how big percentage it is from these projects that started? Also, game development is not only writing a code. There are also designers, audio composers, etc. You won't write a single game, most likely but you'll be part of a team/company.But the same can be said also about other software development fields. These also have more to it than just writing a code. You also are more likely to work in a team/company. Yes, freelancing exists but then you'll have to deal with the sales part (looking for customers, advertising your product, etc.).",

You'll come to regret it.First of all - you'll spend all your time finding the perfect translation, but often the words themselves don't actually mean in programming, what they mean in English. Just something as basic as \"print\" - it never means \"print\", it always means \"write this sequence of characters to the standard output stream, be it a file, or terminal-window\". Which is probably why different languages (and APIs) calls it write, print, log, out, or >> ... So what should your translation be? And if you choose the Spanish word for \"write\" as the function name for \"print\", then what'll you do when you suddenly come across another function called \"write\"? Should that be called the same, or something different?And even if you succesfully translate all the functions, classes and methods, you still can't translate words like if, while, for, function, class, return and so on - you you'll still end up with a mix.And the worst part is - when you forget what a translation means, and come across some of your earlier code - you'll have no way of understanding what it actually does, if the Spanish-named functions are part of the program itself, or translations of the system-functions. And you won't be able to search for anything, because no one else knows your exact translation files ...But you are not the first thinking these thoughts, and in fact there has been a number of localized programming languages around the world.

If just looking directly at the requirement, it seems like the minimum parameters would be the item number and location to be delivered to. It does make sense to also parameterize the \"1 hour\" part assuming folks using the API would be interested in other time frames, too.I think I prefer /centers as the end-point, since presumably a list of that resource is the return value, and the rest as query parameters treated as filters. They could even be nested as filters to make it explicit. Or they could have filter added to the query parameter name.I would not do it as 2 queries without knowing more requirements that would justify an API like that. You'd want an API like that for various reasons. But without any reasons, you may as well just make the API as friendly to the user calling it as possible. 1 call is certainly more friendly than 2. It's also almost always more performant, though I wouldn't worry about performance without a specific reason to.Since it's your API, you can of course require the user to pass the item ID in. Since the requirement is so open-ended, I would just assume the user has an item ID, unless there's some reason to think they don't.

The wages dropped along with the number of positions.Before that it was Cloud computing. Wedge the word cloud into your startup to increase the chances of getting funding. Cloud experts were in great demand. Ultimately cloud has become pretty ubiquitous and now just a part of dev. Mostly it's just the cloud providers who have made big money from it.I think AI will be the next Cloud, rather than the next Blockchain. Lots of companies looking for an excuse to use it, most not making any money from it. Lots of AI startups going nowhere. The infrastructure required to train models will limit the AI providers to the larger companies with each trying to gain market share. AI is a financial bubble, but a useful tool also.

Writing software is easy, once you figure out what you want to make, you can bang it out pretty fast. LLMs make this part even faster, which can be nice, especially when I have writer's block.But.I have to go back and read through everything it wrote, make sure it works properly, make sure it caught all the weird edge cases specific to our codebase, make sure it matches our coding style, make sure it's going to be reliable, make sure it didn't hallucinate. I usually end up having to rewrite a decent amount of the LLM generated code.This sucks because reading software and auditing it is much harder and more intellectually draining than writing it.Figuring out what you need to write is the bulk of your job, understanding the specs, understanding the context of your changes within your codebase. Making sure all the weird edge cases you know are handled. Writing docs. Coordinating with other folks on the team.To get good at that, you need practice, and you need to write stuff yourself, and you need to see it fail yourself. I don't think it's going to actually replace me or you any time soon. I could be wrong, I wouldn't mind retiring early lol. So far, it's been years of threatening to take my job, but no real progress towards that goal.The job market is tough right now and companies are blaming AI for layoffs they would have carried out regardless. Tough hiring market at the same time as AI does not mean one caused the other. And so far the companies that actually did lay people off to replace them with AI have ... re-hired everyone a few weeks later.",

It doesn’t guarantee they can design a database schema or design a system, or even that they understand what a message broker and event streaming platforms are, much less how they fit into a system.It’s always been like this, though, and AI hasn’t really changed anything about that dynamic. Sure, I can design a spec and pop it in the magic Copilot machine and get code that’s close to correct, but I still have to spend time paying attention to what it’s doing and checking its output, while with most junior engineers I can reasonably expect after the first couple months of their career that they didn’t just hand me a pile of dog shit that appears to do what the requirements are asking, but actually falls apart the second I run or test it.For now, it’s just a shit economy, and hiring is going as you’d expect it to in a shit economy. In addition to that, software engineering is no longer the golden ticket everyone acted like it was in the 2010s to the early 2020s.

The finance industry operates exactly at the peak of its own hype cycle, *they* decide when the party is over and the money will stop flowing, and are always certain to secure their own bag before anyone else. Your continued career success is based on the opinion of some Warren Buffett-looking dude who spends most of his days working from his vacation home or in Stamford, CT, contrary to the delusions of some people on this sub, who think that SWEs are sacrosanct. This profession isn't, and never was, immune from macroeconomic realities and hype cycles.

If I think of the last 25 years, we're in a bad era right now, and people who have only been in the industry the last 5 years don't have the context.2000-2001: End of Dot Com mania2001-2003: Black hole of jobs2004-2006: Slow, steady rise2006-2008: A lot of startups founded in this era, lot of hiring2008-2010: Job growth frozen. Mobile and smartphones saved the industry in 2010 as it proliferated2011-2014: Average market. Cautious employers.2015-2019: Good times and coddling.2020-2022: COVID layoffs and immediate hiring boom2023-2024: Constant layoffs2025: No-growth market similar to 2008-2010.So, by my measure, of those 25 years, about 17 were good, but it's heavily cyclical.However, if you've only been in the industry for 5 years, you see a much bleaker view of 2/5 good years.",

At the biggest company I ever worked, one team would scream about day for day shifts in deadline if I delivered late, and also wouldn’t take bugfix releases until they found a problem and then they would cry that they were blocked. For two and a half quarters, they would find bugs in the code six weeks after I or another team had already identified the bug and I had fixed it. A few of them were obvious showstoppers which meant they hadn’t touched the code at all for five of those “day for day slip!” weeks. It was schedule drama to cover their own issues. They did this nine times in a row before they found one bug I hadn’t already fixed and created a tagged release for. Every one before that was known bug, upgrade to 2.0.4 or later to get the fix. I think we ended up with a 1:11 ratio. By then the API was fixed and the test coverage was high so it was mostly performance or security fixes. Eventually everyone in my division caught on to what a clown car they were. Lots of eye contact and eye rolling during project status conference calls",

Had a final meeting with my boss the day before my last day, and he told me they were told it was for two reasons:1) Rising interest rates were cutting into the bottom line and they were concerned about runway (they had at least several years at the burn rate at the time).2) They lost their CTO, VP, and Director for the engineering side of things, and the rest of the executive board didn't want to handle a team of 16 engineers directly, so to make things easier they decided cutting the team in half made sense.In the few months after the layoff, half of the remaining engineers left for other opportunities, taking the org down to just 4 engineers. Apparently this led to some panic with the execs, and they finally did what I and others wondered why they didn't just do in the first place: they promoted they very capable and well liked lead engineer to VP, giving them their delegation point.One of the staff engineers who remained (who I worked with at my job before that one) said they were considering seeing if folks who were laid off might be interested in returning, and flat out asked me, \"If we offered to bring you back, would you?\" Told him I'd really have to think about it, but given the reasons for why the layoff happened I would have a hard time being willing to trust the company wouldn't do it again. He understood and that was the end of that conversation. Sucked too because if I would have been able to just slide back into my job there, as it was before, it would have been a $20k pay bump compared to the job I'd started a few weeks before that conversation took place.Layoffs lead to further attrition, and it's usually the most capable folks in the org who have avenues they can explore to leave. My manager, for example, gave notice a week after the layoff to go be the founding engineer of another company a buddy of his had started, and had been bugging him to join.The entire reason I was at that job was the place I worked before laid off 20% of the company in early 2022, and the attrition afterwards was big. I survived that layoff, the first one I ever survived, but it sucked watching folks I absolutely enjoyed working with leave. Many of them ended up at one or two other companies, and I ended up at one of those companies when one of them suggested they reach out for me to expand engineering. Frustrated with the promotion process and not liking the new landscape of things, being able to interview for two hours (system design and leadership rounds to assess level, no coding) for a $25k pay bump was too tempting.There are mental aspects to these things that linger, for everyone regardless of whether they were the ones let go or if they got to stay. I'm not saying layoffs should never happen or are never necessary, but for all the ones I've been through they definitely felt too reactionary and didn't consider the aftershock among those who remained.",

But I’m not fully convinced that [ATS](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumereview/comments/1jsb9a8/4_steps_to_creating_a_jobwinning_resume_resume/) is irrelevant; some of it may be hype, but formatting your resume for it still makes sense. The OP mentioned spending $300 on a resume rewrite, which is fine if it worked, but there are much more affordable tools with good templates that help you build and organize everything easily, even sending your resume to many recruiters at once. And with AI becoming more involved in hiring, it seems like these systems will only become more normalized over time.",

The good news is you’re still getting final rounds, which means your resume and overall profile are solid. The gap isn’t killing you yet… interview performance probably is.If the feedback keeps pointing to system design, that’s where I’d focus. Not the high-level whiteboard stuff, but the gritty parts… tradeoffs, scaling details, and naming specific AWS or database components. It’s less about knowing every service and more about talking through why you’d make certain choices. I’d run 1–2 mock interviews a week with someone who will push you hard on low-level details.Also, don’t underestimate the smaller companies. They ghost a lot, yeah, but they also move fast when they’re serious. Sometimes you need to get creative… reach out to engineering managers or founders directly, not just apply through the portal. A short, confident note with a relevant project link can stand out more than another polished resume.Lastly, keep something going that keeps your mind active… consulting, contract work, or even mentoring. It doesn’t have to pay well; it just fills the story for when someone asks what you’ve been doing since the layoff.You’re not done… you’re just stuck in the long middle part that everyone forgets to talk about. Keep practicing interviews and treating each one like a live-fire exercise. That’s usually what breaks the drought.",

I like riding dirt bikes, and it’s super dangerous to go out alone if you get hurt. In the past have met a good group of friends playing D&DI’d also say, try to be more open with people. If you are making stuff up about doing things on the weekend, it’s going to be hard to feel out who shares similar interests. It’s kind of awkward after college to be like ‘You seem chill, wanna kick it sometime?’. It’s way easier to be like ‘I heard you were interested in doing X, I’ve been wanting to check it out’ and then it opens the door to invite them to do something together.

What is the real concern from low pay, and can you tie that into some business value? Of course, we want to get our people more money, but there needs to be a good reason.

The thought was if I'm already working crazy hours, I might as well get paid more. Then my old utility field started blowing up due to electrification of everything and I received multiple offers on linkedIn for 40-50% pay bumps (after a 2 year stint not working while going back to school). Left my CS program with about a year left due to class timings and now I have a great work life balance, much higher pay, fully remote and I can use the programming skills I developed to automate a lot of my current work load. Ended up working out well for me. For those that are curious, the utility industry is a good place to be right now. Whether that's Civil/Electrical/Mechanical or even some CS cyber security degrees.

And to make things worse, this was a \"cancerous\" type of technical debt, aka the number of bad libraries kept growing over time because people kept using the scaffolding tool the wrong way to create more and more bad libraries.Fixing it was a colossal effort, involving a lot of automation to do the migration heavy lifting and also a lot of manual code changes and manual testing, impacting a ton of teams.

That saved a large multimillion dollar customer which the company relied upon who was threatening to leave.

It’s important to focus on the “why”, especially when using AI. Make sure you understand what copilot spits out at you—don’t just copy-paste it. A lot of AI code is suboptimal, lacks context, or is completely wrong. A lot of learning can happen outside of work too. Don’t be afraid to read books—learn from others. Focus on architectural and design decisions. If you like a particular area do personal projects related to it. Udemy courses aren’t too bad for beginners either.

When I was at Compass we went from 150 to 440 engineers in a year and I sat through probably hundreds of technical screens. The correlation between leetcode performance and actual job success is... not great.What I've seen work better is giving them a real problem from your actual workflow. Like pull up some messy production data and ask them to write a query to find something specific. Then watch how they think through edge cases, ask clarifying questions, handle nulls and duplicates. For Python, give them a small script you actually use - maybe something that parses logs or transforms data between formats. See if they can extend it or fix a bug you introduce. The best candidates will ask about the business context, not just dive into coding.Also consider splitting the time - 15 minutes on a practical coding exercise, then 15 minutes discussing their approach to debugging, testing, code reviews. Ask about a time their code broke in production and how they handled it. Or show them a piece of your actual codebase and see if they can understand what it does. These conversations tell you way more about whether they'll succeed than watching them reverse a linked list. I've hired people who bombed leetcode but were incredible at understanding business problems and writing maintainable code that other humans could actually work with.",

Actual job performance can vary on multitudes of factors, like motivation, how does the job help them accomplish their professional goals, etc. Also, 30 minutes is a short time to make a decision on someone who you might be working with for potentially years. I split my interviews in 4 parts:1: Introduction about me, what my team is looking for and why they've been selected for an interview, their background and most recent projects they've worked on and what was their role. This could be 20-30 minutes. 2: Behavioral side, to assess if they can handle the business side, how easy/difficult would it be to work alongside, etc. -15 minutes 3: Technical Assessment: Prepare questions based on their resume to assess if they understand what they've mentioned. If someone says, I did X in my previous job. Can you explain how you did X? - 15 minutes 4: Questions from Candidates: The quality of the questions help assess how likely they want this job and understand what's required of them them to be successful-15 minutes(Can be longer if the questions needs to be answered) Pro Tip: An ideal candidate fits 80-85% of your criteria and has room to grow. If they meet 100% of the requirements, they're more likely to outgrow the job position quickly and move somewhere else.",

Get an understanding of what they've been through already. Is there already someone who has checked their basic competence in Python and SQL? If not, I'm in favor of doing some simple quickie questions first, and then you can see if they can move on to harder questions. HR at some companies will send someone who should have never got through an initial screening process. I really like asking people about their experience to get an idea if they really did the work. People should be able to talk about challenges, mistakes that were made, things they'd do to improve the system, etc. I interviewed someone who said they never have bugs and never make mistakes.

It's usually pretty obvious within a minute or two if the person actually has the level of python expeirence they claim (again you'd be surprised at how many people say they have several years of experience as a senior python engineer then it takes them 5 minutes to remember how to define a function or whatever) and then you can spend the rest of the time gauging their communication skills etc.We actually measure internally what % of candidates pass the initial 30 min tech screen and then fail later rounds of tech screens and have experimented with lots of questions, the fizzbuzz-style one had the best outcomes.",

If you’re struggling, let your manager/senior know rather than failing silently. There is nothing wrong with struggling. But there is something wrong if you cry in quiet and put your team and deliverables into risk. If you let them know, they can also communicate with whoever is necessary and take action earlier. This way, if you deliver stuff, perfect move on to the next thing. If you struggle and let them know, you will get the help you needed and everyone will still be happy because they know they can trust you.And second part is learn to be independent and you need to carry some of the burden the team have. Your existence should not be a burden for someone else but rather help them to carry it. Few examples of this could be, actively review pull requests. Don’t wait someone else to tell you to fix something if you see a problem. Write documentation if you know something. This is kinda related to company size but if you are working with different teams from different departments and they need help, be the guy who they get that needed help from.",

        "body": "60 hours a week is a solid chunk of time to become good at anything, which equates to about 3120 hours yearly.Now here's the kicker, you either like your job or you don't.If you do, then you need to apply 20 extra hours to working more (if you're salary, if not then up to you),or if you don't like your job then apply that 20 extra hours on another subject. If you choose not to apply that time to your job then you're looking at roughly 1000 hours a year, which is what you need to \"master\" or \"grab the hammer\" I call it. Some guys spend 20 years in C++ optimization and still find new things out today, so they are \"masters\" or \"able to drive nails in one hit\". That's truly how I look at it, can you walk into an environment and within 10 minutes narrow down a root cause. If you can't find something that quick then you haven't spent at least 1000 hours studying.If you choose to apply those skills to your job then you also need to make sure you aren't a slave to it, then people can control you and make your life a living hell. If anyone questions why you're there so late/early, or you login for a lot of time, then you can gently slip in that it's part of your \"professional education\". Literally use those words.If you're Indian or Asian (in those countries) then I would be careful with what you give your boss, they could become abusive. If it's an American employer then feel free to work for free. Why? because you're not working for free, you're making yourself look better (job security) and you're progressing your skillset. The Key:Do not think that your devotion to the company will result in that job security or professional progression. You're using them for education while paying your bills. Companies will chew you up and spit you out so be careful with how you practice things at work. The Middleground:Study outside of your job things that will make you useful then either grab tickets you know you can do, or communicate that you want to try this because you've been working on it alone. Why not just self-study and keep it private? Well a homelab isn't going to teach you how to upgrade pods and update images in a production environment, you can mock something like it, but when your boss is breathing down your neck and crap is running down your leg then you'll be glad you worked in a real env. The Takeaway:Take advantage of having a job and a place where you can see things break live, that's where the money is made, not when everything is running well.If you are truly just a curious individual then forget everything I said and protect 20 hours a week to explore whatever you want. Having a job means you can buy GPUs, electronics, hardware, etc. maybe not the best but something for you to work with. No one skill will make you permanently secured in your job, no one job will make you automatically rehireable, but constantly learning new things and \"getting a hold of the hammer\", will keep you happily employed. Me? well I'm unemployed because well...I don't know really...actually I suck at Leetcode and haven't used NodeJs a lot. However, if you have a job then you're in good standing.",

Additionally, so many companies that were previously remote are moving to in-office. My current position was remote when I signed up for it, but they told us that we were RTO in September.You'd be much better off seeing if you can get an in-office job wherever you're moving to, unless you're moving to some small town in the middle of nowhere, in which case you might be in for a rough ride. Dropping down to a data analyst position is another option. I have this is a backup because that's what I used to do before becoming a data scientist.

We need you to have your hands in the code within the first 2 months and get some contributions out.You will still get help but that means your fundamentals are strong (DSA) and you have some specialized knowledge you get from digging deep into a problem space (web optimization, computer vision, hardware acceleration).Find that niche and see which companies work in those field and target apply mid-level/senior roles (which usually have more specific job descriptions) and also their general entry level roles. Companies still struggle finding good hires that know a specific problem space so they would usually go for a new grad with a specific understanding in their problem space than a 3-5 YOE that knows nothing about it.

In terms of overall VC investment, took them 18 years to recover.Most people here weren't even born during that bubble, I was a toddler at the time and all I know about it is from mentors and reading.If the AI Bubble burst anywhere close to it, we are fucked. But I don't think it'll burst. The government very likely will bail them out.The major issue is AI companies like OpenAI *operate expecting they will be bailed out.* Last week their CFO literally said they needed government backstop loans. (that's essentially having the government like a co-signer). Because with their 20 Billion in Revenue there's no way they'll be able to pay for the $1.4 Trillion infrastructure commitments.ELI5: OpenAI promised to spend $1400 with a $20 allowance.It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when and whether the government will bail them out (and taxpayers as a whole will be paying those $1.4 trillion).",

What is great is that you're currently employed, so you can take your time looking around.

If a product doesn’t do well but the engineering team did a good job, they will likely be fine, but the pm likely gets fired. On the other side if a product gets crazy successful, the PM is probably going to advance faster.",

There’s limited real desire and opportunity to get to those levels.To be a “true” senior you need to be leading the team and product in all technical aspects, training others, and being “the man” on the team. That requires a lot of dedication, and frankly, down right hours on the keys at the desk that most people aren’t willing to put in.Most teams will end up with their senior engineers being the longest tenured engineer on the team or someone rotated over from another team who was either a rising “true” senior engineer or more likely: just one of the longer tenured engineers who is backfilling another person’s position. Most engineers with a senior title are mid level engineers who haven’t left.To be a “true” staff engineer, you’re doing everything a senior did, but expand that across team’s through your entire department. Now take the hours you invested in your original team to be a senior, and multiply it by number of teams (roughly). That’s way too many hours for most people to want to invest to reach this level. Even after you make it to this level, your desire to stay here might wain and while your titled a staff engineer because you were performing at that role, a few years later you’re essentially a senior again because you don’t want to keep investing the hours.I quoted “real” everywhere because titles mean different things at different companies and the lower the max TC a  company offers: typically the lower the bar is for a higher title. So I wanted the focus to be on what the general-ish expectation is at each level.",

If you believe you are experiencing WLB (Keep it to yourself and please do not broadcast your great manager to bad managers) and treat it as just a temporary hallucination that you are experiencing that will fade away soon to those not in the know.Now with that in mind there are some really great managers in the company that actually do try, keyword being try to establish a real work life balance within reason. Unless this is being pushed from the L8 and L10 levels it will be very hard to sustain long term by an L7 as they all eventually fold under the executive pressure cooker as they try to make it to L8 themselves. Only then can they and do they have real power to enforce WLB in their org.For yourself you will need to set hard boundaries and never become a yes person for too long or you will be crushed due to taking on more work than you can actually do. I've seen it happen so many times with the courageous happy faced yes people, then 3-6 months in they are burnt out and depressed because they are way overdue on their projects that they agreed to do and management is holding them hard accountable for it due to work being in motion. You let things slip then you get dinged for bias for action, ownership, and deliver results which massively dings your ratings (max HV1, maybe LE) then if it happens again in the next quarter you are put in focus, pivot, and then your done for.So if you want to flip the coin, do it for the work experience. Amazon does wonders for the resume and job opportunities as if you can make it long term at Amazon you can work anywhere.",

Sometimes be careful what you wish for. I worked 50-60 hours weekly for a few years and still felt like it wasnt enough. Im not saying this will be your experience, but again you are running the risk that you may end up in a really toxic team as opposed to a team where you know the work and have some repoitoire with the team. If you are going to risk it, do it for a job that will pay you life changing money in a way. 10% for me isnt life changing especially in this career. Put it like this, if you make 80k a year 88k isnt that much of a difference. If you make 150k a year, 165k isnt that much of a difference. It's extra money to play with or invest but again, is it enough for you to risk maybe the next few years being hectic and stressful?

        "body": "Hey, I’ve been through similar experiences and have a few opinions to share.1. You’ll improve code quality on the job. The alternative is to look at more code (open source) but I don’t recommend that unless you’re really passionate about it. Otherwise, it might add more stress. So, just try to criticize and improve your code base at work. Practice articulating what looks good and what looks bad, and why. Experiment with new ideas and you’ll learn faster. There are many signals to look out for in a codebase: does any part of your dev flow slow you down when building new features, are any parts confusing if a new dev were to work on it, do you have to update multiple places in code for a simple feature, etc. If you have few complaints then maybe your structure is solid after all. If you do identify issues, chances are that it’s something someone else ran into and found a solution for, so it’s always worth searching for how others approach things.2. The only way is to study and to practice. There are tons of online resources. One that I’ve used is GreatFrontEnd, but try googling or searching this sub to find some structured learning resources. Also, ChatGPT is a great tool to ask dumb questions and get good feedback. Chat is also a great tool to ask your exact question : “how do I rebuild my fundamentals in a structured way.”3. Similar answer: study and practice, using online resources. I’ll bet you know a lot more than you give yourself credit for, but maybe don’t have the language to articulate ideas. Again, you can treat AI tools as a dev buddy: before developing a feature, create your rough design idea and ask Chat for feedback. (Typically this would be done with colleagues, but if you don’t have other devs as resources, AI is a solid tool imo.)4. I recommend stopping your weed consumption until you feel less anxious about your career. If you can’t cut it out completely, I recommend reserving it for a specific time and in smaller doses, like at night after all responsibilities are done for the day and you’re ready to wind down for bed. This is a nice middle ground because quitting cold turkey can lead to relapse and a negative spiral. Reserving it for night time only is a guilt-free window for you. This way, you’re using weed as a reward rather than a coping mechanism. Just make sure you have a solid and consistent waking schedule. :)5. This is more life advice than just career advice: we’re human beings with finite time in this life. You’ll never have time for everything so a good skill to learn is time management. With this career revamp you’re working on, write out everything that’s on your mind, and then choose the ones of highest importance (it’s subjective and only you can decide that). For each item that you’ve prioritized and deemed important enough to focus on, break it down into smaller chunks. Rinse and repeat until you have less overwhelming and more actionable tasks. And most importantly, do the tasks! If they’re small enough to complete, it helps you psychologically build momentum. If tasks seem daunting it’s usually because they feel more ambiguous and that’s when our minds resort to coping strategies (like smoking weed or scrolling on your phone). In these cases it’s okay to dive in and try things out until it feels less ambiguous, and from there you can continue the process of identifying and breaking things down into a todo list (aka backlog).One last thing, I’d recommend looking into therapy as an additional resource. I know that it can be expensive and might feel useless, but here’s my take on it: it’s not some sort of silver bullet solution to all your problems. If you can consider “cutting down on weed and strengthening my SWE foundation” as a long-term project, then therapy is a great resource to use along the way. It’s similar to what you did here, you posted how you were feeling and some advice and strategies were recommended. But with consistent therapy, each session is like a check-in: here’s what we talked about last time, here’s what I tried, and here’s where I struggled. It’s a continuous, iterative development process, much like how we build good software products!Good luck, you’ve got this!",

The simplest, hardest, and most effective place to start is to quit weed entirely and start running, or anything you can tolerate that gets your heart rate up. Eat candy, drink some beer, watch TV, do whatever helps to avoid actually smoking weed. If you have a good support network, lean on them.

There’s also a personal element to it - is the new position going to have you doing new stuff? Why did you interview in the first place? Here’s my story navigating this in the last year:Personally, I successfully did a counter offer with my firm (very large). I had to show my offer letter to confirm the number and had to basically do a review to ‘justify’ it, but not only am I still here, I even switched teams with no issues internally. The external offer I received came from a position I was reached out to about on LinkedIn, and I took the interview as practice to make sure I’m on top of my interviewing skills and be on top of any subjects or topics relevant. It was NOT to leave. However, the offer I did end up getting was too good to pass up, and I would have been an idiot to pass on it. I was open about this to my manager - I didn’t want to leave, but I’d be an idiot to say no - and they wanted to keep me enough that they worked with me to get a counter. The counter almost completely matched it, and I’m having a good time where I’m at.I don’t know if I’m the exception, but hopefully that helps. Honesty paid off here the most for me personally, but just remember that no matter what, you’re taking a risk if you accept the counter offer. I’d be prepared for anything.",

Doesn't mean it can't happen from an old posting, just less likly, I think.",

The traditional way to go about a job search is to double down on your strengths so that you look competitive in comparison with your immediate peers.There's something to be said about adjacent skillsets as an augmentation of your core skills, but \"from admin stuff to IT\" seems a bit too far off. Ideally, you'd target skillsets that complement what you're already good at in some way that bridges gaps in requirements from job postings in your area of expertise.",

The whole functional programming paradigm, ES6, components, props, how renders work, Redux - all of it felt like trying to drink from a fire hose. I had anxiety and panic attacks over it. So I want you to know: this transition is genuinely hard, and you're not failing because you're finding it hard.That perfectionism/ADHD piece your therapist mentioned is huge though. Modern frontend development, especially in complex codebases, IS a constant stream of \"wtf is happening\" moments. Even seniors get lost in deeply nested components with no documentation. The difference is they've built up tolerance for not knowing and can sit in that discomfort longer.Also, you lost your mentor. That's massive. You went from having someone who understood the codebase to basically being on your own in a system with minimal documentation.The isolation is probably making everything worse too. Even if you go to the office and those people don't understand your specific codebase - they've been through what you're going through. We all have, even if we don't show it or are too proud to admit it. You could try working from coffee shops sometimes too, just to break up being alone all day.For me, it took 1-2 months of really intense, focused work before things clicked. But what forced me to lock in was when the stakes got really real. That kind of pressure made me focus in a way nothing else does, but it's also not sustainable or healthy long-term.Your manager's job is to help you thrive - you could try being really open with them about needing more structured support after your mentor left. Pair programming helped me a ton - you get to ask questions in real time and it actually makes both people more productive. If you ask your manager or even just another dev to pair with you on some tickets, most people would probably be down. And when you're stuck solo, timebox it - give yourself 30 minutes to struggle, then ask.You're 9 months in. That's still early. But you also need to be honest with yourself about whether this specific situation is set up for you to succeed.",

I got a co-founder friend who is a consultant and he's got some pretty good ideas involving LLMs.I've been job searching for a month targeting remote roles which makes it tougher.

The second thing, was exposure to SWE systems ideas, networking, distributed systems, compilers, embedded systems: just he distributed systems knowledge alone has made a huge difference.That said, if I spent the same amount of time (more than 2000 hours) doing projects? I probably would have learned more. The only issue with that, is that the courses push you further than what you might do on your own. For instance, I'm still learning CS, ML, and math concepts, I'm just not spending 20 hours a week on it.One additional point: I already was a PhD dropout when I got my MS CS, so I had research exposure, knew how to make arguments with data, and didn't really need help with research or academic skills, it was really the content that helped the most.",

Handled by both backend and front end systems as well as databases to hold the results of those applications running for the manifest. That’s one such example. Things like that usually take a mixture of full stack engineer with devop/platform. But I really would recommend trying learn and advocate for streaming as a pivot. Next time you see any pipeline or DevOps work that are around ‘eventing’ that or message queues could be adjacent to streaming, try to claim it. Once you work parallel to a subject you want to peruse, it makes it much easier.Like I do MLOps as well. I work a lot of model serving and performance that the information and needs for training AI models have rubbed off on me. I could make the switch if I wanted to.

I lost a job because of \"disagreements\", but it basically came down to I called the out on their shit. There as a lot of lip service to burnout and shit like that, but nothing every changed because the \"project is too important\".The project is so important that we were 15 months late getting FDA approval on the medical devices and still got a company party celebrating the victory. Never mind there was 0 effort to figure out why were were late as to no repeat mistakes. It was probably the right decision to just let me go. Funny thing was, after the left me go over the next 10 months 5 out of 7 Senior SWEs left along with 2 other midlevel SWEs. > I am already struggling to get responses since losing my job. I know I need to be prepared to be job searching for 6 months, but other people I talk to that have experience seem to have no problem having recruiters reach out or getting responses/interviews.It's a tough market out there and everybody is different. Maybe you are not marketing your value well on your resume or applying to the wrong jobs. If you are only looking at top tech companies then you have to expect competition for people working at other top tech companies.I have also been looking for a new job over the last couple of years and this year I got very few calls to interview from my applications. I worked on safety critical medical devices for 15 years and have lead teams over that time in addition to being an IC. I'm basically an embedded application SWE working with mostly c and c++ which is not really what the industry wants.It's not even an issue of only wanting remote work as I am more than happy to go into the office, but sadly I cannot just relocate anywhere due to family reasons. That doesn't mean no relocation, but the city needs to be a place the whole family is in on or people are going to have a bad time.>So far, I have gotten nothing but 2 rejections (no interview), and 2 ATS rejections from LinkedIn easy apply jobs. I'm not just using easy apply, but maybe something is wrong with my resume?That's nothing you have barely started interviewing.>I'm not just using easy apply, but maybe something is wrong with my resume? Post your resume in the resume review thread or on resume review subreddits to get feedback. Things like use STAR and show impact is a common comment.>Is the job market just that toast right now, even for people that have a little bit of work experience? Companies are hiring, but the supply of candidates is large and hiring managers are being selective. They feel the need a close to perfect fit because if you are not it then somebody else probably is. >Is it because its the end of the year and about to be holiday vacation time?Probably part if it as hiring slows down around the holidays and picks up in the new year.",

Not to mention if you wanted to pick up some tasks in the other tech stack, you always had the option to do so. Overall though, it's hard to say if just specializing in one platform will be an issue, given how relatively young the mobile field is (what is it, like 15ish years now?).

There were 3-5 engineers most of the time. No dedicated QA, no pipeline or deployment process. We'd take our app to install on the client's infrastructure on a flash drive. And I'd feel silly and hilarious to wear a suit.The place was laid back, very informal. We would always go out to lunch together. Occasionally working until late at night during deadline crunch we would share a beer in the office. I learned and grew a lot. Got promoted a couple of times while there. They would sometimes fail to pay our salaries on time, always on the cusp of failure. But I was having fun and it fit my life as a 24yo. I would absolutely hate that place today.The second job I'm going to mention is my current one. Healthcare industry related. Chill, remote friendly. Very few meetings. I get to work on my tickets at odd hours, so I can be present for my family. But there is some good engineering happening and opportunity to stay sharp. I've worked at other chill places where after a year or two I felt like I'd have to be very creative to write a single bullet point about that job.",

He picked me up, dusted me off, and just... believed in me.Any time I encountered an issue, he never treated it as a \"me\" problem. It was always a systems problem. His first question was always \"how do we prevent this from happening again?\" Not \"why did you mess up?\" That psychological safety was everything.Here's the thing though - the work itself was an absolute shit show. The technology was this custom mess that practically functioned as its own language. Hard to understand, impossible to debug, nightmare to optimize. The product team was perpetually confused, and we were constantly building the wrong thing.But my team? We were in it together. We kept trying, kept pivoting, and most importantly - we all had each other's backs.I'm at FAANG now and have been for the past 6.5 years, and I'm grateful for it. Better pay, better tech, better resources. But low-key I miss those days.

Happy hours multiple times a week, great people and made many friends while working hard and learning a lot.New favorite is my current job. Tons of perks and events, also in a great part of the city, 15 minute bike commute or 15 minutes by train. Lots of money and bonuses going around, free snacks and meals, smart people, up to date tech, good tools, documentation, and support. We routinely get hockey/basketball/concert tickets in a suite, and people really value the work we do because it makes a positive impact for people. It's three days a week in office, but the office is so nice and the bike ride into work is enjoyable so I don't mind going in for a few days. I've even gone in when I didn't have to because the building is so nice. I've made some friends and referred a friend to work with me. It's been a good time.Last job sucked and I got laid off with 30% of the company. I was able to get severance and had a new job with months of severance left. Their loss.",

Why is because it’s good to offer many avenues of feedback. Etc. Next, if you can, be sure to listen to the interviewer and offer ways to help them if possible. For example, after they ask you this question, you could ask, have you been having a hard time getting consensus on your team? What a coincidence, I got consensus all the time with these strategies, here’s how I dealt with disagreements, etc.",

        "body": "Big tech interviewer here. Although some interview questions lend themselves to specific architectures, we don't necessarily ask you to design systems with anything in particular, you're supposed to put your best foot forward and design a system that makes sense given the requirements.Prep guides love to tell you to list FRs and NFRs and put an api gateway in the middle of the fucking diagram etc etc, but you'd be surprised at how frequently people don't actually know what they're talking about beyond the initial keyword vomit. Getting caught bullshitting is an easy way to get disqualified.I usually ask people to sketch out the system end to end, and then dive deep on some area. Frontend folks sometimes treat the entire backend as a black box, and we focus on frontend things, up to API layer. But not always. There are plenty that can speak backend too, to varying degrees.Often it depends on the specific requirements for the job. Some teams want a strong frontend expert, others want someone who's more full stack. General bar for us is \"we want a software engineer, not a react dev\". Mind you, also, this is for high pay roles. Other companies with lower pay bands often have easier bars, especially for frontend, whose interviewers tend to not be as strong in full stack, end-to-end system design themselves (not throwing shade at anyone, just my observation from having spent a lot of time in this space).",

Not something too serious, but a high picture, then focus on some part, there is no time to ask you about everything that you mentioned, but dont be surprised if they do like lets talk about how this solution scales.There are no right and wrong answers; the interview wants to see how your cogs work, and do you know anything else, except the framework that is used in the company?

If you do not have any real users, what you have is \"homework\", or \"exercise\", not a project.Without users, you have no stake holders, no iteration, no communication. You have no demands and expectations. No nothing. You have none of the things that elevate you from writing code to professional software development.>Should I prioritize coding quality, user adoption, revenue, or project vision?If you had revenue worth to speak of, why would you be looking for a job?Coding quality matters - but without it, you will not have users, or lose the ones that you have quickly. If you write terrible code and still manage to retain users, that's still something. Project vision is almost entirely worthless. I make good money working on a silly little CRUD app. I would love it if my company took it further and developed some sort of vision - but we have users, we are profitable and I can pay my bills. Even if we had a vision, it would still be worthless if we didn't actually manage to build it.>Would getting a certain number of high quality daily users make a difference… I ask because I personally see the value in targeted ads to doctors plus the data I would have from their use( it’s all HIPAA compliant).If all of that works, why would you be looking for a job? (There are many good and acceptable answers here, but I would want to hear them.)>Is there value constructing real world application or is the quality of the code the main focus?Nobody will be looking at your code.>Are there entry level jobs for project management or anything else that may see potential from my projects if I had a good number of daily active users?I suppose there are qualities other than programming that you would need to manage a software project with users - but then, we are no longer discussing a portfolio full of programming projects, are we?",

        "body": "The thing that stands out to me the most about a personal project is when someone solved a problem they wouldn't have necessarily wanted to solve in a way they wouldn't have necessarily wanted to do it.Let me explain.For example, I love fantasy football. If I were to do a personal project, I would build something that I want to build that addresses something I care about - and if other people found it interesting and used it, great, but I would 100% ignore any requests to build stuff that I don't care about, or are too difficult, etc.That's what a lot of personal projects are like, and the problem is that most jobs just do not work that way - you don't get to choose the path of most fun and least resistance. Now, mind you - those personal projects are still good in their own way because they allow you to showcase your more pure technical skill. But from an overall \"how will this person do at this job\", they miss a big chunk of it.When I see someone who built something that was clearly based on a user request with real-world, annoying ass constraints? That's when I'm really interested. I think an app built for doctors kinda fits that, because that's not a group that is going to use something for unimportant stuff. So if you're going to get users, you're going to have to be able to handle annoying shit that most people don't want to deal with (e.g., HIPPA compliance).",

In fact, at her former hospital, there were employees whose sole job was to manually do what this app does for all patients in the specialty. So one full-time worker per 10 doctors or so. So, I have around 15 users at the moment all in one speciality, in one hospital. I'm expanding on 4 other hospitals at the moment because of my wife's connections and friends etc. They will also be in oncology. Each site will probably take me a day or two of data work to be ready to go. Then I am going to get started with cardiologists at her hospital. I don't have revenue worth speaking of, no... I'm still testing it. If I were to monetize it, I think I would go with ads that target doctors while i grow it. Single small ads for expensive cancer treatments, devices, conferences, studies etc. I haven't gotten that far yet. I have a big advantage with her to constantly bounce ideas off and to teach me exactly how this all works and what they need... plus her network of doctors. I'm trying to utilize each angle I have. I would be looking for a job because, well, why not? I am going to keep on working on this full-time but I can send out applications at the same time.",

I don't want to pigeonhole myself too much such that it becomes too niche, so I can try to keep at the general IT stuff we do and slowly lean into niche-but-not-too-niche specializations (like Linux or network management) as it comes along, and continue my education with my CS degree and company-funded certifications.We don't have specific teams or departments, we just have technicians who happen to have more experience dealing with X issues compared to Y issues, so those related tickets typically get sent to that person, but we all still generally deal with the same stuff across the board.",

The more you own, the more opportunities you'll have to help others.Focus on being the person people turn to when they have questions. Ship work quickly and with minimal bugs.

Even 1 month of updating SQL queries can sound like a major portion of your job when it's a line on your resume. I transitioned in backend because I liked unit testing and spearheaded more work in that area and that led me to analyzing database constraints and stored queries.",

Originally, recruiters would scout people with impressive side projects because it gave strong signals about technical excellence/leadership/etc. So job search gurus started to spout the idea that having side projects would help differentiate people from other candidates, and new grads started to misunderstand it to mean that \\*they\\* have to have a side project. But now we're in goodhart law territory, aka \"when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure\".Thing is, the original people getting scouted are senior level high achievers with years of experience. And yeah, the average run-off-the-mill new grad project is nothing to write home about. What people don't realize is that the \"years of experience\" from these high achievers also include a graveyard of side projects that never saw the light of day. Side projects are largely for upskilling and exploring the depths of some technical specialization/area. When you see people getting scouted for a side project, that's survivorship bias from those that stuck with a side grind for years.New grads themselves seem to at least half understand the importance of \"years\", since years of schooling is what differentiate them from bootcampers, right? But they need to be productive years: it's a very different thing to coast during uni playing games like all your buddies did in high school vs going home after uni classes and hacking on side projects and coming out of graduation with a very good idea of what the professional landscape of your desired specialization looks like.There's a saying that the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago and the second best time is now. Side projects are like trees. If you want the fruits of labor, then you ideally should've had the project for a while already, but if you're just starting, don't expect it to be bearing fruit next month.",

They normally do not look at Github accounts, project sites, project descriptions, and the like. Nor are they normally equipped to actually judge anyone's technical skills or the quality of a project. Recruiters really care about essentially checklists - previous experience? education? does everything look OK? are the skills there, maybe?2. I (as an interviewer) don't typically care about your resume holistically. By the time I'm given your resume, I'm already slated to interview you. I may not even look at your resume for more than 10 seconds depending on the type of interview I'm conducting.3. Hiring managers may actually be the person who care the most about your resume as a whole if they are involved in selecting resumes.4. Many people do not have projects.Everything I've previously said to you applies (in no particular order): luck, location, resume quality, and connections are probably the four biggest factors for getting opportunities, especially the first one.",

I would argue something like:\"Developed a DAG-based AI inference engine for video analysis using Python, FastAPI, and TensorFlow for deepfake video analysis.\"is better than:\"Wrote a python backend service for a machine learning workload.\"Be specific and provide overwhelming evidence that you have done useful things. The evidence is these hyper-specific bullets. Be ready to talk in detail about everything you say you have done. It is really easy to tell when someone is talking out their ass about a resume bullet point. If the interviewer is doing their job they will ask you to get specific. Specificity, detail, depth of knowledge.The best way to get these bullet points is for every single job sit down for at least thirty minutes and just write every single technology you used and every single thing you did. Be painfully verbose in your listing of things. Once you have that you can go back and create bullets like the first one I showed you.I would focus on LinkedIn (shocker), Dice, and Indeed. Dice and LinkedIn are where most of my 'in bound prospects' come from in terms of job opportunities. Dice has actually been really great for me. Get your profile there up to date and as specific as possible.Now let us talk applications. You need to be doing hundreds per day. Don't waste time creating tailored resumes to job postings. Your resume will likely get lost in the sea of other applicants. I wish it was not this way. When I was looking for a job when I got laid off earlier this year I was doing 200-300 a day or more. You will find out eventually that most recruiters look at the new job postings Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday so Saturday and Sunday are GREAT days to slam job postings but you need to be ass-in-chair submitting till your fingers fall off every single day. Do as many easy applies as you can stomach then start moving toward the regular job applications. APPLY, APPLY, APPLY. It sucks, it is boring, it is a numbers game. I had 10+ interviews a WEEK for almost a month when I was doing this. It works.Have two or three references ready to go that you can submit if recruiters or job applications ask for them. Let them know you are applying to a TON of places. It speeds things up if you don't need to ask every single time.Back to the resume thing. It is a good idea to have 2-3 developer 'archetypes' you want to apply for. I have 'Full Stack Python focus', 'Full Stack TypeScript focus', and 'Full-stack AI infrastructure focus' archetypes ready to go. Then you can go to LinkedIn and type 'TypeScript Software Developer' and crank through applications.Also, I like to have at the top of my resume a little blurb that shows what I am:\"Software Engineer with experience building AWS-native Python applications to automate critical workflows in the insurance industry as well as large-scale video analysis for customer POCs, securing $10K+ MRR deals, and developing a Python-based DAG-driven AI inference engine for deepfake video analysis.\"The HR person or whoever is looking for X type of developer and if you can put that in front of them your chance of getting a callback goes way up. Do EVERYTHING you can to show them you are what they want.One more thing, on LinkedIn it is a good idea to filter by 'Jobs Posted in the last 24 hours'. I applied to some of those earlier this week and within an hour got a call from a recruiter for one of them. This has happened many times.This is how I hunt for jobs, it works for me. It is alot of work but its pretty straightforward once you have the resume and profiles ready to go. And I don't mean to be an ass by bringing this up but I make $150k a year, graduated late 2024 with my CS degree. I landed this job in a tough job market. Or, rather, I created the preconditions of job offers and was ready when they inevitably appeared. You can do this. Employment is an emergent property, like flight.",

I was hoping my last contract would roll over into a full time position making 160K but it didn't happen.

I think those will be useful for the foreseeable future. Knowing Java and Jmeter, at least last time I checked, was *really good* in some niche situations if you needed to validate data being put into a SQL database. Like, one of the best tools I've ever found for specifically that, which is weird since it's nominally a load testing tool. It's was also surprisingly easy to write your own plugins. That was a few years ago now, though, so I don't know if anything better has come along in the mean time.Knowing a bit about how http/networking works behind the scenes is also a good idea if you do any appreciable rest or network testing. If you're going to be working with that sort of thing at all you really don't want it to be just a magic black box to you. I don't see networking going anywhere either, since the cloud is a thing. I interviewed a guy for QA one time and while I was talking to him I realized that he had a fantastic amount of knowledge about networking and network protocols. I suggested hiring him based on that and told him later that he was underselling himself on his resume because no one else I'd ever interviewed had ever demonstrated the level of networking know-how that we were just casually chatting about.",

I've mainly learned by trying to write software, failing a few times, and figuring out what works and doesn't.Just break things down into one manageable step at a time, and soon you'll have well written code. One piece of advice - only suggest improvements if you can demonstrate their use. No one wants to hear how a proper deployment pipeline will save time, prevent bugs, etc. But, they will listen if you implement a simple pipeline that shows what you're advocating for.If something is useful, implement it and prove it and report your results to the team.
