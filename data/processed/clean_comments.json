General business app development was extremely boring to me by comparison.Spent the past 20 years doing data engineering/data integration work - and while I’m sure the app development space has changed - I can’t see myself ever moving away from data - the problems still interest me to this day.",

The position is unlikely to go to anyone who is external. Direct competitor has a chance if they are beyond stellar. You are competing with applicants who have connections plus are experienced plus have direct knowledge of the domain.Another company I know put up a fake job posting for DE (the position was already hired, but needed to repost due to a migration to a new hiring systems). They purposely only posted the position on their public website and did not post on any job boards. Received 300 applicants in less than 1 day.Sad thing was, their automated rejection email says: “we have reviewed your background and qualifications and determined that we do not have a position for you” pretty fucked up considering that not a single applicant was reviewed since it was a fake posting.This position did go to someone who needs training though, that person had alot of experience in DA, but none in DE, and since high DA salaries are in-line with entry level DE, they know the applicant is capable and will stay. The company received many stellar applicants, but didn’t have the budget to pay for their asking salaries. Also, they wouldn’t lowball someone experienced since that person will quit the second the market improves.",

The pieces that come together so that you can stand up a new application is often poorly-documented and the many pieces that it takes to stand up a new application can delay or demolish a project timeline. Clearly documenting the steps to get those pieces in place and showing your knowledgeability and attention to detail is a way to ensure you are someone who will be kept before those who just do their job. Parlaying your knowledge by helping other across your clients departments to tackle those challenges will build you a reputation that will help you advance or at the very least make you a must-keep.",

But you can be displaced by the perception that one is “good enough.”I think the arguments on both sides of the LLM table are misplaced.Every conversation online about AI replacing humans is centered around looking at it from an individualistic perspective. But that’s not how labor works in the workplace.Essentially, both of the below statements can be true:- AI can’t be a drop-in replacement for Data Engineering- I, as a Data Engineer, can be replaced with AI.If a company begins using LLMs to perform tasks that are repetitive/boilerplate/specific to the strengths of the LLM, and that work makes up a X% of the labor of their data engineering department, allowing for more time from each individual data engineer to perform more work suited for the human DE, then justification for keeping ALL of the original labor isn’t there - assuming the same amount of work is being done.When looking at this from the macroeconomic scale, yes the usage of LLMs to increase productivity in the workplace - whether by agentic automation or simply by using it as a quicker and more efficient task-oriented search engine, WILL have an effect on the number of jobs available in DE and very well could lead to YOU being replaced by an AI, while not replacing all DEs.At any rate, I generally agree with your points on side-stepping being labeled for replacement by embracing and becoming the expert in the business with LLMs usage. It’s what I’ve done and led to me being promoted and now sitting in a much higher position within the company I work for.",

I think a data engineer is already a kind of specialist backend engineer who can get good positions because they are not easy to recruit, at least in my experience. Some DEs are also good at devops and web development, which opens them more opportunities.Another point is that I feel that those titles are overlapping and that a well-rounded DE can apply to multiple of those. I do understand it is impossible to find perfectly independent categories for this kind of studies. Namely, in the same order as the diagram: - big data specialist- DWH specialist- data analyst- data engineer- database professional- BI analystThe fact that big data specialist comes before DE, although a DE is in general considered a big data specialist, may just show how the DE title still lacks recognition. At the opposite, surprisingly DA and DS are put together whereas there could be a giant gap of skills between an SQL DA and a DS expert in ML. Overall, I feel this study or this result is too unclear to draw much conclusion.",

A lot of decisions rely on knowledge and experience and attempting to quantify that at all ends up falling into the same trap that dashboards do: Qualitative judgements are only loosely connected to quantitative amounts.I don't doubt Jeff Bezos knows what he's doing up to a point but I have my doubts his actual working practice bears much resemblance to the principle he's expressing here. Plus I expect there's a healthy amount of survivorship bias going on when analysing whatever Bezos is doing - 100th idiot syndrome if you will. Just because it worked for him doesn't mean it will work for anyone else.",

Numbers need to be put in context and fit into some kind of overarching narrative before it clicks. The great writers of Substack already understand this. Think Scott Alexander, Noah Smith, Nate Silver. Or go read Wolf Street. MUCH more intuitive than any business dashboard I've ever looked at.But the flip side of that is: when are dashboards appropriate? Should all analysis just be ad-hoc and narrative-driven? My intuition is that you should curate a very small, simple set of business-wide KPIs and put them on an internal website and have them update reliably a few times a day. For anything more strategic or involved, where there is a key decision to be made, you need analysts to put on the researcher hat and go do the analysis (hopefully with a nice clean data model that the DEs have set up). You need them to be opinionated. Dashboards aren't opinionated, they just tell you what happened without any further guidance.",

During that same time period I've been holding solidly to the principles of financial independence, saving a high percentage of income, and ultimately just having enough money that if things go south at the job I currently have, in terms of crappy work, crappy management, bad financial performance or whatever, I always have enough money to say \"F You\" if I want to. Each of these times, I've given myself a month of 40-hr-per-week job searching and interviewing, at which point I take the next reasonable offer that comes. You can't not work forever. The bank account can't look like a seive. I've taken lower paying jobs before just to fill in the gap until I get a legit offer that was close to my target salary. Having that cash cushion is sooooo important. All this to say, my backup plan has been to stash cash during the fat times, and use up as little as possible during the lean times. I often joke to my wife that I've always wanted to work at Home Depot. I do legitimately think that if I wasn't doing what I currently am, I'd work at HD. Low-stress, low mental weight, get some steps in for health, and they pay like $20-25/hr in my area, so that would keep me out of the poor house.If our industry disappeared, I'd become a contractor and fix up/flip properties.",

Snowpark Dataframes: These were close to PySpark APIs but (not exact). Initially (2,3 years ago) they were limited in coverage but as of now, do cover most of PySpark functions so if you tried it before, experience is much different now. Because Snowpark was not exactly as PySpark, it did require about 10% code refactoring so some migration effort was necessary. Benefit of Snowpark dataframes was that they were not held back by OSS PySpark Functions so you had access to Snowflake specific ML & AI functions and the newest features. Snowpark Dataframes allowed you to leverage 100% Snowflake Serverless Compute engines for SQL, Python, Java & Scala UDFs.2. Snowflake Spark Connector: This was meant to connect existing Spark clusters to Snowflake to read, transform & write data to/from Snowflake. Driver has some optimization where some of the aggr functions could be performed in Snowflake before delivering the data to Spark cluster but the Spark Compute Clusters did bulk of the work where Snowflake was input and/or output for the data.The new Apache Spark Connect from Snowpark combines best of both worlds Apache Spark code that developers love & use for Data Engineering & ML and Snowpark which gives access to serverless vectorized engine for SQL, Python, java & Scala jobs.Recent innovation from Spark Connect from OSS Spark community was the catalyst that Snowflake was waiting for to integrate OSS Spark in to Snowflake ecosystem the right way.This means you can now run your existing Spark jobs with 0 code changes on Snowflake compute which comes with many added benefits such as unified security & governance, performance, auditability & simplicity as compute is serverless and requires little to no optimization or maintenance.How it works is that the OSS Spark sends the job details to Snowflake, Snowflake generates a new execution plan based on the original details that can run on Snowflake Vectorized Engine (SQL, Python UDFs & etc.) sot he original code remains the same but where & how it executes in back are different.Our initial focus for Public Preview was majority of the customer use cases that we have seen which are Data Engineering & ML workloads that use SQL, Dataframes & UDFs. We are actively working on collecting feedback and build support for other new Spark features supported by the OSS Spark Connect project so definitely would love any feedback that you guys have to take to our PMs.I understand this may not be the right fit for every Spark team. If your team enjoys tweaking Spark params & cluster configs to get every ounce of performance out of clusters then this solution may not be a good fit. However, if the team enjoys Spark code and has a ton of existing pipelines but would rather spend their time building & deploying new projects vs. optimizing & maintaining cluster, it will be a great benefit. Especially if Snowflake is the downstream analytics layer as it would eliminate any Export & Import jobs(time & cost) between Spark & Snowflake environments. The main goal is to meet developers where they are by offering ways for them to leverage advances Snowflake capabilities by offering them different means to work with Snowflake in their preferred language and coding frameworks.If you guys give it a try and have inputs don't hesitate the reach out and let us know feedback.The good, bad & the ugly.",

I’m pretty bullish on experienced and knowledgeable engineers making a lot of use of AI. I wouldn’t trust it to do any foundational work/spec creation that drives other projects unless output was verifiable.

You can “ask” them things like, “why did this job fail?” and they’ll trace logs and give a quick readout.But yeah—data access and vendor lock-in are real concerns. What helps:* Keep critical logic in your pipeline code, not in the agent* Let the agent suggest, but not act unless a human approves* Keep agent inputs small (e.g., just metadata or logs, not full datasets)Curious what tooling you’re testing?",

That way, your pipeline knows to wait X minutes before finalizing a window. Spark Structured Streaming supports this but tuning gets tricky. Flink or Kafka Streams handle it better. Confluent Cloud and Integrate offer simplified options if you are okay with microbatch intervals and less real time granularity.For schema drift, landing raw JSON or AVRO into a semistructured column (like VARIANT in Snowflake) can help. Then handle transformations in a way that tolerates missing or new fields.

Certainly there are better and worse choices to make but trying to squeeze the square peg into a round hole is gonna suck. Putting unstructured data into a structured database is going to be painful no matter which way you slice it.But the real game is winning the organizational battles required to begin actually addressing the root causes of the pain and bringing everything into a unified stack. Iot has changed, when it first started it simple scalar data like temperature and there was only a couple of things going on. These days there are much higher expectations on what the devices need to do. They expect always on at the edge monitoring of complex sensors and it takes a fundamental change in the org to get that done. You need your ml or data team to get in the drivers seat and make the pieces fit all the way from the firmware up to the customer UI’s and tying it all together. Wanting it to be simple of easy won’t help. Look at the most painful problems you have, and start identifying what the true technical root cause is and then begin working to make it better. If you don’t have a person or people with this sort of cross stack powers to actually drive the platform as a whole towards success it’s just going to always be an underpowered brittle mess.That’s my 2c anyway. But concretely it’s important to figure out what needs streaming to meet sla’s vs what should be done batch wise for streaming. Companies tend to commit hard to one approach or the other and then struggle to make everything fit that paradigm. You will need both and you need to comfortable with that. Same with structured vs unstructured. Some of your data just isn’t structured today.",

Then made a vector equivalent value of the theme and the chunks,applied a roll-over technique aswell to merge adjacent chunks which cosine similarity beats a tested threshold. Then persisted this data to my database, with every single chunk having its appropriate time-window, from where it was cut off from in the YouTube video.I then created an interface with streamlit where I could see the data-breakdown, their theme, the video thumbnail and the time the video was cut off from, (so this also works as an automatically created YouTube chapters as opposed watching the video and titling sections by hand)I also created an input field where questions relating to any part in any of the videos are asked and the top 5 chunks which are most relevant to the question are retrieved and displayed on the UI.The videos fed into the pipeline could be a playlist or multiple channels with batch extractions.I personally use this now to get to the most relevant part of an information I'm trying to reach out to in the news.

        "body": "Fantastic question! I literally just spent the past \\~6 months spinning something like this up from scratch for my company, except I wasn't blessed with a $50k/yr budget on tools. More like $5k/year tops. Here was my approach:* Sources: AWS Aurora Postgres database, various APIs, potentially Netsuite down the road* Destination: Timescale (now TigerData) database hosted using Timescale Cloud but linked to our VPC via VPC peering -- **this is where the bulk of our budget is going**.* Tech stack: * Pulumi TypeScript to build infrastructure in AWS to support the open source version of the orchestrator, mostly using ECS Fargate for the containers and leveraging existing networking infrastructure * Dagster OSS as the orchestration (went back and forth between this and Prefect before landing on Dagster) * Sling as the core extract and load software to sync data from Postgres to Timescale * dbt core running within the Dagster framework to apply transformations on new data in Timescale * Python scripts orchestrated by Dagster to get data from APIs. Originally wanted to try dltHub but ended up just writing my own scripts using requests (probably not ideal) * Monitoring/notifications via Slack app integration (originally was using [ntfy.sh](http://ntfy.sh) for quick and dirty SNS topic-like notifications, getting Slack approval was challenging) * Dockerized local development using the pre-built Timescale and Postgres Docker images + the same custom Dockerfile I use for Dagster production deployments to keep things as simple as possible.Data is synced from Postgres every 4 hours and daily for the APIs as that's essentially all that's required by our business. The Postgres sync with Sling runs incrementally and is complete in about 20 minutes, which is not optimized by any means but is sufficient for our purposes. For context, our entire source database was only about 330GB and I wasn't replicating the entire thing.Writing YAML for Sling and later for dbt was a huge time slog for 100+ source tables; I leveraged an AI tool (Claude) to help generate a lot of that code after manually building some of the transformation models myself. Bonus to this is it was the generated YAML was pretty consistent for common columns like `created_at` or `_sling_loaded_at` audit columns.I am the lone developer and maintainer of this project -- most people on my team are unaware that I'm even working on a project like this, let alone what its purpose might be. It has been a wild and frustrating ride at times without many others to turn to for help, but it's been a great learning experience as well. Throughout the development, I tried to stress simplicity, modularity, and ease of maintenance as much as possible. Once a larger team becomes available to support something like this, you can make different decisions like moving your data replication tasks to something like Fivetran or using a real data warehouse like Snowflake (again, budget constraints for us).~~Best of luck to you!~~ Edit: I reread the question and realized this is hypothetical but best of luck if this is ever you in the future all the same! Also I feel like my stack is pretty interchangeable with SQL Server as the source, just use different connectors with Sling (I believe SQL Server is supported).",

I agree with the comments about consulting mostly, but I doubt they would put you on client work or at least throw you to the wolves like they would with an employee. Having worked both for telcos and consulting, I will give you some thoughts:Consulting: you will probably work on one or a few projects. They are looking for prospects to hire when you graduate so it's like an extended evaluation. Consulting is good because you get exposure to different industries and projects, so you learn skills and approaches you might not pick up working elsewhere. One other thing that's maybe overlooked is that you learn how to sell and explain your work, which is valuable in companies later when you need to justify a project or hype it up beyond just explaining the technical side. Working there as an employee though can be grueling not just because of the hours, but because you need to build your career often with little help. They assign you to some client and expect you to pick up the skills you need. They usually do give you some support with a mentor role, but they might be good or just suck since they are assigned. So it can be a stressful experience depending on your personality and resiliency.Telcos: this is a good option because you will get exposure to a lot of processes with a lot of data flowing. It's mostly structured though, but really teaches you how to deal with high volumes. If we are talking a bigger telco like AT&T or whatever then they tend to have all the tools and applications so you aren't looking at a kludged together mess like in some other companies. There is data stored around all the different processes that go on in a telco, so while the product isn't the data platform, it's probably as close as you are going to get. There is usually some pretty high-level analytics work going on as well around customer retention and upsell.",

Dagster does the orchestration for me, as implied, then dbt does transformations after data has landed in Timescale, also orchestrated by Dagster.I can't really speak to how the performance would be with loading data into Snowflake via Sling, but it backfilled about 300GB of data on the initial run in under 6 hours and every 4 hour incremental loads take around 20 minutes (though this could probably be optimized much further). All hosted on ECS Fargate containers.If we had no budget constraints, I'd probably look at a SaaS offering to do the extract and load for me, like Fivetran or equivalent.",

        "body": "If we’re talking about the future of data engineering, it’s worth first asking: *why does it exist at all?*Originally, businesses needed someone to get them data for decision-making. First came BI developers/ETL engineers, they built warehouses and reports so analysts could do their work. Later, data analysts became more self-serve and focused on interpreting the past. Then data science took off, using that historical data to predict the future.Both analysts and scientists quickly ran into the same problem: clean, reliable, well-structured data was hard to come by. That’s when the modern data engineer role emerged, not just to build infra, but to make data usable at scale.Early DE work was infra-heavy, but as platforms matured (Databricks, GCP, Azure, Snowflake), more of the plumbing became automated. That doesn’t mean the job is going away, it means the focus shifts. You spend less time reinventing connectors and clusters, more time on things like modeling, scalability, governance, security, cost optimization, and integrating multiple data sources into a coherent system.This is also where analytics engineers come in, they work closer to the business, doing a lot of SQL/dbt modeling and BI integration. In small teams, AEs might cover most data needs; in bigger orgs, DEs still handle the scale, complexity, streaming, and compliance side.If anything, the “easy” DE tasks are disappearing, which makes deep skills more valuable:* Real-time pipelines (Kafka, Pub/Sub, Flink)* Data contracts, governance, compliance* Multi-cloud / cross-platform integration* ML data pipelines & feature stores* Performance and cost tuning at scaleI wouldn’t say DE is shrinking, it’s just changing shape. The safest way to future-proof yourself is to stay close to both the business context *and* the technical challenges. Platforms will keep automating, but stitching them together, governing them, and making them serve the business well? That’s still human work.",

You’re not chasing prestige—you’re chasing consistency. Platforms like DataCamp have career tracks that walk you through Python, Airflow, Spark, dbt, cloud, and testing *with* hands-on projects baked in. That kind of setup might be just what you need.# What to focus on next:Sounds like you’re solid on Python, Airflow basics, and batch stuff. If you want to move from “I adapt what’s already built” to “I build and improve,” aim for:* **Advanced Airflow** (custom operators, sensors, etc.)* **dbt** (great for modeling, testing, and habits that scale)* **CI/CD** (even lightweight GitHub Actions can go a long way)* **Cloud skills** (pick one—AWS, GCP, whatever your team might grow into)* **Streaming with Kafka** (even small local projects help)# Make it stick:If you tend to fall off self-paced stuff (totally fair), give yourself some structure without burning out:* Pick one portfolio project and let that guide your learning.* Show up at the same time every day—even 30 mins counts.* Use tools that track streaks (DataCamp, GitHub commits).* Find a learning buddy or join a Discord to stay accountable.# Are certs worth it?Only if they *help you finish*. If a nanodegree or structured program keeps you going, it’s 100% worth it. Just avoid collecting shiny badges without building anything. One finished track with a solid portfolio project beats 10 abandoned ones.",

Couple that with the trend of leaving jobs every 18-24 months, and you never really acquire any domain knowledge, you just bounce around doing the same technical thing.The solution? First, identify someone who knows what you want to know. There is always \"that guy\". Talk to him (or her) and just ask questions.

With no data engineers and a single analyst, there is limited investment in the data function (based on the provided information). Given the connector choice, maybe you report to finance? Regardless, it's one thing to get the data from point A to point B, it's another to ensure the data is correct. For example, what happens if they change the configuration of Salesforce objects? How will you handle that downstream?I say the above to warn of the trap of the business thinking that increased access to data easily results in more data utilization.",

A transaction is intended to be a single large block of rows. To wit contention is intended to be low.Taken together, that you think iceberg is a transactional database is your main problem. The design desire of iceberg is to be able to have atomic writes to disk from ephemeral stateless writers for the purpose of retaining and accessing large amounts of data for long periods of time. Any alternative not involving optimistic concurrency necessarily involves a single stateful system that needs to be on for as long as the data needs to be accessible which is absurdly dumb and massively expensive. The only reason databases and database servers exist is to literally provide a lock. To the degree you can avoid locks you can cut massive cost by making the computer independent of the retention process. Don’t get me wrong iceberg is very rough around the edges and leaves a lot to be desired but that you neither understand why it exists or what it’s good for wouldn’t be something I’d publish this widely on the internet.",

        "body": "The author continues their absolutely-detached-from-reality rant against Iceberg. They've essentially looked at a sledgehammer and decided that it is 'not a serious tool' because it requires more effort, is more unwieldy, and lacks a claw compared to a regular hammer.The article indicates it is a 21 minute read, so I'm going to be somewhat brief here, but essentially other than various truisms the entire thing can be broken down. The article is also quite sarcastic and derogatory, which gives me the impression that the author is more interested in puffing themselves up than earnestly engaging with the problem space.I'll pick a few things that are emblematic of the disconnect between the author's basis for criticism and what iceberg is actually for.---> It also means that the overhead of each file is large (in the order of 1KB).Iceberg (and DeltaLake/Hudi, I'll not mention again) is intended for storing many gigabytes to terabytes and petabytes of data in a given 'table' -- a few KB of overhead is going to be less than 0.001% of the data you're actually reading or writing. You'll likely have more overhead within the parquet files themselves if they've been split relatively small, and your choice of compression algorithm is going to have orders of magnitude more impact.> Putting the burden on the clientThe entire point of the base layer of 'lakehouse' implementations is to decouple storage from the compute. That is: *there is no server* to even consider to be 'putting the burden on the client'. You may as well complain that trains have to run on rails.> If clients need to write manifest lists that point at all Manifest Files - we have already leaked the location of every single S3 file worth stealingThe path to an S3 file is not sensitive data, it is protected through access control to the bucket. You may as well complain that clients connecting to databases leaks the IP of the database.Iceberg is not intended to solve row-level security for you in the same way that parquet does not solve row level security. It simply isn't in the scope of what it is trying to solve, because it isn't seeking to replace a database.> Did we not learn in CS 101 that if you need O(n) operations to append to a list, you are probably doing something wrong?This section completely ignores something that the author *should* know quite well, that sometimes you exchange processing time for space consumption. For metadata files the repeated data is utterly insignificant compared to all the other reads and writes that are happening, but because we're dealing with remote storage accessed over a network then when reading it is much more efficient to retrieve a single larger block of data than make many individual requests.In fact the author later whinges that a query has to do sequential 2 metadata reads to locate the parquet files it needs - so they *do* understand the benefit of compacting data together, but they just choose to ignore that in this instance so that they can heap more derision on Iceberg.> Optimistic Concurrency - Why it does not work! ... is there ever a point to optimistic concurrency control? ... In Iceberg, two concurrent writes to a table will ALWAYS be in conflict A section in which the author almost realises they may be lacking some perspective, but plows on ahead anyway.First of all, Iceberg is considered about the overall efficiency for readers and writers that are operating in completely isolated processing environments, and when writing data they are going to be writing a *lot* of data and it may take a relatively long time (seconds to minutes). A complete pessimistic lock would prevent concurrent non-conflicting writes, which means you could only ever effectively have one writer to a table, which would be an unnecessary restricting if you have pure-append ingestion processes, and pure-append ingestion processes are very common in lake/lakehouse implementations.And yes, you can have non-conflicting *data* writes even if the metadata writes are conflicting, but as I've mentioned in here the metadata is insignificant compared to the data in intended use cases. Getting a writer to rewrite even a 1MB metadata file is a significantly better tradeoff than having them sit idle for many seconds to minutes, when their compute runtime is costing you money. And that's if they even get a conflict - subsecond timings on completion of concurrent writes is pretty rare for the intended use cases.> \"Tables grow large by being written to, they grow really large by being written to frequently\".Complete bullshit. My largest tables are either full snapshots taken periodically from sources, or they use streaming ingestion with buffered writes. In fact streaming ingestion is directly a use-case for optimistic concurrency - each partition can have a separate writer and they can all write data concurrently and commit periodically.> Did I mention that 1000 commits/sec is a pathetic number if you are appending rows to table?Absolutely unhinged criticism. The target format is parquet and the default row group size for writers is on the order of 100k to 1M rows. To hit a required 1k commits/sec you'd be looking at ingesting >100M rows/sec and 100GB/sec of *compressed* data while having each individual parquet file be committed one-by-one with a thousand independent writing processes.What you would *actually* do is have a partitioned writer that has 1000 concurrent parquet writes, and it commits once per second.

For instance, I add a new column and want to backdate the values to what they were when the data came in, so ideally want to blow away the type II table and rebuild with all the history. You can't easily do that unless you use snapshots on source data, which is what we ended up doing. Most dbt literature of actual snapshot implementation in real life situations basically said use snapshots as sources to read from. Once we did that and handled type II SCD's ourselves by interpreting the dbt snapshots, our problems went away.",

Havent seen anything that receives a query from an external tool, interject then routes it to different warehouses. It would have to also route the resultsets back to the client so not sure how that will work.Part of the Snowflakes major appeal is the security and scalibility so unless the solution runs fully within Snowflake, the security may be an issue for some as well support if things stop working.I guess hard to say w/o knowing how it is architected.",

But it allow your to grow, avoid potential vendor locking, reduce DW cost by doing preaggregation yourself before loading it in redshift, etc, etc. But all of this requires a lot of effort? Which might be slowing you down to achieving you company goals. If you have a big enough data team it make sense, if you are pretty small the loading directly to redshift is very appealing.You’ll always have the possibility to offload the data from redshift to s3 in the futur if that’s needed but you won’t shoot yourself in the foot and not deliver anything for the first 6 months.In terms of pricing, you are analyzing storage cost which shouldn’t be a factor imo. Yes storage is way cheaper in s3. But the size of data you have in SAP isn’t probably not that big. You need to define that first. For example I don’t see a world where you have a terabyte of data to load from SAP to redshift. A terabyte of text files is a LOT of data for things that are entered manually or mostly in SAP. Now let’s say you have a terabyte of data because your company has a lot there (which you probably don’t) then having the storage cost in redshift would be something are 25$ per month for the hole data set. Our conversation here cost more than that. Depending on type of s3 storage you might save a lot but storage is negligible for small datasets.The real DW cost is compute, and that needs to be considered. I know the business wants SAP and ALL other sources, but you should chunk this a lot so you endup delivering things in small chunks. Everyone wants everything yesterday but that’s not how things work. Start with SAP but not all, the most relevant concepts because there’s probably a lot of tables there to sync, clean, transform to make the data usable. The goal of you DW is to make data usable but also to get a single source of truth. If you just load raw data in and let business build dashboard on top of the raw data I can tell you this is going to be a mess in 2 months. Start small, get the table requirements that allow you to clean the data, make the data available, then repeat.To go back on pricing, if for example you think that you have A LOT of data multiple terabytes. And that the storage cost will be around 1000$ a month because you have 40 terabytes to load and that can be an issue, then I can assure you, you won’t like the Fivetran Bill. If you need to think about the storage cost, then you need to rearchitect this because Fivetran is not the option you are looking for. It’s very good to load data quickly. It gets insanely expensive when you start to really use it. Most companies won’t have issue with fivetran cost because most company don’t have a lot of data.Good luck",

See correct config to save processing and make it write faster, as no retention period. You may also apply clustering rules here.Then I would ask, do you really need redshift? I know it exists and basically how it works but never worked since I mostly only move data from staging area to silver and gold areas in S3, using again Delta/iceberg, leaving data with dimensional modeling as needed by business.I generally use Databricks/snowflake to process it,but so far I know, you can also use Glue for it.Delta/iceberg have acid properties/time travel/and others that can be selected and designed as your need, replicating redshift pros.If it is enough, you totally save redshift costs, and got a simpler arch in only one place. If you really need redshift you send only totally needed tables there. And allow silver/gold tables being connected to other tools in future.I am totally opened to comments here and up to suggestions if it works or not.",

Be transparent about costs, but still go with it. More maintainable means you can add more features, fix breakages faster, and have fewer breakages. Your end users would vastly prefer that you don't have outages on critical delivery days, your boss will prefer that you get this finished and off your plate to work on the next thing, your successors will prefer an easier onboarding, and you will look better throughout.

But for now, we use only 50-60 tables, it’s just that we don’t know what tables will we use exactly in the future based on the use cases. For now the size of the data is very less like max 50gb worth 10 years of data.For this much data, direct redshift would be ideal. But considering the future, if data size increases, it will be a problem. Although data honestly wouldn’t spike much. Coming to your point where if redshift is even needed: yes I feel so because we currently have tableau connected directly to sap where the devs created views which consume a lot of compute making dashboards slow. If we use s3 tables, we will have to use Athena for querying and connect that to tableau, and we have a lot of complex queries/views built on top. I don’t think it’s a good solution to use Athena as our query engine.And I am the only DE here so it will be difficult for me to write code for every table and it’s upsert logic if it lands in s3 first. And it’s really too much dependency on me for every new table. Fivetran makes it easy to load data and also handles auto schema changes. But again, it’s expensive.Hence I am at cross roads.",

For example, all the gold tables for the financial analysts go in the schema `finance`.This is not a dogma, maybe your context needs to have a specific strongly discriminating qualifier first which could go against the rule 3.

If you can figure it out with 20 more minutes, take the 20 minutes to figure it out ffs.If he says you need to find a better balance, then change what you're doing. If you're asking for help three times a day, dial it down to 1 time a day. Ask about less than half of what you're currently asking for help on, and iterate from there. If he still gives you the feedback that you need to ask for help less, don't ask for his help at all for a few weeks to months.

Going the other way is harder.That said, if the data role is solid (e.g. real PySpark work, solid infra, not just moving CSVs to S3), and you want to be in that space long term, it’s not a bad move.But full stack gives you more flexibility and job security early on.

It only gets repetitive if the setup is already done and you’re just maintaining pipelines (that's the only thing that might get boring after a certain time)DE is important for AI, sure, but unless the company is seriously building AI products, that won’t matter much. Most just want dashboards or plug GPT into a chatbot. AI is nowhere close to replacing good engineers. It can speed up parts of the work, but it’s not making the hard decisions or owning the system when things break. So don’t pick based on hype.

The compiled jobs run fast but the program, UI, everything else is glitchy and slow- support is downright awful. Like multiple weeks to eventually just get told 'can you enter a bug report' (this happened 3 times in 2 years)- credentials can't be easily central managed unless you are on cloud and even then it's extremely hacky to do.

But note that it’s kinda nice to have a language that anyone can easily understand and transform data with rather than a specific one. Even more if you are a very small team of 1.Also this is nice , but doesn’t seem manageable by only you. It’s a lot. Also I think you need some really good argument to change something that is currently working (redshift) with something that slower and would do the same thing.

As a data engineer I consider it's part of my job.My concerns about DBT is that it's a simple product but not sealable in the future. Especially doing unit tests is very limited as some column types are not supported making testing some models impossible. With Spark jobs I can fully test queries making sure to handle edge cases properly and it's easier to scale jobs when data volume will grow, with DBT running on GitHub actions runners we are limited in performance and from my point of view it's not a clean way to schedule jobs: no clear monitoring, retry policies etc. like with Airflow for example",

They’re powerful tools, but for most of my early projects, SQL could have solved 90% of my problems faster and more cleanly. SQL is easier to debug, easier to optimize, and much more universal across platforms. If I could go back, I’d master SQL-based transformation first before diving deep into dataframe libraries.That’s why, instead of jumping straight into Docker/Airflow, I’d start with a SQL-centric transformation tool like dbt (or Bruin, which also lets you run Python and handle ingestion). This will teach you the fundamentals of data modeling and pipeline design without the operational complexity of containers and schedulers. Since you already use Tableau, learning the “one step before the dashboard” will make the whole puzzle click.Another big lesson: don’t get lost in technical rabbit holes. The fastest way to grow is to chase the highest-impact business problems, things that save your team time, increase accuracy, or unlock new capabilities. If you focus there, you’ll naturally pick up the right technical skills along the way.Also, don’t work in isolation. Get your code reviewed, and review others’ work. You’ll learn more from those reviews than from most courses.If I were mapping a path for you, it’d be:1. Master SQL + data modeling (dbt/Bruin/SQLMesh)2. Add Python tasks in the pipeline only when needed3. Develop a tool in Streamlit and deploy it for the use of business team4. Develop an ML model, and deploy it.You’ll hit Docker and Airflow eventually, but starting with modeling skills will make everything else much easier.",

If that’s the case, there’s something missing between the REST API and Pulsar to periodically poll the API and produce topics for Pulsar to ingest (that may be in the microservices). However, from both a compliance and support perspective, it’s good practice to retain a “raw” copy of the data on ingestion so you have a recovery/fallback point that can also be used for audit and lineage purposes, especially if your source doesn’t retain data itself. I’m a bit unclear on how your PM role fits in the mix and where your engineers are, but speaking as someone who has platform strategy responsibilities, I would recommend focusing on confirming the required/desired business and tech capabilities, then working with your engineering leads to determine the right tooling to fit and the appropriate design. Good luck!",

My understanding is that Pulsar is a push-based publish-subscribe model (like if you subscribed to someone’s Substack email newsletter). You therefore need a translation interface to perform the pull from the API and then publish it in the appropriate stream or message queue format to Pulsar. You may need something similar between Pulsar and Ceph as well; I’m not familiar enough with Pulsar to say. Unless your API fetcher has the ability to also write to object storage, your first point of storage appears to be the post-Pulsar Ceph so would be there. Ideally you want to create that archive copy as close to the source as possible, so it’s determining where the storage opportunities are in your flow. I’ve not heard of Aerospike before but a quick skim doesn’t look like it’s for this requirement. I asked about the role as it sounded like you were scoped to design the solution, which engineers tend to get a bit twitchy about PMs/POs doing :grinning_face_with_sweat:. But understanding how it works so you can help steer/prioritise is a whole ‘nother thing of course. SInterestingly though, my place has this type of architecture managed by an “integration services” dept and my data engineering crew are downstream from that… unsure if that’s common across companies.",

We are about to roll out Debezium event collector on ingestr as well, which could help you consume them from the broker and land on Snowflake.Another alternative could be openflow maybe?

Since you’re using Cloud Run, any stdout/stderr should be captured in Cloud Logging (which gives you access to Log Explorer & Cloud Monitoring for free). If you only want to track specific numeric values, then you can log them specifically in Cloud Monitoring.2. Alternatively, after standardising your event log format/structure, you can continue to export it to GCS and set up a Data Transfer Service to BigQuery. Or, if you want to continue using Postgres, you can setup a Cloud Function or Cloud Run Job (triggered by GCS) to load the data accordingly.",

That just means with ELT get the data loaded into the database before transforming it.

        "body": "ETL vs ELT is a form of shorthand.Rather than neatly dividing data processing into two types; it encourages you to think about the steps.Extraction, is typically \"given\". You're generally bound by the transfer rates of the source and they provide the data in whatever format they choose. It's always going to come first.Loading, is a more variable step. You're still bound by the properties of the target storage. But since you choose what you're writing you have some more control of the process.Transformation is extremely variable. You usually have a lot of freedom in deciding how you transform the source data into target data. That includes breaking up the transformation into multiple steps.Moving from ETL to ELT is more about breaking up the T than it is about actually saving it to the end. The actual process is typically more like ET1L1T2L2T3L3...T1 is often limited to very simple transformations; de-duping and some light error checking is common. Then it gets written to disk in \"raw form\". We keep this work light so it can be fast and reliable. Since real systems have errors, we want to keep this simple so we minimize the chance of dropping data.T2 typically cleans the data. That typically takes more work since we're looking at the data more carefully and changing it more. We then write that to disk too since there are many different things we might do next.T3+ are typically curation steps that answer specific business questions. They can be very expensive to calculate (there are often dozens of JOINS going many layers deep) and they often drop data (often for speed or security) so we want to keep those older versions too. These final versions also get stored so the business users can access them quickly.None of this makes much sense in small systems. They're techniques that are used in \"big data\". I would practice the basic tools (SQL, Spark, Python, etc) and supplement that by reading case studies on data deployments. That's where you'll see the real implementations and it's never as clean as ETL vs ELT.",

The free version is fine, but most of the paid options are directly supported with any of the three free alternatives:* Visual Studio Community Edition + SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT)* Visual Studio Code + SQL Server and SQL Server Projects extension* SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)SSDT allows for visually designing tables, designing databases prior to deploying, push-button deployment and deployment profiles, and comparing/visualizing existing SQL Server/Azure SQL/Azure Synapse instances.VSCode with SQL Server and SQL Server Projects extension does the same.SSMS provides the ability to generate ERDs on the fly and save them as files or to the database directly based on objects that are already setup in the database.I currently don't have a dedicate SQL pool instance running at the moment to test on, but I believe all of these options work with Azure Synapse Dedicated Pools. I have no experience with Azure Synapse Serverless so I can't say either way.Another option would be looking at RedGate tooling, which is my go-to for commercially licensed support for any of Microsoft's database technology. Nothing really compares to it and their tooling is extremely mature and has more features than you could ever use.",

It has always been a manual effort to get good quality business information about the data. It is almost a data project unto itself.This however is just the start. You will probably want to document lineage, transformation, quality, etc. Those are all needed and highly helpful but take time and effort to establish.

Data engineering requirements for us are about compliance and quality - automated quality checks, integrity checks, matching and joining datasets across domains. Elsewhere in the power sector you'll see a lot more streaming data as folks are trying to monitor the output of power stations and plants and turbines - you're basically checking to make sure everything works safely.

I worked as a chef for 10 years and before that in media and now I transitioned to programming.One thing that was worth it from the bootcamp that helped me a lot was the access to mentors. I have been thinking that it is a shame that a lot of people pay so much money just to access to a weekly 30 min call with a mentor (sometimes even less). The material to learn is already online with even well structured tutorials or learning path, but free mentoring options are missing.I have been planning for quite some time to build a website in which programmers and other professionals can offer free mentoring options for people who are learning or starting. It doesn’t have to be for a long time or long sessions but some guidance or even code review could work. Would you be open to help me build this project? Would anybody be interested in something like this? Does a similar platform exist? It has to be completely free of charge (kind of like freecodecamp but for mentoring)",

I didnt knew like 3 methods it was using or what a debounced search actually is, so my next 3 prompts where asking the AI to explain what a debounced search is and how the code it suggested actually works.

Just realize that you’re not the only one who is making this mistake, there’s an entire generation of students who are going to do the same thing and the majority of them aren’t going to bother fixing it, hit their first technical and realize they cheated themselves out of a job and now they have tens of thousands in debt.I would take a semester off or check to see if you can do a personal project course. I’d pick up a project like a path finding visualizer, sudoku solver, something advanced in terms of DSA. Commit yourself to that project 100% and then make a vow to never use AI again, at least until you’re a couple of years into your job and your management is making you use it.Good luck",

Knowing what to do in all the interviews I have done is easiest to discover if I have the candidate tell me about a business they tried to do, a side gig they did, or frankly something they created on their own. If I have a candidate who was just good at doing the task directed of them, they are usually a “do not hire”…Keep taking the classes and they will give you the tools.

You probably have no interest in how dating websites work etc. That is the likely reason you are not excited about it.Pick a subject you enjoy in real life, like Football, cooking, rugby, gaming, etc. Then think of a little idea. Take football for example, you could build a simple hard coded Stadium displayer. Which shows you the top 10 largest stadiums in the world. It can then display facts about each stadium. Keep it real simple, nothing fancy. Make sure you write the project idea down too and break it up into small objectives.For example:* Create array of hard coded data* Create stadium card to display name, image, stats like capacity, facts like famous matches played thereThen once you have a basic version, have a look at it and see what to improve. Things like add a database, authentication, better styles, etc.If you don’t relate programming to what you are actually passionate about and enjoy then you’ll probably just eventually drop it.The people you see that are passionate about programming and love it are actually passionate about the area they’re building in rather than the idea of programming itself.",

Be on top of all your assignments and when you have nothing that needs to be done just code shit up or get ahead of the readings. Don't leave before 5, the more you code the easier it is. You can do leet code, making your own app, it doesn't really matter, what matters is you are staring at code so your brain gets better at it.If you do this you will have a bunch of free time and be ahead of everyone. If you don't do this you will be in a rush all the time and that SUCKS. Luckily I got this advice early so I only did like 1 or 2 all nighters in my entire degree.Also make friends with your tutors and ask questions, it might take a few months but figure out who the smartest people in the year are and try and get into their study groups.Also exercise. You will probably be able to take advantage of free classes at the gym and it does wonders for your mental health. To clarify join the classes as they will teach you how to exercise correctly, don't try and figure it out on your own.If you want to get a partner / find a fun social group join the evening student dance classes. There's usually like salsa or something. If you have some social anxiety this will help MASSIVELY!If you want to code in the evenings too see if there's some kind of competitive programming stuff like capture the flag teams. You get to travel on them and it's a pretty wild experience. You will also become friends with more experienced programmers who can give you great advice.Just to highlight again, 9 to 5 every week day you are studying.Good luck and have fun!",

I don't know the libraries I should use. So, I let the LLM give me ideas and eventually settled on Python as the language.I've got a 2D array that is supposed to color a cube I'm having the LLM draw. However, it doesn't understand how to associate that 2D array with parts of the cube. It gets it upside down or backwards. I feed it screenshots, and it still can't figure out what's going on. It keeps proclaiming \"this will fix it\" and makes some random changes.Having said that, I did get it to work, eventually. If I had to do it on my own, I would probably have never started. It seemed too daunting, that I had to learn too many new things. So, it got me started, and while I was frustrated at times, it got me a lot closer to finishing than I would have done just by myself.It's the first coding project I've completed on my own since, well, almost ever.I think someone who knows NOTHING only builds really small stuff or has it solve homework problems. I can't imagine they get a real app working.Those who think AI will take over and don't want to learn programming should try it out. It's still far from easy to use, and you'd think it would be easier.",

It avoids the \"don't know what I don't know\" problem beginners face when they try to google things often.It's long-form content that's generally not shat out quickly for engagement/profit (ask technical book writers how much they made from their work, most will say not much) and generally with technical books the quality of the information will be what determines how well-regarded it becomes. Also, contents, index, bibliography etc. You don't necessarily get those with other media.Physical books?

I also did the website redesign (although I was building pages based off wireframes and a spec written by someone else, I'm not a graphical person). About a week after the launch the whole company went into administration, so no one really ever got to use my new website.It was a small multinational and I was working out of their HQ. The web team was basically only 2 of us, and my boss spent most of his time working on the ecommerce site, so I got a huge amount of freedom to learn and try new things.

Or maybe the senior devs are swamped, and you have no idea what to do. Some jobs are not well-thought out. Like they forgot to get you a laptop so you sit for a while. The typical first few days (if there's no bootcamp) is to get your laptop set up and maybe install the main app if there is one. You begin to attend meetings, and maybe start looking at the code base. You'll probably be introduced to some task management system like Jira, maybe the company Wiki, some way to deploy your code, some way to test, etc.I mean, that's just an approximate guess. Could be something else depending on how well run the company is. You might get lots of help or you might be left to fend for yourself. Probably somewhere in between.",

He also has various startups and makes custom web apps for businesses in our area. At the beginning I mainly just reviewed the code for the court app. It was on a much older version of Angular so he had me begin rewriting the entire app in the latest version of angular which accelerated my learning exponentially. Then soon after a new client came in requesting a custom web application for his business and my employer handed it all to me. So I have spent most of my time meeting with that client, understanding his data and building a web app from scratch. It is now in production so now I implement feature request or fix bugs. I also will work on various projects he has with other clients, updating old code or adding new features. We also do IT for the court house and 911 center so I go on site every once in a while and fix network or equipment issues. It is just me and my employer there are no other employees except some Ukrainian guy that doesn’t live here that does some free lance work for him. I am extremely fortunate to find myself in the position I am in and to my knowledge this is not common in the programming world. I am terrified of the day I have to apply for a job at a company with steep competition and strict practices.",

This website doesn't deal with finding a job, but is great for knowing \\_what\\_ to learn in many technologies and career paths: [https://roadmap.sh/python](https://roadmap.sh/python) . If you don't have direction, that gives you it. Also join smaller online communities where daily discussions happen, so you can see not only what's in the tutorials and curated content, but how things work day-to-day.Skill itself is not enough to find a job. Yes, the market is much tougher than it was 5 years ago, but programming is still the right choice if you have the brains for it. It's going to take hard work to get a job, but the value/effort ratio is much higher than that for other jobs. The best case scenario is to know someone that can introduce you to the right company: trust and a feeling of community are valuable to companies that know what's good for them. So see if you, your family, or your friends know someone like that. Even if they don't have an opening, they may introduce you to further connections of theirs. Listen to their advice and don't take anything for granted.If you can't find that person, it's time to polish your CV and hit the job boards. If you're not at all comfortable with your skill level, aim for \\*\\*PAID\\*\\* internships. You might need to apply to hundreds of jobs. It's going to feel like a slog, but it's worth it. Be respectful, definitely don't let AI write your application or emails, the lack of effort is noticed. Many companies won't notice a presence of effort either, but you're better off without them. When you see a company you really like, try to prototype an open source project in the same domain as their product, and put it in the application. Best case scenario they see the effort and dedication, and they'll know you can be valuable to them, worst case scenario you have one more small project in your portfolio for the next company you apply to. There was a period where being disruptive and extra casual gave you a leg up, we're no longer in that period: be respectful (don't confuse this with submissive) and professional. Remember the people on the other side are people too, and if you can make their life easier by being honest and not making the interview/email tough for them, they're more likely to want you as a team mate.Best of luck, and if you have any more questions feel free to ask.",

Cause last I checked (and I check regularly, and with the latest available models), AI falls apart completely with any more complex, custom logic or any bespoke code, which is also where the craftsmanship would shine anyway.I have no problem to use AI for boilerplate, derivative code that's nothing more but busywork, and for parts that require any finesse whatsoever, AI is just a waste of time anyway. AI is simple - the more predictable the next line is, the better it will guess it. Any actually interesting code is not easy to guess, that's why AI based on the current technology fails and will fail by definition.",

So I can speed up my productivity too, you know.I tried using AIs to handle basic tasks for me when everyone started saying that AI would ruin programmers' lives and produce outdated, broken, and bug-ridden code. Yeah, it might be faster because some parts are already done and just need tweaking, but that works for small scripts since they are simple and easy to track and fix. However, it's impossible for an AI to create a full app exactly as you want because you can't specify all the details. There will always be things you do through pure automation simply because you're used to coding.Last time I asked an AI to write a server.js to run express, and it just didn’t work. I had to write everything again lol (by writing everything again, I mean going to my GitHub and copying and pasting my last server.js, which was also copy-pasted from my previous project).So no, AI does not destroy programming. There are no AI writing apps on demand, you could use something like Copilot, but it won't make a big difference unless you're doing repetitive coding. And if you are doing that, you're probably coding in the wrong way.People also talk about AI replacing artists, but artists are still working because AI can do some things to represent your ideas. However, it will never capture everything the way you want because your ideas need a brain with empathy to understand what you truly mean and what you want to do it as you wish. An AI can only replicate what you do, and all the details you don't provide, the AI will just do whatever it wants.You can tell an artist, \"I want my character to be like Jhon Wick,\" and they will take your ideas and adapt them to fit Jhon Wick vibes, while an AI will probably do Jhon Wick and just add some wonky details on top of it.",

If you know HTML and CSS you could skip that part of course and directly start with Javascript. They also have projects you have to do which start with stuff like Rock Paper Scissors and you end with a project at the end of the course where you have to build a full stack Social Network.

This goes for programming too. Learn a language, try a new framework, experiment with a design patterns. You'll never have as much free time and energy as you do now while you're young - use it",

There are all kinds of ways to solve a problem, but programming includes a required strategy. You must break large problems into smaller, more approachable, chunks.You also have to be able to define the problem explicitly. No relying on another human to intuit your intent. Instructions much be clear and unambiguous. There's a TikTok going around showing a teacher following written instructions to construct a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. With predictably comical results. Most humans fail this, at least the first go. Programmers don't.Finally, and this is a rare skill indeed, you must be able to diagnose problems. If a program runs first go, great. However, it's debugging where learning really happens. Diagnostics, probably even more than solving the initial problem presented, is a valuable life skill.",

Sit down with pencil and paper and start from there. Not from the code. Start from the problem, break it down, solve it *your* way, don't even think about programming.

Think what your starting with and what you want to end up with. Then, go from the end to the beginning. For example, if I want to write a function that calculates the cumulative age of all the users of the system, the input is the user list, and the output is a number. Then, I know that number needs to be a sum of each age of each user. So, I need to get user age from user entry. So, I need to compare their birth date with current date. You can probably write a function for each of these steps, and stitch them together. Not sure if that helps at this stage, but the idea might come in handy.",

        "body": "Honestly, there is no such thing as a \"programmer's mindset\". That's a myth and a general excuse for people too lazy to invest the necessary effort, discipline, persistence, diligence, and work to learn.There are things that can make learning easier, such as being a logically inclined person, but even that can be improved and learned.I am a firm believer that most (not all) people can actually learn programming to a certain degree. They won't all be able to reach a professional level, but they can definitely learn it.After all, programming is just creating and translating steps to solve a problem in such a way that the computer can execute these steps.We humans solve problems all day long, just we mostly don't even notice it as it is intrinsic. We work in steps every single second of the day, but we don't realize it.Learning programming is learning to consciously devise steps, to utilize our intrinsic ability to think in steps consciously.Most new learners focus way too much on the *code*, on the *implementation* in a *programming language*, which is only the last part of the process. Sure, it is absolutely necessary to learn a *programming language*, but after all this is just very limited vocabulary and very simple grammar.The real part of programming happens way before the code. It is the process of analyzing, breaking apart problems/tasks and solving them in sequences of discrete steps (again, a skill that we generally are intrinsically good with) that *then* can be *implemented* in any programming language.Here is also the problem with most tutorials and with many, even high quality courses: they focus too much on the code and too little on the design, on guiding the learner to devise the solutions.When I started out with programming, there were no tutorials. There was no internet. There were barely any knowledgeable people in my (rural) area. It was way back in the first half of the 1980s in the advent of the \"home computers\" (Commodore ViC20, C64, BBC micro, Acorn, Amstrad CPC-464, etc.). All I had was the BASIC (programming language) manual that came with my computer and a lot of curiosity. A bit later, we had some \"programming\" lessons (in double quotes because it was more a joke than anything serious) at school - one lesson per week where 8 people were crammed around 4 Apple II Europlus computers where we initially learnt AppleSoft Basic and later UCSD Pascal. Our teacher made us draw flow charts before we were even allowed anywhere near the computer. This seriously helped. Using a visual representation of the steps to solve our tasks made us think more about the actual steps than about their *implementation* in a programming language.Flow charts, Nassi-Shneiderman charts, bulleted lists, pseudo-code, all of these help and are somewhat underrepresented in modern computer learning. If people started out learning these for short time, they would learn much easier and much faster as most learners don't fail at the *languages*, but fail on *programming*.The above is also the reason Harvard chose to start with *Scratch* for their famous CS50 course. It is a visual programming language (in the style of Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams) that lets the learners focus on the *algorithm* on the *steps* instead of on an actual *programming language* with its keywords and grammar. Yes, Scratch comes across as childish because after all it was designed by the MIT to teach young kids programming, but that is actually the biggest advantage of it. Way too many people dismiss Scratch as childish and useless, yet, had they invested a couple hours with it, they would have seen its value.Way too many posts here are in the tone of \"I've learnt programming language X, Y, and Z, but still cannot program\". Why? Because they all focused on the wrong thing. They focused on the *implementation*, on the *end product*, on the completed car, instead of focusing on the *design process, the considerations, the decisions* that ultimately *lead* to the *implementations*.Similarly, way too many people claim \"they can *read and understand* code, but not *write* it\". Similarly, just because one can *read and understand* novels it doesn't automatically enable them to *write* meaningful, comprehensive, fully developed ones.Then, we have the \"I've watched X tutorials, read Y books, but cannot program\" people. Yes, sure, you know the theory, but you have never applied your skills in practice. This is like sitting in the desert and watching countless Olympic Splash Diving videos and reading all about it. Unless you get wet and actually do it, everything will just be plain theory and you will fail miserably in practice.Practice is the key. Even a step further: independent practice. It's not *copying* tutorial code after tutorial code. It's sitting down, thinking about something to program and starting working on it, without tutorials, without AI (don't get me started on that for learners), only with one's own work.There is nothing wrong with tutorials for a *certain use case*, e.g. for small, detailed, specific parts where one is unsure, but not for entire projects, e.g. the typical \"how to build X in language Y\" ones. If you need something special, e.g. \"how to work with SQLite tables in Python sqlite3\" or something alike, tutorials, blogs, etc. are perfectly fine.Too many people fall into *tutorial hell* because they don't dare to just simply start working on their own. They are afraid of not achieving their goals, they are afraid of failure, which is the completely wrong mindset for programming. Failure is an important part of learning. It is *gained experience*. It is equally important to know how not to do something as how to do something.Then, we have the \"do projects\" people who think that projects need to be huge, complex beasts and that instantly get discouraged by that thought. Again, wrong mentality. Every single program, no matter how small, is a project. One can only grow with their projects. People need to start small and simple and then work their way up to gradually larger and more complex projects.Then, we have the people who despair because they see the huge amount that is there to learn and only look at the summit, at the vast mountain of learning ahead of them instead of looking at the *path* ahead. One does not climb a mountain by just focusing on the summit. One climbs a mountain by looking at the path ahead and taking one step after the other.Then, we have the ones who declare \"programming isn't for me\" after investing mere *hours* (couple days/weeks) without much effort. Learning programming takes effort and doesn't come natural.*Fast tracking* in programming doesn't work (it actually doesn't work in any trained skill). There is no 0 to 100 in no time. Learning anything is a marathon, not a sprint. Slow and steady wins the race.> Recommend any books, courses, etc. that helped you most.Here is a knack. The most helpful books have actually fairly little to do with *programming*. They are about the *design*, the steps before the actual programs.The typical recommendations for this are:+ \"Think Like A Programmer\" by V. Anton Spraul+ \"The Pragmatic Programmer\" by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas+ \"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\" (SICP) by Ableton, Sussman, Sussman+ \"Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software\" by Charles PetzoldAnd if you're hardcore: \"The Art of Computer Programming\" by Donald Knuth et.al.",

Someone posted a question asking something along the lines of 'What is the most important trait in a programmer?' and the most upvoted answer by a country mile was simply 'Perserverance'. It's euphoric when all the parts of a solution click into place and we get to sit back and watch it fire on all cylinders, but man it's a rough road to get there at times. The ability to stick with it when everythings broken and nothing makes sense is crucial.That leads me nicely onto the second one really - embracing and even celebrating failure. Andrew Huberman is a neuroscientist that has a few podcasts on how learning works, and listening to him explain that it's repeated failure that triggers the learning process really changed my attitude and I wish I'd embraced it sooner. There's a quote along the lines of 'The master has failed more times than the apprentice has even tried', and whilst I probably spread my interests too thinly to master anything in particular, I'm doing my best to fail my way there.",

But to be of any use to anyone, you'll need to break both of those down into separate smaller problems - how to make bolognaise sauce and how to cook spaghetti. The spaghetti is fairly easy (assuming you're using dried) - boil some water, add salt, add the spaghetti and cook for 10 mins. That's a reusable little skill on its own that can be used with loads of dishes, and at some point could be switched out for a version where you make the spaghetti from scratch, without affecting the other part of the recipe - the sauce.For the bolognaise itself , it's a bit more complicated - fry the onion, brown the meat, add the herbs and tomato sauce etc. Again, each of those steps can be broken down into smaller ones. E.g. the onion - how to dice it and how to correctly cook it is a stand alone set of skills that, like cooking pasta, will be something you'll do in loads of recipes.What's any of this got to do with coding, you may ask. Those smaller steps - cooking the pasta, slicing the onion etc - are small reusable (and potentially replaceable) steps that are the equivalent of how you'd break down your code into reusable functions, and they all roll up into that top level overall recipe/application.",

You can draw rectangles & circles simply as well. If you're coding in OOP you can even make those classes. Since there's movement, and things are updating, you'll likely need a core game loop - easy enough to track. We can then break things down further: To make collisions, you need to know when a ball collides with a paddle. To know that, you need to know1) The Ball's position 2) The Ball's direction (it shouldn't collide if it's not travelling toward the paddle)3) The Paddle's position (should be mostly static horizontally speaking)4) The Paddle's direction (either left or right)So when the ball's at a point where it could collide with a paddle, check if that paddle overlaps with the ball, and if the ball is travelling toward it. If so, calculate the reflection angle of the ball, apply that to the ball - maybe keep track of the paddle's travel speed and factor that in somehow. If the ball isn't colliding with anything, just let it travel on - adding the sine & cos of its direction to its position values (scaled by speed). Then we gotta add the player in. Let them control the left paddle with their W & S keys, or Up & Down, or their mouse, either way. If they move them (i.e. keep track of the last position of the mouse, and check whether it moves between updates), apply the movement to the paddle vertically (not horizontally) and scale that by how fast you want the paddle to move.For the computer, either create some decision tree (like, if the current ball direction would cause you to miss, move toward it. Else, move to centre?) up to you. Or just have it go up and down.",

Since you have some idea of how to do this, then do something much simpler than pong.There is always the challenge, when breaking down a problem, that you won't know how to do some step. For example, if you've never worked with interactive graphics, then you'll be stuck at that point, having to learn what to do.Another challenge is how pong deals with the angles that the \"ball\" bounces. Is this something realistic or is there some pseudo-physics going on? It does seem to roughly obey angle of incidence equals angle of reflection. In other words, figuring out the dynamic behavior is hard.I'd probably try something like Snake where you don't have to deal with those kinds of physics.I think, as people break some of these problems down, they still wouldn't be able to code it up. They would still need extensive Googling or asking an LLM to find out answers they need. I doubt some will figure out the math needed if they aren't that strong in math (and even if they are, but are out of practice).",

For example, football, cooking, wrestling, gaming, etc. Take gaming for example, I’ve been playing runescape lately and enjoying that. I thought of an idea where you can select the items you want to upgrade to and it will tell you exactly the costs and items to upgrade it with and give a plan on that.With any project break the idea / problem down to smaller objectives you can easily do. For the above I would do something like:* Hard code the upgrade data and item list for now* Create a function that can calculate the upgrade route of selected items* Display the items that you can select * Display the upgrade route once items are selectedNow always keep your project simple and hard coded, then you can start adding improvements. For example I can connect it to a database, maybe supabase or MySQL or mongodb, etc. I can also connect it to authentication so users can save their ideal upgrade builds, presets, etc.You want to always start small, then incrementally add to it. By adding overtime, that’s when a project gets complex. Even with the complex projects you mentioned, if you break them down into parts they’re actually very simple.You have HTML, CSS and JS knowledge, so I’d recommend you pick up a framework like React / Next.js, Angular or Vue. I’d recommend you try all three with a basic project then you’ll get a feel on which one you’d like to use long term.If you want some project ideas give a shout on what you enjoy and I can hit you back with some ideas. Try not to use AI during this period, use things like documentation, googling, books. Then once you’re comfortable you can use AI for research but don’t heavily rely on it for your code, you want to use it to help you grasp concepts. The key thing for you right now is to learn problem solving while you’re doing these projects.",

In many cases, getting into this kind of work seems to depend more on personal connections than skill alone.Also, to be honest, I’m a bit nervous about entering the field – sometimes people aren’t very understanding when you’re just starting out. They expect you to know everything from day one, which can be a bit discouraging. I really just wish there were more companies or mentors willing to offer guidance in the beginning.That said, I’m very resourceful, and I’m not afraid to dive into documentation, learn new systems, and figure things out on my own. I just feel that having someone point me in the right direction early on would really help. Still, your reply gave me a lot of hope – thank you again.",

You can either run it from the command line or create an executable. The command line is the traditional way, but if you google “make python executable” you can find instructions on making something standalone. This is also a big thing that separates compiled and interpreted languages. Compiled languages (eg. C) are only standalone (kind of, i’m hand waving a lot). Interpreted generally need an intermediate program to run. In this case, the python interpreter.",

        "body": "Your steps and understanding of the software development process aren't quite accurate. The way I'd classify the steps, in general terms, is: 1. You download an *SDK* (software development kit)2. You write your code3. You compile/package it (or not, depending on the language)First off, what you're downloading is not the language, as that is more of an abstract concept, it's software that uses the language to build software. That can include an interpreter (e.g. with Python), a compiler (c), a runtime (java), and other tools such as a debugger.Writing your code is what you do with e.g. pycharm, but you can do that with anything. At the end of the day, what only matters is the content of the files, so whether you write it with pycharm, notepad, visual studio, or Morse code doesn't matter (it matters to you of course, not to the machine).And then there's what you're actually inquiring about. This steps is what depends most on the technology you're using. With Python, there isn't really anything more to do: you write your scripts, ...and that's it. You just run them and that's your software. That makes it easy and convenient, but not very user friendly which is one reason why you generally don't use python (directly) for user facing applications. For java, the final step is compiling into jar files, or an exe that will use the jar. That's already what you're doing when testing it while writing the code. The only difference is you might be including or removing some stuff from the final binary that you ship to users. Similarly for other compiled languages such as c and c++, it's the same story. The only difference is, you have to compile for each configuration (architecture, os, etc.), but don't need the user to download a runtime. Then for web stuff like JavaScript, it's a bit more complex since you have to host the website on the internet if you want people to access it. But here it's actually the most similar to what you were describing: you do use a software that brings your software to life, the browser! It's a bit similar to Java's runtime but way more involved I hope this kind of makes sense? It's hard to explain without knowing what you know and understand but hopefully I gave a somewhat clear picture of how it works. And don't worry about not understanding all of it, the world of software is vast and complex and developing software is as much about writing the code than it is about the final steps of deployment!",

There isn't a single answer for every type of thing you want to build.In general if you want to build an app that you want others to be able to use, here are the most popular options:1. Make a website. It will cost you $10/year for your own domain name like Grumpy\\_Gremlin49.com, and $5 - 10/month to host the website. You'll need to learn some HTML and CSS to design the content, but most of the logic can be implemented in Python. The best part about the web is that it's the easiest for end users - they just type in your url and they're immediately using your app.2. Make a mobile app. For iOS it costs $99 to become a developer. You either make an iOS or Android only app using the special languages and frameworks designed for that, or you use a cross-platform framework designed to let you build an app once. There's a framework for making mobile apps with Python (Kivy) but it's not very professional. You upload your app to the play store / app store and then users can download it and use it.3. Make a desktop app. You can do that with Python. The main problem is getting it to users. You'd need a website to distribute it (see #1), and browsers and virus scanners will try to stop users from installing and running it. This is a fine solution for sending to a friend or making an internal app for a business, but these days making a good cross-platform desktop app for end users is a real pain. If you want to make an app for the Mac or Microsoft app stores, that does solve the virus scanner problem but it limits what your app is allowed to do.So your next step is to pick one. The more specific the better. Pick something like web or iOS. Don't say \"all of the above\". Start somewhere.",

This is to ensure that, when running in production mode/env, things continue to work. These steps will include a task that's referred to as packaging. One of the mechanisms to do this is to containerize your application so that all system dependencies are bundled into the container (Docker is one of the easiest containerization tools; if you want, you should research Docker and Dockerfile).After the above packaging step (the usual artifact at the end of this stage is a deployable unit, in this case called a \"container image\"), you will need to then research how/where to host your application. If you are targetting running this code in the cloud (say AWS for eg), you will then need to research and decide whether you want to use Elastic Container Service (ECS) or a kubernetes-based solution. If going with ECS, most of the infrastructure-provisioning will already be taken care of - you will simply sign up for an AWS account, and then configure what tier you want to choose (depending on how heavy your application is and also depending on volume of users). Then comes the actual deployment. I have skipped some steps like unit testing, CI builds, connection to a database, security (both runtime/dynamic scans and static scans). Depending on your comfort level and (I assume) your aim to get to a full-fledged application, you will need to research these as well. Ofc, if your application needs a UI, and assuming your python code is simply exposing API endpoints, you will then need to research react / angular / nextjs / vuejs / etc (javascript frameworks) that will be used to build the UI for your application. That codebase will also follow a similar pattern of running the app, packaging, hosting, testing, etc.",

I think youre confused because you have skipped some steps. games are very complex as softwares and building one with no concept of coding or system design would be very difficult.i think you should go learn coding first. know the more complex data types. know some algorithms so you can learn to think like a problem solver. the journey of learning is different for everyone. idk what would be best for you, but i can share how i started back in the day.so this is how i learned python: wanted to learn in a more practical way instead of just watching tutorials. went to https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard. picked python from their \"prepare by topic\" section and just started solving the problems one by one. you can see that it starts from very basic stuff like hello world, then arithmetic operators, if-else, loop... and eventually moves on to harder stuff. i googled when i got stuck. looked at solutions if i failed. even if i succeeded, i looked at solutions as it would always teach me different ways of doing things. i found the one-liners very interesting in particular. hackerrank gives you a goal, in the form of badges. i kept doing it till i had the max level badge. after that i moved on to codeforces to practice more problems. found this ladder [https://earthshakira.github.io/a2oj-clientside/server/Ladder11.html](https://earthshakira.github.io/a2oj-clientside/server/Ladder11.html) . some easy-ish problems that you should be breezing through.this entire thing should take you 1-2 months. you should be very comfortable with python at the end of this journey. switching to something like gdscript or c# shouldnt be a big issue. if your look closely, all languages are same with some small fancy syntax differences. if you find yourself losing interest halfway through, then you might not be as interested in coding as you thought.making a game would still be a challenge after this journey but you should find yourself in a far more comfortable position that now.",

        "body": "> I've tried multiple times but it never actually made any sense, what is a bool, what is a float, what is a class,These are all things that are explained, along with their use, in a proper *fundamentals* course.I'd say to get started doing a proper course, like the MOOC [Python Programming 2025](https://programming-25.mooc.fi) from the University of Helsinki or the CS50 series from Harvard (not the videos, the real course on EdX, Coursera, etc.). This will give you a solid baseline to work from. I suggested Python, because you mentioned *Godot* for Game Dev and Python is closest to GDScript (which is basically a specialized Python).The fundamental data types are easily explained:+ *boolean* - a \"yes/no\", \"true/false\", \"on/off\" value+ *int* - a whole number+ *float* - a decimal number---*Class* is a bit more difficult: it is a scheme, a blueprint for data (fields) together with behavior (methods) - it is a generic description of what can be stored and done with something. Think of e.g. a *Poker Card*+ it has a *suit*+ it has a *rank*+ it may have a *numeric value* (mostly for sorting, or similar, or for a point value)+ it has a *face* (image)+ it has a *backside* (image)+ it can be *face up* or *face down* (which decides what the card will report when asked) all the above are *data* - they are *fields*, *attributes*. Then, there is *behavior*, the *methods* - for a Poker Card these are fairly simple: + It can report its rank (provided that it is face up) + It can report its suit (provided that it is face up) + it can be *flipped* (toggled between face up and face down) + it can *draw* itself Now, you have a *concept* of a *Poker Card* - a full description of the data and behavior - this is a *class*.As such, this doesn't say anything about a *specific* card yet. That's where *objects* come into play - they are the *concrete* implementations, like the \"Queen of Hearts\", the \"Ace of Spades\", etc. Each card in a Poker Deck is a concrete *object*, an *instance* of our *Card* class, of our *blueprint*.----When to use what is a different story. This comes with practical experience. The more programs you write, the better you will understand what to use when.Note that in my description I did not (apart from \"class\" and \"object\", \"boolean\", \"int\", \"float\") use *any* programming language specific terminology as these *concepts* are common to most programming languages.Exactly here is where good *courses* (like the aforementioned course), not just *tutorials*, shine. They explain everything from the ground up and give you ample practical exercises so that *you* have to do the work and understand the subjects.You will need to sit down and start from zero with a proper course. That's the way to go.Most of the tutorials around assume some pre-existing knowledge or fall short on explaining the fundamentals.",

It is migraine inducing cuz you're just flailing about randomly, and your foundations will be non-existent cuz your learning methodology involves \"monkey try thing, monkey see if thing work or not work, but either way monkey not know why thing work or not work\".Find a long detailed tutorial which suits your tastes that covers the fundamentals. The typical data-types (float vs double vs array vs list vs dict vs Godzilla's ballsack), the typical loops and the differences between them (while do vs do while, for vs while), indexing (most programming languages have 0 indexing), etc.It may not be as sexy, and where Joe schmoe has a fully fledged game you may only have theoretical knowledge, but the difference is when you design a game, you will actually know how & why it works and you'll be able to account for why you chose a double instead of an integer and why you needed to use X instead of Y.Personally I liked this tutorial [https://youtu.be/\\_uQrJ0TkZlc](https://youtu.be/_uQrJ0TkZlc) when I was beginning, but feel free to find one which suits your tastes. But yeah - how do you learn programming. My opinion, same way you should learn anything else. Don't put the cart before the horse and just start wildly doing things. Learn the fundamentals - what elements are at play, how they can be used, how they can't be used, etc. ONCE you're solid on that (won't take too long, its simple stuff, a few weeks depending on if this is your main pursuit or your learning it as a side interest) then do projects and learn by documentation and such",

The only thing that might be out of date is the *pedagogy* \\- education is an evolving field and educators are always trying to find better ways to teach - but if the books are working for you, then how they teach is probably fine.The journey from complete beginner to \"proficient enough to get a job as a junior\" is probably 5000 hours long.

        "body": "Changing a language is kind of dangerous. Imagine a language changed every 3 years. You write a bunch of code this year. Three years from now, they change it, and now your code is broken. Does that seem reasonable? Many beginners feel code changes and they want to learn the latest, not realizing, using the same argument, that in a few years, they'd have to learn something new because the current stuff \"became obsolete\".Of course, 20 years is a long time, but languages that last time often change without breaking.For example, Java has come out with new versions over the past 30+ years. Still, in principle, code written back then would still run now. The biggest changes occurred roughly 20 years ago when generics were introduced. Yes, there are a some other features that came out, but if you stuck mostly to that technology, you'd still be decently fine in Java. You'd only add to that knowledge instead of throwing it away.Keep in mind that code tends to stay around for long periods of time. Code can last 20 years or even longer. If you had to rewrite that code just to keep it up-to-date, that would be crazy amounts of unnecessary work. Beginners think new code is written all the time. They hear Rust is big, so they think millions of lines of Java code are tossed out, and they rewrite it all, not realizing how hard it is to rewrite code. If it took years to write, it takes years to rewrite.Now, there are things that have gotten old, but mostly in web technology. Even so, some still hangs around. I thought PHP went away 20 years ago. It's still around. People still use it because web sites were written 20 years ago. Sure, everyone tells you to learn React or something newer.There was a posted months ago that wanted to learn Carbon, Google's answer to C++. It's not even been released, had no compiler that was available, and is still (for all I know) in limbo today. If they just learned C or Java, they'd be in better shape.Also, many programmers learn more than one language, so even if you never use C again, learning to program translates (somewhat) to learning new languages, so it's not wasted time even if you think it is wasted time. The fact is, to learn programming, you will ultimately \"waste time\". Avoiding mistakes often means avoiding learning.",

If the new size is still smaller than what you originally asked for, it's possible that realloc() might not do anything.* The total amount of memory used will increase with n, but because it's freeing what it had before, at most \"n\" memory will ever be taken up.* You might think 1 + 2 + 3 +... + n is some sort of exponential sort of thing, but it's just n\\^2.

Modern day chipsets perform differently than those built even just a few years ago and so optimizations may very much change the way this whole process works.",

I don’t regret a second of it. I ended up getting a job working with the same technology and so now I get paid to play with the technology I was happily doing for fun in my free time. Employer loves my passion for the tech, and those projects let me speak about these things in interviews very well. In my second year summer, I built an Arduino project that would present you with a math problem and you had to put in the answer using binary (with twos complement for negative numbers) by clicking physical buttons. It tracked the time spent on the answers, and I timed myself doing it sober for about 20 minutes, ingested a shit ton of cannabis and did it again. Then I spent the next few days analyzing the difference in performance using Python. I can never bring that up in an interview but I genuinely enjoyed doing it. I don’t regret it. Overall my point is you’ll never regret having fun. I don’t regret the time I spend playing video games, and I definitely don’t regret any time spent that has practical benefits to me. You should be psyched that you’re enjoying this stuff. You have the “knack”.",

One of the best ways to learn data structures is to start with an abstract data type, and then use test driven development to make your own version of that data type. Once you know how to program you can start to build out some of your high level ideas (not as in programming language ideas, more as how a project works) like how project life cycle goes, how to structure a project how to research and find applicable libraries and how to vet them how to reconcile licensing, how to deploy a project, etc.",

Apply your own thought process. You don't need to understand a programming language or concept to understand the logic behind the topics you are thinking about. Lock yourself in a room and think about the problem from the base case.For example, why do you need a temp variable to store values when swapping in an array? Well, imagine you are organizing a stack of books. You want to move the one in the 5th position to the 3rd position in the stack. So aks yourself, what do you do? You have some options! First, you could pick them up in your hands and move them to where you want them. Or second, you could pick one up, lets say the 2nd one, and shove it in after the 5th book, shoving every other book after it down, then take the 5th book and put it back where the 2nd book was. Or visa versa.So which option is better? It's a lot harder to move a bunch of books after the 5th book just to shove that 2nd book in there. So lets pick them up and swap instead.You pick up book 2, pick up book 5, and swap them. Ok, so if you wanted to do that on a computer, what's different? Well, you used your hand to store the books temporarily, so it's clear you have to put them somewhere when you swap. But actually, we can do better! Because in a computer things don't physically exist and it's all information, we can just pick one of them up, and copy the other into it's place. Now you can ask yourself, what would happen if I didn't pick up that book before copying over it? Well you'd no longer know what the book was, right? You'd lose all the content, all the pages, the title, everything about that book would have been replaced by the book you just copied into its place. This is the thought process you have to apply to *any problem* you don't understand. Stand with the fundamentals. This actually has a name; \"principles first approach\". This is what I employ to most problems. As you gain more experience, you will start to see parallels and abstractions, and shortcuts you can take with the \"base case\".For example, now that you know you need to store a variable temporarily, and you are asked how to swap elements in a binary tree, or rotate it, you can start your base case at the fact that you'll need at least one temporary variable.Best of luck \\~",

The tools and libraries you see are there because someone sat there and thought \"What is the first solutiont that comes to mind?\" and explored the consequences.

I do have maths chops. But it just never comes up.A few things that do come up that might be tough for a non-maths oriented person:- The 16 times table is useful. We don't use hex much in the front end, but we do for CSS colours. Also, converting from pixel values (`px`) to relative units (`em`, `rem`) usually means dividing by 16. A 32px icon is 2em wide.- Positioning stuff on the screen is just Cartesian coordinates, with (0, 0) at the top left, not bottom left like you were taught at school. But also, your computer is just a fancy calculator, so there's no need to do any of this stuff in your head. Just drop into `node` or the browser console and do the sum you need.",

That's the way to learn.Open Source is an entirely different matter. First, you should only consider contributing to projects that you use and are attached to, not just pick random OS projects and think you can contribute. Sorry to tell you, but it seems that your current skillset is by far not developed enough to be able to follow and to contribute to open source projects with several thousand lines of code and with several modules.You need to gain experience in building your own fairly large applications first (again not through copying tutorials).----When you face a large code base it is usually beneficial to find the main entry. From there, go through each module in the order it is called. You could, if you want (I do it), draw a treemap, use Obsidian with Mermaid Diagrams, etc. to map out the project structure. Get a general overview first and then go into details. Look for *specific* things, e.g. how a certain value is calculated, how a certain part of the code works. Don't try to understand everything at once. This will be overwhelming.This is also the reason not to contribute to random projects. You are not familiar with the product. If you are familiar with an application through use and find an issue, you check the bug/issue tracker, and then go into the code. You try to find where your specific problem happens.",

Sometimes I’m not even sure if I’m solving problems the “right” way, and it gets overwhelming without any guidance.Is there another method you'd recommend to go beyond this stage?Maybe something between tutorials and full independence — like guided projects that explain the why, or studying design patterns or architecture?Would love to hear your thoughts!",

I think a good frame of reference is if something can easily be done by genAI (very small and focused scope), it's probably not challenging enoughthere are many smaller details about how you can approach this, but ultimately what you really have to do is commit to a larger project. in my uni program we already had 2 big (for 1 dev to do in a couple of weeks) projects also requiring UML diagrams and MVC code structure in our first courseI'm also always going to recommend beginners to start out with static-typed languages and NOT something like javascript. languages like these both make it harder to understand what the code you're reading (that someone else has done) is doing, and it potentially lets you skip certain fundamental knowledge that is important and helps you orient yourself with programming. if you really do not want to drop css+html+js I think you should just go on with basic fullstack and use something like java or c# for the backend",

However I’ve worked in backend web dev the majority of my career and while it definitely pays very well it’s not very interesting or challenging to me anymore, 90% of work the past few years is just solving the same problems over and over with a new skin. If I had had the chance to go to school I probably would’ve leaned more towards computer vision, embedded, graphics/media or something else but being self taught I took the pragmatic approach to enter the web dev arena. So my advice would be to pick up whatever interests you most, because that’ll make you happiest in the long run. If you are enamored by the high salaries in big tech then stick to web dev or AI but plenty of places pay highly for specialized and niche knowledge.",

That CS stuff is great to know, but it's not focused around making useful programs to delight users, or at any rate make their lives easier. HTML is used to create web pages. CSS is used to make them look nice. There are some data structures there (headings, paragraphs, captions, images, all that), but it is a stretch to claim you can code up actual algorithms in HTML/CSS. There's a lot more to programming than those. Javascript, for just one example.What kind of programs would you like to make for your users? Web apps? Games? Mobile apps? Controllers for washing machines and microwave ovens? Medical devices? I am not sure how you would know the answer to these questions as a sophomore. Take some more classes. Look at Unity or Unreal Engine for games. Do the web app tutorials in Microsoft C# / Dotnet. As for debugging your life, my response is this: \"It is functioning as designed.\" Keep on learning.

You should think about studying those in the next few years (you can start now on easy level which is actually a bit hard) just for interview practice.If you really want to do computer vision, you may need to look at grad school, but that requires high grades (3.5 or above in the US) and preferably you've taken relevant courses, perhaps done a undergrad research project.",

Some companies will give you some algorithmic coding challenge and immediately reject you if you don't score high enough. Another company might care deeply about your portfolio...but care far less about what you make and more about the specific tech stack used.Really though, if you can make a huge project that's relevant to already successful businesses, you are kind of leap-frogging an entry level position by a mile. That's like start-up territory.I've done a lot of new hire interviews... And while ever company is free to do whatever they want, in the three companies I've hired for, they all viewed portfolios the same way. It's mostly just talking point to bring up during the interview. It's not a huge deal, in the general case.Lots of applicants will have the same degree and a good GPA but, amazingly, some really will be awful at actually producing code. In the old days, whiteboard/quiz type questions were how we tried to see if someone really could code, but then everyone just started studying specifically for the type of questions that would be asked. I'm really not going to spend more than five minutes looking at a git repo or even a live website or whatever because there are just too many applicants and plenty of applicants are just going to clone somebody else's open source project. It's just something I would ask you about in the interview. I would expect you to be mildly passionate about it, because it's your project, and I would expect you to be able to speak intelligently about how you built it, on a technical level. Counter-intuitively an amazing project can be a reason we don't hire you.If we hire you, we would ask you to sign a non-compete and claim ownership of everything you develop. These contracts weren't always enforceable, and it might be different in your location, but the company wants you to give up your project and work full time on whatever they care about. If your project is so good, so impressive, so huge, that we think in 6 or 12 months it might take off and you would quit to pursue it, you would be a high risk hire. We want the applicant who will stick around for a handful of years. Only twice have I witnessed this. The first was a guy who clearly wanted to develop games. He had an indie game he was in love with and basically admitted he just wanted to make games but had run out of money. The other guy quit his full time job to launch his own app, wrote the app, and didn't sell as many copies as he thought. He was looking for a job but he was clearly super passionate about his app and wanted to keep working and focusing on it. As a person, and a developer who has my own side projects, I get it. We just need some money to pay the bills...but as an employee tasked with hiring good candidates... Those people aren't likely to be the best options and selecting a bad hire reflects poorly on me.",

Each GitHub user can create a folder (called repository) it contains source code (just textual files for code) for software they're developing. The purpose of \"git\" system is to efficiently store each version of file changes that the user made, to save that change the users make \"commits\" with an optional textual message describing what edits/changes they made. The commits have date time stamp, author name and email address. To not dox your GitHub registration email address in your commits history, there's a setting to generate no-reply garbage email address. Users can add repository to their favourites by clicking a \"star\", there's a counter of how many users added the repository to their \"stars\", so it acts like popularity indicator. There's a so called branches in repositories, there's a main branch called \"main\" or classically \"master\". Users can \"fork\" a repository, it copies a repository to their own collection of repositories and after the forking the repository points to the original one with \"remotes\", it's an url of a git repository. You can make changes to this local version of a repository you just forked and then you proceed to make a commit describing what you just changed, then you create a \"pull request\". It's request that's sent to the \"remote\" repository to approve a \"pull\" from your commit, it means getting those chances to his repository. You can turn your GitHub repository into a visitable web site with GitHub Pages. It servers your web site through a link like this: https://.github.io// It can only respond with a content of your files without dynamic functionality like databases and scripting languages. The git is a program that you can use locally on your computer to version your software (or anything else) projects. It creates a folder in your repository named .git (that's hidden in non-Windows operating systems) where it stores file changes and everything about git project. If you don't want some files/folders to be uploaded to remote repo, you can define them in .gitignore file. You can make git repo locally and then upload it to a GitHub (or other git repo hosting websites) GitHub adds more features to the git repositories than it's supported by a git itself, so it's recommended to manage a repo in a GitHub website. There's also available to download GH program that manages GitHub repo in a terminal window.",

Git is a particular version control software that is very popular. Github is a place where you can store repositories online so that it's not just only on your computer. (To understand the difference, I've heard \"Git is to GitHub as Porn is to PornHub.\" Meaning that porn exists outside pornhub, it's just one place to keep it, which is what makes it analagous.)\\> And is there a way to bookmark and or like a repository just like you would like a Facebook post or something on Instagram?Github has stars, \"watch\" toggles, forks, and you can just use any standard way you'd bookmark a webpage too of course.\\> Could someone just give me a short synopsis of some of the terminology used on the site?If you learn git separately from github, then I think most of the terms you'll understand.The specialized terms are things like a \"pull request\" which wouldn't make sense on just your own computer, but that is you submiting code for someone elses' project and, well, requesting that they pull it into their project. That could be bug fixes or feature implementations or documentation or anything else that makes sense for the project that the original author/maintainer might be interested in. There's also all kinds of options for automatically testing or building, or project management, etc. Frankly no one uses every feature, just the features relevant to their own workflow.\\> I want to use it more but I just don’t understand any of the different things you can do.Most of the things it can do won't make sense without knowing git.\\> Just to give you an idea, I didn’t build my PC just because I didn’t want to mess it up.Entirely understandable (although maybe I'm more reckless than you since I'm currently trying to fix my GPU with a soldering iron lol), and actually tangentially related to one of the problems version control/git aims to solve. By using git you can keep a history of all the versions of a file with a little note about what changed. That means if something gets messed up, you can maybe not \"easily\" but relatively easily go back to a version where everything in the file/project was in a good state and move on from there rather than hopiing you kept your \"known\\_good\\_backup\\_file.py\" actually unmodified.\\> main features someone like me who is not a programmer would need to know to work my way around it.Honestly as a non-programmer probably the main thing to do would be to submit \"issues\" for projects you use that you would notice a bug or miissing feature or whatever in. The exact way to do that varies for every project since everyone has their own preferences, but in general it's appreciated to get feedback from people actually using the tools you make.\\> I have used a couple posts to my benefit but each time had someone walk me through setting it up and after that, didn’t have to revisit it so it’s all a foreign language to me.Unfortunately git is just weird, and it takes a little bit of time forcing yourself to use it to get used to it. Ultimately there's like 5-10 common commands but there's way more than that in the tool so it's more intimidatting than it needs to be. Some non-programmers like book authors sometimes appreciate the \"time travel\" ability that it gives them, so it's possible that even without writing code that there's something youd' appreciate using version control for which would help you build up a little more of a habit of using git.",

I assume you're downloading packages from Github, which, unless you are updating the code parallel to the initial project, you should stick to downloading a zip or tar release. Otherwise, to the main point, you would need to know git in order to pull the projects locally.Make sense?",

They don't even expect a majority of applicants to actually have all skills, and conversely a candidate with all skills could still easily be unqualified in a myriad of other ways, such as they've not actually shown a record of engineering accomplishments, or they lack soft skills, etc.So, all that to say, don't worry about it, don't overthink it, if a job looks like roughly a good fit, include the relevant skills on your resume and that's it. You can include stuff even if you don't have direct work experience, but just some familiarity. I'm not saying you should lie, but if you can convince yourself that you actually would do fine with a given technology, then you're good.",

As a quick description, Java is pretty verbose and specific on how it does Object Oriented Programming, so it's pretty word-y but you may have a strong background of OOP. I haven't learned C++ so I can't say much other than it being a more low level language while still being familiar in terms of syntax. In reality though you would start learning either flow charts or pseudocodes before going to write things using a programming language before Data Structures and Algorithms (at least that's how I started in my college)",

Just not sure what kind of personal projects actually help when applying for junior or entry level roles.Generally, I would focus on creating projects that:- Use the stack / technologies you want to use in practice, or want to get a job in. While not completely necessary, as you can show general software development aptitude by simply creating programs that work, having them also be using the technologies a company you are applying for immediately shows your general skill level to the person doing the interview with you.- Write applications that excite or interest you personally. You will find that in an interview just being able to talk about a project that interests you will convey genuine interest in our field of work. Personally as an interviewer, I am always very interested in hearing about projects people have written just because it interests them. - Document your projects, and make them representable. I like seeing Github URLs on applicant their CVs, but interviewers are likely not going to check out more than 1-3 projects. Pin or highlight the projects you are most proud of, provide them with good documentation, if possible with screenshots or in case of a web app: a demo website. Make it easy to run. Your goal is to entice the interviewer to check out the code, and maybe even clone your repo in order to do so. - Your Emotion-AiCbot repo is a good example of this. Your custom-domain and medstuff repo's not so much. - Try and make your projects non-trivial. I do not get excited by projects like calculator or to-do apps. These are simple applications, and there are a bunch of prebaked tutorials for those on the internet. Created some niche application for your hobby, or which you use in your day-to-day life? Way more interesting.> I’m more into backend stuff, like APIs and automations, but I can handle some frontend too. Just not sure what kind of personal projects actually help when applying for junior or entry level roles.Know that as a junior engineer, my expectation would be that you quickly pick up technologies and are a rapid learner. Try not to limit yourself too early in your development by preferring only certain types of task (e.g. back-end). Certainly do get proficient with at least one front-end technology, or you will not stand out among junior developers that are skilled in multiple domains.Best of luck.",

Object Oriented 2d UI heaven! Still haven't seen anything come close to it for interactive 2d work.It wasn't the best way to make a living, but I worked my way up the ranks and bought a nice house. And still had plenty of free time for other projects.I do math with js and html 5 canvas now. Picked up backend/server in 2004. Running my own servers in 2013. Mail servers in 2023. Now C#.NET Core. Stored Procedures.Programming basics are fairly simple. It's not as easy as some say to pick up new languages. It's kinda like making pie crusts. I've been making 4 a year for the last 20 years. 80 crusts now. Just 4 ingredients. Same routine/recipe, but I get better every time. More perfectly round. Less dough ripping mistakes. Better astheyics. Flakier baked results. Smoother process. Less mess.Essentially caring each time. Keeping at it. Coding is like that. Don't get overly discouraged at a mistake. Don't go on autopilot. Love. Care. Time.People would tell me \"Flash sucks. It's a terrible language.\" Well, clearly they did not know what they were talking about. Yes, it could cause computers to use battery and get hot. That's cause it gave the programmer power to access those resources and do fancy stuff. Same with security. It could be abused. Make it more secure and you take power away from the software engineer. People can't abuse resources they don't have access to.Just like guns don't kill people, people with guns kill people. Just take away computers and that solves computer virus problems. Next problem.....AI Music.AI auto carriage control arm installation.Day 3 =^.^=Enjoy the journey..",

Look, we drew a picture.\" Very satisfying, very procedural. Lots of dopamine. Then...you've learned the major parts of the language. Your work becomes a bit more self guided. Progress slows down, rewards and milestones are fewer and further apart. No more dopamine. It becomes a slog. Switching to a new language immediately fixes this, and the cycle repeats.Unfortunately, \"programming\" is mostly what you learn AFTER you pick up a programming language, just like composing poetry is something you learn after learning a spoken language.This is not unique to programming. Happens with everything. Ever take an in-person adult language class? The intro course will always be full. The third or fourth course will always be nearly empty.",

CS50 is no joke, especially for beginners, and the fact that you’re not just watching but actively coding along *and* asking questions shows you're way ahead of just “passive learning.”Yes, it *will* feel slow at first. You’re not nitpicking — you’re trying to build actual understanding, and that takes time. It’s 100% normal to not remember everything or to need to look things up multiple times. Everyone starts that way.If you want to level up a bit without getting overwhelmed, here are a few simple tips:* **Keep a small notes doc** (which you’re already doing — big W)* **After each week**, try to build a *tiny* project using what you learned. Doesn’t need to be fancy — even a simple calculator or guessing game helps things stick.* **Don’t worry about memorizing syntax.** Focus on *what* each thing does and *why* it’s being used.* After a section, try explaining the concept to someone else (or even just to yourself out loud). It’s wild how much it helps.You're doing the hardest part right now: showing up consistently. Trust me, this isn’t wasted time — it’s the foundation that makes future stuff way easier to grasp. You're doing great. Just keep going.",

I watch it however many times i need to, I watch other related videos, I look up things i need a little more detail on. Its good cuz, I know the thing that I want to code, isn't exactly the same as whats being taught to me in the video. At the end i've gathered bits and pieces of what I like from each piece of content.and then, with AI, i describe my understanding of that thing, and i have it just confirm my understanding. this leads to a lot of back and forth with AI because now i'm able to discuss the topic with it, adjust my understanding, correct the AI where it sounds wrong, and by the end of it, even if its not fully fledged out - i have a planonce i start coding, i have a stronger sense of the separate pieces of the puzzle that i need to build, and it becomes way easier to connect them all together",

The best thing to do here is own up to the mistake and work with the entire team to recover it. It absolutely sucks to have to tell everyone about your mistake, but it’s always the best option to be transparent and lead the effort to fix it than to try and keep it quiet and hope no one notices, because if you do so it always turns into a bigger problem.Once you fix things, the next best thing is to write up a post-mortem report outlining what happened, the recovery process, the root cause, and any learning items or action items the team should take to avoid a similar incident from happening again.",

It makes you understand much better how these things work.2/ learn debugging. And here i mean two different things. Learn how the debugger work to step through code and inspect memory.

This is kind of what a binary search tree is doing.Lisp has a built-in \"dotted\" notation for cons cells, so you can just write example trees out to test your lookups, for example.

Once you’re solid with that, binary trees become easier: it’s just two references instead of one (left and right).Then, build a simple Node class for your tree. Keep it minimal: just value, left, and right.Now, draw a small tree on paper and simulate what’s supposed to happen step by step:How insertion flows,How recursion works (base case + call stack),How traversal happens (in-order, pre-order, post-order).Use a debugger or print() statements to watch the logic unfold live. That’s how you bridge the gap between understanding the concept and writing working code.Finally — don’t rush. Trees teach you recursion, memory structure, and flow control all at once. So if it’s hard, that just means you’re learning something real.You're closer than you think.---Let me know if you'd like a sample in Python or a visual breakdown. Happy to help",

        "body": "I professionally work on a large codebase (~50+ million lines of code) containing a mix of backend and frontend code. We pretty much exclusively use plain-old dependency injection and do not quite use the service locator pattern.This is partly due to the architecture of our codebase, which is a monorepo containing a bunch of microservices. That is, we have one giant repo where all code lives, and the code contains several thousand smaller programs that are managed by different teams and deployed independently at cadences picked by the owning team. (The monorepo + microservice approach makes it easier for each team to move independently while still making it easy to share + reuse + mass-refactor code, etc.)Given this setup, having a central registry is not hugely useful because:1. If we create just one 'registry library' that everybody adds their thing to, it ends up introducing a major bottleneck to builds and tests. When we make a code change, our build system + CI pipeline tries building and testing only code that ends up depending on that code change in some way; having a single common module that nearly every microservice takes a dep on would add an unnecessary bottleneck.2. You don't really get much benefit out of having every single microservice create their own registry and register deps. If you're going through the hassle of this, you may as well just pass in those dependencies directly into your code and skip setting up the intermediary registry.Beyond this though, I personally think service locators are inferior to plain-old-code and dependency injection in general because:1. Having the dependencies be statically encoded in the source code instead of created dynamically via some magic framework makes it easier for IDEs and static analysis tools to determine where exactly different snippets of code are being used, programmatically update the code, more intelligently pick which tests must be run given certain code changes, perform type checking, etc. So, the less dynamic/runtime wiring we can have, the better.2. It also makes unit testing easier -- there's nothing simpler then just calling a plain-old-function or instantiating a plain-old-class. The less ceremony you can have, the better.3. Arguably service locators make it a little too easy to add new deps. Code that takes a large number of deps is usually a sign of poorly-designed code -- it should be broken up into smaller, better compartmentalized components. So, having a little bit of friction here seems like a pro, not a con.All that said, it's true that these microservices need a way to communicate with each other -- need some sort of [service discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_discovery). This has less to do with code architecture and more to do with the reality that these microservices need to run on a fleet of many thousands of hosts, and so need a way of discovering which IP address any particular microservice replica is serving from at any given time.To do this, we have microservices register their IP address in a system that's pretty similar to DNS; downstream microservices need to hard-code the specific service address and perform a lookup to talk to other microservices they take a dep on.In fairness, the actual code to do all of the above can end up feeling pretty similar to the service locator pattern in practice -- it's just that instead of registering a pointer, we register IP addresses. So, I suppose we _do_ use a variant of this pattern in practice.> are multithreadedI think multi-threadness is irrelevant here. If your code is multi-threaded, your deps need to be thread-safe, no matter how they're passed around.",

One question I’d ask is if we’re using unit tests to confirm smaller, isolated behaviors as parts of a bigger system, does the method these systems use to communicate matter?Another question might be, do I want/need multiple threads to have (essentially) global access to these systems? Because a service locator provides that. Just as an example with my context, I use service locators in game development to provide convenient access to main systems (audio, saving, scene loading). I don’t care about testing or have concerns with multi threading so it doesn’t factor into my decision. I use DI extensively in many other scenarios where I need to be explicit on my inputs. Definitely would recommend just building with velocity and if you run into a problem over and over again then consider refactoring or reaching for a design pattern.",

        "id": "n6eyzvj",
        "body": "Dependency injection has some pros over the service locator pattern:1. **No hidden dependencies!** \\- You know exactly what dependencies an object has just by looking at its constructor, and what dependencies a method has just by looking at its parameter list. You don't have to read through all the implementation details, or figure out through trial-and-error, what services need to be registered in your service locator for things to not break at runtime. If all required dependencies are explicitly listed as constructor and method parameters, the compiler makes it basically impossible to try and construct an object or execute a method without having everything in the right place for it to work (at least if the services passed to the client themselves also use dependency injection, etc.).2. **Safer async initialization** \\- If a service returned from a service locator requires some sort of asynchronous initialization before all its methods are ready to be used, then it could easily lead to a situation where a client forgets to check some IsReady property before calling some method, resulting in bugs. Or even if the service is explicitly registered as wrapped inside a promise object, then all clients need the additional complexity of handling waiting for the service to become ready, and unwrapping it. With dependency injection you can naturally always just wait for all services to be fully ready before you even initialize the client and pass them to its constructor. Thus all clients' code can remain very simple and focused, and the asynchronous nature of a few services don't end up spreading around the code base, and causing the whole APIs of all their clients to also become asynchronous in nature.3. **Better support for multiple services of the same type** \\- with dependency injection, you can easily at any time pass completely different services to separate instances of the same client type. You can pass a default logger to most of them, but pass a more verbose logger to that one instance that you want to debug more closely right now. If you use a global service locator, then you might just be completely stuck with all instances of a client class being stuck using the same services at any given time. Or even if you use multiple separate service locators, it'll still probably be much way more complicated to swap the service of one client instance in some particular context - potentially even requiring some substantial architectural changes to pull it off.4. **Clients don't have to worry about lifetime management** \\- if a client pulls out a service from a service locator, how do they know if they should dispose of it once they no longer need it? Did they get a transient service, or is it a singleton shared between multiple instances? Does the service locator have to return some other information besides the requested service, so that this can be resolved? Do clients just always have to return all services to the service locator, just in case? With dependency injection all the complexity of lifetime management is pulled out from all the many clients in your codebase, and can be centralized into a smaller number of composition roots, where the lifetimes of all the different services is probably more clear.5. **Clear initialization order** \\- if services are initialized lazily by a service locator, in whatever order they're requested by clients, then their initialization order can become an unknowable, unpredictable black box, where the order of initialization can change drastically due to small changes in the implementation details of clients. This can potentially lead to random spooky-action-at-a-distance bugs, where a small change to some object causes a chain effect, resulting in some event being raised before some service has had time to subscribe to it, causing things to silently break. With (pure) dependency injection the initialization order is super clear, and doesn't just suddenly change \"by itself\" without you being aware of what has happened.",

Here's the deal:You're right that coding isn’t just about syntax or solving tons of questions, it’s about learning to think computationally. That means breaking problems into smaller steps, organizing your logic, and gradually building up solutions. It’s a muscle, not a gift, and it takes time and the right kind of practice.Instead of rushing through LeetCode, start small and deliberately:Pick simple problems (like on Exercism, Codewars, Edabit, or even structured platforms like Dataquest) and write out your thought process before coding anything.Read “*How to Solve It”* by Polya, it’s not about code, but about how to approach problems methodically.Watch CS50 lectures (especially the problem-solving parts), and go through hands-on projects like “*Build Your Own X* “ when you're ready.Also, don’t panic when you get stuck. Practice tracing code with pen and paper, talking through your logic, and working with a study group or mentor if possible. Avoid relying on AI tools until you've tried solving it on your own first. They can short-circuit your growth if you're not careful.You're not broken mate, you're just now learning how to actually learn CS. And that realization? It's a huge win. Keep showing up, focus on depth over quantity, and the improvement will come.",

You need to do something, you look for how to do it, and then next time you need to do it you know how. Make sure you're understanding why it works though and not just how to do it, thats a pitfall a lot of people fall into when learning anything. Also I personally dont use ChatGPT to write any code. If i use it its usually for syntax issues (usually when learning a new language) or as a substitute for google. Sorry I cant help more and im personally wondering the same question tbh. Its definetly hard to know when your competant enough to try and work in this field, but just make sure your always learning and try to always have fun doing it. :)EDIT: Typos",

You don't need to know everything as Google and AI exists (no programmer knows everything) but you need to build projects to learn how a project is constructed from start to finish and what is also important is that you don't use AI to solve problems. Struggling is part of the learning process and you only can learn debugging for example if your code, that you wrote yourself doesn't work and you go through it line by line trying to understand why the output is not what you want it to be. Like mentioned above theory is important too as you need to know that certain syntax even exists but then using this syntax so your brain gets used to it you can only learn by doing projects. Once you think you learned Javascript or Typescript for example (like you said you did), start a project and see if you know what to do. If the answer is you don't know then you need to spend more time with it until you can build a project yourself before moving on. I think even if you can get a job you will feel much more comfortable if you have done several projects. Like many here say, programming is not a sprint but a marathon. It takes a long time to learn properly.",

There are two approaches. The first is polling, which is fine if updates can be delayed by a bit. iPhone email polls. The second is the CometD protocol which keeps a long lived socket open between client and server that closes after either a three minute timeout or when a “push” update is returned. This is inefficient in terms of open tcp sockets for the server and cannot massively scale but can support client counts in the thousands or tens of thousands.If you control the servers, you would allow inbound connections to the database and secure that point using a firewall and likely a vpn for an internal server. You would also strictly authenticate connections including restricting senders to known ip ranges. A common strategy is to route traffic through the vpn and only permit connections from it unless a device is physically in an office and authenticated on a trusted network.",

But that's if \"public IP\" means \"internet\" and not \"any other PC.\" If you need it so that the database server can't be reached by anybody, then you're in trouble. \"Immediately\" means you want a direct connection between the API server and the database, but \"only outbound connections\" means you need the database to initiate the connection to the API server, and that's a configuration mess. If you have lots of API servers, your database would need to connect to all of them and manage reconnecting to any that die. You could certainly build a solution for that, but why?",

I spent countless hours on it thinking I would make money off of it.The reality is, being a student, you likely do not have the skillset you need to succeed in starting a company and it becoming something that pays you.My advice is use the project you're working on as a learning opportunity, but keep your expectations realistic on what it will become. Having a solution to a problem is very different than taking that solution and selling it to enough people to make a living. If you spend an extended period of time grinding on the project, my advice is that you should be doing it because you're motivated to learn, not because you want to make it your job.I've always learned while passionately building a project that would eventually get thrown away, and I've spent a lot of time convincing myself that these things would pan out, but that's not really how the world works unfortunately.TLDR: Look for a job, build as much as you can, maybe get hired, see what professional development is like.",

Alternatively, think about if there are topics your students struggled understanding and see if there's a way to make a tool that helps them understand the topioc better.

        "body": "The whole industry has been feeding on its own grift for a while now.Ever tried explaining SCRUM to someone who doesn't work in tech? They'll look at you like you take the short bus to the office.The average software engineer now applies to over 400 job postings for every interview. And many of those interviews are what, 6 rounds? No other industry comes close to that. And it's not an imbalance of supply and demand. It's a hiring practices problem.Don't even get me start on leetcode. Yes, I know it's supposed to weed out the fakers so the company doesn't end up with a bunch of devs who can't code their way out of a paper bag. And yet those same companies still end up developing massive piles of overcomplicated crapware. Almost like the devs aren't the bottleneck. Also, senior devs can spot the fakers a mile away.And now with the vibe coding. I'm seriously considering starting a new service that just fixes the messes people make with their vibe coded apps. I bet I'd make bank by advertising it with a bunch of LinkedIn posts saying how the service will \"take their vibe code to the next level\". Cannot wait for that bubble to burst.Thing is, it wasn't like this even 10 years ago. These are all problems the tech industry has created for itself.Now for the fun part. To people outside the industry, your skills are like magic. And it's not even the complicated CS stuff.Do you have any idea how many small businesses out there are paying marketing agencies to do SEO for them, yet they don't even have access to their own traffic data? And the agencies make up excuses because really they're just Wordpress shops that can't get their tracking pixels hooked up to Salesforce correctly so the data is useless and they can't say that part out loud.The reason so many people are talking about AI (aside from the grifters and enterprise salespeople) is because they want to be able to do the things you can do. They want their tech to work the way they think it should, yet every time they talk to a dev shop about it they end up talking about nonsense like user stories and sprint timelines.It took me way too many years to figure this out. The kicker was when I was working as consultant and somehow ended up on a small side project that was basically setting up a SquareSpace site for a local business. Our sales guy managed to bill it out at $150/hour. For a SquareSpace site. My techie brain thought this was a drastic overcharge because I thought the whole point of SquareSpace was that you didn't have to hire someone to do it for you. But for that local business that sold old muscle car parts, SquareSpace was over their head and it was worth $150/hour to have me do it for them.Eventually I got fed up building the umpteenth enterprise iOS app so I quit working with companies that do anything enterprise-y at all. It's too soul sucking.And you know what? Turns out it's not so hard to sell my skills to non-tech companies. What I think is easy is what they think is magic. That's a win-win.They don't buy unit tests (not that I want to write them), but they're game for anything that helps their sales funnel.My advice for anyone burning out in the tech industry is this. You probably see your skills and dedication to quality as an investment for a company. They probably see you as a cost center. So next time you get stressed by the nonsense, start thinking about how to apply what you know in ways that would help non-tech companies. Think outside the box. Then do the hard part and reach out to a few of them. You might be surprised at what you learn and end up with a whole new perspective on how all this really works.If nothing else, the experience will certainly help you write better Upwork proposals.",

I just don't know what is worth doing in my spare time in order to ensure I'm able to make money in the future if jobs do actually get cut by a huge % (already have a good amount).",

It's asking your interviewer. In my experience, interviewers don't care if you have some dumb syntax memorized, they don't care if you stumble on how to do X in Y language. Those things don't matter on the job, and they don't matter in the interview. It's the problem solving they care about. Usually interviewers make it clear you can ask them syntax questions like that, or other nudges AI-as-a-tool would normally help you with. I've also been in interviews where they're totally fine with you googling, you just have to let them know you're doing that before you do it.If it's the latter though, good fucking luck. I don't know about you, but I always dreaded open-book tests/exams in college. Because they were always made difficult enough to *warrant* them being open book. They were *harder* then closed book exams. If you're vibe coding and prompt engineering your way through an interview, you can expect that interview to be written with the expectation that you're vibing through it at lightning speed, and it'd be unachievable if you didn't.",

I actually get a little thrill when I get a rejection email (I’d ballpark it at about 10% of my applications actually receiving a rejection). You have layers of AI filtering before you can even get to a human. And I can assure you that the AI filters do not care about the super exciting hike I went on last weekend even if it could create that moment of good vibes with a human that you are emphasizing.The hiring system IS adversarial. It’s turned into a sheer numbers game, a game of maximizing your odds of getting through the AI filters and still coming out vaguely believable on the other side. If I actually got a chance to speak with people regularly, I’d have a much different approach to how I apply, believe me. But I simply can’t afford to spend an hour retranslating my life experience into a bespoke application for every job listing when I know there is a very low chance anyone is even going to look at it and a lower chance I’ll beat out the other 300 people who applied for it within the first 5 minutes of it being listed.And while my heart goes out to all the gainfully employed hiring managers who find pressing a button to blanket filter out candidates a bit distasteful, I can assure you it feels infinitely worse on the other side where there are *actual* stakes (like can I feed my family next month).Again, I’m not trying to trash you or anything. I really do appreciate the tips and plan to make use of them as much as possible.

Maybe I mumbled something about the Chinese remainder theorem and Fermat’s little theorem.This is for a genetic backend SWE position, mind you. Not one that would necessitate detailed knowledge of the math that supports public key.So then he asks me if I can lay out those two theorems for him and describe how they make public key possible. I say, “maybe, if you give me half an hour and a textbook”.That satisfied him. Apparently the whole thing was a psychological test designed to drill down on something the candidate says they know until they reach the end of their knowledge. You succeed by saying “I don’t know”. You fail by trying to bullshit an answer. Apparently one candidate was so pissed at being asked such detailed questions about topics unrelated to the role that he stormed out of the interview.",

His resume was famously bullshit, filled with a fake graduation from the University of Georgia and founding engineer roles at startups that didn't exist. I want you to think long and hard about the fact that this man, by lying about every single facet of his life, was not only able to have his resume seen, but waved past several rounds of hiring managers at all the biggest corps in silicon valley. You need to accept the fact that you've built a system that optimizes for exactly this type of candidate. Every problem that every hiring manager posts about on here has such obvious solutions that aren't being implemented. Every manager who posts on here about receiving too many applicants all seem to not want to just auto reject applications that are from outside the country. They all seem to not want to hire from whatever colleges or universities are near them. They all seem to want to have as much of the hiring process handled over zoom or by automation as possible. If you are a small bank in Omaha Nebraska that needs some entry level engineers and you list the job globally on indeed and zip recruiter rather than listing it on your company website and having your recruiter reach out to the local college for recent graduates then you deserve every single bullshitter and scammer who gums up your hiring process.",

I ask cause Ive been told by other SWEs to add more hard numbers which I can do, but it does feel hard knowing how to do it without feeling a little fake (capturing these metrics in production is not always clear). I don't really use AI for talking to people or in the interviewing process proper but it does feel like the job market is changing very quickly so it's hard to know what advice is still valid, especially as other people in the thread pointed out the best advice may be context dependent for where you're applying. Good post, I think it's really helpful getting a detailed perspective that fleshed out how people at startups may think differently about this problem!",

Or is this only my observation?I think it really boils down to the fact that we have more specializations now and at the same time initial level required to host something >properly< has gone up so there's no real **point** in learning it without going really deep. I most certainly can spin up a VPS and run a basic stack on it, set up a firewall and add some fail2ban + basic logging. But I would not be able to actually run a proper setup with multiple pods, specific levels of permissions, autoscaling, alerts, full CI/CD pipeline with secrets taken from AWS and so on.

So if it's a role that's seen as below your pay-grade and it has little room for upward-mobility within the org, a lot of orgs will assume that you'll get bored and leave within a year or two and they'll have to start the process all over again. With some midsized orgs especially, their bureaucratic process likely means that the cost to hire is going to be impactful for them while they might not be big enough to want to undergo looking for a new person every year or two. With some of the new automated tools too, there's a bit of disconnect between hiring personnel and the people that you'd actually be working with. So the department the role is for might be looking for just a fresh college grad and might not care about experience while the hiring department has their tools set to only spit out the most ridiculously overqualified candidates for the role, which makes the process even more annoying. Source: was dealing with this at my university's infosec lab while I was working there. Basically the only way they could get candidates they actually wanted from hiring was to ask for the top 100 resumes because anything less than that only netted them ridiculously overqualified people or stupidly-keyword/context-heavy resumes (one of the ones they sent up to us was 14 pages long)",

Then create groundbreaking research papers and have the relevant experience which will be another 3 years and barely be like 1 or 2 people from that year of cohorts in the country?So don't worry.

I'm sorry that she's put in so much time and effort and has yet to see it pay off financially. It's very tough out there.Best of luck to her.",

Some spent many more years learning the craft and struggling for a job before finding success. If she really wants this, keep encouraging and tell her to stick it out, but be prepared to work harder for longer. She needs to be ready to take a job she doesn't like. Work on personal projects that display her skills. As everyone is saying, it's a tough market right now and that just means dealing with some pain when trying to break in.

Two were with engineers, each technical but only pretty basic coding and mostly conversational. Then a final call with the engineering department director. It's a <100 person company, maybe 30 engineers.It's by far the shortest / least intense interview I've gone through, and I pretty much only interview for companies around that size or smaller. Most everywhere does 4+ rounds if you're including the intro call, but more than 5 is pretty unusual, and I am including \"take home exercise\" as a round.Most typical interview loops are:* Recruiter screen* Hiring manager screen* Technical round (often a take home)* Deeper technical round (common if last was a take home)* Final call with someone important (CTO, director, etc)Step 3 is *super* common when compared to 2020-2022, but sometimes rounds 2-3-4 there are combined in some way. Occasionally there will be no final round and it goes right to offer stage after the big technical round. It's also pretty common for the deep round to just be a discussion of the take home.Shortest I've ever had was screen, conversational with HM, then a technical. After that was offer phase. 3 rounds was more common in 2015-2020, I think, but I've found that losing the in-person technical round to remote interviewing has made the process longer pretty much across the board.",

If you're interviewing for a medium-sized company (100-500 employees, I don't go smaller as the pay will be much lower), you will have 2 interviews: a technical one with a one to three engineers and a behavioural on-site one with an HR and probably someone ranking between your future team lead to the head of development. The technical interview REALLY depends on the company. I'm interviewing for C++ positions, so the company will ask you questions about the non-trivial part of the language most relevant to them (examples are virtual methods, exceptions, thread synchronization, templates, stuff like that). They will also ask you general language and data structure questions(examples: the differences between map and unordered_map and between list and vector), and they might throw a leetcode-like problem in to see whether you understand concepts like big-O notation. Some companies can also ask you a bunch of really low-level questions where you'll need to know about alignment, big-endian vs little-endian, and the C standard library.The behavioural interview is the basic HR questions(like \"what was your biggest fuckup?\" and \"why are you switching jobs?\"). One company I worked at gave me a personality test, but it was a legit one developed by scientists for professional orientation purposes, not something like MBTI(and the company itself was really nice and chill). The entire process takes 2-3 weeks. They can even come with the positive feedback on the day of the interview. Then they give you a couple of weeks to think about their offer. The job afterwards is usually much more chill than in our Big Techs.",

The 200+ applicant pools are more common now, but your experience and realistic salary expectations could set you apart from fresh bootcamp grads demanding Silicon Valley wages.Regional markets vary significantly. Smaller cities and non-tech hubs often have less competition and more reasonable processes. You can use a service like Applyre to do a passive job search while you're still in your current situation. Local consulting firms, government contractors, and established businesses modernizing their systems are good targets.Your timing might actually work in your favor. Many companies are pulling back from over-hiring and focusing on steady, experienced developers who can maintain existing systems rather than rockstars building the next unicorn.

To get to senior+ you need to hone in on your non-technical skills like communication, how you take initiatives, how you build alignment etc. these are absolutely crucial to be seen as someone with authority, and something most engineers neglect and plateau. I personally heavily leveraged these and went from junior to senior in under 2 years, getting promoted over solely technical engineers with 3-4x my experience. for these soft-skills (the real game changer), I would recommend focusing on good documentation (and I don't mean writing docs that no one reads, but being strategic with it) like writing summary docs to summarize complex discussions, writing well-thought-out design discussion tradeoff analysis docs to promote healthy, structured discussions and building alignment, etc. Speech is equally important - the phrasings used, the tonality used etc can immediately set an authority apart from a noob - this also translates 1:1 into slack threads, and code reviews as well. Small tweaks like that can instantly make someone come off as authoritative and knowledgeable.Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss more. I am an open book!",

But at 4 years, idk. I’m in a similar position to you, 3.5 years in and officially considered mid, but I know I offer much more than that. But I’ve got a pretty good deal all things considered, so I’ve let go of any resentment and just contribute as much as I need and not extra, unless absolutely required (I’m not very visible, but sometimes I might be when other teammates are out). Basically, I prefer being an IC vs. leading projects because there’s much less scrutiny and the routine is much more chill. I even talked to a teammate who is leading a project, and they’re questioning whether the visibility is worth it lol. I’ve had the chance in the past and I knew that it’s not something I’m into. I also keep up with the latest advancements in the field, primarily in terms of AI.

If you have more time, learn another skill that you can make a craft or \"retirement job.\" Personally, I trained weightlifting and martial arts and while it's my hobby now, I see myself maybe teaching this when I get older. I also explore digital marketing in the form of blogs, email, social media and video, so I could technically start a business or digital marketing agency or consultant if push comes to shove. Once you're comfortable, try your hand selling something based on your expetise so you have a test business. Your therapist, according to your comment responses is saying \"your feelings are valid\" and I'm reading it as since it's valid, your brain is probably detecing signs that you're going to actually become destitute. There are signs and writing on the wall that's why you're screaming internally and theres something you need to do about it. And I think you need to take it seriosuly. Be around people solving the problem. Be around people in higher positions within your career track. Be around people who are more successful and ask for their advice. Then do something. My suggestions are just examples. As I've had that thought since I entered the marketplace.",

I can get no references, everyone probably hates me and I have no other skills than being mediocre at coding.I can relate as I have the same fear. I think this is a healthy fear that one should directly address. My advice is to reduce costs and save so that you can live off of a decade from your savings if you lose your job. Work on your technical skills, interview constantly and get job offers so that you always have other options if you get laid off.> Everyone keeps harping about trades or jobs involving interacting with people and I am bad at both.I would stick to CS.> I am in terrible shape, am on the spectrum but not enough for psychologists to care about it, so I am basically someone who has no friends and no relationships in his late 30s.

They don't want you to be professional especially for grad roles. They want to know that you are interested in their company (show your research) and tell them what you have been working on and learning. Keep your github profile public and show your repositories they want to see you are doing something.Another thing that helped was looking at some leetcode easy questions, Iearned some very simple yet important patterns that they didn't teach me at uni and I am usually able to solve the pair programming coding interview parts. During such interviews show your thinking, break down the problems, find a solution iteratively.Was I lucky? Probably, but luck is where opportunity meets preparation.",

        "body": "50-70 applications per day seems like not a lot of bang for your buck. I'd focus in more on specific roles using specific skillsets, then have templated, tailored resumes for those roles. Right now, your resume seems a little scattershot. As an example of what I mean, in your language skills section you have Java listed first, which tells me you'd be most comfortable in Java, but none of your projects or experience mention Java anywhere, so I don't have much to go off of regarding how skilled you actually are in Java other than current coursework from mthree, which doesn't tell me much.I was in a similar boat as a new grad, and it took me 10 months to get a job (2 months after graduating). I would have 2-3 resume's with the same or similar information, just re-ordered to fit the job description. Is the job a front-end position using React and TypeScript? You better believe I'm putting that first on the resume. If the job is enterprise Java, then Java, Spring, JUnit are all going to bubble up to the top. Normally I'd suggest having a cover letter too, but it just so happened that all my callbacks came from applications with no cover letter, so your mileage may vary. Last thing I will absolutely recommend is to **bold** the **relevant skills** in your **experience** and **personal projects**. So things like **TypeScript, Tailwind, etc.** should be bolded. HR people don't have a lot of time to sift through applications, so the easier you make it for them to find the technologies they need to see the better. Don't go too crazy with it though. If around 15% of the text in your bullet points are bolded, I'd say that's good. That's just the path I took though, there's other ways to go about this. My job hunt was from November 2024 to this month and took about 300 applications sent total , but I got the best results most recently when I was only sending 2-3 applications out per day to places I was 100% sure wanted new grads with little to no experience. I'd also like to know what your application-to-interview ratio is. For me and the people around me, it was normal to get 1 interview for every 50 applications or so. If you're not hitting that (or anywhere close to that I'm guessing) then you might be applying to places too liberally. That's all I've got! Good luck, going that long without a job is rough. P.S. if your personal projects fall on the gaps in your employment, it might be worth putting the timeframes you worked on the projects. That way it would at least show you're doing something between your internship and mthree, but idk how effective that would be.",

I think here's where you can be a bit ambiguous and say you worked in a software developer capacity but not specify or limit yourself to their perception.\\- Maybe I'm just dumb but I basically don't understand what any of the projects under Key System Implementations do at first glance. Recruiters with even less technical experience and patience, might glaze over it or hit the reject button when looking for buzzwords. I'd either try to simplify the language or concepts of what you actually delivered or just tailor this section to specific types of jobs (like how in these projects you used Python etc. to deliver).\\- Probably remove the EE degree in progress as it's not really relevant or use it in your EE-only resume.\\- The undergrad teaching assistant role sounds like fluff, and no employer really cares about how many assignments you graded etc. you should probably write something along the lines of what you taught and areas of focus you excelled at teaching like red-black trees or something etc. Or try and take a look at other undergraduate TAs on Linkedin or something and see what they wrote. To me, at least it seems very \"I want a TA job.\"Last point is you probably want to tailor your resume to each of those roles you listed that you're applying for. At best this looks close to an \"EE major that used to be CS looking for an internship/jr role\" to me, but has some mixed signals so you'd want to orient the resume better towards those kinds of jobs if so.",

If I wanted to optimize getting in, and assuming you've already got an education, I'd join a startup.It's true that once you're in big tech, it's easier to get other jobs in big tech, as those resumes tend to float to the top of recruiters stacks.

Senior people would give talks to their teams about how they are leaders, and not managers, presumably after attending a workshop.There's a nugget of truth to the distinction, but in practice your manager/leader is unlikely to change how they behave based off of what they learned about \"leadership\".

But it's a VC funded hype bubble. There's going to be a lot of losers in a few years. And imo, that VC money is way better off in the hands of average engineers like you or I.I say take a stab at it. You have the credentials, both academic and professional. And you could probably ask for some ridiculous pay/options/stock contracts.You literally have everything to gain and nothing to lose seeing as you have stable employment. My general take: if you have the skills and the ability to do so, get aboard the hype train while money grows on trees, get your bag, and gtfo.",

I have published a mobile app that has 1,500 monthly active users, but that didn't seem to help my chances at all. No one cares about or looks at projects. HR doesn't code and is the first line of filtering resumes. Hiring managers have 30 hours of meetings a week. They probably don't even read your resume before the interview.For every 1 person who says they look at projects, there's many more who don't. My hiring manager in banking said projects can only hurt the applicant because you can't defend yourself when someone good looking to judge you. I don't list my GitHub. Projects are fine to teach yourself tech stacks but no need to share the code.Oh 1,500 MAU app, like that's different, that's not some crap project copied off the internet or weirdly coded with AI. Is there not a website or App store listing you can link? But yeah, you're still entry level with 300-1000 applications for every job. You say \"top public school\" but that needs to be #1 or #2 in your state. Then you need to be willing to relocate.Consider forming an LLC to look more legit for self-employed status and mention revenue if over $500. I'm not a lawyer, not giving legal advice.Your resume, you underestimate how lazy HR is. **They read your resume for** [7-8 seconds](https://www.hrdive.com/news/eye-tracking-study-shows-recruiters-look-at-resumes-for-7-seconds/541582/). You need to say what languages were used in your first two projects. Most people don't know what Flutter is. Then you need to expand your Technical Skills. Don't just say Java, add Spring Boot, Postgres with JDBC, Hibernate mapping, other Spring modules, any IDEs used. If same info is within your Java project, that's fine, have it in two places so HR is more likely to read.Then consider an MS to \"reset\" your work gap and be eligible for internships again. [OMSCS](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech is legit and cheap but you miss out on in-person career fairs where I got all my entry level opportunity.",

In 5th grade we had to write a report and publically present it about \"What I want to be when I grow up\". A bunch of kids picked things like professional baseball player, firefighter, cop, \"business man\", etc.I wrote my report on wanting to be a \"Computer Scientist\".I wasn't even pursing SWE specifically. I wanted to get a CS degree, and find *any* technical job that utilized my CS degree. So from day 1 I was ride-or-die CS/tech-industry.But around 10-12 years into my career, my mind has started drifting to simpler times. When I was a teenager, I worked in fast food, and it was one of the best jobs of my life. I literally met life long friends through that job that I still keep in touch with. It's what really brought me out of my shell as an awkward teen, it was pretty formative for my life.The pay was shit, dealing with customers is god awful, but the job itself was very \"zen\". I go in, I sling some burgs for 6-12 hours, and I go home. There's no week/month-long projects, there's no quarterly objectives, there's no product managers, there's no on call, there's nothing to think about after work. It's just burgers. The only thing that followed me after my shifts was I always smelled like beef.But around 10 YOE? I already got my bag. I literally have enough money stashed away that I could afford to work a full time minimum wage job for the rest of my life and not sacrifice anything about my current lifestyle. So when my last job went south, and I started looking for my current one.... I kept thinking \"what if I just... went back to fast food\". I made a spreadsheet to forecast my runway.Ultimately I'm glad I stuck with it and landed my current job.... but I am at the point where if I get laid off, or this job goes south, \"soft-retiring\" is a very realistic option for me.My passion in CS and computers is still as strong as ever. But I don't need to work in the industry to enjoy that side of my life anymore.",

In hindsight it was a good option because if worse comes to worse I can pivot from SWE to EE or CE. Perhaps I would be more competitive in SWE jobs with an SWE degree, but an EE degree is still very prestigious as it was the default for programmers up until the late 90s or perhaps even early 2000s. For example the CEO of Microsoft has an EE bachelors. The CEO of Google did his Bachelors in Metallurgy and Masters and Materials Engineering.I would definitely do something engineering though. CS is less challenging (4 courses vs 6 in engineering), more saturated and offers less flexibility. And even if AI does automate most human labor, licensed Engineers still have state granted authority to sign off on safety critical projects (this matters more in an age with powerful AI, because powerful means dangerous). The reason engineers are sometimes grouped with doctors, lawyers etc. is because they all need to go through stringent licensing and all have serious legal considerations when they sign off on something. Getting a degree that enables you a path to such a license would be extremely valuable, and CS won't give you that option.",

But my advice as someone with a few career regrets would be this:1) Only go to college if you feel ready to give school your full attention. It is relatively easy to fuck around for 4 years and walk out with a degree. But if you limp your way through a STEM degree without fully internalizing the content and setting aside time for relevant clubs and student associations, you're not getting much more than debt out of school.There are plenty of things you can do in the mean-time if you want to focus on being young for a little while.2) Only go into a major you actually have some passion for. Engineering is a lifelong grind. You need to always be learning new things, taking classes, and skilling up. A lot of people in software burn out or decay because it's too draining to grind something you hate.3) The most important thing your college gives you access to is not the degree. It is professional work experience through internships and co-ops. Your entire college career should be centered around securing as much work experience as possible as early as possible. A college degree without at least 9 months of work experience is borderline worthless.",

Maybe look into mentorship sessions/mock interviews for both behavioral and technical and try to get some feedback.",

They may accept out of the kindness of their hearts if you try to negotiate, or they can always just go to the next lowest bidder for the job.

Your willingness to walk away from the offerIf you don't have another offer but you have rich parents who will bankroll you until you get a better offer? You have leverage.If you have another offer, you have leverage.If you don't have another offer but don't care about having to crash on a friend's couch and sell feet pics for money, you have leverage.If you don't have another offer and you really want this job and you're not willing to risk losing it, then you don't have leverage.With that in mind, and in this market, you need to be really careful as to how you legitimately negotiate, but you don't have to be that careful in how you position yourself to get the best offer possible.Things you want to do:1. Try not to give a number first. If they ask you for a number, ask what their range is. If they don't want to tell you and refuse to keep going without a number, you might have to give it to them - but even then, you can say \"I'm looking for $X, but I'm flexible depending on what the job, team and benefits look like\". Because that gives you the ability to come back later and say you need more.2. Tell them you're at different stages of interviewing with different companies, but this is the opportunity you're most excited about. Because here's what you're trying to balance - you want to make them feel like they have competition, but you don't want to make them feel like you're going to waste their time. Also - if they ask for what companies you're talking to and what stage of conversations you're in, you can straight up lie - and you should. However, you want to make sure that it doesn't sound like you're too far along with anyone else (again, don't want to waste time). But if you're talking about e.g., an on-site interview, feel free to tell them you have an onsite scheduled with Google for the week after. Not only are they not going to doubt you, but also they have no way of confirming or debunking that claim.",

Work on those, ask quesitons, etc but at the same time: \\- Learn the version control system / branching strategy / release schedule / rollback policies etc better than anyone else in the organization. You'll find that most people are fuzzy on large parts of it and you'll be able to solve and prevent many problems simply by not being fuzzy.\\- Find out where all the documentation is and start reading it. It will be of varying quality and often out of date but get comfortable with the org's business, architecture, network infrastructure, personnel structure, etc.\\- Talk to as many people as you can, in all roles and departments. Learn what they do. You will eventually save someone from a million dollar mistake because you will have awareness of things that no one else does. Make people like you and see you as useful. You will get many more opportunities that way.\\- Learn your tools and technology stack deeply. In the AI era it's more important than ever. It just takes a few books. Learn everything about Java, be able to talk about the major features that were added at various milestones and why you would use them. Same with Spring or whatever else you're using.",

If you want it learn something you have to do it yourself. Offloading to AI does *not* help you learn though it may enable you to do things you couldn’t otherwise do. Eg we have PMs at my company who are able to prototype their own solutions and even moon light as devs on simple tickets when short staffed. They aren’t learning how to dev.

You'd be shocked at the amount of JS devs who dont understand the call stack and event loop or don't know if js is a dynamically or statically typed language LOL2. Get good at DSA. Identity patterns and solve 2-3 mediums and 1 hard leetcode a week3. Get good at architecture. Buy the Alex Xu book and do some mock interviews. Maybe set up a server at home with redis since you're primary a front end. Cloud certs are just an extension of this. The AWS solutions architect exam is literally 65ish system design questions with an Amazon flair. 4. Get good at soft skills. I recommend \"Grow: the essential guide to get promoted\". It's a 2 hour read and has been Invaluable to my career. Simply being active in meetings and sending follow up emails in the format of this book allowed me to lead projects early in my career 1 and 4 can be done in a few months. Getting good at DSA is a lifelong skill unfortunately. Everything you mentioned (devops, cicd, etc) is built on this foundation. It's not sexy at all but being good at the fundamentals is more important than learning the latest framework.",

If im in the ball park and my explanation as to why I got there is correct, i've impressed the interviewer. There's def been times I didnt get the answer but I also realized my mistake or didnt and said \"my next idea would be to do XYZ since this didnt work\". For me all 3 are just as important but the more Jr you are the more the coding interview should matter. The more Senior you are the more leadership and system design should matter. Because as a Jr it's important to know how to code and learn system design within the company, as a principal it's more important to know design/leadership over code. Seniors and mid-level need to know more about leadership/system design than Jrs but less than principals. So for percentages id say:Jrs - 80% coding, 15% System, 5% leaderMid-level - 65% coding 25% system, 10% leaderSenior - 40% coding 30% system, 30% leaderPrincipal - 20% coding, 40% system, 40% leaderThe higher you go in this career the less you code so for a principal coding shouldnt be important because at that point it's assumed you already know.",

For example, they might think of a straightforward brute force approach and we start with that, then I indicate towards a way they might be able to make it more efficient and see if they catch on and can take the hint and follow it to a better solution.It's also to account for people have one or two 'bad questions', like basically having a mental blank on one.

It depends on how well the automation is. I have only done it for 1 project. It wasnt great at first. Most of the automation wasnt built and most major issues came up from the same few things. Because it wasnt automated, we didnt notice until the customer complained and once customer complaned theyd wnat to get on a 3 hour call because they wanted an explanation. Then wehad to write a report to send to them. It sucked.We could get 20 tasks in a day of on-call. Once automation got better, there were less customer complaints and less tasks in general. Most days Id have at most 5, one time I had no incidents and it was like I hit the lotto. But this project was also a major big tech company with customers worldwide. My current company has on-call I have yet to be added to. From what I hear it's one week long. Unless it;'s major incident there is no requirement to fix it until the next business day.",

Good developers ask questions, especially early in their careers. A healthy team would encourage this, not punish it. The \"vibes-based\" performance reviews are particularly concerning red flags.Don't let one dysfunctional workplace convince you to abandon an entire career. Most tech teams aren't like this, and your methodical approach suggests you actually have good instincts for the field. Your current situation is damaging your confidence unnecessarily, and the longer you stay, the harder it becomes to remember that this isn't normal or acceptable.Start job searching immediately while you still have income. A service like Applyre might be helpful. When interviewing, ask about mentorship programs, team dynamics, and how they support junior developers.

I'd be very desperate, I'd be open to relocating on the earlier side. Am I getting interviews, but just not offers? This is significantly easier to fix, I'd be working on this in month 1, let alone month 4... but if I'm getting a decent amount of bites I'd be freaking out closer to the 6 months mark.At that stage I also wouldn't *only* be open to relocating. I'd be expanding my job search to consider non-SWE roles that my CS degree qualifies me for. Moving into QA, PM, IT, etc can get me on my feet, get an income into my bank account, and give me more time to look for a SWE role.Much more than 6 months unemployed... I'd need to have a long, hard conversation with myself about my career. That's a long time to be involuntarily unemployed in any market. I'm way past the \"maybe I should relocate\" stage.Where I'm at now in my life, with 12 YOE, there's only 2 cities in the country I'd be open to relocating to. I'll soft-retire before I move somewhere I don't want to live.",

From my own experience, the people going on these job pitches get paid more than the devs and it takes time for them to land jobs.So you're essentially paying the contract firm 36% of your total billing to avoid all that.

Also links many LC study guides that have example problems. For me, it's more important to understand DSA than actuall just grind and hope to get a similar problem. Gridning can get you the job but good interviewers will really test your knowledge and if you fall down the wrong rabbit hole you wont understand how to get out of it.

Choose 1–2 roles you’d genuinely like, and let them drive your prep direction. Focus on high-yield patterns (like sliding window, recursion, trees) rather than solving random 300 problems. Your goal isn’t to become a LeetCode machine it’s to show structured thinking under time pressure. You already solve harder things at work. Just reframe this as “translating” your strength into interview language.",

This industry still rewards proof of work you just have to package it in a way that cuts through noise.",

It's very much a class based masters and the majority of students don't do any research. If your goal is to find advisors, ones who can write the type of letters that get you into grad school, you can certainly do that. I'd ask on r/OMSCS for stories, but I know it's possible.I was also interested in Type Theory (Haskell programmer at the time) and unfortunately I didn't find any faculty working on that. I wasn't going back to grad school (did that once), though, and my main focus for doing the program was to get a better grip on CS fundamentals and help grow my industry career. For that, it was extremely effective and I got into big tech pretty soon after graduating. I did find this: [https://omscs.gatech.edu/research-opportunities](https://omscs.gatech.edu/research-opportunities) I'd check that out. All that said, the way I got into a PhD program was by working for a professor as a lab tech, doing good work, and getting into the program hosted by the school. To get into a PhD program, grades and papers help, but what it really comes down to is one professor with influence speaking on your behalf. If you push, that should be possible with OMSCS.",

I have a biology undergrad, was working as a Haskell programmer at a small start up, and 2 years after graduating I made it to a big tech company with pretty good pay.

Sprints are there to collect data for velocity not some hard deadline.

No one can be always positive but constantly pitying yourself and thinking we're all doomed will lead you nowhere.

I dont mind being called out but it seems like he's going out of his way just to do it to me is there anything you can suggest that I can do to best approach this. I dont mind talking to him but I felt it may be best to bring it up to you so to avoid the wrong approach.\" Something like that.Unfortunately in this career there are always hostile devs. Some you can learn to co-exist with them, others it's impossible. I've worked with 2 guys like that. First guy, was a screamer. His way or the high-way. I was terrified of hij when I first go tthere. Then I had to work with him. Funny thing was, he ended up being the nicest guy. I learned how to work with him basically. I noticed that if I had a difference of opinion I had to back up my words. Most of the time I was still wrong lol, but sometimes I was right and he gave me credit. I think he liked that I did my own investiagation and even had my own points. I wasnt just taking his word as the god given truth. Now in my second job, I could never figure out the hostile dev. He had no people skills that I could crack. In a lot of ways I compare him to Michael Jordan. He was the guy that knew everything of the project. He produced in his sleep. He didnt mind working 12 hour days. He told managers how to do their job. I fhe didnt like your work ethic, he didnt want to work with you. And I think he realzied early on he didnt like my work ethic (Im more of a9-5 guy). I worked with him on a major project he had created and it went terribly. I kept finding erors and had to change my design like 20 times because each time I came up with a design, another problem would come up. Then he gave my manager a list of his complaints of me. My manager kind of walked on eggshells for him tbh. I will admit some was fair, but others just seemed unfair. The biggest one I remember that I felt was unfair was that my manager said that I have too many commits in my MRs. That happened once and it was because the design changed so much. I fought it but my manager even 6 months later was still using that against me. I ended up getting fired. I dont blame that dev but it defintelty felt like the beginning of the end when I wasnt on his good side.",

Sometimes they are completely clueless people that don’t understand that using a wide audience chat is not how you deal with things.So, we’ve fixed this a few ways. First step is to document every single time they call you out on a wide audience chat of any kind. If this person does this to others, probably should document that as well. The more records you have the better. Screenshots are also preferred.Second step is to let your manager know that you don’t appreciate being put on blast by this other dev in a company wide chat especially when they you’re not at fault for the issue. Include your record of every time they call you out specifically and what the actual issue was that had to be resolved. Ask your manager how this should be handled. The wrong answer is “nothing”. We had to do a meeting where all the devs agreed to not individually name people even in our team only chat for issues. Senior Devs can ping people directly and handle it not in a chat.Third step is if this behavior continues and your management doesn’t do anything, notify HR with your documentation. Make sure you have save this documentation somewhere you have access to in case they retaliate (manager, HR, senior dev).On most of my teams, we never had to get past step 2. Only once did we have someone get to step 3 and HR talked to the offending dev and manager. Behavior stopped for a few months and then started up again. In that case, the guy was gone in like 48 hours after he started again because he started blaming people who weren’t on our team or didn’t work on the project with issues.",

Focus on roles that mention early-career talent or don’t specify graduation years. Also, referrals have been working for you double down on that through cold LinkedIn outreach or alumni networks.

If you hear about someone working on cloud migrations, network configurations, or server maintenance, ask if you can shadow, help, or at least learn what tools they’re using. You’d be surprised how much access and insight you can get just by showing curiosity and initiative. Outside of work, keep building your skills around cloud fundamentals. Since you're studying cloud computing, start applying what you're learning in small personal projects. Spin up a website using S3 and CloudFront, automate infrastructure with Terraform, or play around with IAM policies in a sandbox AWS or Azure environment. The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner or Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) are great early on. You don’t need them to get a job, but they can show recruiters you're serious. Then, stack on more practical, intermediate certs (like AWS Solutions Architect Associate or AZ-104) when you feel ready. Definitely apply to internships as much as possible, but also start building a presence online. Maybe a GitHub with your cloud projects, or even posts on LinkedIn showing what you’re learning. Follow your interests too but with intention. If you're curious about DevOps, play with CI/CD pipelines. If security piques your interest, try setting up least privilege access or configuring network firewalls in the cloud. Over time, your interests will naturally start guiding you toward the kind of engineering roles you’d enjoy most.",

Most companies today are shipping products faster via LLM APIs, so roles that once demanded model training and debugging have been flattened into integration-heavy workflows. That said, the deeper work still exists just in more focused places: research teams, model pre-training groups, infra/startup labs, or proprietary AI stack builders.If you’re not seeing these roles on portals, it’s likely because they’re less advertised and more network-driven. You’re not burnt out you’re underutilized. Consider targeting orgs building from scratch (e.g., open-source foundation models, RLHF stacks, or custom embedding workflows) where your skill set is still a competitive advantage. Happy to point you to a few such paths if you're open.",

I'm not sure what infra you are working on, but when I took an infra job, I ultimately left because I was frustrated with the shit code we wrote and the lack of any sort of real development work. I did all sorts of stuff with cloudflare tunnels, DNS migrations, and dealt with TLS certs, plus on call. The work I really wanted to do, on the database engine, was just not a priority for us, compared to cloud operations.I've seen juniors and new grads do well on infra teams, so it's definitely possible, but all things career progression depend on how much you excel in your roll, and the opportunities your org has to promote you. I'd say that's equally true as a junior engineer trying to make senior in 5 years, as it is for a senior trying to make staff and looking for projects with company wide impact, at least under the system of stack ranking that will average on the organization level.I basically left infra to go back to product, and am trying to make staff now as a team lead. There's no shortage of impactful projects, especially if you can step up and be a leader. I am hesitant to think one domain mints more staff engineers than another, and I'm staring down a company wide rollout of our project for next year, so that hasn't been the case with me.In my experience, the biggest factor is just what you want to do. I tried infra, didn't like it, so went back to product. If you like infra, do it, the amount of work is pretty much insane, and when you don't like it, you'll really struggle to outcompete the equally smart people who do. Most of the job is simply showing up everyday, moving the ball, and stepping up when you need to. If you're looking for opportunities, there's no shortage of that in either domain.",

Product engineering relies heavily on quick iteration, optics, and easily marketable impact which can be hard to do with infrastructure and legacy systems. You can have a harder time getting promoted and may need to spend more time on painful parts of the job instead of pure coding experience.",

        "body": "I landed on an infra/platform team as a new grad at a f500 household name fintech. I was misled and thought I'd be doing mobile, it was a miscommunication during the team matching process. I've been on the team for 3 years. To be honest, it has been pretty miserable, and I actually think it has hindered my career.My team is very top heavy, its all senior and staff engineers. We maintain the service mesh, the problems are all pretty abstract and challenging and require a serious knowledge of the *entire* system, and every item we own is a tier0 critical service meaning zero room for failure. It requires both breadth and depth of knowledge. So finding junior-appropriate tasks was really difficult for the first couple of years. Most of our time is spent putting out fires and handling incidents, and dealing with horizontal asks. The work is hard and the on-call toil is extremely stressful, the work life balance is bad, and the work is simply not fun. It is more of a devops/sre role than SWE, and I am not actually building or creating anything, the work is not fulfilling. I expressed some concern to management that I was not writing enough code and was missing out on vital early-career experiences to hone the basics, but everybody always changed the conversation to tell me how lucky I was to have the opportunity to learn system design and get exposure to kubernetes (sound familiar, OP?). Unsurprisingly, when I finally decided I wanted to switch teams, I was told that I couldn't because I don't have enough experience writing code and other managers want to see evidence that I have worked on substantial projects with object oriented languages. So at my company, I am basically stuck. I worry that if I look for a job elsewhere using another stack, they will think I don't have the skills they are looking for (or that I will land the job anyway and then struggle to ramp up). I do not want to work in similar roles in the future. Going from devops back to SWE is hard - so choose carefully.I think that infra/devops is something that people tend to do when they get tired of app development and are seeking more complex challenges. Some people really just enjoy this type of work, as well, but my experience is they tend to embody the negative stereotype of misanthropic back-end developers, more-so than regular SWEs. That is anecdotal, admittedly. I also think that having a background in regular SWE work will help somebody do better with devops once they eventually get there - it is hard to maintain a platform for service owners to develop microservices on top of, when I have never really done it myself. I do not believe in the idea of \"take on something extremely challenging as a beginner, and rise to the occasion\". Science has shown that this is not the most ideal pedagogical approach. It is like weight lifting: give me a 300lb weight, and no matter how long you let me try, I won't ever get strong enough to lift it. Give me multiple plates and let me progressively try heavier ones, and I will eventually get to the heavier ones.This is just my experience. I struggled to find mentorship and that is a big part of it. The team is constantly busy with high-severity urgent incidents, nobody wants to make time to answer questions and help me. It's been a really shitty experience and I burned out very quickly.tldr: I advise against it, but in this labor market, it may be wise take what you can get.",

Sometimes the skill is also in realizing that they've asked the wrong question and proposing an alternate question with a more useful answer.Unless you've very recently answered the same question for someone else, or the question is related to the work you were doing moments before the conversation began, being able to give a deep, accurate, off the cuff answer is not expected.

(In my position, the real challenge is having time to follow up on question A before I get questions B, C, and D coming in...)The other senior engineers you see answering questions off the cuff are either answering about their current work, or giving a rehearsed answer to a common question, or (worst case) bluffing about how complete/correct their answer is.

Buf AFAIK these clauses aren't really as far reaching as you're making it sound, it's usually very specific to if you do something *wrong* that brings about damages to the company. For example, say you infringe a copyright as a part of your work, and the company gets in trouble for it. Or if you leak sensitive company information and it causes damages to the company.It's still a scary clause, and one I don't recall ever seeing. Talk to a lawyer first. Most lawyers would be happy to have a quick consult with you for cheap, some might even do it for free. And I mean a *real* lawyer, not a reddit one.2 - NDA's aren't unusual. *Especially* for a paranoid startup that's still in the stage where they think everyone's out to get them. You leaking their big beautiful startup idea even a couple years after you quit could cripple the company. At least that's what they're imagining.Outside of the startup world, and the government-adjacent world, NDA's become less common.",

So I think the answer that I would have here is to think about what you're doing to set yourself apart from others and how you're showcasing this to potential employers.Other than that, I'd say that software engineering jobs seem harder to come by than usual, even for those with experience, and the first job people find after college in their career field is typically the most difficult job search they have, so finding a job will probably take a while. TBH 100+ job applications really isn't that much and I kind of think you have unrealistic expectations on how long and how much work goes into finding a job as a new grad. Also, in addition to the resume advice others are giving you above that you should listen to, your resume also seems to be missing a skills section which generally should be included for a software engineering or other technical role.",

I looked up the university given the non-4.0 grading scale, TCS in India had [big layoffs](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1mb7cxe/offshore_services_giant_tcs_is_laying_off_12000/) and that's not a good sign for the industry as a whole. Still, you should at least make it past the initial screeningOne of those companies should have wanted to hire you or offer a second term to come back. It's not a big stretch to think you were just resume boosting and didn't really want to work for them. Better to have 3 internships than 0 by far but you really only needed one. I'm not saying take 1 or 2 off your resumes, just that 3 isn't all upside.",
