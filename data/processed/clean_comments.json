So if your company uses AWS and you need a data warehouse, it's likely that leadership just chooses redshift, despite the fact it shouldn't really be used in most cases.

Redshift is a very black box that throws unexpected errors and is very difficulty to introspect.One of the more frustrating things it does is it can sometimes pick a query execution path that it doesn’t support depending on the tables you’re hitting. Exact same query, exact same table structure will error from one execution to the next.It doesn’t support all of SQL and I don’t mean the syntax, I mean that certain sub queries and joins will sometimes not be supported.When it encounters an error it shows up as a stack trace to an internal C file that you don’t have access to.It’s also sometimes wildly inconsistent where the compute nodes and the main node have different behaviour. You need to internalise what will run where to be able to keep track.It’s a pain in the ass to optimise things because makes it hard to turn off caching and other optimisation to be able to measure execution impact of iterating on your queries, it rewrites queries into multiple queries and makes it a pain to track down how things are getting decomposed.Redshifts feature development is very slow, and it has surface level support for things like JSON. I wish we had gone with something like ClickHouse where you have some hope of seeing long standing issues and features gaps get resolved over time.It’s also quite complex in terms of managing it, if you adopt it and actually use it you’re gonna be spending a lot of time learning things that are only relevant for redshift which is a huge time sink. One of the major selling points of redshift is the price, but when you need to spend money on salary to manage redshift that calculation may not work out in redshift favour.",

The comparison isn't equivalent. Redshift in combination with other analytics services such as Athena gives better results. It is the complete AWS analytics stack which needs to be compared with snowflake and databricks, not Redshift alone. Recently AWS have begun to address this with the new Sagemaker Studio.A huge chunks of the complaints fall in this category - UX, and features which are outside of Redshift but possible with other very well integrated services. On the other hand it is true that Redshift tuning needs higher skill and detailed knowledge. A lot of people don't understand what MPP is. Or how database internals work. However if uses correctly you end up running a cheaper and more efficient system.Personally I haven't seen any \"random errors\" - I've generally been haply with Redshift.After a long time looking at such discussions I've concluded that it's usually a problem of engineers not making an effort to understand their tools properly. You can run any platform - AWS, Snowflake, Databricks, BQ. Each has its pros and cons.Good engineers will figure it out, bad ones will complain. Maybe I'm just cynical.I know people who are happy with AWS, happy with snowflake, happy with Databricks, and also others pissed off with all of them - several migrating in between different stacks.The biggest sell of snowflake is that it is an easy environment to work in, but more expensive - what you save on salaries you may spend on snowflake.

Do you want to backfill and then stream from the buckets all the deltas? General how of the ingest seems ok to me but orchestration seemed missing. Also questions on what technologies they are using for current end state so you don't just drop your own tech stack if they have one already and adapt to that.

I did ask them where this data would eventually live. They told me assume it was a database then I asked about a dashboard where I mentioned where the schema normalization would be important to make sure that on the front end you could identify specific filters to show the user (like drop downs). Also, your point about aligning with their existing tech stack is spot on. I think I got a little too caught up in the idea of feeding everything into an LLM pipeline with vectorization + embeddings. Probably came off like I was optimizing for a use case they didn’t even confirm.In hindsight, I should’ve slowed down and clarified whether they needed real-time ingestion, what the downstream usage was (e.g., dashboarding vs search vs ML), and whether historical backfill was in scope.

Fix the bug and reprocess all of the raw data for that project.There's a change in schema due to evolving business requirements?

For example, all source databases should dictate anything that contains currencies and prices in float(8,2). That way, you don't feel frustrated that two columns that are topically similar (e.g. transaction fees or sales subtotal) can be calculated without some weird-ass errors due to data type mismatch.That's just **one** type of governance. There's also naming convention governance, (so you don't have one table column named \"STR_NAME\" and another named \"NAME_TXT\"). I could think of other things, but remember that you want everyone to talk to each other compatibly. The less you need to wrangle and data cleanse, the faster it is to deliver OLAPs or BI reports.",

That said, it’s not flashy, and it’s rarely a direct path to monetization unless you’re working in a highly regulated industry. In most cases its something I think you layer on top of your existing data skills to increase your value in the market, whether you're a data engineer, analyst, team lead, or CDO. But generally once you step into a management role, governance quickly becomes central. At that level, almost every decision touches on it in some way. And I definitely see its importance growing on a broader scale, albeit from a different than traditional point of view that there are generally much more CDO's and data leaders out there who require and need those skills or that organizations are failing in mode modern projects like AI or digital twins and learn the hard way the requirement of governance. So I guess overall its just more streamlined and integrated into broader management, data transformation, and change management efforts.To answer your question directly. Is data governance essential to land a job? I don't think so, unless you're lucky or in a specific industry. But can it significantly increase your value in a data related career? Absolutely, especially if you're entering the management area.",

Your goal is to catch changes early. 3. SaaS APIs and finance sheets will always change so treat them like untrusted user input. Assume they WILL break. 4. Build joins in a downstream layer ONLY after validation and cleansing. Default to left joins with null safe logic and then log any unmatched rows. 5. Version everything using a version control system (like most common one git). Save schema versions, your data samples, and row counts with every load. It makes it 10x easier to debug what changed and when, and you can always roll back into a version in case anything goes wrong. 6. Don't spelunk through logs, you should be able to track lineage, stats, and failures in tools like OpenLineage and your future self will thank u. 7.

This can be a lot of work. And also ugly in its own right when building an ecosystem around a third party.Sometimes what you are dealing with is just the name of the game. Organizing workflow for all your processes will make the biggest difference. A real basic breakdown of what I like to see:1) Store the raw data, either unstructured or semi-structured, or both. (If semi structured, some of the parsing step should be broken out to accommodate first)2) Parse the data with a schema/layout (if not meta data driven, just write some sql or code. Depends on how much time you have on your hands and if you expect to support many dozens, if not hundreds of layouts. Or just 7. In which case I’d dumb it down) should initially store everything as string, imho. I personally like to stage as stricter data types when reasonable (dates are a great example), as long as I’m capturing the raw data elsewhere.3) validate parsed data with a schema/layout. (Layout-specific validations — discovering inconsistencies from customer-specific problems4) transform data (and/or structure) using a schema mapping. 5) Store the sanitized data in a staging area.6)Validate data in staging area (validations on sanitized data)7)Send valid staging data to prod.Such system still has limitations as I laid out above, but if you only need to consolidate behavior, you need to build a workflow that will validate data from source, transform the input to a common output to be loaded from, then validate data at this staging area to validate for the destination (prod).",

A lot of experienced data engineers hit this wall after working with legacy tools, especially when the market shifts fast. Most would also wish they had the experience. The good news is: you’ve already taken the hardest step. You recognized the change and started upskilling. Python, Spark, SQL—those are the right moves. You’re not starting from zero.Now it’s time to shift from learning to building especially showcase a story / impact. Courses are fine, but real traction comes when you can point to something you’ve created. Set up a public GitHub repo with two or three small but complete projects. Think end-to-end: pull in data, transform it with PySpark or dbt, orchestrate it with Airflow, push it into a warehouse like BigQuery or Snowflake. Even if it’s basic, the fact that it works is what hiring managers want to see. Aka you are self sufficient and not to be watched but deliver results.At the same time, tighten how you talk about yourself. You’re not “catching up”—you’re evolving. Build a 60-second intro that shows you’ve worked in high-scale environments and now you’ve added modern tools to your stack. The story needs to be clear and confident.Also—don’t get stuck applying to roles blindly. Be intentional. Focus on companies in transition—those moving from legacy to cloud. Your past is an asset, not a liability. It’s not about having every shiny skill. It’s about showing you can adapt and ship. Do that, and doors will open. Keep going. Good luck :four_leaf_clover: keep us posted.",

Almost any data engineering workload can be done in a manner that data is always fresh and available the moment new data is generated from source.

Getting more familiar with kafka itself will help you identify more places you may be able to benefit it from it in a virtuous cycle.",

I have seen so many databases filled with stored procedures that no one wants to touch and they aren’t being version controlled.With DBT you organize sql scripts in nice little project folders. Add as much or as little documentation as you wish. You can reuse common snippets of code (macros) among the scripts, which is helpful for making the code modular. The whole thing is code so it harmonizes nicely with git and version control. Finally, the little SQL scripts are easily referenceable by orchestrators to be used as building blocks in other programs.Duckdb is used to create versatile lightweight ephemeral database instances that can hold a lot of data in memory and can run blazing fast queries and joins in SQL. If you need to temporarily store data then duckdb is a nice way to ingest, transform, and stage data on its way to some more permanent system. Well, you can even use duckdb as the final resting place for some data since it is after all a portable embedded database like SQLite. Duckdb can fit just about anywhere in a data pipeline, but it’s especially useful for memory-intensive or slow tasks that are bottlenecking your workflow.Honestly the tools have a ton of overlap and you could very well use both, like [this guy](https://georgheiler.com/post/dbt-duckdb-production/).",

If you have many transforms that need to be run in order, you’ll be writing a lot of custom logic to build the DAG, handle retries of something fails, etc.dbt abstracts some of that away. It’s basically a convenience that lets you write transforms and automatically builds the DAG for you in the right order. You could use dbt to manage transforms in DuckDB just as easily as in a warehouse. The main problem with doing the transform in DuckDB and then loading to a warehouse is you have to build some process to do the loading. Are you just going to drop and rebuild every table?

There is no debate on this. But for other transformations you can use either polars or duckdb, depending on your coding style and have about the same level of efficiency.Since you use dagster, and did not mention any machine learning application, I will suggest to use dagster-dbt-duckdb integration.

All data is loaded afterwards to 1 data warehouse. I still use pandas for 2 things. I like the normalize function and to_sql function. 1 problem though, using dbt with duckdb does not allow a merge with scd2, had to develop this myself. Duckdb is fast but not immune to OOM especially when using window functions or pivot/unpivot. One way to get around this is writing a dbt macro that runs your sql per batch and union the results. So all in all it works great but dbt-duckdb doesn’t give you the all the same bells and whistles as dbt-Postgress would. Depends I guess on your specific use case.",

Thus, many do not actually do much data engineering, funny enough, even though they should. Overall work quality does suffer for this, so don't run your data teams like this.At well run orgs the MLEs do data engineering and share ownership of pipelines with data engineers; DEs focus more on ops and moving data to different environments and MLEs focus on transforming data, though there aren't any hard lines, and human to human collaboration is necessary.It is unusual to move from DE to MLE, the reverse is a little more common. MLE is a more competitive title: mostly because it is sexier, more people want in, also pay tends to be higher because people assume it is more skilled (I really don't feel this way; median MLE has just superficial knowledge of a few concepts and a few Python APIs, but that's another topic for another day). So companies will prefer to hire MLEs from the pool of people with prior MLE experience, of which there is no shortage of such people on the job market looking for a role, than DEs for MLE roles.",

Pick the wrong tools for the job and undoubtedly your engineers will waste cycles building shims to work around it. On its own this is a cool project, in the context of the OPs business this is technical debt. Another tool to maintain and keep track of instead of just using the ecosystem of existing solutions.

There's a quote about writing in general - \"Perfection is achieved, not when there is *nothing* more to add, but when there is *nothing left to take away*\". Giving someone 6 page CV isn't going to make them think \"this person is seriously experienced\" it's going to make them roll their eyes a bit. That shouldn't discount that candidate (I definitely wouldn't throw a 6-page CV in the bin, for example), but it definitely doesn't help.2. making \"hail mary\" applications as an entry-level dev for a position that is advertised as a senior position may *feel* productive but is kind of a waste of your time and the recruiter's time. There may be exceptions - maybe they were planning on also hiring someone junior and may contact you about that position - but that's kind of rare.Similarly for the \"there's no such thing as entry level in data engineering\" - that's someone trying to appear profound, but instead is frankly coming across as an unhelpful dick.If you're lacking experience try for internships, give Google's [Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) a shot, try to do some self-study and personal projects or find some open source project you can contribute to. For the open source projects you can contribute even if you're \"only\" writing tests, documentation etc - that's a really valuable contribution, and demonstrates some commitment and could quite easily lead to contributing fixes and features in the future.",

If you've never worked as a data practitioner (DS, DA, AE, BIA, pricing analyst, etc) before, then go for these and think about making the transition a few years down the road. The job is entirely dependent on having a practical understanding of how data is consumed downstream of its production, and you just cannot have a clue if you haven't spent a few years of your life, well, consuming data.80-90% of the DEs I know have basically the same story. STEM degree(s), 2-6 YoE in Data, legitimate interest in software engineering (reading books, recreational programming, etc), makes the transition by learning the trade directly from the DEs working under the same roof. These roadmaps may give you the impression you can make the jump by learning the right tech. Learning bash, SQL and python is more like the bare minimum for most data jobs, honestly, not exactly a recipe for becoming a DE.I know the job title is pretty sexy, but trust me when I say you have no idea of what's it like.

I also ran into so many of the same limitations — it’s cool (and somehow validating :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:) to hear others tried to work around them too.And yes, I know **Cuallee** — it’s a really cool project! The fact that it’s **dataframe-agnostic** is a standout feature and definitely a big differentiator. Being able to support Spark, Pandas, Polars, Snowpark, DuckDB etc. with one API is super powerful.That said, what it’s still missing (last time I checked) is **declarative configuration** — you’d still need to build a wrapper layer around it for YAML- or metadata-driven validation flows. But it’s a great foundation, and I’m definitely keeping an eye on where it goes!",

If you're looking for something **lean, extensible, and framework-like** for Spark data quality, SparkDQ might be worth a look.Appreciate the discussion — always great to see more momentum around data quality in the Spark world!",

Didn't ask a single question, no comments or suggestions. Meeting ends, we all go out for lunch and invite him, he says \"go ahead, there's some personal stuff I need to take care off during the lunch break, see you soon\". The guy never came back. We were all shocked, \"maybe it's something I said?\", \"did he think our architecture was so bad he didn't want to work here anymore?\", etc. I was a little suspicious because in the quick small talk we had he didn't seemed like he was a very experienced programmer, so I asked my boss to send me his GitHub profile. There were dozens, maybe hundreds of repos there. I started to click in each one and... It was all just repos forked from various open source projects with ZERO changes from the guy. So he just basically just forked a bunch of random repos to impress some clueless recruiter and it fucking worked. The guy was a hack, probably didn't understand a word of what we said in that meeting, panicked and never came back.",

Think complex CS topics or high-profile FOSS projects.We are in a market were we are flooded with hundreds of similar CVs with no signs of curiosity whatsoever. Showing that you have (or have had) courage to tackle hard software problems outside of your expertise is a MAJOR green flag. Showing that you can do teamwork and manage an open source community is a MAJOR green flag, as there is no way for me (appart from asking your old colleagues on Linkedin) to assert that otherwise.This is not mandatory, putting no Github on your CV is fine.

You only need representative data in dev, just enough to make sure things are working as expected.It wouldn't hurt to have a way to shift prod data to dev, with transformations set up to mask and/or replace sensitive data. That way if you need something comprehensive you can create it as needed. If your storage is cheap you can also keep it around, but you don't want to run every single dev process at full scale.At a place I was at previously we'd essentially snapshot the prod environment in a way that we could repeatedly 'restore' it to other environments as needed. That snapshot then had transforms to cut down the data as needed into other snapshots. Want something that only targets a specific geographical area, or a particular customer segment, or product, or a random sample? Then just grab a data snapshot for that and restore it into your project.Just check the costs against your labour costs though. If it is only costing 10% of an FTE, then is it even worth messing around with it? With that cost if it would take more than 10% of someone's time in a year to set this up and maintain it, then it isn't worth changing. If your dev is costing 100% of an FTE to run on prod data rather than a cut-down version, then it is probably worth having someone spend their time on setting up that cut-down data.",

Which means that your code has to pass every single linter check or you have to turn them off with comments in the code.This isn't too bad for new projects that can start with the linter, and if you generally agree with the linter. But for old projects being migrated it's a very time-consuming transition.A score-based linter (like pylint) instead simply gives you a score. And it's up to you, and your automation to determine what the minimum score needs to be to merge into prod. When I had to migrate a 110,000 lines of dbt that was (of course) a nightmare, we set up a process that would automatically reject any PRs using a number of rules. Basically, the worse your code was the more you had to improve it. The PR was appended with linter failure info, and the developer had a lot of flexibility - the decisions were made at the PR level, not the file level, so the developer could have a nasty file that was hard to fix and so decided to make improvements to other files instead. We didn't care.This process allowed us to force the codebase clean up to have gradually, so it didn't cause much hardship. Just had to be patient and wait.",

In my experience, I've tried to get really good and efficient in the domains that I am responsible for and always find ways to improve there. I ask questions like: Can I automate this a little more? Can I add some fault handling or error handling? Can I set this up to be triggered to run instead of running on a schedule? By solving some of these questions, you allow yourself to quantify your impact to the business, which goes a long way in showcasing your skills and upgrading to a new role.I wouldn't worry too much about a particular tech or skill you don't have, because you can always try to pick them up on a personal project or training, and there's always a possibility in the future for a use case, especially if your are looking for one.

There are a lot of businesses that are either not in a position to implement real time systems due to lack of skills or do not yet see the value in these systems. I would recommend doing your best to pick them up on some personal projects if you can but I don’t think not having it on your CV will hold you back too much for the next 1-2 years - potentially longer.",

Also it would require for you to go back and change previously written partitions as time goes on.The functionality more so exists so say you have a massive table where you want to “evolve” the schema and/or partition over time, you don’t have to rewrite the whole table.What you are proposing could work, but I am guessing you would be incurring some performance hits because now your query execution engine has to factor in multiple partition patterns. Would be curious actually about how this turns out.What I normally do is instead I will have my “source table” with all data that is partitioned yearly as my “cold” storage. I will then incrementally build another table that is just maybe 1 year or month worth of data partitioned by month or day as my “hot” storage. Yes I am duplicating data but the compute cost to query is significantly less. This is also very easy to do with dbt. Also cost of storage is cheap which is a big selling point of Apache Iceberg in the first place.Edit: And of course anyone who needs more data will accept that increased cost and simple go to the full history table.",

One effective way was leveraging tools like Fivetran for data ingestion combined with dbt for transformations, as you are, but maintaining a sandbox environment helped a lot too.I'd also suggest looking into DreamFactory for API generation which might ease integration woes by providing endpoint management across evolving data sources. Experimenting with this multi-prong approach allowed us to scale without constant delays.",

It means that people that are familiar with that system can use your data platforms to get at the data they need, without having to put strain on the original source.Another thing you could do is, with the 'internal tables, if some team wants access to some state like that you just make a copy of the model and call it a published one just for that team. You should then able to make changes to the original model to suit your own needs, and they've got something stable. It does mean you might have two materialisations, and you'll have two dependencies, but it might be worth it.You still might have a bit more going on with the source-replica styled tables. People might want a history of the data in there, for example, so you might still run raw staging copies, then produce 'latest' and 'full history' representations of the data. It generally isn't hard to do both, since the latter gets you the former, so you can make it a standard that every time you ingest a new source you create these representations to provide to anyone that needs it so they can get quick access.Later down the line you'll have to grapple with data governance issues, but in a small org it can be handled more directly.",

It’s often through teaching or explaining concepts—whether it's techniques, architectures, or tools—that they become more deeply embedded in our understanding. That said, choose the method that works best for you.Feel free to DM me—I'd be happy to share tips and resources that have helped me throughout my career. For context, I started in the computer vision field, transitioned into software back-end engineering, then worked as a data analyst, and since 2020, I've been both a Senior Data Engineer and a Solutions Architect Expert at large international companies.",

Trying to put everything at once will take you a long time and you won’t be able to validate your progress and maybe you’ll stop in the middle because it was too long and you don’t see the project ending anytime soon.First focus on ingestion.This will guide you collect data from a source and store it.You can try a couple different sources here like REST api, web sockets, MQTT topics, GraphQL API, just here you can have some fun.Do things simple, use simple python and once it’s working THEN try to improve if you want ti make it faster or what ever.Then focus on transformation Load the data from S3 to Snowflake. It doesn’t have to be automated. Ingest enough to have a couple of hour/days worth of data for your need and load that at once into snowflake.Now configure your first DBT project and make sure you are able to connect to snowflake using DBT debug command.Then clean and transform your raw data to something meaningful.Note that before you start the ingestion step you should know what’s the first thing you want to achieve. If you don’t this won’t work. Find something you want to know then find the data source for it, not the other way around. It’s always more fun to do something which have some value for you. Then work on testing you ingesting code and you transformation. Might be boring, but it’s a needed skill.Then focus on automation. Configure your airflow module and orchestrate you ingestion module on a schedule with your DBT transformation from a trigger when the ingestion for a specific partition is done.Then you can start looking into streaming.Configure your infrastructure (Kafka, or red pandas or what ever you want)Then modify your ingestion module so it send events instead of full set of data. For example if you were collecting all weather records from all country well don’t wait for the complete process to be finished, yield events as you consume them to your Kafka stream.Then configure your ingestion engine spark/flink/quix/bytewax and run some transformation on real time data.Then try to configure some threshold will would alert you in real time if xyz happen, if the temperature increase from x in the last hour.Then work on building beautiful dashboards.Then you can try to consolidate all pieces together.This is never a small project, and doing everything at once won’t bring you where you want. Do small integration instead. You’ll get completion reward as you go and you will be more willing to continue instead of dropping because the scope is to complex.Cheers and good luck",

It does have mandated PII masking for sample values, and all uploaded files are automatically removed every 10 minutes, but I get that’s still not strict enough for a lot of real-world use cases.Based on feedback like yours, I’ve started working on a fully self-hosted version. Everything will run locally, with no data sent out at all.If you're interested, I’d be happy to follow up once it’s ready, would be great to hear your thoughts after trying it in your own setup.",

What I meant is a lot of teams hand off wide, flat exports with repeated entities, no keys, and inconsistent columns. Kinda like someone took a reporting dashboard and hit \"Export All.\"The idea behind the tool is to help untangle that detect the relationships, suggest a normalized schema (like you'd design in a real DB), and give the data team a solid structure to load the actual data into. That way you can avoid duct-taped pipelines built off raw flat files.",

When you apply, your cover letter AND your resume need to clearly show your capabilities. Cover letter is for introducing yourself, but also to explain any gaps or highly specific technical skills asked for in the job description. i.e., job poster wants you to have done x/y or z, this is your chance to give them an example of you doing that. Your resume is there to illustrate your history and your accomplishments. You need to create bullet points that show numbers, that show completed things as much as possible. Your resume is meant to give the company looking to hire you an idea of what their employees can look like if they hire you, or how you can make their team better. This means that you need to tailor your cover letter and resume to the job you are applying for every single time. Yes, this is a lot of work. Yes, it's a pain in the butt to do. Yes, you should still be doing this.Please make sure you are tailoring things to your audience when you make your applications. Just because you have the titles doesn't mean that you are showing you are of value, or that you are summarizing your capabilities effectively. Dressing things up matters A LOT in these cases!",

The idea is -Say you select avg(size)I will collect a sample from the underlying table, eg 10k records.Then will resample these 10k, say, 100 times (with replacement). For each such sub-sample i will calculate avg. Now i have distribution of 100 averages. When i say 95% it means that the final confidence interval is the the 2.5% -> 97.5% quantiles of that distribution. This is \"bootstrapping\" as i understand it.I am not sure this is mathematically correct but seems to return correct results.Makes sense?",

Dagster's deployments allow multi-tenancy under one umbrella. We even have customers using Dagster with Airlift to bring multiple Airflow instances into a single Dagster deployment so they can see it all in one place. Outside of orchestration, Dagster has a data catalog, data quality, cost insights, and we've just started shipping Dagster Components which lets you create templatized pipelines for your stakeholders. Imagine a less technical team wanting to only write YAML while your core platform team wants to write Python, you can do that now.I will say a lot of the benefits of Dagster will come in a hosted version. The hybrid model lets you execute all the code in your infra, but if you care about things like real-time insights you'll want Dagster+. You can do it all yourself on your own infra if you have the expertise and resources though.",

The benefit of SSIS is that you have full control over it - you can run it on-premises or in a private cloud. The development process is also much easier because you can develop solutions right from your notebook with no need for network connectivity. Once you pre-process your data with SSIS and perhaps store in Parquet files, you can load and do your analysis with DuckDB - it is free and very high performance.The solution I have described above will be the most cost-effective and easiest to develop and maintain.",

I think decisions like this exist on a spectrum, for the sake of your question.If the ML prediction outputs are something that is very \"closely\" tied to the document records, then re-funneling things through the raw layer so that it all flows downstream, could make a lot of sense. A trivial example, would be like a \"word count\"... I don't really see anything wrong with adding a \"word count\" column alongside the original raw data, especially if downstream datasets will also benefit from it.If the prediction outputs are something that is totally separate from the original records, and/or if you plan to expand your ML platform to cover more models and different kinds of predictions, then it probably makes more sense to aim for an independent architecture, use things like MLFlow for tracking/registering instead of the existing DWH governance. But there's no absolute right or wrong here, it all depends on what direction the team is going in, what kinds of skills or resources are available, etc. There's no point pursuing a \"pure\" ML architecture that is too big for you, if you are a single solo MLE and can't support it well. OTOH, if the team is gearing up to invest more deeply in ML overall, then the calculus for making future-ROI investments can be weighted differently.",

My team is doing with both ML and LLM outputs following same pattern.The reporting layer for model ready inputs is also a good idea (and something my team is doing). To add the ML/LLM outputs to reporting layer, you just need a separate object in your reporting layer for the final consumption. Our ML/LLM versioning is handled outside of the warehouse (through an app we built) and ingested into the warehouse. We have a generic section of our warehouse dedicated to modeling the ML/LLM workflow that includes entities like document (text/data evaluated), the prompt (type 2 generated from app data that version controls the prompts) and the ML/LLM outputs of each version of the prompt that was used against the given 'document'. All data flows through this generic model and then flows to the various reporting layers that need it. This also provides standard building blocks for document chunking/RAG which we have built on top of this. Not sure on exactly what you mean by pushing the derived data breaks the idea of it being raw data? The point is that is raw data, totally new. Take away the ML/LLM model used to create that data, you can't regenerate that data using SQL with the data you already had in your warehouse. It's a totally new source of data, hence it should be treated as such and move through the raw layer.",

It is a downstream system that generates new data that needs to be ingested.The days going to ML might change in some incompatible way, so this allows the ML output layer to account for that, rather than breaking things at the integration point. If the data from the ML changes then that forces to raw, and it goes through a usual process of standing a schema change or a new source.Another way to think of it is that a dwh processes *never* goes backwards through the layers. That makes it extraordinarily difficult to pick where to put the ML inputs and outputs as the most sensible place to integrate the data into other models could be anywhere, or in multiple places, or it might move. Therefore you treat it as external, you send it says from some output layer, and you interest into your raw layer.",

Do a sufficient amount of this for a year, and you now have a year of experience for ah actual company rather than some random projects that probably won't stand out. You could even pull back the start date to a year earlier (giving you 2 years of 'experience' ) and just claim that you didn't incorporate the company officially until a year later if asked (they may not even check, so long as the linkedin founding date is the same).This is all very much on the edge, and I am sure some people will clutch their pearls at this, claiming it is unethical, but it will probably be way more fun and give you a way more competitive edge on the job market. This is how you beat the catch-22 of needing experience just out of uni (until India or TikTok catches wind of this and it becomes unviable). You have got to be crafty if you wanna succeed in this job market. It's just like a video game.NOTE - For what it's worth, the 'meta' for applying seems to be tailoring your CV to each job post using AI (well) and the same with cover letters (well).

As a result: data quality complaints -> DE fixing bugs that DA reported -> skyrocketing cloud bills.My point is: **data accountability overlaps** for both DEs and DAs. A systematic governance framework is required in every business that assigns clear data accountability to each data role. DEs and DAs need to collaborate and answer one fundamental question first: What data product does the business need?To achieve such a goal, DEs and DAs need structured and adaptable data quality rules and to determine how to monitor and catch issues at the source. This is the critical overlap that many organizations are missing today.If you can, build a custom (homebrew) system to detect data issues early. If that's not feasible or scalable, invest in a data observability platform that meets these needs.I might have answered a bit more than you asked for, but this is a good question and I think it's worth rethinking, even for some senior DEs and DAs.",

The benefits of grads vs experienced hires is actually they haven't learnt bad practices. You should have a solid induction and they be very clear what skills you need and how to get them. You won't be expected to hit the ground running. But if it is intense they will expect you to pick up what they saying quickly. As an entry level hire you should have a solid support in palce - don't be worried to ask questions or have to know everything. Learning about the tech stack is good but really passing the interview and landing the job you can consider yourself done until you start. You could email your new line manager and ask if there is any training or reading they would suggest before you start.",

Learning ‘data ops’ will only make you more employable and will never be a bad thing. A lot of data teams are not fully supported by a central devops team so being able to do it yourself will be invaluable.2. Don’t try to be an out and out data ops engineer. Most business do not hire for someone that specialises. Being a data engineer with a lot of data ops experience will get you a long way in my experience and is probably better for your employability.Anyone else out there feel free to correct me if you think I’m wrong - this is all anecdotal from my personal experience.",

        "body": "Hi! I am a little experienced programmer (\\~20 years), mainly in heavy-data-oriented companies (banks, governmental taxes, investment funds, energy). IMHO, DataOps - and similar teams - are costly solutions for an underrated way of seeing data.Even companies dealing with high volumes of data can use other solutions, which - although old-school - are cheaper, effective enough, and have known, stable tools. Companies have analytics teams, reporting teams, controlling teams, etc., working closely with IT. If all they deliver useful, valid data, it's good enough. DataOps as a team is another layer of organization, which requires more collaboration, more tools, more discipline, more dependencies, etc., giving unknown (maybe?) better value. Which company wants to pay for it?!DataOps should be more a general concept, a part of strategy, like DevOps, not a new role or a new team. (BTW, this is one of the reasons for failure in introducing DevOps - by a team or a role foundation.) Of course, this is very convenient for some people to have a visible \"thing\" on an orga chart, with attached obligations and maybe some KPIs, but it is not working for 99.9% of companies - I guess this level, but I will try to justify:DataOps as a team or a role is a kind of coordinator role. There are two general attitudes (it's malicious, but it's for real): first, this role is given to the least competent person, who needs to do something, but in this role can't mess up anything; second, this role is given to the most competent person, who quickly becomes a bottleneck.But there is easier, working alternative, which paradoxically is also a MUST for DataOps: collaboration between parties. Without collaboration DataOps is probably impossible. With collaboration DataOps is probably not necessary.So, if you want to look for a very niche job offered by very few companies, that are rich enough to proceed with such an experiment, and if you have very high skills in business and technical issues, you are probably a good candidate for a very lucrative contract. In other case, have a good plan B. Whatever happens, good luck!",

Something that \\*could\\* be cute if your boyfriend is familiar with the signs of base64 encoding is to send him a base64 encoded message. It would only really be useful for one email but it might be cute to send him an email that says something like:I just wanted to say, SSdtIHNvIHByb3VkIG9mIHlvdQ==Which translates to I just wanted to say, I'm so proud of you.Just make sure there's the == at the end of the message to make it obvious. Base64 uses padding to make sure the content is of an appropriate length so sometimes it will end in = or ==. So if you encode it to Base64 and it doesn't have == at the end just add a space and reencode until the encoded message contains ==. You do run the risk of him not realizing what the message is though.",

It's a short read with some diagrams available -though I recently listened to the audiobook and didn't feel the missing reference images took away from the experience. The author basically starts mentioning the abacus and other early calculating machines, which leads to Babbage/Lovelace, which leads to Turing, which leads to Von Neumann, which leads to... etc etc all the way up to modern networking, cloud, and social media. It doesn't go overly in-depth into any one topic, but still explains a lot of things in a way that's easy enough to grok even without a CS background. And it's not just historical figures like a textbook, he does explain things like how vacuum tubes worked and *why* certain things developed the way they do, like how CS concepts we consider foundational today were being theorized/implemented to invent devices to accurately. Lots a little fun facts you can repeat to sound smart at parties too which I appreciate from any book.... like how a committee inventing machines to calculate the necessary settings to aim anti-aircraft kinda just offhandedly invented the term \"digital\", humble beginnings for a word that defines the modern day. Definitely recommend, especially if you like history or are a little shaky on certain CS topics. Really having a good explanation of how a vacuum tube actually works before moving onto microprocessors really helped the IRL \"tech tree\" make so much more sense to me, and now if you ask me what a microprocessor is, I won't any longer respond by saying \"idk, shit that low level is just magic to me\"",

That’s “easier” than self taught because it’s structured and you are forking out of ton of money so youll probably actually do it.",

I can relate I’m turning 29 on the 29th this month lol and I’ve just hopped from one dead end job to the next, started learning coding in 2023 got a Comptia network+ cert and had absolutely 0 luck getting into IT with the exception of one help desk job I ended up turning down cuz it just wouldn’t pay the bills and I couldn’t wait for the whole “moving up the ladder thing” tbh I really wish I went to school in 2023 to become an electrician as well, seems to pay really good right off the bat. If you don’t enjoy programming or coding (which it sounds like you may not) it’s prob best not to force it. Let things happen naturally do what interests you. If you’re not afraid of taking on some debt (which shouldn’t be too much if you go the trade school route) I think becoming an electrician could deff pay off. Don’t give up hope remember the good times and your more than just your career. Remember also. Small habits make big changes. Try doing just 15 min of something you want to learn every day and see what happens. I hope the best for you friend",

I don't think it is impossible but you are absolutely going to have to learn how to sneak in through the backdoor. The guy who called me a clown is absolutely right (I am a clown, \\*rimshot\\*), trying to get through the typical application process is going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible. You have a couple of options, one of these is \"network like your life depended on it\", perhaps you can find somebody who likes you personally and wants to give you a shot. The other option is to undercut the market. Even working minimum wage is positively lucrative compared to the cost of a 3 year degree. Two or three years as the associate / coffee run kid at a cash strapped startup might give you the education to step up. It will depend on where your mind is. If you are thinking, \"can I just skip the college bit?\". Nope, not really. You might be able to replace it with something else but you are going to have to earn those stripes regardless and you are going to have to get a lot more creative if you plan to go off piste.

If your running Unix/linux then I suggest you learn some terminal commands. If you are on windows…then i understand why the terminal scares you. Not hiding API keys is a huge security threat. Someone can essentially take ur key, and call requests on an api and the api think it’s you when it’s not. Not all APIs are free. So someone can take ur api key and loop forever and call it, and you’ll have to pay for it. Theres a plethora of reasons why is a threat.",

Getting medicated is the best thing I have ever done for my productivity.Also, I almost guarantee you know enough to make something if you actually sit down and TRY and just do some googling when you are stuck. Leverage LLMs and stack exchange, you can make something. And I'm saying this even with the absolute lowest expectations of you - like even if you don't know how to create a class in Python. You are smart enough to learn it 100%. Tons of non-CS majors teach themselves to code on their own time.Make a website clone - for example if you like video games for example make a stats website or app. You will get stuck for sure, which is the scary part, but that's where you learn. Break it down into smaller problems.Back to the website example: when you think of it, you think, \"I don't know how to build a full website\". But let's think about it in smaller detail. For example: \"I don't know how to pull stats from an API and display them to a web page\"MUCH easier problem to tackle, and less overwhelming when you don't know how to do it. Couple google searches, couple hours of playing around, and you're good to go. Do enough of those small subproblems, and wham, you're done.But you need to address the procrastination - whether it's a medical issue (ADHD, depression, etc) or not you need to find a way to deal with it.Good luck!",

People here are saying \"no\" but it's more complicated than that on modern architecture. Yes, they can slow down your loop if the branch predictor guesses wrong, because the CPU pipeline will have to flush its pending work. But branch predictors are pretty good, so unless the if statement is very unpredictable or 50/50, you'll be fine.edit: As far as optimizing if statements out of loops, sometimes you can split the loop into two loops with separate logic, and that allows you to extract the if statement outside the loop. Alternatively you can look into branchless programming, which usually relies on methods like boolean algebra. But don't go too deep into the world of micro-optimizations, 9/10 times it is a waste of your time unless you have definite specifications that require it.",

In modern ISAs, you typically see cmp and jump instructions bundled in the same one, this would be executed faster than two instructions, but the jump offset addressing is usually smaller.How fast are those instructions? Well that would depend on the architecture, but I assume they are done in a cycle easily.Of course, if you don't need the IF, your program would obviously be faster, because you reduced the need for an extra instruction.But in reality, it shouldn't make it that much slower (remember one instruction only), but since IF is used to cover side cases, it'll obviously make your program bigger, how big you may ask? Depends on what the compiler optimizes the if to, it could be a branch with a link, it could be a skip, etc...If you're strictly testing loop scenarios, just think to yourself \"every time I run this loop, I am doing an additional instruction\" so if the loop is 8 instructions long, and one of them is the IF instruction, then yeah, it would make it somewhat slower. So yeah, if you're doing a loop that loops 1 billion times, and you tracked the time it took, you could probably see a noticeable difference.",

Humans think in objects. There is a thing called a car. I have one. Mine is a particular colour and it can drive to places at various speeds... yada yada yada. OOP let's us express these ideas in these ways. When it comes to large, complex systems, this kind of separation and encapsulation can help tame the chaos. Over the years, I have come to accept that forcing \\*everything\\* into the object model is a mistake (as a Java guy for a couple of decades, this was a hard lesson to learn), but there are times when it is the right way to express an idea, even a very complex one.

        "body": "Let's be honest with you: your programs so far were way too small to really benefit from OOP. OOP works great with huge, complex programs.Yet, there are even smaller programs that can greatly benefit from OOP - provided, you have the right use case.For me, a prime example are card games. Here OOP can really play its strengths in simple, fairly small projects.Think about what you need for card games: you need cards (obviously), you need a deck, you need players (also obviously), players have hands (the card hands, not their physical ones), and there could be much more.Exactly the nouns above: Card, Deck, Player, Hand translate very well to Classes in OOP.+ A *Card* is a class modeling a single playing card. It has a suit, a rank, potentially a numeric value, potentially, a front and a back, and it is either face up or face down. It can be flipped (toggle face up/face down), can report its suit and rank, and value *provided* it is face up, otherwise it should not reveal its values.+ A *Deck* is a collection of cards. It can be initialized, can report its size, can be shuffled, can deal 1 or more cards.+ A *Player* models a human player with a name, potentially some money, a hand (the cards they are holding), a bet, etc. Of course, it can report all that.+ A *Hand* is basically similar to a deck of cards, but always directly related to a player.When you have this fundamental classes above and add a Game class where you define the rules of the game and how the game rounds run, you can quickly whip up any card game.Even better, by just changing the game class you can make Blackjack, Poker, and many more games by reusing the other classes you have previously made.Sure, you could just as well do all that without OOP (and it has been done plenty times already), but overall the OOP code will be much cleaner, much more modular, much easier to maintain and reuse, much shorter in total than its non-OOP counterpart.Reuse is one of the advantages of OOP. Another is *encapsulation*. The outside, the program that uses your classes does not need to know anything how the inside works, how it stores its data (state). The outside always \"communicates\"/\"interacts\" with the class/object through well defined and limited channels, pretty much in the form of a dialogue. The program asks the class/object for something and the class responds.",

An object contains data about itself, and methods to manipulate that data, so other objects can \"communicate\" directly with it, without having to know anything about how it is built.The example you supplied is just a single method that does some procedural work on some separate data, so you don't get any benefit from doing it more object oriented.But imagine a game, where different players have different health and shield-status, different inventory, equipped weapons and so on. Every item in the game is an object, so that when one player hits another with their weapon, you don't have some central code that does all the calculation, but the Player1 object sends a message to the Player2 object, that they hit it with WeaponA - Player2 then calculates the damage delivered by WeaponA, subtracts its own shield, and adjusts their own health-level. Maybe even deciding to hit Player1 back.That is all done by code inside the Player-object, making it seem more like the objects are \"communicating\" than running a procedure.Since many processes - in games and business - can be modelled as entities communicating, OOP lends itself very well to that way of thinking, and it is \"easy\" to transfer an abstract model of a system to independent objects, than to a huge procedural program. Smaller procedures, like parsing a text, calculating shortest distances or sorting data, usually don't benefit from using OOP.",

Encapsulation is what makes object polymorphism possible, and it’s the core thing that distinguishes OOP from procedural and most functional programming.The point of encapsulation is that it limits how much of the system you have to keep in your head at one time. At its best, you can focus on the responsibilities of a single object and trust that other objects are doing what they’re supposed to do. This is in especially important when you’re on a team where someone else is writing those other objects.One place where the rubber really hits the road with object-oriented encapsulation is in the enforcement of invariants. An encapsulated object can make more guarantees about its behavior than a publicly mutable struct. To understand whether a struct is in a valid state you might have to look at every place that has mutated it, whereas to understand if a mutable object is in a valid state you should (ideally) only have to verify that its constructor and setters properly maintain its validity. You can think locally rather than globally.The other place where OOP has a leg up is extensibility. When you encapsulate your objects by writing to an interface rather than a concrete implementation you gain the ability to add new implementations of your interfaces which will interoperate with existing code, without having to modify the existing code. This is also very important as the project increases in scale.I’ve written a basic [blog post](https://jnkr.tech/blog/abstract-data-types-and-objects) on the tradeoffs involved in choosing between proper objects and imperative abstract data types which you might find interesting.",

They usually try to introduce it with some flimsy metaphors of cats and dogs and bicycles and wheels and then have you memorize the four tenets: abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, without really giving a good reason for why OOP embodies these tenets better than any other paradigm. To their credit, it’s difficult to see the benefits until you are seasoned enough to start working on larger scale coding projects.First, let’s get this out of the way: OOP is not strictly superior to procedural programming. Different paradigms are good for different things. We also don’t choose one paradigm over another because of performance reasons, or really anything involving the computer. Paradigms are solely concerned with how we, the humans, conceptualize the code we’re writing. At the end of the day, every program is in an imperative paradigm once it gets compiled down to machine code.Procedural programming is great if what you’re coding is best conceptualized as a procedure; AKA a series of instructions. If you’re writing a python script to run some preprocessing tasks on your ML model then it makes total sense to take a procedural approach.However, let’s take the most stereotypical application of coding, software development. Say you’re developing an app like Microsoft Word. Is Microsoft Word better described as series of instructions, or as an object? In this case, OOP makes much more sense because you are developing a *thing*, and that thing is composed of many smaller things like buttons and menus and widgets. It makes it much easier for our brains to decompose the task of coding Microsoft Word into manageable subtasks in a way that effectively reduces complexity.In reality, most languages these days include elements of many different programming paradigms, there are very few languages that are purely one paradigm. This is nice because you don’t have to commit completely to one paradigm if there are little parts of your project that would be better done in another. JavaScript mixes OOP concepts with functional programming which works well for web developers since functional programming is great for dealing with network protocols.",

Done cleanly it can certainly work, but it's rarely done properly and often results in much more complication than is really required.As a learning pattern it is something that really seems to \"click\" with people in theory, but implementing in practice it brings in more natural bias about how things \"really exist\" even if that doens't make sense for the actually requirements for the code.You can frequently see this with beginners who want to do something like write a game, the first thing they will is start listing out object types and quickly realize that half the time \"Enemy\" should be a \"Unit\", but other times it should be a \"Targetable\" or something and often end up with inheritance trees that look like spider webs.With practice you can learn to manage this better, but it never fundamentally changes the fact that model isn't actually that great in the first place.I think a lot of people have spent so much time hearing the supposed benefits of OOP that they have never seriously questioned that fact.",

Management tells you to add a feature so buyers can be enticed to buy a new version, and the more you look at what has to change to make the feature work, the more impossible it seems.Object-oriented code is a way to manage complexity, and make it possible to add to the code without having to understand all of it.

These days functional programming is what is in vogue, though that too leads to some rather tortured codes in places. Traditionally Object oriented languages have acquired features to support it. Note that a lot of the new up and coming languages like Go and Rust only include a subset of Object oriented features.Java is an excellent example of this. Version 1.0 was a small neat and Object oriented language, and over time it has acquired a whole lot of syntax that makes it look like a Functional language. And Java derivatives like Kotlin that this even further.",

I don't know how to put it into words. But they definitely see it as a skill to become better and more proficient in.I see it as a means to an end for artistic expression. A beautiful tool to make whatever you might imagine, digitally a reality with enough time and effort.I don't care about optimization, I don't care about what is proper, or better, or easier. I just do what's fun. I enjoy the simplicity of SQL ( I was better at it than my director only a few months in haha), I enjoy the chaotic free-for-all that JavaScript is, and I enjoy the approachability of C#.But most of all, I enjoy seeing things just work. I get so excited seeing technology able to make things function. Watching code full from a database and vice versa for the first time made me so excited.If you want to enjoy programming, just find what makes you happy, don't try and be \"The next best thing\", or be like everyone else. Otherwise, just see it as a tool to make you a lot of money, or more efficient.Regardless, figure out what exactly you want to do with these skills, and it will quickly become a lot easier to approach.",

So, an important part of this activity is finding interesting problems and solving them. The satisfaction obtained when our solution works (and we or the user found it useful) is like a painter or sculptor feels seeing her/his last finished opus.Keep learning; search about the evolution of programming, languages, paradigms, models, etc., be amazed about the persistence of people using wood and rocks to build smart buildings and smarter bridges between them. Do you know there are languages that can do calculations and solve any problem using only colors, strange symbols, or where the code is so that you can sing it with a guitar? (Tip: look for \"be a Rockstar programmer\"). This field is amazing, just dig, and do keep solving...!",

I really think to make it in this field it has to be something you genuinely enjoy otherwise you'll get burned out and hate your job because it is a mentally taxing task. I had the same experience as you with regards to writing. I spent too many years trying to be a writer because I enjoyed the idea of writing, but I didn't actually like doing it, I was always forcing myself to do it and I didn't understand why it was so hard to motivate myself. So I know your experience and why despite not actually enjoying it, you're still trying to force yourself to do it.But with programming, I actually didn't like the idea of it, I refused to learn it for so long. I thought it was too difficult and didn't want to put in the effort to learn. But then I took a programming course one day and it just clicked immediately and I realized I actually really really like it.That's a big thing I've learned about life. Sometimes your dreams are not meant to be. Sometimes what you think your dream is, isn't actually what you would genuinely be good at and enjoy.

        "body": "Amidst all these optimistic comments, I’m going to shatter some dreams. It is only my opinion but here we go.Employers won’t except you to know everything, but they’ll expect you to know the basics very well. The tech industry is built on tons of abstraction. In our ‘modern times’, new, complex, shiny technologies are abstracted away to a point where using them is very easy. This makes it more and more common for underlying concepts to go overlooked.An example is the frontend web development world today. We constantly see new shiny web frameworks that make the development precess so much easier, and alongside them, the big frameworks trying to catch up. And as a result we see teenagers ‘vibe coding’ SaaS apps with minimal understanding.This is a slippery slide that makes you feel productive and confident in your programming abilities. Makes you think you can definitely land a job already.In reality, most employers don’t need people who can use new tools. They need engineers who can solve difficult problems. To become an engineer you need to have a very deep understanding of the fundamentals before going into the advanced stuff. Frankly, the fundamentals are not even about one’s ability to code or use different technologies, but rather theory that you learn by reading and practicing with pen and paper.In my opinion, the best way to land a job is by mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (that means reading books and studying them, not solving random LeetCode problems), Networking, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems and Unix, Databases and RDBMSs, OOP, and the cherries on top - a low level language (C or C++ - understanding explicit memory management and having the need to implement everything on your own is very good for practice), and a high level language (Java, C#, Go, Python, JavaScript, etc - pick your poison).Of course ’mastering’ these concepts is subjective. There is no right answer as to at which stage of that exactly, one will be able to land a job. However, learning about all of these concepts to a decent extent is the fastest way to land a good job in the field.",

Lets take on C++ strings and string processing first, then. Try doing the basic stuff... make a string from a constant, append to it, find a substring, convert it to uppercase, and so on. All those common things you do regularly. Use only C++, no cheating and using c-string tools or the string to cstring conversion.From there, I would master the vector class. You don't have to understand the template syntax fully yet, just know that its vector variablename format and work it from there. Work the learncpp chapter on vectors hard.NOW, with your feet a little wetter, give classes and object oriented programming chapters a look, and start working that stuff.A couple of things to forget from C for a while: pointers. Just forget them for now. You can circle back later, but code without using any at all for a while. Iterators are OK to use. macros. Don't use them unless strictly necessary, like a debug tool to spew a line number. As with pointers, just don't go there for a while, get used to coding without them, and circle back later once the C is a bit of a distant memory and less of a habit.As you move forward, I would alternate a day to study c++ differences with a chapter or two on the deep topics. For example (literally!), the c++ for loop has a new twist, you can iterate over a container with loops that look like for(type &t : container) and t will advance through the elements of container, becoming each one in turn. If referenced, its the real value, if not, its a copy, and that is a big deal for performance and behaviors both, to get that & or not absolutely correct. This is similar but not exactly akin to something like for(int \\*ip = arrayname; ip < &arrayname\\[max\\]; ip++)",

Continue on the current road**Learn other languages / frameworks for backend development: Java Spring Boot, JavaScript Express, C# w Razor/Blazor, Python w Django / Flask, or whichever combination you find. Something new but well known.**2. Go deeper in the professional development career**Learn more about the infrastructure around coding: all the DevOps branches, testing, automated testing, dev containers, docker, github actions, deployment, CI/CD and so on - become a \"software developer\" more than a programmer, and understand the environment around the software.**3. Go deeper in programming**You have some low level C++ knowledge, but do you understand data structures and algorithms, do you know how a linked list is built, or why a hashmap is as fast as it is? While these aren't necessarily required skills in this day and age, it helps to understand more about the machine, more about why programming works the way it does, and it can be very code-nerdy fun.**4. Take the alternate route**Try something completely new: * perhaps **frontend programming** (which would be a nice match for your backend knowledge), learn some React, try to build frontends for your existing backends* or **games programming** \\- pick a language and framework you like, and play around with making small games - if you like designing complex programs, that can be a great challenge, and could be an excellent hobby, if not exactly job-oppertunities* or **hardware programming** \\- buy an Arduino or similar small scale microcontroller, and play around with controlling lights and motors. If you feel up to it, try to do without the libraries, and learn how to actually control the hardware. Can be very challenging, but also great fun, and the physical aspect makes it feel a bit different than programming, while still giving you lots of practice.* or **app development** \\- try to make small apps for your phone, small things that you can use yourself, and decide if you want to expand in to better UI or more AI once you get going.Right now there's no guaranteed direction that will make you a lot of money, so pick the one you deem most fun, and try it out. You will always become a better programmer than you already are, no matter which direction you pick!",

        "body": "I have a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and used to work as a [backend developer](https://roadmap.sh/backend) for multiple companies including Amazon. For the list of common professions in the Computer Science world, see: https://roadmap.sh/ I'm going to go through what you wrote one line at a time.> \"So, I'm in my first year of college and honestly, everything in tech seems super interesting—whether it's web development, AI/ML, DevOps, or cybersecurity. The problem is, I don’t know which one to choose, as I don't know much about them.\"You start with the foundations that they all have in common. For example, regardless of whether you are doing full-stack web development in JavaScript, Machine Learning development in Python, DevOps scrips in bash, PowerShell, or Python, or red team cybersecurity penetration testing scripts in Python, you have to know how to code. First, you need to learn programming fundamentals like variables, integers, Strings, booleans, conditions, operators, loops, functions, etc. Then after that, you need to learn Object Oriented Programming (OOP) like classes, class inheritance (subclasses), interfaces, methods vs. functions, etc. At some point you should probably also take a class called \"discrete math\" that covers the math of logic (and, or, not, true, false, etc.). This class (in the University of Michigan course list): https://eecs203.github.io/eecs203.org/ Also, for most of those specialties, a Computer Networking class is also useful (note that this is a 400 level class, so students usually take it in their 4th year of undergraduate university studies): https://github.com/mosharaf/eecs489> \"Everyone says, 'Pick what interests you,' but that’s the thing—I like all of it, and it’s kinda confusing.\"You don't have to pick a specialty in Computer Science right away. Look at the list at https://roadmap.sh/ and know you can be in university for years before deciding on a specialty. Sometimes you don't even make a conscious decision, life circumstances and availability end up deciding for you. Like I know one guy who graduated with a Computer Science degree but couldn't get a coding job but did land an on-premise server I.T. job, and then he ended up going that route and eventually managing/supervising a huge number of on-premise servers. Circumstances ended up choosing for him.> \"How can I try out these different fields for a small amount of time and figure out what I actually enjoy the most?\"Maybe check out various subreddits, follow them, and eventually send professionals in those subreddits chat requests to ask them about their profession. To help me find subreddits, I start with a Reddit search and then use The Map of Reddit (Google \"Map of Reddit\", it's a website to help you find related or interconnected subreddits). For example, for Machine Learning there is r/MachineLearning and r/LearnMachineLearning , maybe r/DataScience . For experienced developers there is r/ExperiencedDevs . For backend developers there is r/backend . There is also r/fullstack , r/WebDev , and r/frontend . Then there are subreddits for the individual programming languages like r/java , r/LearnJava , r/Python , r/LearnPython , etc.> \"I'd really appreciate some simple advice on where to start and how to explore without feeling overwhelmed.\" Start with the foundations that multiple different professions in the tech industry have in common. For example, backend developers, data science people, data analytics people, data engineers, and software engineering team managers all need to know databases and SQL. Thus, this class, Database Management Systems, should be a class you take at some point: https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1JK6_nmwkouMnU3gtD9AF085hR_LhPKIL1bVPzRAS8MA/mobilebasic?pli=1 But yeah, start with establishing a foundation that spans across multiple different professions. Keep your body and mind healthy and sharp, and never stop learning so you can pivot as necessary. Who knows what will be most in demand when you graduate.",

If there are a lot, then you're learning the right language. If there aren't, then it's not entirely useless. Learning any language will teach you some coding principles and practices. This is good, because the ideas are transferrable to other languages. And if you're in school learning computer programming as a concept, you may as well learn them in the language it's being taught in. But bear in mind you'll have to learn the more popular language, like Python, when you've graduated. So let's assume you're learning the wrong language. For instance, maybe the employers in your town all use Python instead. How do you get ahead? My suggestion is to find out what is the most popular language used by the industry in your town, and then start a club on campus where you *teach* it. To be able to teach it, go to [Software-Carpentry.org](http://Software-Carpentry.org) . They have courses that are ready to teach in a variety of popular languages, it's just a matter of learning how to teach the curriculum, and doing the work to practice teaching it. Luckily, they also have self-paced courses that teach you how to teach. And by teaching, you learn. Once you've graduated, saying that you TAUGHT a popular language at a university club will make you stand out.",

Nonetheless you can learn programming basics with it, very well, and use the knowledge for other languages later on. You just need to learn to adapt to a new syntax/library functions.Knowledge of Assembly is good! It will teach you how computers work internally, and what high-level languages work with. Knowing it, you will be able to write more efficient and realistic code. But it is only seldom used nowadays in application programming. It is used in some embedded projects, even when C compilers are way more standard, or platforms running slim interpreters for script languages. It is still useful for some isolated use cases for extreme hand-tuned optimizations, hacking, reverse-engineering etc.The Graphic design you describe as making graphics with basic library functions by a basic or assembly header, I understand. Well, it is toddler stuff fpr beginners imho. You can learn programming with it, and collect experience. But later you will have to move on and learn to use more professional solutions for graphics design.Even if you study these topics in university, I'd recommend you to privately stay busy with more widespread, professional components, i.e. python, java(-script)/typescript, C/C++, ... Another benefit of these languages is, aside possible involvement in way more professional production projects, that you can massively learn from the open source scene using these languages, i.e. on GitHub, and you can get all the tools and docs you need for free from the internet!",

I still learnt because I wanted to gain a deeper understanding regardless of if Bob over there could do it 10x faster. Same here. Cs isn’t all programming. There’s other stuff that you do on the job that ai hasn’t been able to do yet. Why do you think OpenAI bought a vs code fork (windsurf) for $3b if their latest unreleased ai was reported to be the top 50 coder? Cuz coding isn’t everything.Stop comparing yourself to others or ai. Just learn because you’re passionate about it, same reason I learnt. And if you’re not passionate about it, I’m afraid you won’t succeed in cs.

The ai creates code based off what I prompt it for, so I'm telling it what I want to make, it generates code to do it, I type it out but I hit enter to use intellisence completion rather than AI prediction completion, so it is kind of teaching me how to write the code quicker if I wasn't using AI.Then I always have to make sure I know what the generated code is doing so I know how the functions work and what they're doing exactly. It's just a lot faster to learn now with AI assisting because you don't have to spend days reading and searching to decide what data type to use, instead I ask AI for recommendations and it tells me pros and cons and then I decide what to do.",

I think that you end up with lots of holes in your knowledge if you just hack away at something without some sort of guide. I don't agree with your friend, partially because AI currently produces terrible code and is often wrong about what it does, and partially because having a conceptual framework is important to software development in order to apply existing knowledge to new problems. If you only have a mechanistic understanding, then you have to spend time learning every single time you are presented with something new, instead of applying existing knowledge. That being said, learning by doing is the best way to remember what you learned and to get a sense of how to apply it. Having an entirely conceptual understanding of something is not useful either.",

It’s not just about what the code means, but also how to use it effectively and how to solve problems when things go wrong.I’d recommend starting with sites like:[https://www.w3schools.com/](https://www.w3schools.com/)There are many other usefull resources as well.

If you can't handle that delay after having typed in a command, of course you should go with the faster version ...Anyways, never believe anyone talking about how some constructs in the programming language are faster or slower than others - usually they are wrong, and perpetuate myths started by 1970s assembly-programmers. And a note to those, who think that a string comparison takes additional time - it doesn't. In all modern languages, strings are immutable and handled by the runtime, which means that comparing one string to another is as simple as comparing two addresses - it is as fast as comparing any other value!",

The idea of fixing a slow program because you believe long if statements make it slow is often termed as premature optimization (not the specific reason, but any reason you think a program is slow).It's often more important that a program be readable if it's fast enough, and likely, it's going to be fast enough. If you have evidence it's running slow, then you can look at *profiling* a program. This means using a program called a *profiler*. Many beginners still choose to optimize without a profiler because it's just one more tool they need to learn, and they'd rather guess what's slow.If you insist, you can create a HashMap (or whatever C# has) that maps the command string to a something that implements a Command interface. You can pass the command line and the args. interface Command { void runCommand(String command, SomeType lineArgs); }Replace `SomeType` with the actual type.You would create this map in an initialization phase (static constructor, say). You'd do something like // commandMap is a hash map Command obj = commandMap.get(commandName); obj.runCommand(commandName, lineArgs);It is a bit more complicated to get this set up, but not a whole lot more.",

Don't worry until you have a reason to worry. Why are you thinking about this now? What does the loop do? Do you have a hard time constraint you are trying to stay within? Don't optimize prematurely. That doesn't mean you should write fast and shitty code, just that you need to learn the optimal amount of \"should I consider this now\" vs \"note this as a place to consider if execution time becomes and issue\".I am a firm believer in not putting off refactor if you see problems, but beyond keeping good, clean, defensive coding practices, overthinking problems that haven't even presented themselves yet will just drive you fucking crazy.B: You have decided to listen to random people give you \"this is how it is\" advice instead of exploring and learning about how if/else and switch might differ in the resulting assembly. Stop letting other people answer your questions with other things you don't understand. The internet is full of fucking nonsense, and I read TONS of it being given as confident \"this is how it is\" programming advice when the reality is ALWAYS more complicated and nuanced. Get curious. The answer to your question is out there and well explained by someone who actually knows what they are talking about.Anyway, what you are doing is fine. Using a switch might make it look a little cleaner if it gets longer. I would also look up using function pointers and a dispatch table, more as a thought experiment. Function pointers seem outlandish at first but are an amazing tool to be comfortable with. If you want to DM me at any point, I do light tutoring for free and I think this is a cool problem to talk about a few interesting design patterns.edit: I dropped the term \"function pointer\" in this without thinking language. Deep in my C work right now. Dispatch table/pattern is still a great idea, but ignore my usage of the term function pointer.",

Then I learned building small tools gave me structure. If I didn’t understand how to solve a problem I would Google until I had an idea. Over time, the small tools and projects are what filled the knowledge gaps and really solidified concepts and patterns. You just have to get your hands virtually dirty. The grocery item tracking app is a great start. Or tic tac toe, the game of life, or even a small app to read and parse data from a web API. You’ll learn it doesn’t matter what language you start with, the concepts and ideas of “programming” transcends the language itself. Just pick one and go.As for “thinking like a programmer” , for me it was thousands of hours grinding on problems before I started to see the world as I do now. It sounds to me like you just need to program.",

Once you have some momentum and confidence start working on bigger things. Final though: IF you feel like you don't know how to code stop messing with libraries and frameworks. Just stick to one of the primary languages and get very comfortable with that. You need a foundation, putting up walls before the concrete is poured is silly.",

As a matter of fact, I ended up leading a team as Tech Lead of 9 people.What helped me was always trying to learn more. Fing blogs like Daily Brew ..... read up on different technologies. Work to learn best practices and make sure you aren't complacent about things like continuous deployment, source control, and design practices. When you read comments about lone developers that ended up with problems, they always mentioned that they had their way of doing things, and usually they were not documented, no source control, etc.Working with other devs, I was surprised by how similar the issues a Python dev or a UI guy has run into.

You did not list it, but maybe just because it is so obvious to you.If it does include playing chess: build a chess game first.After you did what others told you about learning: Write down a small stepped roadmap: e.g. 1. open and close app window. 2. Draw empty chess board 3. Draw pieces in start position 4. Define internalBoard state and draw that. 5. Have regression tests on state. 6. Detect and report on invalid states, etc.Stick to the roadmap. If it gets hard to reach 3. don’t start with 4. Otherwise you will end up with many half done steps and be frustrated.",

I’d take a moment and get a stretch goal laid out of a project that incorporates these tools step at a time. Example: create a list with an “exit” or key search term. Then optimize your solution for a bigger data set. Lastly use a popular search algorithm (binary search for example) to implement for your solution. Did it decrease your run time? Can you do it in less lines of code? Optimization is one of the key tasks all scientists have to learn as they’re testing in the field. Don’t treat computer programming any different.

I had a great experience with it and can only highly recommend it.Then I did two \"nano degrees\" from [www.udacity.com](http://www.udacity.com). They are super expensive. A very good thing, though, is they give you projects to build yourself.The problem with most self-paced paths is that the instructors shows you something that you copy.

Alternatively you could use scratch to introduce him to programming concepts such as variables, loops and conditionals as well as help develop an algorithmic mindset which is honestly one of the most valuable things you can have. Knowing the syntax of the language is one thing, but the most important part of coding something is knowing how to think within the bounds of computer language.Once he has some footing, he might want to try out godot. It's what i'm using to make my rhythm game and the coding while incredibly flexible and powerful, has easy to learn syntax. Don't get me wrong it's a proper engine and has all the bells and whistles, but it's accessible compared to something like unreal.The other alternative is gamemaker which doesn't have coding, it has logic blocks that you connect together visually. Unreal has something similar and deeper called blueprints but unreal is the premier game engine on the market, very much not suitable for beginners and the actual coding in unreal is C++, pretty much the most beginner unfriendly (but powerful) language you could learn.",

In addition, since your specifically interested in web development, I'd recommend the Odin project. It has a lot of front end stuff, and it is really well made I think (also free). The two of those combined should really set you up for both backend and frontend development. Some other great resources are freeCodeCamp, Coursera, and edX. Coursera and edX have some free courses, I think Harvard's CS50 is often the go to recommend for a first course in coding on here. freeCodeCamp is just awesome in my opinion.

First thing you'll do is get acquainted with learning techniques that can be applied to any subject. Then you'll learn the most necessary parts of basic web development using HTML, CSS, JS. Then, backend systems, and then, you'll learn about frontend JS frameworks. Finally, you'll build a real project, an application that you would use. That's just the practical stuff, though. There are plenty of lessons that go into CS concepts like OOP, Data Structure & Algorithms, etc. On top of that, you'll learn how to build a network. Going into 3 more years of college with that skill and you will definitely have a job before you graduate. Oh, and your classmates who are getting paid for their side projects? Well, part of the program is to get your own client, make a little money, and beef up your resume.I started 100devs December 2021 with basically no coding knowledge and had a job by September 2022 with no CS degree; I'm employed today and the skills I learned there have kept me well above that pack of other folks with the same YOE and degrees. It is more of a Job program than a bootcamp, but the way the coding is taught is really easily digestible. Technically, the program is like 7-9 months, but I finished(including the big project) in about 5, and that was with a job and other adult responsibilities; I imagine a summer would be enough time to get through it if you don't have much else going on. I tried to stick to the two classes a week schedule like when they did it live, but it didn't take long before I was watching at 2x and skipping big portions of the videos, so accelerating is definitely possible.Lots of people say \"Build stuff\", \"Do projects\", etc.; I think that's definitely something you should do, but it isn't super helpful for someone in your position. You'll build lots of things with the technologies that you're learning doing 100devs.Best of luck!",

Or if you studied a foreign language, ask yourself how long it took. Was it just magic that you learned it? Probably not.Learning to program is somewhat similar. You start from basics and progress from there. Maybe the a-ha moment is understanding how a program runs or making your first algorithm, but it isn't a single a-ha moment, and it doesn't mean one day you don't know how to program, and the next day you're churning out code.There's always new stuff to learn (whether you choose to or not) and it's done in steps. Have you ever seen people who draw really well. Sometimes they post their drawings over the years from stuff just better than stick figures. Sure, maybe there's a year it starts to take a big leap forward, but there's often more progress after that.We all want shortcuts, but they aren't always there.For a recommendation, try (web search: `MOOC Java`). This is a free course in Java. You can do it in C# instead, but if you do it in Java, there's automated grading. The key is to do all the programming exercises, and not just read. As you do this, you can do the equivalent in C# which is reasonably similar to Java.",

In any job, you are going to have good points and bad points. And as real professionals, though, we must find \"stomach\" to cope with the unenjoyable bits as well, at least in a professional manner.There are certain types of programming that are enjoyable for some folk and not to others. For example, Web Development, Frontends, etc. Some people really enjoy doing that kind of work, and others find it kind of dreadful or annoying. You have to learn what kind of programming or systems \"get you up in the morning\" as it were.But if you don't enjoy programming ITSELF, then I'm not sure what can be done. There are always annoying parts to the craft, as well, but once you have done it for a while you know you can get \"to the goal\" and that is always a good feeling for me. For example, if you don't understand how something works yet you need to understand, then that is annoying at first, but you know that you can eventually \"get it good enough\" to accomplish the task. Or, if you are in a greuiling debugging session then again it's frustrating, but with experience you know that you can either find the bug eventually (even if it's just one dumb typo) OR can find it or learn to find solutions to work around it if it is too elusive. In any case, once you achieve these goals, it's ultimately going to trigger dopamine in the brain and will become addictive in a good way (basically a self-fulfilling positive cycle in psychology). And this is probably ultimately the thing that helps us avoid the so-called \"burn-out\" feeling.",

JQuery is really for modifying the DOM (styling and what you see on a webpage) so you can tangibly see your changes happen 'live'.When you boil it right down, JavaScript is really just: * Variables (var, let, const) - places to store bit of data * Arrays and Objects (arrayName[data], objectName{dataKey: data}) - places to store many bits of data that are related to each other * Conditionals (if, else if, else) - ways to run different pieces of code depending on something, usually the value of a variable * Loops (for, while, do while) - ways to run the same piece of code over and over again * Functions (someFunction(someArgument)) - ways to reuse a piece of code in many places without having to re-write it.There are a lot of complicated terms to describe many variations of the same ideas. There can be confusing, but they still really just boil down to these core ideas. Eg \"ternaries\" are just short-hand conditionals. \"Iterations\" are just another work for loops.The problem with Boot Camps is they go so fast. Like showing people a basic `while` loop for the first time than 15 minutes later moving on to telling them how to use `map()`.",

My concern would be that you're struggling to get through the content, even when taking ADHD meds. If you don't have a genuine interest in programming (as in, actually programming, not \"what you think programming is\"), then it isn't unlikely that it's just... \"not your thing\". You don't need to be a math genius, or be able to perfectly follow code in your mind, but you do need to be interested. A lot of the developers I know could take ADHD meds and program for 18 hours straight. It make them insatiable.At some point, you'll need to learn more about data structures, algorithms, and memory (which is usually what the Bootcamps skip). I tried my hardest not to learn that stuff for as long as possible, but eventually... you just need to. It helps you recognize problems and how to solve them.JavaScript is particularly tricky (even though it's also beginner-friendly) because it's the only language that has built-in templating, windowing, rendering, and styling (HTML, the browser, and CSS). Vanilla JS teaches you about manually manipulating The DOM, but the second you move into more professionally-oriented work, you'll likely be using frameworks like React that abstract The DOM away. So they teach you all this \"document.querySelector\" stuff in JS, it's unlike anything in any other language, and when you've finally figured it out, they say \"just kidding, we usually use libraries to do that for us\".JS and all of it's libraries, packages, and frameworks update regularly. Syntax changes, frameworks fade in and out of popularity, and you'll need to keep up. I'm autistic with ADHD, and for me that's a benefit. It keeps changing, but it keeps getting better, the tools are fun and relatively easy to use, and I enjoy trying and learning all of the new stuff. Keeps me from getting bored and keeps me sharp.Bootcamps are intended to jump-start you. So they'll walk you through database, server, and user interface - relatively quickly - so you have a reasonable understanding of how to build a complete application, even if you don't perfectly understand the languages, syntax, and tools being used. It's just a starting point.For Vanilla JS, as is always recommended in this subreddit, [https://javascript.info/](https://javascript.info/) is the best, most modern, comprehensive, interactive tutorial. If you can get through part 1 (save part 2 and part 3 for later), you'll have a really good understanding of Vanilla JS, it's tools and it's syntax (depending on how well you learn, and how well you integrate what you learn).",

So you don't need to search for it. But you still need to traverse the *k*-1 preceding items to reach your target. That's the access runtime.And so on like that, for all the data structures that have access times listed on that website. But a hash table has no stable order. So there can be no cogent concept of \"accessing the *k*th element\". You have to search every time. (At least that's the argument for the N/A, I think!)",

So if access here means \"get element at an index in the list\" then yeah it's arguably not applicable.

To stick with your example, attempting to create your own Carousel module might seem tedious, but it might be great practice nonetheless. Understanding how it works in its core principle is important for you to be able to be able understand how somebody else's Carousel module has been implemented so you may be able to add such a package and implement it efficiently and as intended in future projects.The order of importance is1. UNDERSTAND2. Import3. AdjustToo many freaking people skip step 1.

For smart home features I'm curious what you'd charge, 200$ profit for motion and voice lights, 17-20 for materials, 60 for the extra functionality, you're already paying the 300 in this option so total price comes out to 570 now. They buy their own lights so customer cost goes into the 650s-700s. So it does get a bit crazy on the customers end.. since I've never seen this service offered and definitely not peer to peer I don't have any baseline though. Garage door opener is another big seller if they bought the lights I'll bundle in the door for 50 profit on my side, they see around 70$ additional charge. If they didn't starting is still 200. Temperature controls if above it bought I'll bundle it for 100 additional profit, this I know I should increase since people always have weird requests when it comes to temperature. Always gotta modify this one. The watering feature is definitely under priced but people treat it as a novelty and walk away from the additional 160 even though that's only 100$ profit on my end. When I do get a sale it's just a script flip and hand off the hardware with instructions, for a very hard sell in minimal time I almost want to remove the option but something is better than nothing I guess.

It can probably be done with just some really snarky batch file, depending on what exactly you have and what exactly you need to do beyond the stated stuff. I highly recommend looking into this idea. The learning curve is very low, just poweruser stuff instead of full on software engineering level. that said, a windows .exe file is generated by turning a programming language (the stuff YOU write) into machine code (the .exe file), which is done by the tools (compiler and linker for example in C++) for that programming language. Some languages are 'interpreted' and do not make an executable program, but instead run directly from the source code. That may also be ok for your needs, but any computer using the program would require the tools to run it, which are not default installed on windows. A windows program that makes actual windows (the GUI) take more know-how, as you have to learn the tools to make the windows and widgets on them. This can be little more than glorified drag and drop to build, but even so, there is some learning curve to it. If you don't do those things, the program will be a 'command line program' and work under the cmd shell (dos shell) that you may or may not use (its part of windows). Such programs just accept typed text and print out response text to the shell, 1980s style. Even when you make a windows exe, the target computer may need something you used -- its often a shocker to beginners that other computers lack the debug libraries so debug mode executables won't usually run on other machines. Be sure to run the program on the target machine and that it works properly there.",

It's a simple language with a wide ecosystem so things like working in excel or sending emails are really simple to do. Next, install an interpreter for Python so you can run code you write. [Here's the download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3133/). Download and install it. It will come with a tool called IDLE you can use to write code in. People may prefer other code editors like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that can make writing code easier, so you can look into them but may not see benefit yet. It's worth adding the code interpreter won't create an executable file, but will run your code files. Then pick up a guide for learning Python. There are tons of YouTube tutorials and Udemy courses. Id recommend [Automate the Boring Stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) because it covers everything you want to do.",

        "body": "If you’re on Windows, just start with Cygwin; it’s very similar to a Linux, but it runs natively on WinAPI without blocking it from you. (Properly, it’s a POSIX operating environment.)MinGW comes with some of the same gunk, even forked from Cygwin, but gives you a much thinner shim around WinAPI, which ranges from irritating to miserable for beginners. (E.g., the Windows environment of the NT kernel—now the sole one AFAIK—has two separate subsystems, console and graphical, and they expose slightly different APIs and behaviors. Cygwin matches other Unixes in model and behavior, which means you can follow Unix tutorials, and if you’re careful with `LONG` vs. `long` you can probably follow some Windows ones too.)WSL2 is another option, but it’s stood off from Windows itself by a hypervisor, which means you don’t get good access to things inside the Linux domain from outside or vice versa.Otherwise, chances are you’re already on Unix. Apple’s Darwin (incl. OS/X→macOS, iOS, watchOS, tvOS, etc. ad ridiculam) is in the FreeBSD family, which derives from Jolix which is a clean-room BSD/Net2 Unix. Linux wasn’t forked from anything, but its kernel tends more towards the AT\\&T family of Unixes culminating in System V, rev 4 (SVr4). Android is a variant of Linux using Bionic as libc and very little in the way of shell environment; desktop Linuxes tend to use the GNU libc and environment, of which Bash and GCC are also constituents.On Android, you can install F-Droid and thereby Termux and Programmer’s Keyboard; immediately run `pkg update && pkg upgrade`, then you can install your preferred packages. Termux layers GNU onto Android, giving you a rough, subordinated desktop Linux environment.For desktop Linux, I use Neon, which is an Ubuntu variant for KDE, which is my preferred windowing environment; Ubuntu is a vast family of Debian-based distributions, so pretty much anything major will do—Mint is supposed to be reasonably good, but you do you. Konsole (part of KDE, but runs anyway) is imo the best terminal available on Linux (also works for Cygwin and Win-per-se); open it up, start a [shell tutorial](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview), and you’re good. If shit ever breaks, Ctrl+Alt+Fkey will usually drop you to a lower-level terminal, so monkeying is never far away.Most Unixes uses Bash for their interactive shell nowadays, though POSIX mandates certain characteristics for the baseline shell environment, and older systems tend to have their own, quirky Bourne shells. IIRC modern Linux tends to use Ash or Dash for POSIX and startup scripts via /bin/sh—Bash used to be used everywhere.For editing, Kate (also KDE) is a very good GUI (MDI) editor for getting started with, but I strongly recommend you at least install Vim and start learning the basics, whether or not you use it for day-to-day work. It comes with a built-in tutorial, and it’s pretty straightforward to pick up. Very useful when you’re three ssh forwards deep, trying to resurrect a very custom, in-flight supercompute batch job, for example.So that’s 1½ languages to start with, Bash and Vim.I’d probably start in on a C tutorial, also—prefer GCC or Clang; under no circumstances should you use MSVC for C or C++ unless you’re being paid to or have no choice in the matter. Also, I’d recommend staying away from full IDEs in general for just now, since you don’t need all the extra trappings. Build directly from command line, and try to engage directly with the terminal where it’s not counterpurpose. Get a feel for imperativeness.IIRC for Apple, you get a Clang-in-GNU’s clothing with XCode, but I don’t do their nonsense so that may have changed. XCode itself is a …fine editor, but probably overkill for your purposes—syntax highlighting will often not line up with what the compiler actually sees or does.On Linux and Cygwin, you go through the usual package management tools for compilers, or build them yourself if feeling adventurous. `pkg install gcc` for Termux, `pkcon install gcc` for Neon, `apt-get install gcc` for Ubuntu, `yum install gcc` for RedHat, and Arch has its own, fancy mess.If you install all the goodies—sometimes from separate foo-doc packages accompanying foo—you should have Bash `help` built-in command, a `man` command to acess manual pages (e.g., `man man` for man’s manpage), `whatis` and `apropos` to search for manpages, and `info` to browse the info manuals. (E.g., `man gcc` tells you how to run the `gcc` command, and `info gcc` tells you how to use it. /usr/share/doc may also have some goodies.)I recommend installing the POSIX manpages alongside native, where available, and bookmarking or downloading the 2001–2004, 2008–2018, and 2024 editions of the [POSIX standards](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/), which is what you aim for if you want your code to be portable to other OSes in the Unix family. (Links to prior versions at bottom of that index page—only 2001/12, 2008/09, and 2024/05 editions are recognizable from within the C-language build environment. You can also find 1988 and 1990 versions as FIPS-151-1 and FIPS-151-2, FWTW and FTTB.)If you learn C, K\\&R’s *The C Programming Language,* 2ed (1988—not 1ed from 1978) is the usual approach vector, and you can easily find free copies to work from. It’s a bit out of date, but so is most C software, and you can push forwards from C89 pretty easily using the draft standards, or backwards using XPG, TCPL/1ed, and compiler manuals.[ISO WG14](https://open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/projects.html) is presently in charge of the language (qua ISO/IEC 9899), so they produce standards docs that form the backbone of the language. The final drafts are effectively equivalent text for free, so they form the most portable layer undergirding the language, and then dialect extensions (e.g., GNU, MS), POSIX and X/Open, and other environmental stuff layers atop that. If you want to know whether something ought to be “legal” or not, start at the standard for your language version and then look at your compiler and ABI manuals for how the blanks are filled in.Good luck! I’d probably run through to pointers, then take a dip into assembly and come back, but delve however you like. Most of the system software is in C or C++, and if you’re on Linux, the source code is readily available to explore and play with, so you can reconstruct pretty much everything to your choosing.",

That's why salaries are good, and still, there are not enough professionals. I think the best thing to do is patiently follow a good book, a good tutorial. There were written carefully, many times by teachers, thinking about the best way to explain things to students.

It often tries to move me onto other ways of doing things but for my own projects I focus on my understanding first. You can tell in one glance projects that were built “with”/by AI. For my final project I had like 15 or 16 jFrames involved, the code was drastically different through each section as my skills were improving. For my review I was able to explain multiple concepts and give reasons why I chose this approach and which one I would use in what scenario going forward. AI should be a tool not the conductor.

The answer is \"Yes, it's possible, because people play in the NBA\", but it is nearly impossible for almost everyone.The odds that you can become a front-end developer are far greater than being in the NBA, which means it's hard to guess whether you can or can't. That's the risk you take. You have to be willing to spend time to get good regardless of whether you make it or not. There are hundreds of thousands of people that want to play in the NBA, and they try really hard. Fortunately, many can play at a much lower level (for fun, at a high school, in college, etc) and so they can gain some satisfaction in doing that even if they can't earn millions of dollars. They want to believe they can make it, which is why they try. You have to delude yourself that you can, until enough evidence presents itself that you can't (or you lose interest).A potential problem with your dream is why you haven't started it. If you are second-guessing yourself (\"Should I do it or shouldn't I do it? What are the odds I will succeed?\"), then you can run into trouble. Either you have to convince yourself that you are good enough to do it, or you have to say you're going to give it all you've got and not worry whether you're good enough or not because those kinds of worries just stop you from making progress.And really, that's the danger. Once you have doubts, and they start to impact whether you'll learn enough, that can stop you. If you had other goals like \"I want to write a small program to play checkers or a simpler game\" then those goals are more achievable right now.I would consider picking a smaller, reachable goal right no, such as, I'm going to spend 3 months taking some online programming course, and see how I feel. If I am still motivated, I'll continue to work on it, rather than make that decision now before you even start.",

Do not listen to people saying straight out \"no\", or \"not possible\", or \"not in current market\", they are **fucking idiots**. They are sheep, and you shouldn't concern yourself with their opinion. I mean for real, ask yourself this: \"If i spent 16 hours daily learning, and live & breath programming every day, including weekends and holidays, then would I be able to catch-up and get a job?\". If you frame it like this, then obviously the answer is yes. It's the same concept when people ask you: \"What are the chances that you make 1m$ this year?\" And majority people respond \"1%, 2%\". Then shift the perspective - \"What are the chances you make 1m$ this year, or else your entire family dies?\" Suddenly everyone answers 100%. It's not the goal or timeframe, it's the perspective. My point is, anyone that is so closed minded to give you a definitive answer to a question that is so open-ended, is a dumbass.I am completely self-taught in everything I have done in my life. I dropped out at age of 16 from high school to pursue business, and when my peers were getting their bachelors, I was buying a new apartment. While that sounds great, it took 16 hours daily for years, my health declined hard, and it frankly, wasn't worth it. I wanted more stability in life, where I still make great money, but not at cost of all my time and health. So I started learning programming to transition, and mind you I started in 2024. In a shitty market, filled with the same comments you see on this thread saying you can't do it, CS is dead, there's no jobs etc.Fast forward to today, and with zero YoE on the job, I am interviewing for Mid positions at various companies and tomorrow I have another job interview with F100 company. Was it easy to get to here? No. In the last 365 days, I probably spent 330 or so coding and learning every day for 8-10 hours. Is it doable though? Absolutely. Fucking. Yes.I was like you though, posting threads on reddit asking if there's future. Until I realized that there is future, but only for people who put in the work, and don't spend their time worrying on reddit. Every hour you spend on a real project of yours, is an hour you get ahead others writing posts on reddit. Which reminds me, it's time for me to prep for the interview. Good luck though, believe in yourself and don't give in to haters.",

I would urge programmers to think about code this wayI would also say that induction and recursion are two sides of the same coin, basically opposites. Recursion takes a case and breaks it down into sub-cases until it gets down to a base case. Induction does the opposite - builds from two base cases every possible sub-case.You can prove your code is correct by doing an induction proof on it - proving the base cases are correct, assuming the recursive calls will provide the right answer, and proving your call will produce the correct result. You can also do this with runtime complexity or amortized analysis. A simpler example is something like merge sort. If you can show ordering 1 element works and is ordered, then show that you can correctly merge two ordered sub-lists into an ordered one, you can prove that your code orders the entire array. This is highly applicable to many problems, and you're on the right track",

        "body": "Hey exact same boat here, untreated ADHD, graduated in December from WGU and work full-time as a mobile diesel technician with an ever changing schedule. I hit it extremely hard with the job search and have only had two interviews first one for full-time junior dev, I bombed. Second one, was an internship at the same company, position got pulled because the current state of our economy. That really killed my motivation.After that I pretty much didn’t touch my laptop until about the middle of March, where there was the first local in person hackathon in my city. I signed up and started to get excited about programming again…and then extremely nervous, because up to that point I realized I got through the degree because the “thought process” & “project requirements” were given to me pretty much on a silver platter. With a mediocre grasp on the fundamentals and no real problem solving experience I didn’t want to look incompetent in front of people that were likely much younger and realistically more experienced than me. So, I went to roadmap.sh and started from the beginning with JavaScript. I got reacquainted with the basics and nuances and went to the event, I was in a group of 4, one took building out the frontend, ironically another guy was currently enrolled with WGU as well and he took the backend, the other was our pitch person and that left me as a floater to just help wherever I could. This was the absolute best position for me! the frontend was next.js/tailwind, backend was spring boot with a Postgres db. I remembered enough about the backend and how everything “worked” that I was able to help there anytime our backend guy got stuck or needed a break and was able to pickup right where he left off, having used typescript at WGU and refreshing my js knowledge I was able to figure out enough of next and tailwind to be helpful there too. This helped in a few ways. Building a fullstack app with stuff I hadn’t used and people I don’t even know in 48hrs showed me 1.) I knew more than I gave myself credit for and 2.) I’m capable and genuinely have a love for programming. We lost but since then I have been steadily keeping detailed notes on project ideas that pop in my head at any given time, so I can work through how to actually get started building them and make it a point to spend the downtimes at work to study, listen and consume tech related things and then when I get home in the evenings even if it’s something as simple as writing a function that does something trivial or solving a problem on codewars, I try and code at least something everyday to make it habit. So far I’ve been able to stay pretty consistent with that. Now that WGU has MSCS programs I’m planning to enroll for that to give me a tangible goal and something to work towards since I doubt the job market is going to turn around anytime soon and I want to gain additional skills in a structured way.I know most of the advice floating around is to network, grind leetcode, move cities, etc, but for some of us that isn’t a possibility at the moment and I say find some way for you that makes you excited to get home and build that project or learn that tech stack or concept and keep getting better a little at a time until you finally get the opportunity to make the career change!",

If you do I would suggest looking up games that are similar to your idea first and take note of which game engines such games use. After that you can compare these game engines by how easy they are to use, how hard is the language they require to know, is the price for your budget etc. Then you can learn the basics of the language of your engine on platforms like Coursera, Udemy etc. You most likely won't be ready to make your game immediately after that, so watching tutorials/ courses on how to develop games (especially the kind of game you want to make) with your specific engine can be the next step.This would be a time-efficient approach if you already have an idea. And once you learn a language, learning a new one is quite easy so if you want you can move onto a new engine in the future without too much struggle, as well. Good luck",

        "body": "From the [docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/ranges-indexes):>A range specifies the start and end of a range. The start of the range is inclusive, but the end of the range is exclusive, meaning the start is included in the range but the end isn't included in the range. The range \\[0..\\^0\\] represents the entire range, just as \\[0..sequence.Length\\] represents the entire range.[A comment](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54092520) on stack overflow contains some sorta lost info on how this came to be:>We decided to follow Python when it comes to the from-beginning and from-end arithmetic. 0 designates the first element (as always), and \\^0 the “length’th” element, i.e. the one right off the end. That way you get a simple relationship, where an element's position from beginning plus its position from end equals the length. the x in \\^x is what you would have subtracted from the length if you’d done the math yourself.>Why not use the minus (-) instead of the new hat (\\^) operator? This primarily has to do with ranges. **Again in keeping with Python and most of the industry, we want our ranges to be inclusive at the beginning, exclusive at the end.** What is the index you pass to say that a range should go all the way to the end? In C# the answer is simple: x..\\^0 goes from x to the end. In Python, there is no explicit index you can give: -0 doesn’t work, because it is equal to 0, the first element! So in Python, you have to leave the end index off completely to express a range that goes to the end: x... If the end of the range is computed, then you need to remember to have special logic in case it comes out to 0. As in x..-y, where y was computed and came out to 0. This is a common nuisance and source of bugs.>Finally, note that indices and ranges are first class types in .NET/C#. Their behavior is not tied to what they are applied to, or even to be used in an indexer. You can totally define your own indexer that takes Index and another one that takes Range – and we’re going to add such indexers to e.g. Span. But you can also have methods that take ranges, for instance.",

If you’re one of those people then I suggest taking a couple Google courses and get yourself a google certification. They look amazing on resumes.Create yourself a LinkedIn page and start networking! There is literally nothing more important than networking in this market. Goto hackathons, tech events in your area, post on linkedin and talk with recruiters etc… Have all your code public on github.And if you’re serious about perusing a job in this market as a junior make sure you can code without AI and code with AI (not vibe coding but using it as a tool to speed up your development)",

        "body": "TypeScript will not fix JavaScript's shortcomings as a weakly typed language, because it doesn't make JavaScript into a strongly typed language any more than, say... data validation.To me it's a linter with lots of DevEx overhead, that makes projects much better for both solo or collaboration. Once you learned TypeScript, you also get used to have a lot of guardrails, and there's no reason to go back to coding without those guardrails as you'll encounter issues at runtime (in the browser console) that will require you to debug more lines of code. It's not a shortcoming for JS, because for a senior JS developer it's part of the job to keep a tight ship, code linearity and easily readable unit tests (see examples of Express in JS), but for someone learning: choose TypeScript as long as it is an option (almost always is nowadays).I even believe that frontend needs TS more than backend, because it's harder to structure frontend for code linearity when you have more important hierarchies such as layouts, components, events, async effects, the DOM... The logic is being called from potentially many different places and it's harder to enforce type consistency everywhere \"by hand\".",

Salary is great, lifestyle is balanced, and you learn a lot. But boy oh boy, you have to dumb a lot of the stuff you learn. It's incredibly hard not having a CS degree to stay focused, a lot of the basics DSA you won't have heard of just because you followed a Udemy course etc. You really have to learn a lot of it, I'm 5 years in and still learn fundamental stuff once in a while. Thankfully with DevOps, it's less coding atm so I can spend some time coding on the side outside work. I do mostly terraform with AWS atm, and use other tools like Docker, K8s, etc. You learn a lot on the job, and I mean A LOT. Thankfully, I have a very very good team who is about developing engineers. I won't be a CTO in my lifetime but idc, I'm an engineer and I want to solve stuff. I would say do not do a bootcamp, you learn web dev mostly, you skip out on important stuff like BigO, DSA etc. plus, don't enjoy web Dev as much anywaysDo self taught mostly, I used to research what modules get taught at university for CS degrees, and focus on those modules for a while. Definitely helped more (I took a bootcamp from Makers in the UK)",

Two weeks ago I got two offers and and accepted one as a Software Engineer without any professional experience. Here's the route I took:2 year technical college. This got me exposure to more programming concepts, experience working on a small team, and a small portfolio of a wide range of applications to pad out my resume without costing a fortune. The applications I ended up with werent fancy, but I put more work into them than I needed to and really tried to experiment where it was allowed.After graduating I started working on personal projects in my free time. I set up a homelab server to learn more about networking and security, and made some small applications that made my life easier both at home and at work. A few of my software solutions got adopted by my company for widespread use. I had fun doing these, but more importantly I was able to replace a lot of the academic work on my resume with these, and it gave me talking points when doing interviews.I'm not sure if I've just been lucky or not, but I haven't had to do any leetcode in any of my interviews. They have been way more interested in talking about the solutions I made, and the impact they've had. I spent a lot more time practicing talking points, terminology, and having a professional conversation because I'm bad at interviews. In the end I believe this helped set me apart, and I highly recommend spending some time explaining parts of your projects to someone (or even just to an AI).When you do start applying places, spend some time customizing each application for the job You'd be surprised how many people don't. Also, it helps to format any examples you give in STAR format. Some say it's outdated, but it helps keep things consice while effectively conveying impact.The market sucks, but some things don't change. The jobs are still out there, and the people that put in the extra work still stand out. Don't be in a rush, make sure the jobs you interview for are a good fit for you. Hopefully something in here helps you on your journey. Good luck!",

Honestly, it’s all about feeling comfortable with the concept. If you can explain polymorphism to someone else, or even just write a few simple examples without looking it up, that’s a good sign you’re ready to move on. You wanna be able to recognize when to use it in your code, like knowing when to apply method overriding or when to use interfaces. A good approach is to learn the theory, then try to implement it in a small project or a few coding exercises. If you can do that and it clicks, then you’re golden! But if you’re still feeling a bit lost, maybe stick with it a little longer. And yeah, it’s totally a \"learn X, use it, then learn Y\" kinda vibe.

I’m sorry OP..I will echo one of the responders you might be better off seeking some vocational training at a community college over trying to mess with bootcamps…there’s less stigma during hiring with AS Degrees.Just know without a full blown CS degree the going will be tough and we are currently in the most junior unfriendly hiring market I have ever seen in my 11 years of working in this field. Literally no one is looking for junior devs right now and it’s sad…because there is in fact a shortage of GOOD senior level and mid level devs and engineers BUT in order to get fresh talent we have to train the new incoming juniors…no one wants to do that right now though.",

In the real world if your employer has you switch languages best case scenario you’ll have a month’s time to pick the new language up.",

This process was 100% CPU bound for the duration of the scan (which could be a couple of minutes).So I created a scheduler thread which would maintain the list of files to be scanned and \"scanning slots\". There was one slot per core on the CPU the process was running on. So, when there was a free core, the scheduler would create a thread and cause it to run the scan for the specified file.This involved a but of Thread management and process coordination via semaphores and single entry functions to coordinate the allocation and release of slots for the individual processes.When it ran, the system would be fully CPU bound for the duration of the process which on a fast system took about 24 hours. On \"standard corporate issue\" systems it would take about 4-5 days to run. Single threaded, we estimated it would run for close to 2 weeks on a decent system.You might also want to look into SMP, MPP and Grid systems.",

The Microsoft Graph API would probably be worth looking into.Authentication methods are probably not bad to at least have a basic understanding of how they work, or at least how to use them (dotnet handles most of it). Xunit is probably not a bad idea for unit and integration testing, and all the various things that come with it. Honestly learn the basics and build up from there. Dotnet can get overwhelming, so just get a good foundation and go from there. If you're looking to go into a corporate job, knowing databases is very important. I personally would stay away from the model first design, and stick with DB first and scaffold afterwards. Also create a separate Fb project or completely separate solution for your DB stuff.

        "body": "I thought I knew the answer, but apparently I was rather off.  Here is Claude's responseI'll explain how physical memory is partitioned into blocks for contiguous memory allocation in operating systems.In contiguous memory allocation, physical memory is divided into fixed-size blocks or variable-size partitions that can be allocated to processes. Here's how it works:Physical memory is organized into addressable units (typically bytes), and the operating system manages this space by dividing it into partitions or blocks. When processes request memory, the OS allocates these blocks based on specific strategies.There are several approaches to partitioning memory:1. Fixed partitioning: Memory is divided into fixed-size blocks (like your example of 10 MB chunks). Each partition can hold exactly one process, even if the process doesn't need all the allocated space, which can lead to internal fragmentation.2. Variable partitioning: Memory is allocated exactly as requested by processes, resulting in variable-sized partitions. This reduces internal fragmentation but can lead to external fragmentation as processes terminate and free memory becomes scattered.For allocation, the operating system maintains data structures (typically tables) that track:- Which blocks are allocated or free- The size of each block- The process using each allocated blockWhen a process requests memory, the OS uses allocation algorithms such as:- First-fit: Allocate the first available block that's large enough- Best-fit: Allocate the smallest available block that's large enough- Worst-fit: Allocate the largest available blockThe actual implementation involves memory management units (MMUs) that translate logical addresses (used by processes) to physical addresses. These hardware components, along with operating system tables, handle the mapping between a process's address space and physical memory blocks.Modern systems use more sophisticated approaches like paging and segmentation rather than contiguous allocation, as they address many of the fragmentation issues.",

You just need to define types.Javascript function greet(user) { return \"Hello, \" + user.name; } const user = { name: \"Alice\", age: 30 }; console.log(greet(user));This piece of code creates a user with a name and age and logs those fields to the console. To javascript, name could be an integer, a String, a boolean, it doesn't know until runtime when it is evaluated.Typescript interface User { name: string; age: number; } function greet(user: User): string { return \"Hello, \" + user.name; } const user: User = { name: \"Alice\", age: 30 }; console.log(greet(user));Here, we once again have a user with name and age fields. However, this time, we provide an interface that defines the object. Not only does a user have a name and age, the name is a string and the age is a number. If we don't tell Typscript that info, it wont compile. Typescript will actually compile into Javascript which is then run trough an interpreter.",

This isn't to build the next big project because if you are still at the learning phase the chances of you creating a project that would \"make money\" is pretty slim at the beginning and even years into your career. NOW this is actually to your benefit, find a project you like/use and recreate it. The reason this is beneficial is you already know all the things to build when a lot of times ppl try and build stuff but never have a set of requirements.The whole \"build something you are interested in\" are to make sure the person keeps on building it so while I agree it's not helpful in giving you an actual \"thing\" to build it's usually beneficial because ppl quit projects they lose interest in.So the TLDR; you aren't building this to be the next tech bro and get super rich so if you don't wanna pick something that involves your interests pick something that already exists and then you have a list of reqs to build and then build it. And hell maybe there is something in that tool/thing you like that is missing and you can add that.",

Arduino would be a cool next step with a different language as well but arduino has a vast online community which is helpful with learning. Raspberry Pi is another option but I would start with Arduino as you get a chance at another language with a system that has a lot of support. Plus in my opinion building with Arduino seems more versatile and probably closer to what you would be wanting to make. Side note would be the esp32 can use micro Python but I vote start with Arduino’s original language. Cheer and enjoy!",

I understand your confusion, it is very hard to understand some accents. My daughter is born and studied in England only, sometimes i cant even understand her. But the key thing is; if i dont understand something i always convey that i didnt get. Either repeat or rephrase. People usually take it in normal way and always repeat it slowly. I do the same thing when talking to Italians, they hardly get indian accent. So do not hesitate to tell them whatever you couldnt understand. Ask them to write or repeat. And in time, you will understand them and vice versa i hope.",

On the other hand if they’re the type to mix in Hindi or something and shift without realizing they’re doing it, you’re fucked and need to explicitly say you’re having trouble understanding them. Usually - especially if you’re the only non Indian - they don’t even realize there’s an issue. I’ve had to do this a couple times in the past and ask them to stick with English and annunciate a bit clearer and they did make a concerted effort which helped a ton. Just be polite and have a tone like a request for help rather than an accusation and you should be ok. Stuff that can be jarring for native English speakers vs Indian English - - pauses at weird points mid sentence and sometimes multiple times per sentence- rising tones like asking a question but during a statement or other part of a sentence- dropped words (your brain will autocomplete the sentence anyway once you get used to whoever you’re working with) - certain phrases (do the needful being one of the most infamous) and words (definitely, certainly, surely, etc pop up frequently) that you will soon realize are far more vague than they imply. For example the “definitely” does not mean definitely, it can often be said as a “yeah yeah whatever” vibe- sometimes questions are phrased more like demands, but just know that usually it’s still a request and no offense is intended. It can come off as a bit aggressive though. (Ie “you will do XYZ for me”)(paraphrased a bit). I dunno maybe others here can add to this list for OP to adapt faster.",

The idea that you could cut comp by 50% and increase workload by 50% without a mass exodus is pretty disconnected from how labor markets actually work. Engineers aren't stuck in one company or even one industry. Talent moves. Fast.Tech compensation is high because demand is high, the skillset is hard to build and maintain, and the impact on business is massive. If one company decides to nerf pay and crank up workload, that’s a gift to their competitors. Good devs won’t just stick around out of loyalty or passion; they’ll walk. Even the \"not-so-passionate\" ones are often very competent, and they know their market value.Could there be some cooling in salaries over time? Sure, especially as markets mature or we hit saturation in certain roles. But some exec \"overheard\" saying they want to halve pay and work people harder isn’t a signal of an imminent industry collapse, it’s a signal they’re going to lose talent fast if they try.So yeah, I'd still code if unicorns were real. But if you're banking on market-wide comp dropping because of wishful exec thinking, you're betting on unicorns *and* leprechauns.",

Where, when, and how they work is not necessarily up to you. If you dictate they next come to your office, at x time, to do y work, they are likely going to be classified as an employee.In this case, it sounds like OP is an employee for a company, and his employer has a contract to do work. An employee has to do what the employer requires, or the employer is free to fire them. Writing that a job is remote can trigger some legal protections for how much notice they must give you to change your work location, but any employer can change your work location as long as the proper notice period is given. That depends on the state, but it's usually pretty short anyway.",

Hardly anyone will tell you this, because it's likely you don't have anyone close enough in your life that you wouldn't immediately push away, if they pressed you to pursue getting help. That is a sign of the problem, in addition to spending several years and not actually getting software dev experience, which speaks to fundamental motivation. (It is worth asking the question: you've done some of it, do you enjoy doing it at all?)Get signed up for whatever affordable coverage you can and go find a therapist that has a background in depression, addiction, and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT.If you really don't know where to start, go to a Gambling Addictions Anonymous meeting. You don't have to buy into it all the way. It will give you a place to say your piece, as well as talk to people who have gone through similar things, de-stigmatizing the shame.People are saying quit trading and gambling. You should, but I am going to tell you that is a *symptom* of the cause, because waiting years to try and get a job after getting a degree, or not applying yourself to available skill learning resources (you literally have to not look for them) indicates that your problems lies in fundamental motivation, and is likely co-incident with other mental illness. You need to fix that first, or at least find a sustainable coping strategy or short term medication assistance, because everything you've described (switching from what sounds like hardcore imposter syndrome pivoting to high risk, low reward strategies as the first shift you've described) points to the problem not being your ability to learn, but in fact, something emotional you're not dealing with that is impairing your ability to deal with your problems, which are not compounding (and not just like the interest on debt).This stuff is worth figuring out and you are not hopeless, you're just mostly avoiding doing this, because I highly doubt I am the first person to say this to you, but in case I am. Stop reading this, and go do that immediately. Can't do it right now? Write it on a note and put it on your bathroom mirror or refrigerator. Somewhere you can't ignore. Just do what it takes to deal with this. If you actually do nothing about it, nobody will care about your suffering. Why do I say this? Because everything I have seen you write indicates an immaturity in dealing with the consequences of your own actions. You need to own that first, and you need to help yourself. Because you have created problems that will take years to solve, and you have to be the one to do it. The upside is you will feel better when you actually start doing working on it. Congratulations on making it this far, and good luck.",

Divorce is way way way more damaging to your career and ultimately you’re only going to be able to do 3 of the 4 things well as your kid gets older. I cannot stress this enough. 3. One last caveat is I have yet to make it to a startup that didn’t blow up after 8 months.

Now they all seem to have said, if you dont hire we wont, and have changed the overall strategy they are approaching innovation and development, this to me is the biggest threat of LLMs and AI.

Emphasis on \"the right\" gig. I imply that I am being selective, not rejected.Reality is somewhere between. I am being selective. I don't want to work somewhere shitty, and I still have ample savings. I am working, but not as much as I want to be.Part of why it's been so long is I am not \"grinding\" applications. I've done some traveling. I've done some grinding. I am at the point where I'm getting more serious, though, as it has been much longer than I expected.My resume doesn't have a gap, but I have found response rates for initial interviews to be pretty abysmal. Better as of late, though, but I often wonder if I should just accept the gap and remove the freelance from my resume.

The truth was that I was still applying to jobs pretty consistently and getting rejected or ghosted, but to be fair, some of those were definitely due to companies having layoffs and no longer hiring for the position. Also, the personal hobby I was the most focused on was building my wedding photography business, which I didn't share with recruiters bc I didn't want them thinking it might get in the way of being a dedicated full-time employee.Edited to add: I'd also sometimes talk about how I wasn't in a huge rush to get back into the job market and was just keeping an eye out for the Right Opportunity.",

More than half the company works on deep learning.I only hear bad things about Amazon's culture, I'd stay away. From first hand experience, NVIDIA has excellent culture and a strong hiring pipeline for interns, and we're doing lots of cool work in ML depending on team. Meta is probably also a good one if you want to be doing cutting edge ML work. I don't think you can go wrong with either NVIDIA or Meta.Edit: for more context, a SWE at NVIDIA working on ML is more likely to be inside the guts of a model, figuring out how to optimize its throughput or latency. A MLE at Meta is more likely to be applying ML to solve a business problem. So it depends on which part of the problem you want to work on.",

They gave me guest version control account, a restricted repository, branch and requested an MR for the loosely described task. Nothing was off the limit. I used documentations, internet and AI to complete the task. After that submission got cleared and a follow up was arranged I had near 2 hours with 2 engineers going over all details of my submission. Ran the project locally and they asked me key performance and functionality questions. We discussed the shortcomings of my submission and what I could have done better… totally open conversation with many back and forth exchanges. Impossible to fake if you haven’t done the work or used AI without understanding. This is where they actually verify it all. Having done these interviews I always left with the confidence that these guys know what they’re doing, and that I was respected as an adult. Not surprisingly, working with them has been a similar experience. I spend more time finding these companies than actual interviews. It’s not easy to come across such companies which also have great compensation and interesting projects so I have very specific set of questions to narrow down at the initial interview. LC… or any kind of trivia crap and I bail. This is also why I never interview when I need a job. I interview when I’m okay so I won’t have to rush or take these subpar interviews.",

It's often natural to focus on the negatives about your current situation, but that's an unproductive mindset. Channel that energy in a productive direction. Maybe invest in a hobby, invest in another career, find something to do that is rewarding and recharging.And, this might sound obnoxious, but you should be grateful you have a job that is paying bills, probably more than most people get, while you figure our your next step.Quick aside: I went through several years where I hated my job in tech.

Although, I am sure the question that would need to be asks is \"what if it worked?\" (e.g., were investors ok with you being in university still?, did they expect you to drop out if you were funded?, was it something you could do while university was in session?).",

It takes a lot of effort. Anyone can do it but the vast majority of people don’t like it enough to study it constantly for years until they get paid to do it. If you drop everything, quit your job, and study, you should be prepared to invest a lot of time.The market isn’t the best right now. Not as bad as some say but it’s definitely not great. Out of my graduating cohort of like 50 students, I think maybe 10 percent are working as software engineers. Who knows where the market will be by the time you’re looking for a job but the optimist in me says it should be better. That said, it’s still a risk.

With the caveat that you will be a cog because scale includes the scale of the number of their employees. Doors will permanently be opened to you because you did this, but I learned a lot from G as well once I realized that was something I had to do. G or M > A, partly because A is structured as a VC fund in a trench coat and is much lower prestige, and partly because even in 2025, G and M have wildly better WLB. I'm not hearing about regular deaths yet and I lost two teammates at A. Did you know that G vests all your stocks when you die and at least at the time, A did not?And they pay well enough that you can afford the Bay even with a family unless they're bringing you on as a new grad. (Which they might. They might not even be wrong. Working on that type of organization is a skill.)Personally, I'd say 20 months or 20 years. 20 Months is long enough to stare at their size, scale, and institutional structure (Another reason not to A; It's just a bunch of startups) and pick up a bunch of lessons without forgetting how to use more standard tooling. Plus a 4-6 month job search and boom two years at the big G. Or you love it and they love you and you don't get laid off until you retire.",

There are exceptions, but knowing your stuff will often get you to a sensible result faster in the scope of the interview. You need to be able to coherently explain and reason about your code, why you're taking one approach instead of another. Using AI in an interview doesn't pair well with this. It also gives me less signal as an interviewer.All this to say, when you're ready to start your job search, you should be doubling down on fundamentals, Leetcode and upskilling on things like React/whatever framework you're rusty with. Using AI on the job is one thing, but imo you should be focused on fundamentals and interview prep in the short term.Once you have a job, then worry about how you'll use AI to work faster and better.",

And a million other flavors. What makes a good software engineering job or employer is in the eye of the beholder, your dream company might be my nightmare.I personal value WLB/culture over all else. That's what keeps me at a company. Everyone respecting each others time, no expectation to work outside of business hours, a product that's stable enough where while on-call may exist, it's almost never called, no egos/drama/politics, etc.I spend a lot of time reverse interviewing companies to find out what their culture is like. If it sounds like I'd vibe with it, I join. If it doesn't, I don't.Usually WLB/culture changes though, it's basically inevitable. One change in management, one prod fire that was just a bit too big, even one bad SWE hire can take a great culture to a shit culture essentially overnight. When that happens is when I look for another job.My track record: 3.5 years -> little over 5 years -> 2.5 years -> 1 year so far.",

Work hard, learn as much as you can, and enjoy it!",

I asked what most of the team was using, and they said most people use a Mac... so I said what the hell, and went with a Mac. Everything went so much smoother having the same device as my team members, *especially* onboarding.I've done that at every job since. If I'm given the choice, I ask what most of the team is using, and go with that.At the end of the day, the OS you use isn't *that* big of a deal. It's not hard to switch. It's just a computer.

        "body": "I've worked at 3 Fortune 100 companies - so, large companies.The only job postings that I think would qualify are when someone posts a job that is intended for an internal hire. That is when a team has decided to create a job to make a career move for an employee (maybe a promotion, maybe a diagonal move), and in order to create that new role - even if they intend to hire internally - they need to (by law) post the job publicly and have that posting up for at least some amount of time before hiring.EDIT: u/ImSuperHelpful is correct - it's not by law, but it seems to be a very popular policy at a lot of companies to prevent nepotism/encourage diversity. It's been the case at every large company I have worked at. I also wonder if it helps to prevent potential lawsuits for discrimination.The idea of having posts out there that the company does not intend to hire for generally doesn't fly at most companies because the entire process of creating a job posting starts with actually getting a real job approved first.It's also why recruiters can't just create a job posting to look busy - again, it would be the hiring manager (i..e, the person who owns the team where the new employee would work) that would need to get the job itself approved by his leadership before HR and recruiters get involved.Now, I don't doubt that there are some companies that do that - I think that might be true for super mega large companies like Meta, Microsoft - and that is to have a generic job posting meant to attract candidates for a large swath of jobs, but without necessarily having a job opening right this moment. But I think that's a minority of companies that do that.I think as someone else said, the other source of issues might be 3rd party recruiters posting fake jobs to farm resumes - but those should be easy to spot because they wouldn't actually tie to a real company's job posting.I think the reality is that a lot of this job postings are real - there's just so many applicants (including internal ones), that it probably feels like they're fake.",

        "body": "This depends on a few things \\* The kind of job search you're doing (fishing around for new offers with low information vs already knowing exactly what you want)\\* The quality of the recruiter\\* The job market that you're inMost of the time I would say no; in general I think it's best to have an idea of where you want to be and give that range for where you want to be. Ex. if you make $80,000 and want to make $100,000 tell them you want to make $100,000 to $160,000 (arbitrary ceiling chosen but give yourself a nice range) rather than you make $80,000. I don't think it's unreasonable to give SOME number, if your number is TOO low then it's possible you should have bolstered your position by understanding the market better (to be fair, sometimes difficult to do).However third-party recruiters don't just have the incentive to match you to multiple companies, they have the incentive to match you ASAP. That means if they're going to companies, they may be getting the cheapest offer just to line you up with a few offers and have you choose (if you are presented with 3 offers ranging from $85k to $95k it may also give the impression that is all companies in your area are willing to pay and cause you to commit early). This isn't always the case, but if you get a lazy recruiter, this is more likely.If you give them a target, they will more likely hunt against that target, in which case you're aligning their goals (getting you matched) with your goal (getting you matched at your target) which I think saves everyone some time in the long run (companies for whom you are out of their league won't bother, companies who are willing to pay more may be more inclined to be more competitive).Hope that provides some clarity.EDIT: I also generally don't like advice to never give a number, I think that's just lazy on the part of the candidate and can be wasteful of the time of the recruiter if they're following leads you would already know are not worth your time. Knowing approximately where you stand saves everyone time and makes you better positioned in the hunt.",

I think you just brushed this off, but it sounds like you feel the need to constantly validate and confirm your worth due to insecurity. Hopefully it should go away once you get some experience under your belt, or if your priority in life changes(such as getting a partner, getting married, starting a family, etc.).Not every successful engineer becomes an icon in the tech world, a social media influencer, or even a revered name that is whispered among their peers. While some become celebrities in their own domains, others prefer a life of quiet anonymity. > But digging deeper, that desire doesn’t feel purely ego-driven. In tech, career advancement almost entirely depends on perception. Recruiters scan for brand names. Managers reward visibility. Friends decide whether you’re worth a referral. Your market worth is defined by what others think, not by what you think you’re worth.This is because you surround yourself with people who believe in this and actively participate in this grind.

        "body": "You’re right that perception is important. “Your career is what people think of you” is a pretty insightful way to think about progression. But I think you’re thinking about it too simply, and the way you’re approaching it is (at least slightly) counterproductive. It is valuable to be perceived as competent, confident, and personable. When switching jobs, making new connections, or seeking capital investment, peoples default assumption will be that the MIT grad who’s a staff engineer at FAANG is smarter/more capable than the state school grad working in QA at northwest mutual. But I think at some point, you cross a vague threshold where you’re taken seriously at a glance and you don’t really need to worry about micromanaging “prestige”. I’d even say that continuing to be visibly/noticeably concerned with prestige is a negative signal if you’ve already “made it” into high scale software development. It reads either as very self-conscious or very braggy, neither of which are good things for people to think about you. Strongly preferring a big brand like FAANG or a major scale-up over f500 or a small startup is just rational career planning. I don’t mean this in a flippant way, but agonizing about picking meta or google or citadel for prestige reasons is probably a question for therapy. It sounds like you’ve overcome a lot of challenges to get where you are. I’m proud of you, and you should be proud of yourself. But things aren’t as Machiavellian as you’re thinking. People aren’t going to go out of their way to help that person who wouldn’t ever shut up about how awesome they are and how many other offers they got and how hard it was to choose because they’re so impressed with them. People roll their eyes at that person and try to avoid talking to them again. People go out of their way to help the person who worked together with them on some project that neither of them remember, but they had a fun rivalry going on the Tetris machine at the office.",

        "body": "I'd just say this -- it's easy to think that the entire world goes through you staying at your current company, but you actually have options. Software isn't a game we play for a day and can take big injuries, but a game we play week after week for years. For you, it doesn't sound like you are in a sustainable work environment -- you'll ever suffer some major health consequences then lose your job, or lose your job a little bit sooner and be back home.Therefore, I'd figure out what you need from your work to start getting on top of your health: maybe that's medical leave, or it could be an accommodation like more WFH. Then, tell HR what you need, with the right documentation, and let them decide. They don't really need to know the details of your condition, just that you are asking for certain things that are medically required. You might a little screwed right now, but if you lose a finger (or more), you'll be dealing with that consequence for the rest of your career.You're already on your way out of the company: that's what it means when your manager is forced to PIP you, it's a pretext for planned turnover, and it's very likely that no matter what you do, the manager will be forced to make another decision they might not agree with, since this is already going on at the company. I'd weight that pretty heavily in planning on what to do next.Also, you gave a small tell that your performance probably isn't as good as is expected or you might be misreading the situation: \"This was shocking, since one of those leads had publicly praised my work before, even in front of my current manager\". This complaint is common in a few people I've had to coach for not meeting expecations, and it's difficult for them to understand that praise of a single task, or doing one thing well, doesn't equate to broadly meeting expectations. IMO, it says there's a blind spot in your understanding of where you fit into the workplace, and therefore I'd encourage you to sit down 1v1 with the lead and get their opinion on whether or not you're on track, or what else you could do.",

Tech is inherently boom & bust, and requires that you retrain on whatever the latest hot technology is periodically.You should look at management as a *skill* (or really, a collection of skills) and not a *career track* though. As a manager, you can go back to IC as long as you keep your technical skills reasonably sharp. The converse is not necessarily true, someone who has never managed will have a tough time getting a management position without first building trust in their org.",

It’s important to recognize that the quant job market is significantly different than just SWE/tech job market in some key ways. Culture, working hours, stress, and sustainability of your career should be considerations. Can you handle joining an investment firm then getting the axe a year or two later? Can you handle one or two years of garden leave due to non-competes? Can you handle being restricted by non-disclosure agreement?Anywho, I know Wells Fargo and PIMCO is huge out west. All the regular developers I know who work on securities pricing, risk reporting, trading systems, or otherwise more business-activity related platforms seem pretty secure in their jobs, if overworked. Although the American banks, at least, love a good layoff (eyes on you Goldman). IMO it’s great having a $$$ cash bonus at the end of every year while not being on the front line for layoffs relatively (suck it bankers, quants, researchers, and sales traders!). Maybe it’d be easier to skill build and lateral into a business-related developer role (ex. Java Algo Dev, E-Trading Dev, Low-Latency Trading Systems Dev, etc) than get a grad degree just to work on capital markets technology again?Definitely get in touch with recruiters and headhunters. See McGregor-Boyall or Stanford Black to name a few. Network on LinkedIn with these agencies or consultancies and interview grind yourself into a new job.",

Like when you said you used WebSockets you didn't say which language you programmed in. I would list everything packages, library, programming languages or whatever used on any given project. It bloats the resume, but no human is going to read it. You just want to cram in keywords. Even some jobs ask for \"git\" experience and I just assume that is a given and don't list it, but I do \"managed projects with git\" dur. Even when it seems redundant like you used Java at your last two companies, get that keyword in there at each company.Also, it may just be me, but I find a lot of companies don't give a shit about \"non-professional' experience, projects don't get any weight. They will explicitly say so in job descriptions (X years of professional experience with Y). Or recruiters or managers will appear kind of disappointed when you admit you know something from a personal project.And also, you can just lie. A find a lot of companies rarely check you on the skills you know, if you know you can pick it up easily, they won't know the difference once you're on the job. A lot of requirements are written by managers who think you need 5 years with git or else you don't know it at all. And like what I mentioned about projects above, you can just say you did that at your job rather than as a side project.Anyway getting your foot in the door is hard, I got my first job by referral from a relative. And it's probably even harder with the economy contracting. But I started my career at the start of the great recession, so there's some hope it's not as bad as that.",

Some of the tools you used there can just be listed and probably don't need to be in a sentence.Also, I have little idea about what you actually worked on. Seems almost like buzz words in both the companies and the projects. That could use a slightly clearer explanation at the reduction of other things (as mentioned above). Think of how you would explain it to your mum/dad or a 6 year old. Many recruiters aren't technical, and even engineers don't know every field.For skills you list tools but are there any interesting algorithms or patterns you know?Having only a couple of months and then looking for a new role can be something recruiters occasionally pass due to being risk-adverse. They don't give you a chance to explain. However, having some experience is better than none. If you can hang in at your current company long enough, then it'll start to look better.Any awards, papers etc...?Keeping it at one page is good.",

I'm saying this as someone with a disability who has been through this stuff multiple times.If you needed accommodations, you could ask for those after you've already been hired. No need to disclose it during an application. But since you say you don't need accommodations and it wouldn't impact your work much, there is zero reason to disclose it. Most employers will always look at a disability as a negative, and as a hindrance. It can and will be used against you. I'm not saying this to fear-monger, it's just how corporate/private companies work.The only case where it would be different is in government jobs, although I don't even know about those anymore given the current climate.",

Getting good working on legacy systems is its own skill set and provides a lot of job security and opportunity if you are.But the first question is what is the leaderships understanding and support to make the situation better? Are they receptive to tactical investments in tech debt? And second question is do you have the appropriate technical lead to help drive a vision and technical plan to dig out of the hole? This is hard and many are not cut for it, preferring to create plans to burn it all down for something new. Lastly, I hate to say, but just wanting to be a mundane ticket taker is neither good or fun for you long term. You should develop opinions and strategies for how to make things better. This field is getting more competitive and saturated and if you can’t put out more than the exact minimum effort to not get fired, you are going to be left behind in this field eventually.",

They won't ask HR for a reference, HR is just there to confirm your title and dates of employment for a background check. I've also never heard of a company asking HR about \"reason for leaving\", I *really* doubt HR would be willing to answer that even if they knew. At most they might say \"fired\" or \"left of their own accord\". The more details HR gives, the more liable the company becomes at no benefit to them. That's something they may ask *you*, but definitely not HR.So that said, the exit survey is something only HR is going to see and care about. Answer it, don't answer, lie, tell the truth, it's not really gonna matter. In no world is HR going to respond to a background check saying \"Yeah, pinkbutterfly22 was great, but they didn't fill out their exit survey so we wouldn't recommend you hire them\". HR is going to strictly say \"pinkbutterfly22 worked as a SWE from X to Y\".I personally don't tell the company where I'm going, or even the real reason of why I'm leaving. I don't *lie*, I just give non-answers. \"I was just looking for a new adventure\" or some BS for why I'm leaving. For where I'm going \"To a \\[large/small\\] company in \\[industry\\]\" is the most I ever give. I don't really like lying, but I have no issue with dodging questions. When I give that response they know what's up, and don't dig.As for your manager/co-workers, *those* are the people that'll be giving you references because you give your new company their contact info directly. From their perspective, as long as you were decent to work with, and you put in your 2 weeks notice, no bridge is burnt. That's all you're really obligated to do. If you think your colleagues that you hated wouldn't give you a reference... don't ask. Only ask for references from people that you know will say good things about you.",

I have contact info for most of my previous managers just from the act of working with them, and those I didn't I was able to find out through other means.... this is why I'm curious what's going on here, and what you've already tried to dig up contact info.And this 2nd manager... what does \"not pull through\" mean? Did you text them and they're ghosting you? How long's it been? Did you follow up? Try a different contact method?If they're explicitly asking for one of your ex-managers that actively managed you, and you can't provide them any of the 3 you've had in the past... from their perspective that's at least a yellow flag. They'll wonder why you can't get in touch with any of them, and they'll wonder if maybe you can but none of them are willing to give you a reference.I'd try extra hard to get what I could from manager 1 and 2.... but if I can't, I'd have to try and just shoot my shot. \"Hey, I reached out but wasn't able to get in touch with my previous managers. I've provided an additional SWE (maybe in a lead position? A tech lead might fit the bill) that worked very closely with me, hopefully that works. Thanks!\"",

Companies with great benefits will always be on the higher end of that but if the company doesnt do well, expect drastic lows. One year nobody got raises because the company didnt do well.",

A phrase I've heard from some companies lately has been rather than adjusting to the cost of living, they are adjusting to the cost of labor. With all the layoffs, I believe total compensation has been dropping. Add to that some companies are doing poorly, you could argue the raises and promotions you've been receiving are a good thing, especially relative to the market. But a major factor is how your current company is performing. It feels like you're doing pretty well given the current market, but it's your right/decision to want more.

Cert won't get any jobs but has a small chance of getting you to the interview stage and helping you with a design problem. Master's in Data Science is a worthless degree. A Master's in CS is useless except either **a)** you can land a paid internship and co-op in CS to reset yourself **b)** reset a long work gap where you feel recruiters are discriminating **c)** you don't actually learn CS with the CS degree or work experienceDoing QA work and deployments, it's more or less a dying job for Americans and has been so for years. Why Cognizant does it, was POS IBM where I was. Newer trend is make the developers do the tester job as well for the same pay. All of a sudden I was coding and deploying my own code with responsibility for all levels of testing. Violates segregation of duty and forces me on 45-50 hours weeks but saves the man money.If you still want to go this route and build on your work experience, yeah the cert is probably okay and degree probably works the same way in that it's a calculated risk. Less a risk if the degree is fully funded. You can do Multivariate Calculus. The shock value ended in Calc II. Nice part is taking the derivative of one variable, you treat the other variable as a constant and it doesn't matter what order you take derivatives in.",

So my intent in pursuing these is just for learning something fruitful, then I can hopefully build my own projects to show some competency on my own.I hear what you're saying about the Data Science Master's, it isn't much on its own and actual experience matters. But I can't get a job without experience, and I can't get experience without a job, as the saying goes, so that's why I considered this. Rutgers also offers a Master's in Business and Science which combines data analytics and business courses, but having to fund it myself, fully or partially, I dunno I just don't want to bother with school again, now that I think about it more. Also for calculus, I haven't touched it in well over 5 years, neither at work nor school, basically forgot everything, so that's why I am so hesitant about that part.Companies expecting people to be a jack-of-all-trades just so they can save money is an irritating trend. If I were a greedy CEO I'd probably understand, but as someone who just wants enough of a salary to live comfortably, it gets on my nerves. But that's how this field is, the ones who are willing to adapt in the race to the bottom will succeed.I'll stick with the self-learning path then, for now. It's the most doable at this point.",

No training on hiring or evaluating, but I wasn't interviewing for that position. I just took it not because I wanted it, but because I was 3 days away from being laid off due to bench expiration, so it allowed me to get a paycheck still. Fortunately for me, I actually was rather good at it, as I had been a teacher before and know how to evaluate and ask higher order thinking questions, so I did a hierarchy starting with basic easy questions, and then questions such as walk me through how you would design a Spring Boot service given a specific need, and even if they didn't do it the way I would, I'd at least know they knew what they were doing. However, if I didn't put any thought into it, I could have been like the others and just did a google search for common interview questions. Very few of the candidates knew the first thing about what Spring Boot does or how to make a React component. We were mostly campus hires that were hired just for having heard of stuff before, and training was canceled early due the company cutting funding, so it was everyone fend for themselves for a year watching Udemy and doing our own stuff.",

I was kind of hoping they'd be asking me more about collections, Spring Boot features, database integration, and some of the core Java features, and maybe some scenarios of how I would achieve a specific goal. On top of that, when I was trying to figure out runtime issue when he said a couple minutes prior that we had 10 minutes left, he suggested to go and read the Java documentation for a specific feature for a hint before I finish. I told him that was kind of an unrealistic suggestion as I didn't have time to read the docs and then finish the rest of the problem all in only about 6 minutes. Unless there was some algorithm I wasn't thinking of, the kind of solution seems to be quadratic and insanely complex, and not code I was able to write in only 40 minutes.",

Also, see if your employer might cover some of the cost; always worth asking.Speaking as someone also in cybersecurity, I don’t think a degree is strictly necessary solely because you already have work experience, but it can definitely help break through certain barriers, especially if the current job market trends continue. Plus, getting a solid foundation in computer science can open the door to more technical roles within cybersecurity down the line. Now if you solely want to learn the material, and don't also want degree there are dozens posts on self teaching CS and how to cover all the topics in a BS CS.",

Supply is increasing at an uncontrolled rate. I think you have an advantage as a young person because you are honestly assessing the situation for what it is. Many others are delusional and think they can just \"go cyber security\" like it is one easy trick to fix their career. You are honest that you want to have a good steady income - which puts you ahead of the crowd who rambles about \"passion\" and \"purpose\" while spamming random companies in desperation.",

I wouldn't do one just to do one.I'm doing a masters, but I wanted to go for a PhD since I was a freshman. Had pretty bad undergrad gpa from some earlier years (I left and returned to college 3 years later) at a really low ranked college, but still wanted to do my PhD at T50. I couldn't qualify for a lot of internships because of GPA requirements, but with a masters I could since it would just go off that GPA. I also wanted to work some a federal job. So doing my masters now at school T100 school with a 4.0 and currently in the interview process for a job with my dream federal agency where if I get I'll start at GS-7 (56k) and once I finish my masters I'll go to GS-9 (69k). The hiring manager actually seemed interested cause AI is designated as mission critical for the US government and my concentration for my masters is AI/ML. I guess with the lower pay and it being several hours from a large metro that it's harder to find young workers. Plus they said they'd help me get my PhD if I got the job which would put me at GS-11 for 84k.If it would actually be needed for the path you want to follow then go for it. But outside of a federal job pay boost or wanting to do research it may not help. Plus you sound like you dont want to do it.",

A MSCS without experience usually can only be considered as 1 yoe, so even if you ace all the interviews, the HC will question the decision. If they approve, they’ll lowball the shit out of your offer, basically around 240k for SDE2. To get a better comp you’ll need data to back that up.I’d ask the recruiter more about the role and try to gauge the HM. Dont let the SDE2 title fool you and join a shithole.",

Popular techstacks were Nodejs, PHP, Java, and C# with Nodejs being the most dominant among new grads like 5 to 10 times higher than usual (I asked my cs friends from colleges/universities all over the city and they all confirmed this) while PHP was treated like a second class citizen even though positions were just as much as for all of them. Unpopular ones were Python and Ruby: I'm talking about like just 4 or 5 postings per month.So I had a decision to make, should I compete in popular techstacks knowing that there would be more jobs to apply but the competition would also be crazy or should I choose a less popular one knowing that there would be only a handful of jobs to apply and only a handful to compete against? I picked the latter, learnt both Python and Ruby, and landed my first role after 3 months.Niche stacks have served me really well and now I'm even more invested in them. At my previous and current company, I've got the chance to add Golang and Elixir to my resume too. So now basically I have to maintain the knowledge of 4 stacks knowing that the amount of jobs I can apply to won't even compare to many of friends who have experience with only Java or Nodejs. For the current company, I've been more involved with the hiring process and the amount of Python/Ruby devs are still very few and far between. I guess the upside is that I know for sure I don't have to worry much about unemployment anymore. Take this as an anecdote, it might not applicable to your situation, nonetheless, good luck out there!",
