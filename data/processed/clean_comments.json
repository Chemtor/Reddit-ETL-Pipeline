There are perhaps three, at most five, major players in the data warehouse space. Many vendors have started to just build push-type integrations with each of them; this isn't that difficult to maintain and has numerous advantages over some external service running big extractions on a schedule. They can point to what Fivetran would charge to shift that data and make it a selling point.Where does Fivetran fit into this? They don't. They're being cut out.Worse, they've got much cheaper, open core competitors with cloud offerings whose main disadvantage is that they don't have the long tail of connectors. But this advantage is constantly being eroded, and the long tail is, by definition, less marginally lucrative the further you push into it.So what's the play? Seems to me that their plan is to- take advantage of existing lock-in: jack up prices- accept the resulting churn; it'll happen anyway if nothing changes- use the windfall to power a set of acquisitions that amount to a land-grab of other, more defensible parts of the data stackThoughts?",

Here 2 recent projects: \\- [https://github.com/complexity-science-hub/llm-in-a-box-template/](https://github.com/complexity-science-hub/llm-in-a-box-template/)\\- [https://github.com/ascii-supply-networks/dagster-slurm/](https://github.com/ascii-supply-networks/dagster-slurm/) (this is still WIP, NOT finished) but I quite like the idea of bringing modern data orchestration tooling with a neat UX/DX to supercomputers (and it solves the pain for us that public clouds are too expensive for research.

I have to try really hard to make sense of everything business related as my brain is really naturally wired for technical stuff.What made me decide to switch to data engineering is that I just find it more interesting and this is where I see myself growing. As I've mentioned, my brain is also naturally wired for being technical than being business oriented. I also dislike building dashboards and would rather write automation scripts and ETL pipelines. I also find talking + presenting to business stakeholders rewarding but very draining so I prefer just being left alone coding. I guess being a DE is just a perfect alignment of what I'm naturally good at and what I'm interested doing which make it a good fit for me.I don't know why but I sense that you want to do something else that's not exactly DE related with the way you describe yourself as mediocre and not being able to build pipelines like the others. If you really want to be a DE, by all means work hard for you to get the right skills or maybe you just need to find the right environment that'll support your growth.The more important question is that, is that what you really want to do and where you want to grow? No one started as a good DE because the skillset required to be a good one is something that you can learn over the years as long as you have a learning mindset.The others already answered what possible paths to take but of course you have to identify first what you want to do. Just ask yourself: What am I interested at? What sparks my curiosity? Where do I see myself growing? What do I like/dislike about this role? What kind of projects/output interests me? What problems do I want to solve? What kind of hardships/challenges would I rather face?Go out there and explore. You might find the path that's the right fit for you. You define your own career.",

As a beginner, you tend to be afraid to bring someone on without the required skills. Spoiler alert: if they are motivated, they will learn and catch up! If they have a bad work ethic or sth, they will never learn.Experienced hiring managers and leads see the big problems in teams are caused by the bad apples. Those lacking humility, eagerness to learn or smarts in the workplace. So, although your point might also have to do with ego (\"I'm THE hiring manager because I know X/Y/Z\"), I think it's just a lack of experience in having made mistakes that is the real reason.",

The gap is operational responsibility. Can you troubleshoot when Cosmos throughput throttling breaks your ingestion?

And I could present that to you and you'd think \"wow it's not so bad there.\" But you'd be wrong. Because I don't control every pipeline. I can't, healthcare is too complicated and too big. Tons of special rules and regulations. And a lot of the other functional areas look like what you're describing. And they look like that despite some legitimate good effort on some DEs parts. And be careful what you insult or call bad practice. Once you start trying to work with this stuff, you might find out it's like that for reasons outside of your control, and someone has done the best they could with what they have.",

But in healthcare it can be worse, especially if you have dinosaur companies. Even when they develop newer version they keep the old structure and build on top. It’s rare to build a complete new software (with a new db structure). But no relations? I’ve never seen that, except with flat file dbs. The best solution is to talk with people who know the software and the database (if possible). Otherwise you’ll lose a lot of time. Prepare your questions and ask for regular meetings so you can go on with your work. Or bother them as soon as you have a question. I’ve had both scenarios. See what works best for them.",

Did you have strategies or tools that made the process more efficient than just manual exploration?Pretty much what you did. Break down the problem, isolate the problems one-by-one, and clearly document them. In one of Kimball's books, he talks about the concept of a \"bus matrix.\" It's not totally what you're after, but the idea is very similar. Come up with whatever standard concepts you are looking for, indicate the potential sources that semantically mean that thing, and then indicate how you map from a -> b, c -> b, etc. etc. It's paintstaking and laborious for sure!",

That's a big jump!Couple of points to your main question as someone who was in your position 4 years ago (almost to the day actually). but TL;DR I'd give yourself some more credit.1) I would not discount the work you do as a wrangler. Did you talk to stakeholders? Did you dive into the data? These things are often the hardest to teach. You know what it looks like when customers have the data they need, you know what questions to ask, and some of the subtle ways things can be wrong. This is very valuable. 2) You mentioned trying to keep up with standard practices at your previous job, this will likely have gotten you much farther than you think. A lot of folks don't really think about these things or appreciate why they are used. Beyond just that, it also demonstrates curiosity, which is very valuable. I'd actually say it's one of the main things I look for when interviewing junior to mid-level candidates. IMO that curiosity will take you farther than anything else. As far as not having a degree goes, the biggest challenge imo is convincing someone to take a chance on you, and you've just done that. That's not to say it's all downhill from here, but the degree no longer matters. I would be surprised if it even comes up the next time you're applying for a job. Keep asking questions, keep reading about best practices, keep trying your best. You'll go far.",

Lock down cloud basics: IAM roles/policies, VPC/subnets/security groups, storage semantics (S3/GCS), and how your orchestrator deploys code. Pick one broken or flaky job, add tests, alerts, and retries, then harden it end to end. For data modeling, define grain and primary keys first, keep naming consistent, and handle change with clear SCD rules before you chase “perfect” designs.Working in a new codebase: learn repo layout, run the full test suite, add tests around any bug you fix, and aim for frequent small PRs.

The application logic and authz is also in some cases deferred to the DB in Stored Procedures - a horrendous design driven by a data engineer who didn't/couldn't consider the whole application requirementsThe best skill you can learn is to be commercial, understanding and improving the data task requirements and how to communicate and refine broad tasks from the business.Learn how to understand the domain/problem, application/software/data architecture and understand the tools you have/are available. Then communicate improvements to the plan in planning, spikes, reviews, retros etc. And ensure you know your data modelling fundamentals - you should know when to normalise/denormalise data, implement appropriate SCDs, and the different industry 'best' practices for updating and tracking pipeline tables batch updates. So many engineers in general just do the task without understanding the why or taking ownership. Have opinions and be collaborative, that's what I look for in a good DE.Also expect (depending on your org and management) to hear heaps of no's - but realise that having opinions is a good thing.",

Connectors is the biggest gap: there’s no magic “one lib fits all.” It’s usually case by case, pyodbc or sqlalchemy for relational, boto3 for S3, azure-storage-blob for ADLS, google-cloud libs for GCS, requests for SaaS APIs, etc. I haven’t seen a universal package that matches ADF’s connector library.For orchestration, Airflow and Dagster are the go-tos. Prefect is nice if you want something lighter with better DX.Honestly, even GitHub Actions or cron works fine for simpler setups if you’re disciplined with retries/alerts. Hosting wise, containers on ECS/Kubernetes give flexibility, but I’ve also seen folks run Python EL pipelines on Azure Functions or AWS Lambda when workloads are small enough.The headache is always secure on-prem access. ADF’s IR is very convenient, and replacing that usually means standing up VPN, jump hosts, or agents that your orchestrator can reach. That’s the bit most people underestimate.I used to burn days wiring retries and metadata logging until I made it part of the design from the start. You probably already know, but building a little audit table for run\\_ts/run\\_id helps a ton when debugging.Curious are you mostly moving SaaS/db data or do you also have on-prem sources in the mix? We keep hitting this dilemma with clients too, and it’s one reason in Stacksync we leaned into building ingestion + sync as a product instead of fighting with connectors every project.",

The role of analysts was executed by the respective stakeholders who needed the data E.g. the finance team was pulling data with SQL directly from the databases for their own reporting purposes, the risk guys did the same ,etc. If something needed to be automated, changed or structured in a different way, they raised requests to the devs. The people who wrote SQL for data analysis were not dedicated only for data analysis, they were also experts in their own field with a sprinkle of SQL skills. 3. Around 100 people we started looking for a dedicated data engineer and hired analysts within the respective teams that would use the data (again, finance got their own, risk got their own, etc.).",

        "body": "The ROI threshold for dedicated data roles shows up when manual reporting starts consuming more hours than the insights are worth.Early stage you don't need either. Founders query the production database directly or export CSVs. Once that becomes 20+ hours weekly of repetitive aggregations, an analyst makes sense to automate dashboards.Engineer hiring triggers when data sources multiply beyond what one analyst can maintain. Three different databases plus external APIs means someone needs to own integration logic and handle schema drift when vendor systems change.Most companies hire backwards. They bring on analysts to build reports, then realize nobody can keep the pipelines running when source systems break. Ends up with analysts writing brittle ETL scripts they don't have time to maintain properly.Better sequence: engineer first to establish reliable data foundation, then analyst to consume it for insights. Otherwise you're building analytics on quicksand.",

I don't think unit tests apply to data eng/ETL like elsewhere in software engineering. I think you would be really surprised how far you can get with QA when you pick a record in the source, dump it to excel then look at the target and see if it matches the expected behavior (and then repeat for a few records). And then find records in your source that have certain edge cases and confirm your pipeline handled them correctly by looking at the exact records in the target",

You could do a inmon style data model, data vault or directly into a kimball structure. Inmon and Eata vault give more flexibility but require a lot more work in building them. While straight to Kimball is the simplest and quickest way of building data. It depends on your businesses skill sets and time constraints. - gold layer - kimball data models with surrogate keysIn terms of pipelines youre main aim is to have the easiest estate to maintain and manage. This to me means having minimal pipelines. This can be done by building a metadata driven ETL making your pipelines parametised and driven by configuration tables. In my experience its best to have configuration tables stored in an Azure SQL DB to allow easy transactional data changes, and ease of inserts and updates. With Azure pipelines you can typically do one extract pipeline (or a couple of parent child pipelines) per source system type and authentication type (e.g. Oracle and Windows auth).Enterprise/Silver pipelines you can have one pipeline.Presentations a pair of parent and child pipelines.",

In cloud stacks you trade that GUI clarity for scalability, and sometimes the trade doesn’t feel worth it.If you want something closest to that old-school feel, Coalesce is probably the best “modern PowerCenter” I’ve seen. You still end up with SQL under the hood, but the GUI gives you traceability that’s hard to replicate in pure PySpark. Matillion works too but the lock-in stories are real, and Informatica Cloud is… still Informatica, so you know what comes with that. Apache Hop is worth a look if you want open source with a GUI—less polished, but flexible.The reason folks keep pushing dbt is because it hits the sweet spot of modularization + lineage + testing in SQL. Add dbt’s semantic layer or a canvas-style GUI (dbt Cloud if you’ve got budget) and you get part of that PowerCenter experience without losing code discipline.If your gold models are the bottleneck, I’d maybe pilot Coalesce on a hairy one and compare cycle time + auditability against your current PySpark/dbt flows. Sometimes just seeing the impact analysis in a GUI saves hours of detective work.Curious, are you leaning toward vendor-backed tools (Coalesce, Matillion, Informatica) or would you consider open source like Hop or even something hybrid? We hit the same frustration with lineage when syncing ERPs/CRMs into warehouses, and it’s one of the reasons we built [Stacksync ](https://www.stacksync.com/)with audit trails baked in otherwise you lose days explaining how a field was derived.",

Maybe have a task where you hit a free stock market API and dump it into bigquery.Can you schedule jobs within your version of DBT? I feel like the DBT stuff should be set up as a job within an API trigger and then your DAG hits a “stg_daily_stocks+” to run it.After transformation, I’d expect something from the marts data to be extracted in some way and then pushed to a place for users to access. That could be into a sheet with gspread, or a slack channel, or somewhere else with an http endpoint. You can layer AI onto it at this stage too which would demonstrate experience with AI APIs.IMO, a better DAG would be:Extract_from_api >> run_dbt_job >> run_analysis >> communicate_to_team",

It is especially useful for scenarios where the database does not have timestamps, and you don't have other application-level events.Databases store every change that happen to them in some form of a changelog, roughly a file that has the changes applied to a row, sth like this:* table: `users`* operation: \\`UPDATE\\`* id: 42* email: [`old@example.com`](mailto:old@example.com) → [`alice@example.com`](mailto:alice@example.com)CDC is the idea of using this change dataset and replicate the same events for analytical purposes in other places, e.g. your BigQuery or Snowflake.There are various ways CDC can be implemented, the most common open-source software for that being Debezium, which reads these events from the database changelog and publishes them to other destinations such as Kafka. This allows people to start consuming the changes even if there's no domain events being published from the application.This way of retrieving the data is especially useful when you do not have reliable timestamp columns, which is very common in enterprise settings. CDC allows avoiding any changes to the applications themselves and still replicate the data into the destination in an efficient way.",

At the simplest level, it just means capturing row-level changes (inserts/updates/deletes) from a source system and pushing them somewhere else.How it’s done depends on the tech. Some databases expose their transaction logs (Postgres logical decoding, MySQL binlog, etc.), and CDC tools read from those. Others use triggers or periodic queries. So you’ll see CDC as both a *concept* (keep downstream systems in sync with source changes) and a set of *implementations* (Debezium, Oracle GoldenGate, Fivetran, Estuary, etc.).Compared to microbatches: microbatching polls the DB every X minutes and compares timestamps, which is simpler but usually heavier load and not real-time. Event streaming is closer in spirit, but those events are usually app-generated, not DB-level changes. CDC is nice when you want the “truth” from the database itself rather than relying on apps emitting events.",

I am not sure what you mean here.Are you already using DBT? Then sure, continue using that, and setup CDGC to scan the models, and then you have the exact data lineage in the catalog. As for data quality, Informatica have full-fledged data quality solution, so with me not having used DBT that much, I don't see what Informatica should lack that DBT has, but again, if you already have the DBT models running, it makes sense to continue doing so, and just add them in the catalog. Informatica can get lineage out of many many different systems, so using Informatica as ingestion is not a requirement to get data lineage, as long as your ingestion tool is supported to track lineage. > With new features like canvas and copilot I feel we can make our development quicker and most robust with git integrations.Depends on tradition and existing skills and habits in your organization. You can parameterize everything and template your way out in Informatica as well, though their git support is not always as nice as I would love. > Does informatica integrate well with DBt?Yes.You are however talking about different services. Data catalog is obvious; given DBT's focus on metadata. I see no reason as to why it should not be a breeze, though I have not used CDGC and DBT together yet.> Can we kick of DBT loads from informatica after ingesting the data?Yes. You can execute your tasks on command line or use the API and track the jobs through there if you need. But if you already have an orchestrator, why push that into Informatica? Informaticas catalog can get lineage etc anyway.> Is it DBT better or should we need to stick with snowflake sps? Not sure what you mean. Depends on situation and circumstances.You can use cdgc, data lineage, data quality and profiling in Informatica, without having Informatica to handle your ingestion or transformation. Or you can if you wish. Remember you can go to docs.informatica.com and download the scanners' document on DBT if you you wan't to know what is supported. Or any other systems you might thave, that Informatica supports. If you are to touch these tools you should have gotten an account so you can get the information that is requires an account. Haven't ever understood why some parts of the documentation requires an account, really.",

As others pointed out, solutions like Fivetran would be far better suited as an EL solution (with dbt doing the T) rather than using an old school ETL solution such as Informatica?Also using Informatica as data ingestion tool (EL) seems complete overkill in this scenario - especially as it is not really a \"no-code\" managed cloud service like Fivetran?

Ideally you want to choose a system that has built in connectivity and allows you to do your data manipulation along the way. If it does not have built in connectivity then look for systems that you can drop your own connectivity into. If data manipulation is not a concern, you could use a system like airbyte. If however, data manipulation is important, then use a system like tabsdata. Either way, choose the system that you feel comfortable with. Bottomline is to resist the urge to create hand-made solution that is taking care of connectivity, manipulation, reporting and job scheduling.

While none of these issues may immediately prop up, they invariably eventually will. Unless you are building a product that can be widely deployed for such use cases (which would require significant over engineering), you will end up making assumptions one after the other that eventually become invalid and cause failures. The solution will eventually lead to more patchwork etc.Another example - what if the requirements, which are arguably very simple now, change down the line. At that time, you may not see it as your problem but your employer will unfortunately.Hope you see the point. Given you have simple connectivity and you are comfortable with python, I strongly suggest looking at tabsdata as a possible open source solution that will help you focus on your domain/ETL logic and can use the connectivity you provide. Most other systems will split the ingest and transform into different layers unless the transform logic is trivial.",

Do a two-step flow: validate/transform first, then post. Add retries with backoff, timeouts, and a circuit breaker; failed records go to a dead-letter table so the run can keep going. Version your transform with Pydantic models so schema drift blows up loudly. Log a correlation\\_id end to end and ship structured logs. Do a daily reconciliation: counts and a checksum/hash by vendor to catch silent misses.If you don’t have native connectors, tabsdata is a decent middle ground to keep your transforms in one place; otherwise a light orchestrator like Prefect beats Task Scheduler for retries and alerts. I’ve used Airbyte and tabsdata, but DreamFactory helped when I needed to expose legacy ERP tables as clean REST endpoints without writing glue code.Point is: make it idempotent, add state + retries, and use a lightweight orchestrator so maintenance stays sane.",

There's an easy way for the reviewer/UAT resource to review the code and then push it to prod (I guess they would be reviewing the PR in git and approving)? 2. Each persons changes remain separated (in their own branch) until they are reviewed and merged to Prod. For #2, it doesn't work that way for our environment. As soon as a dev tests and passes their code to stage/uat it's in a singular branch. So, if three different devs have merged their code to stage, but only two of their changes have been reviewed by a UAT resource (let's say the 3rd devs code needs to be reviewed by a different UAT resource), we still can't merge the code to prod because there's a pending change in the branch that hasn't been reviewed yet. Make sense?This wouldn't be an issue if the team was smaller. But since this dbt project covers multiple business applications, sometimes one UAT resource approves changes but another hasn't had time to look over remaining code changes in the stage branch.",

For dates, detect formats per column, parse explicitly, store raw and ISO, and flag ambiguous rows. For addresses, split them with libpostal or usaddress, then validate/standardize against a service like Melissa or Smarty; keep an “unparsed” bucket and a small review queue. Talend or Matillion handle conditional logic and mapping fast; push heavy transforms into Snowflake with dbt, and add tests with Great Expectations so bad rows get quarantined. For backfill, run batch by domain, then switch to incremental loads with idempotent models and row-level dedupe keys. I’ve paired Talend and dbt before, and DreamFactory helped expose a crusty ERP as REST and proxy an address-validation call without extra glue code.Bottom line: choose a data-quality-focused ETL, rely on deterministic parsers over GenAI, and test every transform in Snowflake.",

Given you are comfortable and focused on saving time, use a system that:* allows you to import all of the original data and schemas, and* build incremental transforms that will turn that messy data into conforming data. One option is to dump everything into a data platform (snowflake here) and clean it up there, although that will skyrocket the costs. Another option is that you use an open source solution to process this before loading it into snowflake. Options include systems like delta lake and tabsdata. Bottomline is that whatever you do, it should lead to operational dataflows that will continue to work after the current backlog is finished to ensure that the systems stay in sync until the legacy ERP is retired (which, brace for it, may never happen).(Edit: formatting)",

The team that stayed needed elastic SQL at high concurrency, cross‑cloud, mature Spark, and better CI/CD; Fabric Spark jobs were slower for them, pipelines felt young, and workspace isolation made dev/prod clunky. Also test for throttling during heavy Power BI refresh windows; we hit capacity collisions.OP, run a 3-4 week POC: pick a heavy SQL ELT job, one streaming workload, and a BI model; baseline cost at target concurrency; validate git deployment, lineage, RLS, private endpoints, and backup/restore/failover. Fivetran for ingestion and dbt for transforms worked well; we also used DreamFactory to expose warehouse tables as quick REST APIs for app teams.If Power BI + governance consolidation doesn’t deliver clear savings and simpler ops, stick with Snowflake/Databricks.",

Ship a CLI that outputs both JSONL and JUnit XML so GitHub Actions/GitLab can surface failures inline, plus per-check severity (warn vs fail) and exit codes. Add partition-aware filters (like lastndays or where on a timestamp) and a tiny state store (sqlite) to track baselines for freshness/volume z-scores. For CSV, consider running via DuckDB so DB/CSV share one SQL adapter, and add a statement timeout and optional EXPLAIN to catch accidental full scans. An Airflow operator and a dbt post-hook would make it drop-in; also support sampling and row\\_count deltas pre/post transforms. For messy schemas, ship a “hints.yml” that maps ugly names to semantics so Claude prompts stay deterministic. With dbt and Soda Core for assertions and anomaly checks, I’ve also used DreamFactory to spin up quick REST endpoints over Snowflake/Postgres that a tester can hit in CI. Keep it lightweight, but add CI outputs, partitions, severity, and state.",

As somebody reading your github, as soon as I saw the dataset I immediately though \"this person has followed a course to make this\" which may, or may not, be true although, in my opinion, that's the effect of using a common dataset has after reading your 10 CV of the day.>I'd love to know what to learn / implement for my next project to get it at a level which would get recognised by potential employee.In my opinion, if you're going to make a project, it's about making something which interests you rather than making a project for the sake of making one. Speaking with, what I think anyway, is reasonable knowledge about the UK DE market, people will have a flick through your Github and a competency style interview is more likely than anything else for your first job. So, you should have something to talk about.The easiest way to do that is build something which is interesting to you. Being able to build and solve problems independently by far the biggest and most difficult step, although it's the most important and rewarding.>Also, since I don't have a qualification in the field, I have been looking into the 'Microsoft Certified: Fabric Data Engineer Associate' course and wondered if its something I should look at doing to boost my CV/ potential hire-ability ?Certifications are for people with experience rather than people who are new. If you are new, having strong fundamentals is a lot more important because somebody who can quickly pick up how things work is a lot more likely to be somebody who is a valuable contributor than somebody who is sleepwalking through certificates and courses, not really being sure what to do.Only ones I do recommend is do the free AWS cloud course.The next question is - well, how do I stand out? Get on the phone and speak to recruiters. Go and build rapport and sell your experience that way by showing you know more than your CV lets on. At the end of the day, everybody needs each other. They're the gatekeeper who wants to let people in so they can get paid, so it's in their best interest to place you provided you meet the criteria.More often than not, it's giving the recruiter confidence to put you forward more than being 100% qualified for the job. Nobody in the job advert will ever say \"Will take somebody who can program, lives in the UK, and isn't an utter bellend\" although sometimes that's exactly what they're looking for. Only the person in the hiring process will tell you that.",

If you have an existing Airflow instance, and you want to build and maintain your own ingestion DAGs then you can go for it. Check a DAG example [here](https://docs.open-metadata.org/latest/deployment/ingestion/external/airflow#example). If instead, you want to use the full deployment process from OpenMetadata, `git-sync` would not be the right tool, since the DAGs won't be backed up by Git, but rather created from OpenMetadata. Note that if anything would to happen where you might lose the Airflow volumes, etc. You can just redeploy the DAGs from OpenMetadata.",

Lightweight API layer for common queries.Technically, that maps to: dbt for transformations, Snowflake or BigQuery for storage, FastAPI or GraphQL for data access. Users write dbt models, your team manages infrastructure and core datasets.If users are more technical, go full developer platform. Version controlled data pipelines, CI/CD for data products, infrastructure as code. Think Airflow for orchestration, Terraform for infra, Git workflows for collaboration.The mistake most teams make is building custom internal tools nobody uses. Instead, adopt standard open source with good docs. Your value is curating datasets and maintaining platform, not building bespoke ETL frameworks.Start small: pick 3 high-value datasets, build them as self-service products with clear schemas and documentation.

Survey the dozen most common requests. Dashboards, raw exports, real-time streams, or ML features? That tells you what to build. Most 300 person orgs need a data warehouse with dbt for transformations, not streaming Kafka sitting idle.Mid-level team is your advantage. Senior engineers overbuild. You'll ship Postgres with Airbyte and dbt in 8 weeks. Senior teams debate Snowflake vs Databricks for 6 months then build custom Spark jobs nobody maintains.Your bottleneck is governance not technology. When 50 technical hires pull data you need contracts, documentation, access controls. Build the boring stuff first. Data catalog, CI/CD for transformations, automated testing.

The Dev environment needs to have prod data. My team uses dbt for our sql models, and we configure our dev environment to pull in prod dataOkay, so now you have a dev and a prod SSIS environment. You need to configure your environment variables in the SSIS project. This will allow GitHub later to switch between environments based on the git branch.You can use Github actions to build the ci/cd. The action is just a yaml file that gives github a list of instructions to perform. Here is the workflow. You push code for your local repo, les call it ticket SSIS-001. The ticket changed the column name in a table. When you push the local changes to the remote branch, aka SSIS-001, on the remote server. The Github actions will kick off the instructions. The goal of the instructions is to confirm of the deployment is worked as expected. You will probably want to run some test that check if any of your transformations fail. If any transformation fails, the entire pipeline will fail. When this happens, the ci/cd will stop. This means you can't merge SSIS-001 into prod.So, now you go back on your local branch and fix the issue and push the changed back to the remote SSIS-001 branch. The pipeline passed, and now you merge into master branch. The master branch will run a pipeline that is the same and then push the dtsx package to ssis server and done.Checkout Azure DevOps that might where you want to handle the ci/cd. But if you google github actions or Azure dev ops for ssis you will get a yaml file that will look exactly like how you deploy manually today",

        "body": "Off the bat there really aren’t universal “best practices” - Data Engineering has historically been a very “dirty” area in IT. You will need to be able to adapt to kind of whatever your company throws at you/wants from you. It’s definitely getting better, tools like Dagster, dlt, dbt (R.I.P. this open source project…) together with [PEP 318](https://peps.python.org/pep-0318/) (and associated RFP) have really helped to push DE closer towards SE in design and implementation. As such you are best looking at best practices around software engineering principles and adapting to your work.To answer your questions, please see below:1. This VERY much up to you as the DE to decide. The OLTP -> HDFS/S3(-like) storage is a very common use case and as such has a lot of choice for you as the DE. In saying that it’s easiest to usually use what you have on hand/in production already. Have SSIS - you can start with that, only have Python - use that. What you are really asking here is how do I ETL - just google ETL OLTP to storage etc.2. For you (or your architects/plats guys if you have them) to decide, but I personally would want separation of services since I’m not trying to deal with noisy neighbours etc. You really don’t want to add more ways for your Production OLTP server to crash/underperform IMO. So I would recommend a seperate VM/dedicated file server/service with proper subnetting etc.3. Will once again depend on use case, but almost always will be read-replica if they exist in your corp. (You can take this as - Yes, use your read replica(e).4. You will need a VPN gateway (unless you are running some ExpressRoute etc). Also you will need to give the cloud storage a Private IP address (and check subnetting/peering etc) Your network guy(s) will know what to do/should really be doing this for you.5. Just more ETL - this time file system to cloud storage. Once again you decide.6. :person_shrugging: Up to you. I personally don’t use them as they quite expensive and don’t seem worth it to me and my practice, but if your company is on board and you feel more comfortable using them go for it.Edit: I want to point out that it entirely possible to this all on-premise (and open sourced :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:) if you need/the cloud aspect is the most frustrating portion.",

Commercial solutions like fivetran or open source systems like tabsdata could be used. Try not to have your own managed staging area as that creates complications and management overhead.> Would the file system be on the same server as the database or on a separate server?If you still do that, don't put data on the system where the db is, use a spearate system.> Is it better to extract the data from a replica or would it also be acceptable to access the production database?Depends upon on the db load profile. Use the replica if it is readily available unless the load on the production database is low enough that you can query it directly for data extraction.> How do I connect an on-premise server with cloud storage?There are data movement systems you can and should use for this. No point in reinventing the wheel as it will get complicated very fast.> How do I transfer the extracted data that is now on the file system to cloud storage? Again custom scripts?Again, if you insist on going this route, I would still suggest using a data movement system to pick it up from local file system and sending it to cloud.> What about tools like Fivetran and Airbyte?That is a good idea.

Provide a small set of vetted query templates for common asks; let the agent fill dimensions/metrics only. Lean on dbt exposures/metrics, cache the heavy queries with materialized views + TTL, and invalidate via lineage.Handle dialects by normalizing with SQLGlot; add a “safe mode” where the agent outputs a tiny DSL that you compile to SQL AST. Observability: fingerprint queries, tie to user/session, log rows, bytes scanned, and cost; sample results to detect drift. CI: canary prompts per dataset with golden answers and block deploy on regressions. Governance: row-level policies, redact PII before Slack, and cap output size. Backpressure: per-user budgets, token and scan quotas, and a simple priority queue.We’ve paired Airbyte and dbt for pipelines, and DreamFactory to auto-generate REST APIs over legacy SQL Server/Mongo so the agent only hits curated endpoints.Get the sandbox, evals, and budgets right first-then the agent loop becomes manageable.",

A few comment- access control, permissions, observability and other enterprise features are built in to the product. - eval: bow has built in evals and self learning (from human or machine feedback) which works great!About semantic layer/parameterizied queries— the product has native support (dbt etc), but honestly— I don’t think this approach of hardcoding LLM exactly how to query will scale and I think data tools will converge to use instructions or more llm-friendly formats like agents.md. Why:- being too specific with LLMs kills their agency. Semantic/metric layers often even define how you sort the data. It’s good for dashboards and such but not for exploratory analysis usually triggered by prompting — recommended read: https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents- semantic layers are (due to how specific they need to be) are long and never ending projects. AI is moving faster, you don’t want to block AI to when semantic layer is ready (never)What do you think?",

This is paramount. Aim to complete things already in play before you start new things.I'd drop the product. Unless it's already got legs and you have actual commercial interest, putting your time into something which, by the sounds of it, already exists may not be optimal for your current mental health.

I want to keep build towards something bigger but feel like times not on my sideI have no idea how old you are, but you sound young. The idea of time not being on your side is absolutely insane. You probably have a lot more time than you think, you're just giving yourself a million things to do and wondering where the fuck all your time goes.Do less. It's okay.> Feels like a lot to juggle and I don’t want to get stuck.Real talk here: sounds like you are already stuck. The good news is there's a reason - you aren't aiming for anything in particular and you are trying to do everything. This is like one of those things when at work everybody says \"I need this tomorrow!\" so you bust it out and then it turns out they didn't need it tomorrow.Prioritise what's important. Finish your degree. Have a think about what you really really want to do for a couple of weeks instead of putting time into time consuming things.

Currently im developing in C# and its so nice to just be able to hit „build“ and see if the code still compiles.Apart from that Python is slow and because of the GIL concurrent programming is a PITA.",

You will have a very wide base of knowledge, just deep enough to know what you actually need to do.The most useful in real life for most people is probably DSA. At university, you will learn way more complex DSA than when you are self taught. (I personally also did multiple advanced DSA courses, because I liked the topic)I implemented a partial merge sort (just the merge step, we had pre-sorted data in our database (as JSON, don't ask)) twice. I had to implement a version of A\\* to run on a huge dataset (which was not in a graph database, it was a mess but worked) and I had to write a maximum-flow-algorithm.I am sure a programmer without prior knowledge could have solved all of these issues, but I already knew how to solve them and what I needed to look up (because I didn't do all that by heart) in advance. That's the real benefit: I know what to look up, and when I need it.Other topics that I know \"enough\" about to gain a massive speed boost, should they become relevant, include how operating systems work, how the network stack works, basically all math that will ever be relevant to me, how compilers/interpreters work, and probably a lot more passive knowledge I forgot about.EDIT: You absolutely CAN learn all of that by yourself, but generally people don't (and it takes quite a while longer without good lecturers, tutors, fellow students, dedicated time and pressure to learn things you don't particularly enjoy)",

Frankly, I haven't needed most CS fundamentals in anything I've written (e.g., you don't need red/black trees to sling JSON across the internet or optimize a SQL query).Here's some books I read and recommend, in no particular order:* Refactoring by Martin Fowler* Domain-Driven Design by Eric Evans* Working Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers* Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture by Martin Fowler* 97 Things Every Programmer Should Know by Kevlin Henney (and 97 other people)* Accelerate by Nicole Forsgren et al (more about managing teams, etc.)* Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce* Modern Operating Systems by Andrew Tanenbaum et al (deep dive into how operating systems actually work)* Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann* A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms by Jay WengrowPlus a pile of language-specific books, etc. Some of there I drew a lot of lessons from, some I've abandoned a lot of lessons from, but overall I just recommend reading something that fits your current needs, especially after you land a job.",

Let's say they get 2000 applications for an open posting. They need to cut it down to, say, 10 to call in for an interview. If half of those 2000 don't have a B.Sc. in Comp Sci on their resume, it is easy to toss them in a bin and cut your search space in half. Will you throw away some applications from great candidates? Absolutely. But their priority will be whittling down the pile of resumes to a more manageable number as fast as possible so anything they can filter on is great.Next to that hurdle, there's just that university comes with lots of networking skills. You'll make contacts - especially if you do an internship, but even if you don't if you have a good reputation in your program the other good students are going to remember you. And might give you a recommendation if you try to get in where they work. The whole \"it isn't what you know, it is who you know\" is at least partially true in every field.Okay, social/employment considerations aside, what actual learning advantages does University have? There's a few.First is time. Between classes and studying and assignments, you'll probably spend 5000 hours over 4 years on comp sci as you go through the degree, which I think is probably the bare minimum you need to get competent. A lot of self-taught people are trying to cram in all their learning into just a couple hundred hours and that's super unrealistic.In addition, when your work is being evaluated by others it helps you figure out if you're actually learning anything. Good professors (and they aren't all good) will design assessments that are really testing if you understand the material deeply. Whereas I see so many people \"self-teach\" themselves and learn *nothing* because their knowledge is never put to the test and they never realize they've just been copying tutorials and never actually internalized anything.In terms of actual subject matter, yeah, fundamentals, data structures and algorithms, that type of thing self-taught people tend to miss out on. But there's like a *million* books you can pick up that'll teach you those. The employment angle and the \"actually forcing you to spend the time and effort instead of just convincing yourself you're learning\" parts are the far more important aspects for most people.",

CS grads may have more theoretical knowledge but they may not have \"industry-ready\" knowledge such as knowing Git, knowing PostgreSQL, building a rest apt, etc. Autodidacts will have a lot of holes in what they know and without proper fundamental knowledge, they may get stuck.However, this is just a generalization: * Not every CS degree holder are the same. Believe me, I've seen some who, all they did throughout their 4-5 years in college was just coasting, only studying in preparation for an exam but never actually grasped what they've learned. Also, there are CS degree holders, in addition to having solid grasp of the fundamentals, also know important software engineering tools such as git, know multiple languages in depth and software engineering principles.* Not every self-taught programmer just knows basic web dev stuff. Some even learn other languages, some learn in depth. And there are self-taught devs who learn the fundamental knowledge (such as Data structures and algorithms, computer architecture, software design, etc). Any serious developer, regardless of their background, will eventually have to learn the fundamentals if they want to stay relevant, and not just someone learning a new hot technology each month only for it to be deprecated the next month)",

You can do a lot of low level things and learn a lot about hardware architecture. Most of my suggestions above almost *require* C at times. Maybe that’s your thing maybe it isn’t (it *is* my thing if you can’t tell). Unfortunately school classes are not usually good at helping us find *what* we want to do with programming. Struggling in a class is another thing though and very rough. So I’m sorry you’re going through that. It’s especially hard when it’s something you thought you’d like. Try and see what school resources you have, sometimes they have free support systems for people who want to help struggling students. Sometimes it takes in-person help to really wrap our head around complex subjects. Programming can take shaping your brain to think differently for those who don’t already think like a robot.",

Theory of code is great. It’s nice to understand concepts. But truly understanding code comes from writing it. Seeing the same error and then eventually clicking “oh it’s because I put this here, or oh, I see how to refactor this into less spaghetti”Additionally, while C is a backbone language it is considered low level, and you might benefit from taking what you know and applying it to another language. Some are much easier to learn than others. For example, writing a webpage with basic functions (like say writing a blog post) is significantly easier in my opinion than the majority of things you could build in C. Not only is the syntax easier to understand and master, but you get immediate gratification in seeing what you’re doing as you work and change things. E.g. changing the size of text or a container can be immediately seen when you reload the page or even faster if you use a plugin like Live Server. (Refreshes page every save so you don’t have to manually reload the page). Anyway, my point is don’t fret on not understanding all of the conceptual stuff. Some of it will come in time. There’s still theory far beyond me and I’ve been employed and coding projects for about five years now and again I need to note I didn’t return to college and pick coding back up until my mid twenties. However, I started with Python and then quickly moved into data cleaning with python libraries like NumPy and Pandas. Then web development, then swiftUI, and now I actually mostly use react (JS library), and for personal projects a lot of godot so gdscript.",

Loop a few more times, print something different, whatever. Make sure you know what the original did and what the changes you made did.Now, do that again. A lot.I like to code tic tac toe. I've done it a thousand times, still fun. You start with the most basic of things, printing. You quickly realize you might want an array. Then you'll figure out some functions you'll want. And so on.Try that.",

It includes:\\- Communication server and client in C - supporting both Internet sockets and AF\\_UNIX sockets for easy testing \\- Packet construction and parsing modules for a custom userspace payload protocol \\- BigInt Math library including not only ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV but more advanced stuff like Montgomery Modular Multiplication, to do math on gargantuan numbers with thousands of digits each.. \\- Cryptography library implementing Diffie-Hellman prime search and shared secret generation, chacha20, blake2, argon2id, stuff like that.After this is done, I'm planning to do a project that has both low-level components like FPGA / kernel modules, as well as high-level components like a website (whose webserver i'll write in Assembly of course, frontend in CSS/HTML/JS) to control the embedded board remotely from anywhere or something.

It's much more comfortable on your eyes and much more ergonomic for typing.Basically, I had the same issue with headaches and sore eyes - but the issue for me was staring at my laptop screen close to my face.

The current interview meta is more forgiving because companies are using coderpad, which has syntax highlighting and suggestions, but that hasn't always been the case and could just as well change in the near future because of cheating. White board coding or even basic notepad coding takes a certain amount of care and attention to detail that is becoming exceedingly rare because of the vibes. Building the habit of proof reading the code you just wrote is incredibly important for catching bugs. Not just simple compiler errors but subtle runtime errors as well.",

It can only really be generalized to \"able to competently build stuff of reasonable quality with the particular language/tech, with minimal overhead and ramp up time\". But even that is relative to job title and expected general experience level. Thus *strong* proficiency is that same idea, but better and more knowledgeable. I think for most roles, \"strong proficiency\" implies something beyond simply having existing knowledge and intermediate competency. It means having used a language enough to know many of its ins and outs, and having reasoned opinions about different approaches/methods/etc. which come from prior experience — on top of generally writing quality code. Someone with strong proficiency isn't stumbling their way to *some* working solution — they're choosing wisely from several possible approaches, and making deliberate decisions about *why* they're writing code a particular way. My personal rule of thumb is that someone who can't articulate a personal take on what constitutes \"proficiency\" in a given language is almost certainly *not* highly proficient in that language.",

It gets into an \"operations\" problem.The short answer: just make a file on a Local Area Network (LAN), (usually just on your home network somewhere), and then access it by that local network's IP address.Long answer: By _default_, nothing has a domain name on the internet. You have to apply to get one of those if you want it to be public, and it's a whole process.By _default_, everything on the internet has an IP address. This address allows the computer to figure out what other computer to talk to.Most (home network) LANs have an NAT (network address translator), which takes all the requests sent to it that are destined for the WWW, and translates them so the data gets sent back to said NAT, and translates it back to the LAN address. This NAT is usually in a Router (a connection between two different networks.)Without this router, you cannot connect to the LAN from the internet, so it is not public.With this router, the stuff on your network is only public if you change the router settings to allow incoming connections (usually with Port Forwarding/Triggering)Thus, routers have two different IP addresses. One for \"the internet\" to communicate with it, and one for the LAN, to communicate with the LAN.Any computer connected to the LAN can talk to any other device on the LAN with its IP address. This LAN address usually starts with 10., or 192.168., depending on how the router is set up.So if you save the website on a local computer, then use the computers LAN IP as the URL on any other computer in that LAN, you get what you want.",

Nobody's going to accidentally discover that, but copying IPv6 addresses around is kind of a pain and the people you're sharing it with may not even have IPv6 access.The easiest thing to do is just to not worry about any of that. Get a domain name, run a server to serve your web page, and put a password on it. Practically every web server will allow you to require a username & password to access a page, so you can just set that and then also give those out to anybody you want to access it.",

I can do meanwhile something else when doing home office. Will get a notification when the test run ended and I can return to my laptop. I have played around with local LLMs as well, recently.My projects are something that I will be using. Either daily, as part of my work, or will be using time by time. I have one project idea in my mind to set up a monitoring system for my home with Zimaboard. Like this I can see how much power I had used over the time, which home machines used the most power. Where I can save up money. etc.But it is not that I will practice daily or something. I work on my hobby projects whenever I feel so. Sometimes I go cycling instead. Sometimes I watch anime. Anything really. Me coding from my free time can be from 0 minutes a week to 20+ hours a week.",

Its only hard to be motivated to learn if I didn't have freedom because of my current job to do game design and learn related code in the meantime. I worked two full time jobs when I was in college for my AS that I ultimately couldn't finish because my father was diagnosed with cancer my last year and I had only child responsibilities.

IMO the numpads should be moved to the left-hand side of the keyboard so we could have the home row in front of us, and one peripheral (mouse & numpad) to each side.",

And if it needs to integrate into an existing code base it gets worse. Treat it as a data summarization tool. In general, we’re still learning how best to use this thing. After a couple real years of trying, ROE on AI in business has been objectively abysmal. Programmers who expected a 20% speedup often actually experience a 5% slowdown since correcting AI throws off their rhythm when they could have banged out the pattern on autopilot. This will get better but it’s not a complete revolution yet.

If you want to really learn a specific IDE, you should think of that as a separate project from learning C.For C, you should focus on the language itself. You can go a long way with no IDE at all. Most programs you write while learning C will be perhaps a few dozen lines long and easily fit in a single source file. You can compile your program with a single command like: gcc program.c -o programThere are of course about a million compiler flags that can change aspects of how the compiler works, what errors and warnings it emits, what architecture to compile for, what files to include, and on and on. Those are good things to know about, but not anything you need to know while you’re learning the fundamentals of C. In short, you seem to want to do everything all at once. **Start with a good book about C.** Work your way through it, doing as many of the exercises as you can. Once you’ve finished that, you’ll be in a better position to decide what you want to learn next — IDE, compiler minutiae, debugging, source control, etc.",

The current LTS are Java 21 and Java 25.And similar version changes have happened also to Spring Boot and other things.But as we know, the real life shows that companies are still using old versions because most of the development funds go to adding new features and fixing bugs. Infrastructure upgrades are of lower priority for the management level.Maybe somehow big thing was Log4Shell vulnerability that affects Log4J versions between 2.0 and 2.15. If you have any projects using Log4J from these versions then update your stuff. That Log4Shell was a catastrophe level vulnerability. Or, just learn to use vulnerability checking tools like OWASP Dependencycheck or Trivy scanner if you are not doing it already.Other than that, the world is quite same in 2025 as it was in 2017.When it comes to an AI then that is what you need to learn to use. Everything else is just version upgrades.There is free ChatGPT tier you can use. Also Google AI Studio is free to use (better than free ChatGPT tier). Just try it out. See what it can do and what it can't do. I would say that the current AI is on a Bachelor student's level. So, imagine working with a Junior developer. Sure, it is a helpful tool when it comes to debugging stuff, brainstorming, etc. Also when it comes to automating simple things. But do not fully trust its output. Be critical about its answers. Imagine doing a code review to a Junior developer. Like that.More often than not, then current AI that is available to us, is lazy, forgets things (due to a context window and due to an unoptimized focus), sometimes ignores your instructions. Many of the AI tools can access the Internet. BUT it does not mean it will do it. It is lazy. Unless you demand from it to look up information from the Internet it will not do it. It tries to rely mainly on its training data (which can be outdated). It also hallucinates when it does not have an exact answer to something. It starts generalizing stuff and making up answers.So, be critical with what the AI is telling you. It is a useful tool but do not fully trust it. The same way how you do not fully trust Google Search results. Verify over, when possible.You can also use Claude Code that can work with your projects in your own machine. But all the pros and cons of AI apply also to Claude Code. You will tell it to do things and it will then display code changes with a git diff. Then you will either approve, reject, or correct it with your own input on this.Edit: That answer is based on what concerns backend development. Can't give much input about how did the frontend development changed or not, in these 8 years.",

For example if you were making a game engine you might build over top of a Graphics Library, an Audio Library etc. Or, if you wanted to stay sane you'd use an framework or engine and have a higher abstraction.

Only one packet can be sent by one host at any given time, since there’s only one wire to talk on.Rather than send EVERY packet on your local lan to EVERY host on your local lan, a switch pays attention to the traffic (including some special packets) and figures out who’s on which physical outgoing cable, and sends packets only to their recipients. But that’s just an optimization. It does the same *job* as twisting 8 sets of wires together, like the hub was doing. Purely a local-network thing.You can see how this is totally different than inspecting packet headers, consulting routing tables, and forwarding a packet along on its way to who knows where.[I guess that’s a long way of saying that a router routes IP packets on the global network , and a switch “routes” Ethernet packets on the local network.

Layer 2 is about connecting the physical devices together on the local network.Real, physical devices that you actually use, almost always operates at ALL layers. A router will have a physical connection to other devices, it will will have to be using something like Ethernet to connect, it will have a networking protocol like IP, IPX or something obscure for its primary functionality. But it will also have a management interface, and often it will have some support for network services like ntp, dhcp, dns, etc, meaning it will operate in layer 4-7.Many of the devices called 'switches' you will have access these days also can operate as routers, have packet filtering and so on. Many devices that are called 'routers' and used for home networks include a switch. I could take a random computer and put in a few network interfaces in it, and with Linux turn it into a router, or switch. What something is called is more about what you believe the primary function of the device is.> even though switch comes after router. When looking at the OSI model, you must evaluate it individual for every single device between the source and destination.

A router can connect different types of networks. A 'switch' is basically an Ethernet only thing.It used to be very common to have a T1 (serial), or frame-relay, or some other type layer 2 network connect to the router, and maybe a token ring network on the 'local' segment.For people with a cable internet connection (DOCSIS) they will have a router with a cable interface and an ethernet interfaces. Or maybe you'll could have a DSL connection so you'll have a router with a DSL interface.DSL, DOCSIS, frame relay, fddi, token ring and many more are not Ethernet.

Ethernet is what most of us think about and is extremely common in home and business networks. But there are many more. High capacity fiber links, satellite networks, cellular networks, even USB and Bluetooth, all have their own implementations and their own particular way of sending data between devices on those networks. The Internet Protocol accepts the fact that network operators won’t always agree on what devices and protocols to use, and that new network innovations might occur in the future. The Ethernet protocol is actually younger than the IP protocol. There were other types of networks in use when IP was developed, some still in use and others not. With IP, as long as devices are able to send an ordered sequence of bytes over a network they can handle IP traffic, and a lot of details necessary for how those bytes are moved in the network are left to the lower layers.",

That part used to be a lot bigger (with directly programming assembly instructions or managing memory), but it's still there, hidden under layers of compilers that translate your code to stuff the machine can work with.One thing you can do is to flip your mental switch and not treat programming as something goal oriented, but with the mathematicians curiosity of: okay, I have this set of primitives (your language and the idealised computer it runs on) - what can I do with this? What interesting stuff can be found in the set of all possible programs - and how does that change if I use a different idealised machine (for example with an ARM chip vs an x86-64 chip) or with a GPU.",

My suggestion: learn full-stack development without shortcuts so you understand how frontend, backend, DBs, and deployment connect. Once you know the basics, use AI to speed up work (scaffolding, tests, explanations).If you want to learn frontend connection and use AI in development, a practical way is to build a small, deployable app end-to-end. You may or may not follow a course for the app idea. Utilize platforms such as Replit or Lovable or similar, to prototype a frontend for your backend. Those platforms provide code for the generated frontend prototype. Use ChatGPT (or another model) to clarify each generated code block and how it could integrate into your backend application. Write the code(implement it yourself, not copy) in your backend developed application. Reading, running, and editing the code is how you learn. Use AI as an assistant to make your app better. That balance (fundamentals first, AI as an assistant) will make you a faster and stronger developer.",

All the tutorials online are beginners tutorial and cover everything I already know, but everything else is just \"build a project\" and requires knowledge of frameworks Nothing ever requires a framework… You can do most things from first principles and be just fine (only area where this might be a bit iffy is cryptography and encryption since you actually have to be sort of domain expert to understand all the constant time hacks etc…)> I have never seen and I don't know where to even start gaining that knowledge.

Use a secure, unique password, with 2FA if possible. Don't fall for phishing attacks that seem like they're coming from your registrar but aren't really.The other is the privacy of your registration information. ICANN requires that all domains have valid contact information, including a mailing address, and that information is made public through the \"Whois\" database system. If you don't want your details to be public, you may want to use whatever privacy forwarding service that your registrar provides. (If you just provide fake info, it's possible that you'll lose access to the domain when the contact info can't be validated.)----Everything else depends not on the domain itself, but what server you're pointing its DNS records at.If you're using a static file host such as GitHub Pages, then there's not much to be concerned with. Any attacks would go to GitHub's servers, not yours, and there's not much risk of a security problem affecting your data specifically. All you really have to worry about is inadvertently publishing information that you want to keep private, but that's true of literally any digital communications.If you were to have your own webapp running on your own server, then you would have to be a lot more careful with security, but that's true whether or not there's a domain name pointing to your server.",

Take 2 equations: f(x) = 100x + 10, g(x) = x (the simplest function we can represent with the same degree as f(x)).The largest exponent for both of these equations is 1, so we can apply the above rule. Let's choose a constant of 105 for c.For some values of x, f(x) > c * g(x). Take x == 1 for example. F would be 110 and g would be 1. 110 > 105 (1 * C). However, at larger values of x, this doesn't stay true. At x == 10 we get f is 1,010 and g is 10. So, for these values, f(x) 1,010.Basically, this just sums down to the idea that a functions growth is capped to its largest exponent, which is why Big O notation always ignores constants (except for O(1)). So, even something like f(x) = 1,000,000,000x, the Big O notation would be O(x), because there exists a constant C and a value of x X0 that f(x) < c * g(x).",

For game engines, there are plenty of tutorials you can watch.I also learned at 14 in 1998 with QBASIC on DOS. There was no Google and I had a \"secret codebook\" with some simple programming details, and I taught myself from there until I took a class in high school on C++. It's *way* easier to learn now. So yes, I would argue you can definitely do it!The key thing is to start small. Take things one step at a time. Don't add a game engine before you know what a variable or condition is. You don't need to finish the whole [Harvard CS50 course](https://www.youtube.com/cs50) before you open a game engine, but at least a few intro videos can be a big help.For game engines, both Unity and Godot are popular for beginners. Godot is easier to start with (simpler, no setup), Unity has more jobs/resources. Both are great choices.Either way, I'd take one of many online programming courses in Python or C\\# before jumping into an engine, or perhaps dig into the CS50 course for more structured learning. A game engine adds a bunch of concepts on top of programming that are specific to the engine. If you want to jump in with both feet, that's fine, but you may struggle with information overload. If that happens, I recommend taking a break from the game engine and going back to programming basics, then trying the engine again when you feel more comfortable.Good luck!",

But that was a long time ago, there is certainly a lot more, better, learning resources out there now than 15 years ago. And I was less solely focused on game dev, I was more overall into scripting/automation/etc, so that’s not to say its not possible if you put more effort into it; again especially because back then you just had one or two good youtube video series and the rest was crack open the books.. and asking questions was pulling teeth, unlike today with AI, etc",

Java will run on desktop and natively on any Android device. Python has frameworks and tools that will also allow you to do it. If it’s a web app like browser base JavaScript can get it going. My advice pick something you’d like to do with plenty of tutorials and find a language that matches it. Stick to it until you have a good grip and you’re able to build a fairly robust app. After you can look into other languages and specify into what you want. It’s not crazy hard to change later once you know what you want to do with the new language. Personal recommendation:If you want to build mobile apps go with Java and Android Studio. It’ll do a lot of the heavy lifting for you and it has a drag and drop GUI builder. If you want to go the longer route and get the basics down start with C. Try CS50x (Harvard’s free course), that’ll bringing you through C fairly well (to start) and cover a bit of html and Python, I think it uses flask towards the end but I can’t remember. I like Python alright but I wouldn’t recommend starting there, you don’t need to define types and it’s an interpreted language so you don’t compile to find errors which is a big lesson in learning early on. Also it is a bit different from how key features work (tuples, indentation, for loops). I’d stick with a more traditional one to start. JavaScript unless you want to go full web-dev I wouldn’t go there either (not really a fan). Again like Python it’s interpreted. It will run on any browser but I’ve only done the bare minimum when I’ve had to use it. Most importantly check back in 2 years when I’ll be advising you that JS is the only way to go, after getting out of bed on the other side or something. But really getting a start on any of them and sticking out the hard parts is the way to go. C/C# for .Net or Java take your pick.",

If you can represent the data in a way that makes sense and start with that, it becomes easier to do the rest. \"Great programmers worry about data, not code.\"An example might be, if you want to make a picture editor. The data you want to manipulate is an image. So you think about how you might want to store the image in memory. Maybe as an x/y grid (a 2d array)?Maybe start there, and get it showing on the screen immediately so you know it's working as expected. Then you can start adding other stuff. Don't try to plan and write it all out at once.. get your data on the screen so it's easy to manipulate, and work from there.This can be applied to most kinds of programs.For me, there is a strong connection between computing and humanities. A computer is probably the most powerful artistic medium ever created. Programming itself is a creative medium. But just as you can't write ideas without first learning an alphabet, you have to learn some basics about manipulating bits to wield the power of programming.

        "body": "Yes it is a lot more important to learn from a good course or book. Something that I see a lot of beginners do is they will want to learn to program and they will jump to a Python course on YouTube and then they're confused as to why they can't code anything after learning the language.Because learning the language isn't actually doing much of anything for you. Syntax isn't difficult, what is difficult is problem solving and that's what programming is at it's core. If you pick up a good book or a good course, that course will not just teach you the technology but how it works and why it works and how to use it. For example, I did CS50 and it's great, it's really good. It doesn't just teach you C and Python and SQL, it teaches you why those tools are useful, how to use them, how to solve problems with them. The course focuses more on what programming is, other than what language are we using this week.I believe that learning how to problem solve and how to write code will teach you so much more than just doing a Python course and moving on. Once you learn the fundamentals of programming and the concepts every other mainstream language will look pretty much the same, of course some of them will have differences big or small but most of the concepts carry over. After learning JavaScript and solving a bunch of problems with it I then noticed that I can easily learn whatever I want now, I had no issues using C++ in college because I already knew the core concepts they were just a bit more low-level.",

Further, like you suggest, there's a very good chance there is no \"ball\" in the implementation and the server is picking whether you win based on chance (if you check the call to the server, it might not even bother saying which cup was clicked).That's not to say that this sort of mistake never happens. There have certainly been failures of this type many, many times before. An example of this sort of failure was in the early 2000s, when the government occasionally redacted PDF files by drawing black boxes over text...but it left the text under the boxes, so when users just deleted the boxes, they could see the text. People goof. But gambling sites are usually careful about this sort of thing. It could be an educational exercise for you to check.",

Maybe start with the C# yellow book that is linked in the *FAQ* in the sidebar.Also, you need to work on your frustration tolerance. If you give up as soon as things get hard and outsource to AI, you will never get anywhere. People learnt programming before AI and even before the internet with its countless resources. They didn't give up. They were stubborn enough to bite through hard things.Forget that AI even exists. Learn the hard way.",

        "body": "Heyyy, listen to me,I’m not here to motivate or demotivate you, but here’s how things worked for me.I’ve been a game developer for a year, and I’ve been programming throughout my bachelor’s. I got my first internship in game development right after my final year. At that time, my skillset in game dev wasn’t very strong , even though I had been learning it on my own for almost a year and had even taken a course at university.Anyway, once I was surrounded by senior developers during my internship (which later turned into a job), my skills started improving rapidly. I’m a passionate person, and having great seniors around me helped a lot. I took their mentorship seriously, never hesitated to ask questions, and treated projects personally. I often worked after hours on related stuff to improve myself.After just a few months, I cleared interview for another good job, not only better in terms of pay, but also because of the senior developers I got to work with. Being around skilled people and working on the same projects as they do gives you a huge jump. I even managed to handle the responsibilities of a senior with 5 years of experience who had resigned.So in your case, I can see that you’re passionate but you just need the right environment. I realized that about myself too: I’m passionate, and I need a place that helps me grow. Even though I received another higher-paying offer, I didn’t leave, because I want to focus on building my skillset in these early years.When you work with brilliant people, you grow much faster , no tutorial or course can give you that. Starting from scratch alone can easily frustrate you because you don’t get that sense of achievement. Seniors usually have strong foundations, so when you learn from them, you learn the right way.",

And then, when you feel comfortable with that - switch to C#Second, do a free course. Not a tutorial, because you will end up in a tutorial hell. I personally started learning by taking Harvard's online course CS50x - there I learnt concepts and basics and afterwards I was able to go on on my own.

I’m currently working remotely in an internship but it’s a challenge, I meet my mentor once or twice a week but it’s only a team’s call here or there. It’s hard to see what’s actually going on and fair it was more frequent towards the end of summer but it’s still not great. Having someone physically beside you where you can see and more freely chat about what’s going on would be a lot better. A lot of the internships advertised around me are hybrid, 2 days in the office and 3 remote. They’re advertised exclusively to college student going to Uni in my city (supporting the local Uni’s). So while there is competition for them it’s a much better chance of securing something. How I got my remote internships:1) I joined the local GDG group (I actually joined the 3 nearest, within a 2 hour drive) and spoke with people nearly any chance I got. Not just about coding but open conversation during intervals or asked what they thought of the talks after. 2) I got lucky and met someone from the same area I’m from, I think it was at a careers event not directly tech focused. He went to school with one of my uncles 20-30 years ago and we had a brief convo about back home. 3) the next time I met him I mentioned it’d be great to just see “What it’s like day to day or the general flow of what devs do? how the online meetings go? What their day is actually like?”. He takes my number and said he’d ask if I could join a meeting with them some time. He’s in management so not directly linked but sat in on some meetings. 4) 2 months mass with no response and out of the blue I get a text asking if I’d like to join an update meeting. 5) from there one of the devs offered to wait on the call and have a chat after. To be honest that’s all I expected to get from it and it was nice just to get that introduction. A week later he offered me some unpaid work just to get a taste of it, I jumped at the opportunity. 6) that was 3 months ago and now they’re on about maybe being able to offer me a paid internship. It wouldn’t be amazing money but roughly equivalent to part time work so I could probably quit my other job and get some real experience. .It’s not easy and I still have another job alongside Uni and the remote work currently. 1) I’m in college 30hr per week. 2) I work 20-30hr per week. 3) and the internship is 16-20hr per weekIt doesn’t give a lot of time off for anything else but ya the experience is invaluable right now. I’d aim for getting directly into a paid hybrid role if at all possible but ya I wouldn’t turn down the Unpaid remote work if it played out that way either. Bit long of a story but hope that helps:grinning_face_with_sweat:",

What will be new to you are the commonly used libraries like NumPy (arrays) and Pandas (data frames). They make sense coming from a data background, but to other devs they might seem oddly and needlessly complicated. If you interface with SQL at all, the advantages and quirks will become readily apparent.For a quick tutorial, you can fly through this in a couple of afternoons and likely know enough about Python that it won't be an issue with the ML: [https://open.cs.uwaterloo.ca/python-from-scratch/](https://open.cs.uwaterloo.ca/python-from-scratch/)This spends a lot of time explaining CS as well, so someone might have a better intro for an experienced programmer.

Even with 3+ years in software, revisiting CS fundamentals isn’t about re-learning the basics, it’s about connecting theory with these more mathematically heavy AI frameworks.

        "body": "This sounds like a situation where a bit of profiling and measurement will help with your system design.My guess is that the time taken to scan a file's header and figure out what codecs it uses is a tiny fraction of the time taken to actually re-encode it. And the time taken to traverse the filesystem and open the file is even tinier. (Profiling will tell you just how tiny.)And as a counterpoint, whenever you go from having a single source of truth (e.g. the filesystem) to multiple separate data stores (the filesystem + a separate database), you increase the number of opportunities for complexity and bugs to creep into your system.For *interactive* use, it might well be desirable to maintain a DB with metadata and indexes, so that you can quickly search for individual files. But for a big batch reprocessing job which is going to be slow anyway, I think it makes sense to just treat what's in the filesystem as authoritative, instead of relying on a DB that might potentially become out of sync if there's a bug. The difference in performance is likely to be small.If the performance does actually matter (e.g. because you want to re-run your reprocessing job frequently) then what I would probably do is just maintain an index of paths/timestamps/checksums which are known to be \"good\" (don't need re-encoding). This allows you to avoid repeatedly scanning files that haven't changed. But the index itself contains no important data. If it gets lost, or stale, or corrupted, it's extremely unlikely to cause any kind of inconsistency or bad behavior; the worst that will happen is redoing unnecessary work.",

I believe that feeling lingered well into the 2000s and then enterprise dev shops wanted to cut costs (we used to pay for things like compilers and IDEs and web/app servers, everything). One way to do that was to run java on linux and run more open source, yes even in the enterprise.the enterprise folks who ran stuff previously on Sun systems and the ones who used to run MS Windows Server systems both were able to run application servers (there used to be soooo many of these app server products) running java on linux.

It's just a very non-linear, low-guarantee path to it.2. From my understanding, this would put you in competition with people with 4-year degrees, and even the fresh grads here are facing friction.3. The general consensus I've noticed is that pre-2020, these were good, but they aren't as competitive anymore. While yes, people make it work, the tech workforce is still largely made up of 4-year degree holders.4. Again pre 2020, this was more viable. I would make the caveat that with this you can make your own luck freelancing on sites like Upwork. If you're persistent and lucky, this could pan out in the long term.In short, optics aren't great atm for entry.

I mean, do whatever you want, I'm not trying to gatekeep, but if I were back in my 20s contemplating this career with the way things currently are, I would absolutely not pursue it. There are no perks left in this industry like how it was a decade ago. Job security is bad. Over saturated, hyper competitive. Corporatism killed it, AI killed it even further. Everyone is just making slop, everything is a scam.Something like law is much more in demand I believe, and you can pursue all different kinds of sub-career paths in law, you can work for a corporation, the government, yourself a small firm. There is always gonna be demand. You can do actual meaningful work. I'm sure it's very difficult, more difficult than software in a way, but much more fulfilling if you do it right. Just my 2c.",

But I don't know any simple language that enforces side-effect free functions, immutability and referential integrity.React does not and cannot enforce this, because JS doesn't enforce this. But react still requires these constraints to be satisfied in order to function properly, the way it was designed.Way too many people jump into react, they discover useEffect on their first day, and then they write absolute atrocities because they think of it in procedural style, which is what useEffect allows them to do. And then react gets a bad rep.",

If it is a relatively simple CRUD application then it does not need microservices. If it has distinct independent parts that function separately from each other and serve a specific purpose, then you can consider building microservices. You can go first with multimodal monolith and see how it works out. If one of the modules becomes too big and starts having way too many that-module-specific-only functionalities, then you can take that module out from the monolith into a separate microservice.You can have your monolith running from inside a Docker container and be maintained by Kubernetes. You do not need multiple microservices for that. MQs or Kafka are needed when you are having separate microservices/monoliths. Although, by an idea, you can set up these also between your modules within one monolith.gRPC is not always needed. It is much less needed than the other things you mentioned. You are more likely to use REST and then SOAP (with older systems).In terms of what you should learn, then pick all but gRPC. And use MQ only when you need it. You can have your senior project running as a monolith inside a Docker container and be managed by Kubernetes and you'll do fine.There is a good likelihood that you will be using Docker. It is a must to have. Kubernetes is also a good pick because even with older systems these can be migrated over to Kubernetes when the client is willing to put money in it. With multiple microservices/monoliths and/or multimodal monolith, you are also likely to encounter either some of the MQ tools or Kafka. But as I said, use it in your project when it makes sense to use it. Do not just drop any and all kinds of technologies into your project. It will be an unnecessary technical bloat. Your client will not pay you for stuff that serves no actual purpose (sometimes he is not willing to pay even for meaningful things/upgrades).",

It's a valid criticism. I don't understand how you can say that it's a valid criticism, and still think they didn't know what they were talking about.> Flash had a lot of vulnerabilities because it gave freedom to the software engineer. Freedom which could be abused.The point of something like Flash is to run code from external third-party sources, which are by definition potentially untrustworthy. Abuse prevention is part of the bare minimum requirements.If I go to a website, and a plugin automatically loads some content, and the plugin gives too much \"freedom\" to **some other developer's** code to do what it wants with **my** computer, then the plugin is not fit for purpose.Modern browsers like Chrome and Firefox have put a lot of work into sandboxing HTML/JS code so that it can run *safely* even if the code is untrustworthy. Modern HTML-based webapps give just as much \"freedom\" to developers to make actual content as Flash did -- the existence of [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) is proof of this. But that freedom is kept safely within a high-quality sandbox.The difference is in the implementation, not the overall architecture. Macromedia/Adobe *could* have put as much careful work into sandboxing as the browser developers did. And then they would have had an equally high-quality, secure system. But they didn't, and that's why their product sucked.",

Doesn't matter whether I'm installing cable from the telephone pole, cleaning toilets, coding scheduling apps for sports venues.I still love coding flash/animate/air though. Been exclusively in C# now for 4 or 5 years. My impression is that Adobe did a friggin amazing job of the rework from AS2 to AS3, but that was another nail in the coffin, because all the old AS2 programs could not be converted. I coded some things to convert from AS2 to AS3 and it was a nightmare.(C# seems to suffer from the problem AS2 had where there was not enough uniformity with web service calls and event handler delegates.)Adobe Flash through AIR did work on the iPad as an app, so it did have its little security sandbox there. It had terrible performance on the iPad 1, but it was totally fixed on the iPad 2. I made many apps with it including a 10 point touch app that was on a floor to ceiling monitor where multiple people could interact with it. A heart rate monitor app in a fitness studio with time synced looping video on 16+ iPads displaying the composite heart rates on a 70\" screen all timed with music programs that the owners made on the server.I made about $100,000 from that job. So, not good at man negotiating. I'm a trans woman and my masculine behaving first wife was the only female in the 18 piece Memphis Jazz Orchestra. She would sit on my left playing bass trombone and the amazing leader trombonist on my right. We made $25-$50 a night playing on Beale St.That scheduling app was about a $100,000 thing too. Yes, security would have been an ongoing thing with it. That StripeJS implementation seems like it changes every 5 months and my career was certainly going in a direction where I wouldn't be around forever to maintain it. My doctors tend to retire too.Also coded a CNC machine. Arduino, stepper motors, pump switch, scale. Used a wireless Adobe AIR tablet to calibrate and control it. Made less than $20,000 on that gig.Also a js audio podcast recorder/editor for less than $10,000. I could never find anyone to handle the negotiating end of it. What is the trade? Where is work in the world headed? Do we need more hydro electric more than new software?Have you called your electric provider and asked them how the grid would handle increasing backflow from solar panels? I did back in like 2014.Q: Can you cook a steak with a solar panel without the grid, a battery or a flux capacitor?",

The problem was I couldn't get any more gigs using it. And then, just like with Apple, I got frustrated with all the subscription fees I was paying for a software that I considered to be end state mature software. Since I couldn't make money with it anymore, it became a hobby, so I became interested in actually coding a clone of Flash itself. It's certainly too much work for one person to do, but I enjoy it as a hobby activity. It keeps my mind creative and in the software engineering mindset.So my C# WinForms projects are a blog tool with a PHP to HTML compiler and image resizing features, a picture viewing and snipping app, a camera app and a hard disc music recording app. I also have a web scraper tool I made a year ago.I had started the flash clone project a year and a half ago before I sold my house and lost the computer and code. It had an MDI (multiple document interface) like web browsers or Photoshop. Now my picture viewing tool has a paste into new app instance option and a paste in place option. There is a bug in the drag after paste in place right now and I'll get around to that in a few months.Oh yeah, that clone had an action history that I coded for an unlimited undo and redo feature. First time I coded such a thing and it was working great! I used a List object and model to save the data and accessed it with LINQ. Then saved it to a file using Newtonsoft. I did some fancy C# Reflection work professionally at my last job. Multithreading too.I made a tweener in Objective C in 2011 that was multithreaded. Remember @synchronized?",

So I built a script with Bash that handles the archive discovery, the decompression of said archives, the compression of every image in the archives by calling command line tools like ImageMagick, and the final recompression into the final, smaller archives.It’s nothing crazy. But it gave me a reason to care about what I was learning. I could see the immediate use, and it helped me internalize the various methods I employed to build the script.",

For those not familiar with shell scripting, this course provides an overview of common Linux Shell Commands and shell scripting basics.It sounds like it will cover the basics, but it will also go deep into using Bash as a full-fledged programming language, which is probably overkill for what you need. And, after you finish it, you will probably still be left confused about some of the Python- or application-specific commands for running different repositories, which are probably not built-in Linux commands.If you'd like to focus on the problem that you mentioned, I'd recommend simply Googling the specific commands that you're confused with, and spending a few minutes learning about each of them. I imagine that terminal commands will never become your main focus in programming, and so this way, you'll simply learn about the ones that you need.However, if diving deep into terminal commands and Bash scripting is still something that you're interested in, the course definitely does seem helpful, so definitely do go ahead and take it if you're interested.",

Then came the mouse.On a modern computer, you can open virtual terminals. You can type in them, use the mouse to select text in them, but it’s basically a text thing.Inside the terminal, you are usually discussing with a shell. That is a program that takes your input and acts on it. The form you give to that input, the language, is characteristic of the shell.On Windows, the shell today is PowerShell. You get a terminal with that by clicking on the >_ icon somewhere. You can write scripts to be executed with PowerShell, so that you can use its power without having to type everything repeatedly.On Linux, there are a number of different shells, but most resemble the original “sh”, and “bash” is indeed one of the best known. As with PowerShell, you can write scripts, and learning to do so is quite worth the effort if you are going to study CS.You can certainly also use bash on Windows, but I think you have to install it.I hope this helped to clear up the basics.",

I've been trying to figure out how to get people into using the shell since it can go faster than booting up a graphical environment on an emulated PC. I think it'll just be a matter of preference though, people will use the easy GUI until there's something that can't be done and requires a terminal command.Maybe trying to ease people in with a TUI might be a good in the middle approach. So your question back at you, how do I teach people to use the shell XD let me know if you find a good way that works for you.Cross scripting for bash is a thing thanks to aliasing, so you can create a definition at the top of the script like delete=rm and then check if you're a Linux or Windows machine and set it correctly, to be rm or del respectivlyI'm still working on writing a good script myself, but looking at you suck at programming it seems like I've got a lot to learn about bash scripting.",

        "body": "The One Definition Rule says there can only be one definition of a function or method. `inline` grants you an ODR exception. C++ also recognizes \"normal\" functions and \"inline\" functions.Beyond that - `inline` doesn't actually mean much. It's SUPPOSED TO hint the compiler that call elision is preferred (don't generate a function call, just instead integrate the inline function body directly into the point of the call), but the compiler absolutely does not have to honor that. Hell, even non-standard compiler extensions like `__forceinline` STILL won't guarantee call elision, simply because it's not always possible.In practice, the compiler internally maintains a list of the two different function types, and when using heuristics to determine if a call should be elided, it will pick either a more conservative or more ambitious value. These values are always adjustable as a compiler parameter, so you could just set both of them the same, so that EVERYTHING is elided just as aggressively as everything else.Yes, this implies that even normal functions ARE candidates for call elision, `inline` doesn't grant that like a special power.I should also point out that a shitload of function types are all implicitly inlined, so an `inline` decorator is strictly redundant. Template functions and methods, for example.So why do you want an ODR exception? Because C and thus C++ do not have whole-program compilation. Every Translation Unit is an island, wholly isolated from all others. If you want the COMPILER to elide a function, then the COMPILER needs the function definition visible IN THAT TU, in order to decide whether to elide it or not, and also just to HAVE the statements that it is eliding there and then at compile time.In order to get the function definition into every TU, you need an ODR exception.And suddenly templates make a hell of a lot of sense, because when you `std::vector`, or whatever, you implicitly instantiate that template in every TU as a concrete type - it's compiled into object code into every object file - how else could you do that without an ODR exception? (Hint: there are ways - advanced programming techniques that also cut down compile times.)---So normal functions are considered for call elision, too, and you can fuck with the heuristics without fucking with the source code.Also - since C++ doesn't have whole-program compilation, that means we don't get TYPICAL Whole Program Optimization. But we DO get A version of WPO, and it's called Link-Time Optimization. It's strictly inferior. What the compiler does is it decides to bundle the compiler flags and source code in the object file. When the linker comes across these bundles, it invokes the compiler. With the linker's perspective, the compiler can decide whether to elide a call or not.So now you don't even NEED an ODR exception to get the benefit of call elision, even across TUs.But I can do you one better: unity builds. Basically, you configure your build system so that ALL your source files are included into ONE source file, thus making a SINGLE TU. This has the effect of putting all the source code in the same scope at once. The compiler can do a much better job at compilation, heuristics, dead code elimination, and reduction than you can get with a link step. The machine code and object code is superior to an incremental build with LTO, and less error prone. Unity builds are preferred for smaller projects ~20k LOC or less, and that number grows with faster hardware, and they're preferred for release builds, since you're always going to build a release from scratch - no cached object files. Incremental builds are ONLY useful for dev cycles on large code bases.So this basically renders `inline` useless. For every reason you would want it, there are always better ways to leverage first. Always configure a unity build - and in 30 years I've never seen a reason not to. Do prefer to fine-tune the compiler from the configuration, not the source code - what is good for one compiler is bad for another. Let the optimizer do its job and don't assume you're smarter. If the optimizer can't figure it out, your code is more likely bad than the optimizer is dumb. Don't be hinting the compiler from the source code. YOU don't know WHAT compiler I'm using, so get outta here with that shit.Oh, and we have profiler driven builds, where performance is measured from a test build and the heuristics is catered per function. At that point `inline` heuristics are irrelevant.So the only thing we can guarantee about `inline`, the only thing we know it's good for, is an ODR exception, and so you have to ask yourself why do you want that? What technical problem are you solving for by turning off safety, that's better than being protected? So far, I've never seen a use case.If you see `inline` in source code, you've got some developers with some dogmatic beliefs, because indeed, there was a time - in the 80s and 90s from which I hail from, that compilers and optimizers were indeed FUCKING TERRIBLE, and YOU WERE smarter than the algorithms. But that's just not the case anymore. Even new developers come up incorporating what they're being told without EVER critically thinking about it or reading about it or looking into it whatsoever.And yet people are attracted to C++ because they \"really care about performance\" but cannot accept that this belief in particular is dated and wrong. Yeah, dogma won't get you there.",

Reading other peoples code can also be a huge help if you're able to vet the quality of the code you're reviewing to make sure you're not picking up bad habits - e.g., well maintained open source projects with multiple committers is more likely to be a good example than small pet projects by a single individual, IMO. If you're stuggling with concepts, or need more guidance, many consider the [University of Helsinki's online course](https://programming-24.mooc.fi) to be the best online python course available.",

        "body": "You can freelance jobs in many languages, one is not better or easier than another. It's mostly about what kind of job you want.In general:* Python -> Data Science, AI application, Web Backend, Automation* C#/Java -> Desktop and mobile dev, game dev, Web Backend* JavaScript -> WebFrontend, Mobile Frontend (Technically Web Backend, but everytime I see that, it's a mess, so... I suggest you don't)* C++ -> low level stuff* PHP -> Web BackendThere are a lot of other languages, but in my experience, those are pretty common examples. So yeah, Python is a good choice, if you are interested in one of it's applications.Video game modding is heavily dependent on the game. You can probably, technically, mod any game you want in C... but that's beside the point. Most games have a modding API, either officially, or inofficially. Most often, those APIs are meant to be used in the same language as the game was written and/or scripted in. C++ is the most common, as most major enginges are written in C++ under the hood. C# works for Unity modding, iirc, and some smaller game engines use lua or GdScript (Godot specifically).So, in both cases, freelancing and modding:It's not about one language being better than all others. That's just not how it works. That's like saying \"The saw is the best tool ever!\" and then attempting to drive a nail into wood using it. If you want to do a job, there are tools that are better suited for that specific job. But, as I said above: If you really want to, you can probbaly mod any game using C (after copious and unnecessary amounts of reverse engineering), just as you COULD use C for Data Science, Web Frontends (WASM), App Development, Automation, etc. It's just not the most ergonomic tool to use, and that's understating it.EDIT: Also, don't fall into the wrong assumption most people have, that programming languages are hard to learn. They are in fact, not. If I (or any developer with only a little experience) want to learn a new language today, it will literally take me a weekend. They all pretty much work the same, and once you understand all key concepts, you can switch langauges as you please. Sure, the tooling will be unfamiliar, and some conventions will be too, and you will take a little longer to get into a groove, and the first few weeks your code quality might suffer a little, but it's really not hard. The reasons most people assume it's hard (I think), is because they think it will be like learning their first programming language(s). When in reality, the first langueage(s) you are learning are not hard, because languages are inherently hard to learn; It's because you are learning to program. And programming is hard. It's problem solving, a lot of theory and background knowledge. You can spend multiple lifetimes learning non stop, and still not know everything there is to know.",

With programming its a bit differnt very few employers will be impressed with raw code, most people doing the actual hiring are human resources not tech usually so having something that showcases your projects actually working like a website with pages displaying a sort of tech demo of some project you are proud of, and it can be nice to also have your resume on there (although you might want to limit your contact info on the website resume), as well as a bit about you. Things that work good for your portfolio website is you want to focus on well designed landing page, you want it easily navigable to different parts of your website, you want things to be snappy, and for projects links to source code and maybe explanations of things will be a good idea. You can think of the website itself as a project, and its typically something you host on your own, either self hosted or on some web hosting platform.",

But if you look at the above list and want to emphasize that 1, 2, and 3 are discrete acceptable values and everything else is a reject, then a switch-case might be a good alternative to express this idea \"in code\": switch(X) { case 1: case 2: case 3: // TODO: Add acceptance code here. break; default: // TODO: Add rejection code here. break; }However, some programmers, especially new ones, find the switch-case difficult for various reasons (usually due to the \"fall through\" rule), but once you get used to them they are pretty handy.",

I also have terminal ADHD.I firmly believe that almost anyone, including those of us with ADHD, can learn almost anything with the right resources and learning strategies. Those resources aren't guaranteed to be available to you, and you aren't guaranteed to find the right learning strategy if you go looking, but there is a very good chance that you are capable of this.Random notes in no particular order from what you've said:* You're \"supposed\" to learn TypeScript, Rust, JavaScript, Python, React? Why? It is far more valuable to be a good dev in one tech stack than a novice in 10. I strongly suggest picking one set of technologies that you feel suits your purposes and sticking with that. Jumping languages and frameworks every 5 seconds is exhausting and doesn't really teach you anything useful in my experience. It's also much easier for a good Python dev to become a good C# dev than it is for a polyglot novice to become good at any language, IMO.* Find a practice/learning style which suits you so that the endless learning doesn't become too much of a chore. For me, implementation is everything. I don't often \"get\" things unless I practice them myself, so if for example I'm learning some new data structure I'll usually hand-code an implementation of it rather than importing someone else's and prove to myself first that it works as I expect, and second that I've gathered enough information to create it. I also use this with programming for other things - my mind is a sieve when it comes to calculus, for example, but writing programs that *do* calculus really helps me crystalise the knowledge.* Respect the ADHD. A lot of people aren't going to get it and will give you advice that amounts to \"just keep trying\". Ignore them. I strongly believe that banging your head against a wall or burning yourself out trying to force your mind to act neurotypical is a net negative for learning. If you find yourself struggling for more than, say, 15 minutes on a problem you're quite possibly reinforcing the struggle rather than the progress. Learn when to be gentle with yourself, when to give up and look up the answers. There is such thing as trying too hard.* Drink water, sleep, exercise, socialise, rest and relax! Too many junior devs treat their health like shit and then are surprised when they feel like shit. Your concentration and working memory are already compromised by a neurological condition - don't make it worse.I think I've rambled long enough - please feel free to ask any questions you might have.",

Syntax is just the tool we use to bring our solutions to life.So, you want to build a workout routine app? Perfect. What’s the big problem here? It’s something like, “Creating a program that allows you to track your workouts and even generates workouts for you.”But that sounds pretty overwhelming. Where do you even start?That’s where breaking things down comes in!!!!1. Creating the ProgramAlright, now we’re getting somewhere. Fire up your IDE and create a new project folder. Maybe call it WorkoutSmart, or whatever the heck makes you happy.2. Tracking WorkoutsOkay, so how do we track workouts? Are we taking user input? Sure thing! Let’s build a simple flow.User flow example:1. The user types a workout into the input field (for example, “Push-ups”) and clicks Submit.:down_arrow:2. The workout is added to the program, either in the background for now or visually on the user interface.:down_arrow:3. Add buttons for Sets and Reps, each with an increment counter.Nice! Step two is coming together well. Push your progress to GitHub and call it a night. :ZZZ:3. Keeping Workouts on RefreshThe next day, you might notice something. When you refresh the page, all the workouts disappear. :frowning_face:Bingo. That’s your next problem to solve.Now it’s time to make the data persistent.You might start Googling something like “how to keep data after page refresh JavaScript” and build from there.As you gain more experience, things start to click. You’ll begin to recognize patterns and might even plan out an entire project in Notion or on paper before writing any code. The plan will change as you go, but it gives you a solid blueprint to follow.I hope that all made sense.Honestly, I think this approach is a beautiful metaphor for life itself. When things feel overwhelming or anxiety creeps in, break your problems into small, manageable pieces, and calmly tackle each one.Happy coding!",

Pick a Web framework that you are most comfortable with. There are many to choose from and no one option is the best option. Just pick one that you are most comfortable with.3. Using that web framework, write the most basic application, one that just loads the home page with the text \"My first web app\".4. Get that most simple app working.5. Now go to your to do list and pick one of the items from that list. Try to implement that feature. If you get that feature working, cross it off the list, otherwise just move to the next item in the list.6. Rinse and repeat until you've managed to cross off all the items from your list.Using YouTube or any resource found on the internet is fine and will not be cheating. Just don't be tempted to turn to something like ChatGPT or any other AI tool, as that would be cheating and you'll end up learning nothing.Also expect things to go slowly at first, but what you should find, the more you try the better you'll get at solving problems and faster things will go.Don't get discouraged when thing get tough as this is to be expected. When you do run into problems try to use google or YouTube to solve those problems. Problem solving is a skill that is needs to be learned, so this practice will make you a better programmer.",

So if you have two instances of the class, they can have different values in their nonstatic fields. The nonstatic methods on each instance will interact with the nonstatic fields of that instance.To stretch a sometimes-useful example: `Car::Drive()` doesn't really make much sense on its own. There are many cars; which car is being driven? `myCar.Drive()` makes more sense. It's clear that the car being driven is `myCar`, and I'm definitely not driving `yourCar`.You might say \"but in my particular example, it doesn't make sense to have multiple instances of the class\". In that case, perhaps you don't need a class, or perhaps your class should declare everything as `static`, or perhaps you want a class that acts as a singleton and prevents users from instantiating more than one instance.",

        "body": "> why do we have to create an object in main to reach classes?A class definition only defines a type. Let's look at an example: class weight: std::tuple { static bool valid(const int &value) { return value >= 0; } static int validate(const int &value) { if(!valid(value)) { throw std::invalid_argument{\"value cannot be negative\"}; } return value; } friend std::ostream &operator <<(std::ostream &os, const weight &w) { return os (w); } friend class weight_extractor; public: weight() = delete; explicit weight(const int &i): std::tuple{validate(i)} {} weight(const weight &) noexcept = default; weight(weight &&) noexcept = default; weight &operator =(const weight &) noexcept = default; weight &operator =(weight &&) noexcept = default; auto operator (const weight &) const noexcept = default; weight &operator +=(const weight &w) noexcept { std::get(*this) += std::get(w); return *this; } weight &operator *=(const int &i) { std::get(*this) *= validate(i); return *this; } explicit operator int() const noexcept { return std::get(*this); } explicit operator const int &() const noexcept { return std::get(*this); } }; static_assert(sizeof(weight) == sizeof(int)); static_assert(alignof(weight) == alignof(int));This only tells us what a `weight` IS. It gives us the semantics of a `weight`. The definition of a `weight` is not itself an instance of any one particular `weight`. class weight_extractor: std::variant { friend std::istream &operator >>(std::istream &is, weight_extractor &we) { if(is.tie()) { *is.tie() << \"Enter a weight: \"; } if(int v; is >> v) { try { we = weight{v}; } catch(const std::invalid_argument &e) { is.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit); if(is.exceptions() | std::ios_base::failbit) { throw; } } } return is; } friend std::istream_iterator; weight_extractor() noexcept = default; public: weight_extractor(const weight &) = delete; weight_extractor(weight &&) = delete; weight_extractor &operator =(const weight &) = delete; weight_extractor &operator =(weight &&) = delete; operator weight() const { return std::get(*this); } }; static_assert(sizeof(weight_extractor) == sizeof(weight)); static_assert(alignof(weight_extractor) == alignof(weight));The semantics of a `weight` describes all that it can do - you can add weights, you can multiply scalars, you can insert weights into a stream. But extracting weights directly from a stream is problematic; if extraction fails, you can have an invalid weight. This extractor helper class cannot be instantiated by you directly - only the `std::istream_iterator` has access to the only valid - default, ctor.The `weight_extractor` is an example of \"encapsulation\", aka \"complexity hiding\" - we hide the complexity of extracting and validating a `weight` behind a simple type. \"Data hiding\" is a different idiom not demonstrated here - that the class members are `private` is NOT data hiding. weight operator +(weight l, const weight &r) noexcept { return l += r; } int main() { weight my_fat_ass(190);See? Now we're talking about a specific `weight`, `my_fat_ass`, as opposed to anyone else's... Let's get your fat ass into the picture here, too. if(std::input_iterator iter{std::cin}, end{}; iter != end) { weight your_fat_ass = *iter;You will likely never have to use a raw stream iterator in your life. Instead, the standard library has views, like `std::views::istream`, which itself is implemented in terms of stream iterators. You can `std::views::take` 1 or you can use `std::views::single` to get just one value. auto a_whole_lotta_ass = my_fat_ass + your_fat_ass; std::cout << a_whole_lotta_ass << \"lbs.\\n\"; } return std::cin && std::cout << std::flush ? EXIT_SUCCESS : EXIT_FAILURE; }In C++, we don't use primitive types directly - they are there so we can describe our own types and their semantics. We make types and behaviors and implement algorithms to create a lexicon that describes our problem domain, and then we describe our solution in terms of that. An `int` is an `int`, but a `weight` is not a `height`.So to address your question directly - you need to distinguish between your phone book vs. my phone book vs. any other phone book. If the whole program is to have just one phone book, you'd make it `static`, but often that is a very poor design decision.",

A general answer would be that there is no requirement that a C++ program contains any objects whatsoever, if you don't want it to. It's a multi-paradigm language. If you're using C++ in an object oriented way, the memory for those objects will need to be allocated somewhere. There are different storage durations (e.g. static, dynamic, automatic) which define how long the memory lives (e.g. entire program, custom lifetime, life of stack frame, respectively). You pick the one that's most appropriate for your object(s) when you create them.",

In my case, that was Java, Servlets, Databases/JDBC, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

That might initially look like taking on more backend tickets as a full stack developer but it could also mean focusing solely as a backend developer if you're on a larger team that segments work that way.If you decide to become a backend engineer, it's unlikely that you'll forget everything you knew about frontend development.

If you specialize in things like COBOL, JCL, IMS etc., you will have a better chance at a job than other developers at the moment (IMO).That said, it's not exactly exciting work. COBOL was designed back in the '50s, before we had a good handle on compiler and language design. It has a *lot* of quirks that can drive developers nuts. All variables are global, there is no dynamic memory management, it's incredibly verbose, and you can forget about OO. And that's quite aside from the pure insanity that is JCL.So, yes - it's still relevant, but you probably don't want to get pigeonholed as a mainframe developer.",

Sounds like there's a few but not many.Yes there's probably jobs out there for it but programming is one of those fields where it's hard to get any jobs without experience (and you can't get experience without a job) ... From what I remember of Cobol (and it's very little), it was very procedural/function based , nothing at all like the object oriented programming languages of today.Sure it's possible some things have been extended to bring it into the 2000s but it would still likely limit other programming opportunities ...",

By contrast, my grandmother *was* there when they were writing this stuff, which is why she was consulting with large government migrations all the way up through her 80s.If you're interested in these kinds of mainframe applications, you are much better off learning Java or C# and being on the teams that are slowly, *slowly* gathering the requirements and doing the study required to migrate off of those COBOL programs.",

I have to deal with COBOL currently in my job from the sysadmin end.Good god...it's awful and has like many have said here. Many quirks that you simply have to just \"remember\" are a thing. In my case, no two COBOL programs perform consistently with each other. For example, we have 2 programs at work that take on similar data, instead of just one program that does it all. Oh and if you make a mistake in one, you have to start again but in another you can go back with shift + tab.No one can figure out why this behaviour is a thing, mainly coz the guy who originally wrote it...died. Additionally, to get output from some of the programs we have to use export TERM=vt100 to emulate a DEC VT100. At least that is what Google's AI overview tells me...I've not been able to confirm a source. But at work we call it 1970 mode...considering that is around the age of the programs and the existence of vt100.And yeah, like others have said. It's hard to figure out what bits are \"we didn't know any better, here's a better option\". And load bearing shit that...no one can figure out or is deemed part of the too hard basket.We are in the process of trying to convert it to C#...it's not going well. Good luck!",

So it's important to test out the waters by actually doing the thing. You might need to try a few different things before you find one that really clicks, but that's okay, that's partly what university is for!You should also look more into what the actual careers would entail. For example, game dev is notoriously competitive and often has a high workload for less pay than other areas. But if you're really passionate about it, that tradeoff can be worthwhile.",

        "body": "Edit: I want to be clear, a few of the best students I've ever had I've had in the last 5 years. People who will basically be revered legendary developers at some company someday. This post is not saying \"all young kids suck\", but rather explaining how so many people completely unable to do any CS work are getting degrees. They aren't slipping through the cracks, admins chiseled out a crack and swept them towards it.By the way, those great students? To a T, all of them were eager and hard working. Not all of them were obvious geniuses - they just worked really hard on a lot of things because of the love of the craft.---College CS professor here.In the last 10 years, we've seen an absurd increase in the amount of pressure put on us to just pass students by admins chasing retention and graduation statistics. I had a student who literally never showed up to either of my two classes he enrolled in a semester, never turned in a single assignment.So I failed him. So he filed a civil rights complaint. I then had to spend a total of roughly 60 hours defending myself from this, having meetings, collecting every email I ever had with the student and their advisors (plural), recalling dates of the two conversations we had, and rebutting outright laughably obvious lies like the student claiming that I locked them in my office and said they weren't allowed to leave until they did their work (the student didn't even know where my office was) - work that was never completed and he couldn't produce.More than a few professors, would I relay these stories, tell me , \"just don't fight these battles, give them what they want\". Which is even more frustrating because it means when those professor students get into my class, they can't write a for loop by themselves in an advanced software design class.Also, (noting I'm teaching faculty and not research faculty), teaching evaluation is almost entirely boiled down to student evaluations and student evaluations are negatively correlated with the difficulty of the final exam. And let me tell you, they put no effort into this analysis. They just look at in a 30 question survey, the average of one question. And my 700 person undergraduate class is treated as apples to apples to a 12-person grad level research team course. They only look at above average or below average, nothing else. So, your incentivized to make the class as easy as possible so the students give you five stars. It is the yelpification of America, and it creates the worst possible incentives. Like, my student evals can average to 4.1 out of 5, But the average for the entire department is 4.3, so therefore I'm a bad teacher. My average being brought down by a very large number of one-star reviews from shock of all shocks people failing the class.So we've created an entire incentive structure where students seek out the easiest classes they can to get the piece of paper that says they're entitled to a job, and faculty are pushed towards making those classes as easy as possible rather than actually teaching, and anyone who bucks that trend will have an admin ride their ass at the end of every semester because their student evaluation score is .02 less than last year, and \" maybe you could try bringing cookies to class\" (serious suggestion made by someone with a six-figure salary)Basically, goodhart's law remains undefeated.",

        "body": "Part of the issue, I believe, is a lack of understanding of shifts in technology. If you’ve been working in technology for long time you’ve been exposed to lots of things, lots of languages, lots of libraries, lots of methodologies, etc. and then you zoom in on one very, admittedly simple thing like basic understandings of JS for someone who has been working in JS or any arbitrary simple thing that isn’t necessarily cross cutting between technology implementations.On the surface that seems simple: why doesn’t this person understand this thing when they’re working in that space? In reality, you’re looking at it from a biased view. You have a huge repository of internal knowledge and experience. Meanwhile on the daily basis, they may be doing their best to understand baseline assumptions across dozens of technologies and implementations they’ve never been exposed to. Things you take for granted likely, maybe they need to deal with managing certificates, or connecting to a remote Linux system, or something else. Everyone’s going to have varied levels of exposure over their education and careers to certain things. There’s a good chance they have a *firehose* of things they’re trying to understand that they’ve never dealt with before.In addition to that, if you’ve been in tech for say 15+ years or longer, software wasn’t a huge space the further you go back. There was a point in time in the 90s and early 00’s where pretty much everyone alive used Apache HTTPD. Fast forward today and there’s all sorts of HTTP server implementations, but during that period of time simply knowing Apaches HTTPd server in and out gave you baseline knowledge almost anywhere you went, which was learned experience, so new problems you had in that work environment could get more focus vs having to understand a layer of some service on-top of understanding the actual unique problem at the workspace (I’m just using this as an example, there are lots of domains where some almost monopolistic technology reigned supreme, and things didn’t shift that often).Today I can think of probably a dozen popular implementations out there people use, sometimes even library based services, SaaS options, so on just for HTTP hosting, all of which with all their own little idiosyncrasies and domain specific knowledge around them. Again this shift is true in many (most?) technology spaces (e.g. databases, etc.). Software variety and knowledge surrounding those popular concrete implementations has exploded.As a result, all sorts of businesses out there are likely to use some unique mixture of “base” (to them) services “the whole world should understand.” Someone experienced these days may even struggle shifting between environments because of variation in tech. You know some things, but there’s some variety of tech you simply have to learn, in addition to doing your actual job, which isn’t accounted for, it’s just assumed you know it. It’s a very common bias in tech I’ve seen.If you’ve also been working a long time you’re picked up a lot of these things and expanded your pool of knowledge. You’ve seen and used several database systems and services, you’ve seen and used several http servers, front end libraries, so on. You had the benefit, to some degree, of watching these things grow in popularity and catching up as they became popular. None the less, it’s not possible to know all these systems anymore due to the growth rate of tech implementations. So even experienced engineers have issues with these now.I see this bias often with people who tend to work in one or two technology spaces and have the luxury of garnering deep understanding of something. You tend to forget that things that come “simple” or should be “basic” to you aren’t inherently as simple or basic to other people. These kids have little to no experience and are jumping in a pool that doesn’t have good discrete skill specialization (software engineers should be broken up into multiple disciplines when you consider the range of knowledge assumptions, in my opinion).So all this is to say, give the kids a break. It’s like they just finished med school and are applying for open medical speciality positions ranging from cardiologist, to neurosurgeon, to dentist, etc. and being judged as if they had “base” specialized knowledge and experience around each profession yet they have to apply to all of them just to attempt to get employed and hope for the best. It’s especially true in today’s market where you cast a wide net (they’re applying to anything and everything, they need to eat). Thankfully medicine isn’t like that or your dentist may be like “oh I usually do hearts but let’s get this root canal underway, should be similar, veins n such!” Maybe all their past experience was on embedded systems work and all of the sudden, they need money to eat, so they’re now doing their very best to do React frontend work. In software businesses do this in an attempt to reduce labor costs (there’s also practical reasons specializing doesn’t work, your specialty may be dead in a year) and because the impact usually isn’t someone’s life… it’s some not so life threatening feature or service being unavailable, so whatever. But the challenge is somewhat similar (obviously in software we’re more tolerant of failure to some degree).",

Even at my previous company (where I was mid) I really didn’t see a big difference between mid level and Sr, and I’d imagine that’s the case at most places. Mid level is an awkward role tbh because you’re expected to work at Sr level to be promoted and you don’t have a lot of room for mistakes as you’re no longer a Jr. In reality, you get paid less than a Sr to do Sr level work anyway, especially if your company considers Sr the terminal level.YMMV, but I would consider leaving for a comp increase and a title change once you’re at mid level anywhere. If you’re currently mid level, try interviewing for Sr roles, they’re not that different.",

That's how that whole shtick works.Someone like a fashion influencer can just follow the fashion trends. There will *always* be people obsessing over buying fashion, and as a result, there will *always* be companies desperate to sell fashion. That industry doesn't die. It just changes forms.Leading up to the pandemic, and especially during the pandemic, there was a ***huge*** audience that wanted to buy the idea of being a SWE. Make $500k, chill around the office playing ping pong 90% of your time, etc. An easy way to riches.So the audience was there. And the people paying influencers to influence that audience were also there. The US government was desperate for people to major in CS/STEM, the universities were thrilled that everyone and their mother wanted a degree now, the big tech companies wanted more talent to hire, everyone was tyring to cash in.Post-pandemic, when the market crashed.... none of that demand exists any more. The audience has noticed a CS degree isn't quite what was originally sold to them. The government doesn't want to shove more people into a degree with a high unemployment rate, and the big tech companies have an enormous pool of talent to choose from now, and Universities *really* don't want a bunch of people going to their college to end up unemployed and kill their numbers.That *idea* of being a cushy-SWE has dried up. Unlike something like fashion, it's not forever. It had an end. And we hit it.There's simply no more money in being a SWE influencer.",

For mobile tech stack I know they used paid apps to make it harder to check. When an interview was gained they had the “subject matter expert” sit on the interview to feed answers in case an unexpected question arose.It was probably one of the better “mills” but before they dropped the bombshell that all our experience would be made up we had to sign a two year contract stipulating that if we left while under contract we’d owe 20k or 20% of lost profits if on project, whichever was more.Another fun thing was that they had people pretend to be us on screening calls, we only ever talked during actual interviews. All the references were also employees who’d give glowing reviews or pretend to be managers from the companies we never worked for.They billed at 120+ dollars an hour but, talking to the other guys, our pay ranged from 22 to 31 dollars an hour",

For context, I’ve had similar situations with startups where I’m hired for a project, I complete it successfully, and then I’m laid off to “stay lean”. This has happened multiple times, good feedback, good relationships, good work ethic and productivity, it’s just market shifts and the company trying to be strategic. I had to get clear about what I wanted… and that’s stability. I started looking for opportunities in stable, but growing sectors, i stopped taking interviews with small companies or companies known for their leanness or competitive firing practices. I reached out to people at the company to know what type of culture I was signing up for. During the interviews, when they asked me what I was looking for, I told them… a stable place to grow in my skill and to develop a long-term relationship with a company. This may sound sexist, but I looked for companies that had a lot of women and parents on their team and good paternity leave… to me, this is a signal that the company cares about investing in people rather than the bottom line. If they’re willing to hire women (who may be out an extended period after/around pregnancy) or parents (who have stricter schedules and can’t do the 9-9 grind), they believe in investing in people rather than the short term setback of human life being inconvenient. I looked for companies that didn’t do boom/bust hiring waves. How long have jobs been posted? How many jobs are posted? How frequently do they post? Does this company have a history of downsizing? I think the world has definitely changed a ton since Covid. The market doesn’t reflect on you as a person. If this is the issue, the best thing you can do to adapt is be ahead of the trends.",

The strategy I implemented when I was choosing a job this last time around is to NOT go to a company where the product is strictly digital. The reason is bc a company can just decide to pivot or cut a digital product too easily. Therefore I was looking at companies that have a physical product. The other thing to look for is companies that operate in highly regulated industries especially where what you will be doing will help them meet regulations, esp new ones. Businesses that get their revenue from making sure their customers can meet regulations always have work if those regulations change frequently. It's hard bc these types of jobs will not pay as much as tech jobs. They'll be overly boring and frustrating. But think of lost income from being in between jobs. You'll have a lower salary but less gaps so over 5 years, it might even out Also just to be safe....never tell anyone you're looking for another job except if it's a coworker you're close with and you don't want to blindsided them. Always try to appear cheerful and optimistic. Don't be the squeaky wheel either. Sometimes it pays to be a \"yes man\". I don't agree with these things but I've also found some of it out the hard way. Some managers don't care about doing what is best for the company... they'd rather get rid of someone who is trying to \"make a difference \" bc it's too exhausting to deal with them.",

A couple thoughts that may help from what I’ve seen:Need to look at companies that are solving macro problems such as smart mobility, health insurance, public utilities or even large consulting that operate at a large city/state/country scale. The tasks that you excel at are typically handled by “data scientists” in the research or engineering subteams of the broader product team. Most of the time it’s run through a platform like snowflake with some basic trendy algos applied and then call it a day, with little interpretation or understanding of the results.As strange as this sounds you may want to hunt for UX Researcher roles. If you dig into the requirements a lot of what they are asking for there is a lot of overlap and it at least is adjacent to your skill set. One of the hardest things, as this thread has shown, will be articulating your value. Most hiring managers for these roles will have come up through a more vanilla CS background so having a paragraph ready about what the current state of the industry is, why it’s leading teams and products astray and how your deeper understanding makes a difference will be critical. You are a PhD level data scientist who looks at the world through a sociology lens and that brings inherent value.Lastly, the job market actually is pure ass right now. It’s all of us and not just you. If you have any folks from your cohort that went private sector they probably have some good advice on how to modify message for what folks are looking for now. Sadly keywords matter more than concepts in the initial stages.Good luck and you got this. Hope all this helps.",

Meanwhile, HR and marketing keep pushing out polished, inauthentic videos — and then act surprised about “quiet quitting.” Honestly, disengagement feels like a perfectly natural response to such a fake environment.",

First of all, you’re treating H1Bs as a monolith, when in reality, there’s two “tiers.”The bottom tier H1Bs don’t work directly for big tech. They work for WITCH companies, insurance companies, oil companies, etc. They are modern-day indentured servants. In this case, if their employer can’t easily replace them by sponsoring someone else, it would stand to reason their wages would rise, not fall. They already couldn’t get sponsored by other companies. Not how it works for this caste. On the other hand, there are H1B recipients who already worked for Big Tech directly overseas. They get sponsored. They insource their job with them. They were never begging for table scraps. They’ll just self deport and outsource their job with them if they get a $100k paycut. Moreover, people like that create other jobs. We’re outsourcing an entire team’s worth of jobs with them. You’re also ignoring the consensus amongst economists as to why SF became the tech capital of the world. Why it outcompeted the hub around MIT in MA. Because non compete agreements are illegal in CA. You presume competition is a bad thing. Maybe it is for entrenched, enshittifying monopolies in isolation. But even those monopolies had been paying a premium to bring the world’s top talent to the place where they weren’t a big fish in a small pond. If they wanted to entrap their higher tier H1Bs, they would’ve done what all the employers of lower tier H1Bs did: moved them out to some godforsaken shithole in TX or NC, refused to sponsor applications for green cards, paid them below market rate, etc. At some level, even the monopolies realize competition is good.We issue under 100k H1Bs per year. That’s it. And they don’t all go to IT/CS jobs either. India and China have nearly 3 billion people between the two of them. Do the math… We’re only getting the top 0.01% of them, for the most part. There are some serial abusers. The WITCH companies in particular ought to be permanently barred from H1B. But really, the problem with H1B is how abusive it is to the recipients. We should be more like Canada and just give them green cards when they arrive. Unironically. Why do we make it so fucking hard for talented people to come here and pay tens of thousands of dollars a year in taxes, while some barely literate economic migrant from Venezuela just says the magic word “asylum” and they can come stay for years in a free hotel, no questions asked? It’s insane. Both sides of the immigration “debate” in this country are fucking unhinged. Guns and immigration are the only two issues where I’m an obnoxious enlightened centrist, I swear…",

In fact unless you're the rare 1%, you probably should be putting up less PR's as a staff, senior, etc. then you do as a junior.That's because your job becomes more and more about improving the quality and speed of the devs around you. Devs on your team should be moving tickets faster with you there.The reward becomes harder to see and it's not for everyone. You'll have less days logging off feeling great because you finally solved a problem that's blocking a release, but more quarters feeling good because you identified and shipped a solution that enabled 2+ projects to deliver quicker.

If they exist, I don't see them \\- Remote work whenever I want, also the place is 20 minutes by foot, 8 by bus \\- Sometimes the customers are stupid, but when they escalate, my boss actually protects the team. \"You keep working, I will deal with it\" is something I heard a lot when one customer was using our work to do politics in his own company. \\- I convinced HR, my boss and one of the owners to try D&D, we still play every month or so. \\- current customer is amazing. Hands me 2 weeks of time to solve an interesting problem, because they can't decide how to solve it. So I just make a prototype, and then they tell me what they want to keep and what they want to add/change. Saved them multiple weeks of discussion. \\- Unless something happens, I will not leave.. but don't tell them that so I still get a raise. \\- During the Covid downturn, the owners actually put money into the company so they don't have to fire anyone.",

And yep, all of these were job life types. There is no such thing as a company being loyal to you. And before you think, Oh you're just jaded, you must have just worked for shitty companies.

You've gotta choose your battles more wisely and learn how to compromise for your own good. It may not even be a case where you've done anything wrong in particular, but more about what you don't do, and how that makes people feel while communicating with you, ultimately that responsibility falls on you, even though if you're like me you won't think it \"should\", but it does, which is where choosing your battles more wisely comes into play.",

If they're left speechless then there's your answer. This should be mega easy for a senior engineer to do. Get them to use a screen sharing tool to make a quick box diagram of the architecture or components, how they relate. Prod them for all the minor details you can to make sure they aren't just bullshitting and have meaningful knowledge.Like yes, GPT messes up quiz questions about \"how do undefined and null differ in JavaScript\" (who gives a shit?) but it's not going to let them *convincingly* fake knowing about a whole system architecture or what makes it well designed.And frankly if they can use LLMs to properly solve challenging programming tasks then cool, that is itself a skill.

I've had this happen where they throw a 'gotcha' and all of a sudden you're in a different vertical than what you thought they were going to test you on. Big fat waste of time for everyone involved because you can't code something you're unprepared for within less than an hour window, even though you could do it within 3 hours and a bunch of Googling. If you're going to build a Wordle game, tell them before. If they're going to fetch data, manipulate data, filter data, and display a list, tell them beforehand. These are two very different things and you could be super sharp at one and not the other.\\- Live technical test with AI. The key here is to check whether or not they are blindly accepting prompts from AI. Take the time to ask questions around what the code they just accepted is doing and why they think that is a good solution.\\- Timed test (take home/alone). Give them a quite complicated technical test and 3-4 hours to complete it with a submission deadline. They will have to use AI to solve it in that time. Then you follow up in another meeting to discuss the solution and why they did what they did.\\- Take home test. Make it complicated as above. They will use AI but how do they handle state management? How do they fetch data? How do they handle errors? Is it scalable? Etc. You can ask for more if you're permitting AI.You can effectively assess someone's ability even when they use AI. All you need to do is ask a bunch of questions around the solution to see if they know what they're doing. Overall, just remember that you're trying to hire someone, you're not trying to catch someone out who can't remember a certain method on the spot, that won't tell you anything other than your process is an act of gatekeeping. If you judged a fish on it's ability to climb tree's you'd believe it was stupid so ask yourself if you're setting your candidates up for success.",

I've had to give them whiteboard problems....and I really don't think either are very useful. People study for those things in a way that they do not study for their job. And I do the same. But I get it. It's an attempt to be objective. Still, I don't think it's really that useful. LLMs haven't really changed anything, IMHO.Here's what I really did, at least when I was still in the office.Let me talk to them. It can even be over lunch.  We just have a chat about their last project, or any project they want. It can be academic or professional. It can be a Pokemon fan site. I don't care. Preferably something they are passionate about, especially for the earlier career folk.Low stress. I'm not trying to trick you. Explain it to me. Let me ask some questions. There aren't even right or wrong answers. It's about communication, and clarity, and a depth of understanding. Use a napkin and draw something out if it helps. If I'm doing it right, it should be the easiest interview they've ever had. It hardly feels like an interview... I'm just like a slightly overenthusiastic fan of their work. I'm trying to help them demonstrate all the awesome stuff they have done. It's not a sales job. There isn't any benefit in them practicing to prepare. The questions I ask are all over the place and are specific to their project and their previous responses. I'm intentionally asking questions that will let them demonstrate a breadth and depth of knowledge. It's not a prepared slide deck they could practice with. The way to crush this interview is to fully understand the ins and outs of a sufficiently complex codebase, or at least, section of codebase, AND the languages, frameworks and tools they'd use. Practicing for my interview would be exactly like practicing for the job. And our conversation is basically the same as I would have with a coworker who wrote XYZ in our codebase, except, ya know, I'd be less interested and ask fewer questions, but it's really really close. I've personally watched people who aced our technical problem _because they had seen it before_ get hired and be mediocre. I've also lied about a candidate who failed his whiteboard session miserably because they were nervous, hadn't prepped and hardly communicated anything, but during our 'culture fit' spent 45 minutes convincing me that he was an experienced developer who didn't do well under pressure. He was a great hire. I'm old, and he's actually progressed further in his career than I have. Maybe I've just been lucky, but I've never had a decently long chat like this with someone and thought 'Wow, they really know their stuff' and been wrong.",

If they want to reduce pressure, and expectations then change job and accept a reduced salary. This isn't rocket science. If they'd rather earn the high salary whilst they're young then this is the cost of doing so. It's unfortunate but it's the reality of the tech industry.The US also has few protections for employees, like you can all lose your jobs so easily, and when you do you lose your medical care too. Ofcourse that's going to put pressure on people to work when they shouldn't and to never say no.

        "body": "I think a big problem is multi-layered. Ill try to tackle it from a few viewpoints:\\- We are the techies of our social circle especially from a young age. The ones who make it to big tech companies that burnout their employees are usually the ones that did really well in school, exceled at every level and their community assumed theyd make it far. Then when we make it to that big time company that overworks us, we feel like the top o fthe world but then when we see how many hours we have to put in, we dont want to feel like we failed because we have never failed. I worked for microsoft azure, i remember sturggling with not doing enough and the thought that i might get fired. It slowly creates a bad work culture where everybody is doing 60 hour weeks. Checking shit at 10 pm, etc. I remember i underperfromed and my manager said i underperformed because my teammates had nmore work to show than me. It's not like i had no work to show, i just wasnt pulling the 60 hours some people wer epulling and i wasn being compared to that. Quitting almost seems like failing. \\- We join these jobs for the fame and fortune. You can go through this sub. Some people think making 120k in base pay is laughable pay because the big tech companies pay 200k in base, with 100k extra in RSUs and bonuses. But compared to other jobs 120k is amazing. What i realized when i joined MSFT, i was kind of selling my free time for that money. Companies will throw a ton of money in bonus and RSUs to get people to join. They see that number and think \"OMG that's more than ive ever seen\". \\- our jobs are never secure. My GF is in healthcare. Something her and i do is talk about how our respective industries are. She gets shit benefits compeared to me so my job looks amazing. But i tell her that she will forever have a job even if she underperforms, as for me it can go either way. Just because one year is good, the company can have a bad year the following year and now im jobless. Whenever the economy is doing like shit, techies are the first to go due to our high paychecks. \\- remote work has made it easier to be on the clock more. Remote work is convenient but now people can get on their laptop at 10 pm to quickly check up on something. Then they see something brkoe and work on it for an extra hour or two. \\- since we always have gotten ourselves out of trouble we think that this is just a new challenge we can figure out. But the burnout is real. Many of us go to these companies in our mid 20s when we are still just leanring and being really hopeful but then we realize that we are missing out on things that we really want to enjoy. I work for a different company now and one of my co-workers went to vegas for a weekend. He told me he has a friend that works in big tech that could not go because he had to work in the weekend to catch up on work. That he was afraid because many of these comapnies have put in a system that at year's end they will fire the least productive employees.",

The more optional and voluntary my out of work activities are, the less priority they’re allocated mentally, and they tend to just drift away, which maps to what you’re saying about meditation apps. “I’ll meditate later. Right now I have to keep thinking about how to solve that problem I didn’t get to because of all my meetings today….”I know meditation proponents will probably say it’s not good to just move from being busy with one thing to being busy with another, but I think it works better for me. If I try to just meditate etc, I can’t avoid letting my mind drift to the highest priority topic, which is usually work unfortunately. So, your solution should be something that demands the person’s attention while they’re doing it, and provides strong incentives or disincentives to keep them coming back.",

You start to question the meaning of life and the purpose of your life. You want to do something that perhaps matters in some way, and that allows you to feel energized and spend more time with your spouse and/or friends and family.

It’s surprising you haven’t noticed it yet.- A lot of them don’t make nearly as much money as you think. More common than not for junior/mid-level engineers to be classified as low income in the Bay Area. Millions in unvested stock? In 2025?! What nonsense. A lot of them would be lucky to have $100k unvested.- Many of them see the writing on the wall. Maybe they haven’t gotten the PIP yet, but they see the future work drying up, and they know the stack ranking is probably coming for them next. You don’t seriously believe just because they’re extremely talented that they could never be PIPed, right? PIP is not based on merit. If you got hired at one of these companies, your performance isn’t the issue. PIP is based on bean counters setting quotas to meet quarterly cost cutting targets to pump the stock, without triggering the WARN Act.- Some people are genuinely, deeply unhappy at large companies, and enjoy the startup chaos. It’s like asking what’s wrong with ER doctors, when they could’ve been cardiologists instead and worked half as hard for 4x the money.- Some people have something Bezos could never have: enough. I mean, if you played the FANG cards perfectly, you could be a millionaire by the time you’re 30. At that point, how is more money going to make you any happier?- People often make big moves like this because it supports their life in some way.

Sometimes it's because father passed away and they need to take care of their mother who is alone in China, etc.Anyways I replied in one of the comments but just so that it's more easily accessible for other high school/college students to see: why do you think people jump off the bridge and all?Some jobs literally kill you. Mental stress is no laughing matter. Just because you never experienced it does not mean it is not real.At the most stressful time, I literally woke up at night and could not even feel my legs let alone move them for a few minutes. And that happened twice. Shits scary as f. Suddenly the world view changes and you care nothing else at all when your legs might stop functioning. Your body actually breaks down from stress itself. You tell me if money is worth losing your legs.People vastly underestimate how scary extreme mental stress is. I know in one of the startup talks one of the founders stated that he had a period of time in which suddenly his eyes stopped working and he had trouble seeing with his left eye from all the stress. And that's when he stopped everything because anymore stress and he would lose his left eye functionality.So yes. People leave stressful jobs all the time. Stressful jobs can legitimately destroy your body. Just because stress is mental does not make it any different. Human body will legit break down after a longer period of extreme stress.When you are a college student and never actually worked these stressful jobs all you see is numbers. You have this delusional belief it's high pay or basically homeless (wtf?). That's not how reality works.You only live your life once. Don't waste your life chasing solely money. Money is important to function in life but once you are in comfortable means of being able to provide yourself, food/healthcare/shelter/etc, then other things take priority. It's great if your job pays a lot and you enjoy it and all but that's not the case for everyone. For others, the high paying jobs are legitimately destroying their happiness. And ask yourself is this the life journey you want to take? Something you would be proud of doing looking back a decade from now?",

That happened to me, ended up in faang for the money, got piped and fired 3 years later. Even during my time there i didnt think there was much upward mobility.

Like my manager sent me videos of the new system they were trying to integrate and asking me to watch the videos. I should've known how that was going to be the second he sent me 10 hour long videos and i hadnt even started. That job was so stressful that within month 1 it was like they wanted me to be an expert at things already as a mid-level.\\- current job is also big tech but not as big as 2nd company. They have been super chill. Like another commenter said, it took me 2 weeks to even get credentials enoguh to build and they were telling me to slow down that i should take my time before i really got into the code. 6 months in this job has been super chill but challenging tat the same time edit: forgot to add. I this company is already expecting you to be a high level person, especially if you are a mid-level or below (maybe even a senior) then this job sounds like it will be stressful. At most if you were a principal i could see why because you are being paid expecting that you already know things but you dont sound like you are that far in your career.",

I think industry roles often have a similar level of pressure / slog to academia’s “publish or perish.” Plus a lot less job security, and a different type of politics which can be exhausting. The other consideration is that it will probably be easier later on to go from academia to industry if you change your mind, than vice versa, especially if you’re going to a non-research industry role.Context in case it’s helpful or you want to ask questions: I left my phd program a few years in without completing it, for an industry job. I’ve had a good career so far, and it’s been fun and interesting and I’ve learned a lot (mostly interpersonal stuff and management skills), but in retrospect if I’d had a real option to continue the phd and go into academia, I would have. I don’t regret the decision because personal circumstances made it the only reasonable option. But sometimes I’m sad about that.",

My burn-out wasn't from research per se, but from the feeling of doing research alone. Working in an industry AI lab has completely changed my relationship with research. I am in a significantly more collaborative environment. The flavor of research is quite different though, but turns out I find math-circlejerk research (theory-heavy) and simple-at-scale research (experiment-heavy) equally fulfilling. There's a certain joy to pulling out a seemingly random idea in literature that, with the right clever modifications, ends up working well in practice at O(10k) GPU scale.\\- The main downside to industry, imo, is politics/drama. The AI industry is rife with them at the moment. You'll also sometimes look at what your company is releasing product-wise and question whether you're on the right side of history.\\- You definitely lose out on the mentoring/teaching aspect in industry. You will meet the occasional brilliant researcher fresh out of undergrad/masters that you can take under your wing. But it's significantly less frequent than as an actual advisor.\\- Are you sure you'll enjoy being a research professor? Your main job will be to write grants and steer your lab's research agenda, not actually teaching students, unfortunately.",

The burnout is real and it sucks in the moment but you can thank yourself later. And if you haven’t worked in industry/engineering before, you may realize it’s not what you want. Given your background, you will have your choice of role in industry when you graduate. If you want to leave research you absolutely can, but it’s always good to have options",

        "body": "Not a CS PhD, but I did elect to leave academia for an industry SWE position after a year as a postdoc, much to my old advisor's disappointment. Like you, I was burned out and had gotten tired of the publish-or-perish race, even though I'd been told that if I were to stick it out a while longer, I'd have a really great shot at a TT position. There were some other factors for me that you likely do not have to deal with, but I don't regret pivoting to industry. To directly address some of your concerns:* On flexibility: * Yes, most industry jobs will afford you much less flexibility in how you schedule your daily life. However, industry also pays you a fuck ton more money so that you can actually enjoy your time off. I don't know about your finances, but when I was in academia, I basically didn't take regular vacations; my \"vacations\" were always tacked onto conferences and involved me blowing off one day of talks and/or staying a day longer before flying back. * It is also much easier to change jobs in industry, which affords its own flexibility; I know people keep moaning about the industry job market, but it's still way easier to jump jobs than to jump institutions if you happen to hate where you're forced to live. TT positions are not a dime a dozen, and you may need to take what you can get; if you don't like the location, then you're likely gonna be shit out of luck for at least a few years. (This is assuming you don't have to do the postdoc hazing ritual that involves moving every 1-3 years.) * WLB in industry is much better than in academia, and at the end of the work day, you can disengage from the work. Even if you're on-call, you don't really need to waste brainpower on it. In some ways, I feel that while I have lost some flexibility during the weekdays, my time off is much more my own. Being able to spend time guilt-free on my hobbies has improved both my physical mental well-being tremendously, which itself feels like freedom; I honestly didn't even really know how unhappy I was in academia until I left. * At $400k-500k, a high savings rate, a smart investment strategy, you will have the option to retire in less than a decade, which would afford you the maximum flexibility.* On being able to work on what you're interested in: * I won't lie. Some of the work can be **very dull**. However, as you get promoted, you'll hopefully find yourself in a position where you'll be addressing larger business questions and architecting solutions, which I have found to be relatively engaging. I mean, I don't really *care* about the subject deep-down, but I also can't say it's boring. * With a CS PhD and a specialty in a hot field, you can keep applying to jobs and try to pivot to a research-focused industry position, which may be more up your alley.* On teaching and mentoring: * Not gonna lie. I really miss teaching. Mentoring new hires doesn't scratch the same itch. With your degree, you do have the option to pick up an adjuncting gig, and I've considered it, but I'd feel bad about taking a job away from some poor sucker who actually needs it. I've thought about going back into teaching once I have enough FU money. But another option might be teaching or tutoring folks for free at local libraries if you've a mind to do it and don't mind teaching basics.I have many friends and a sibling who have remained in academia in TT or postdoctoral positions. I chat with them regularly. Academia does have its pros, but having spoken with them, I don't think I would've been happy even at a TT position. Happy to speak more, but this post is getting long, so feel free to just DM me if interested.",

Think about it you can be the engineer who gets good reviews from other Jrs. Or the engineer who gets good reviews from Jrs and Srs/Principals. Guess who is getting the promotion if they only have enough for 1 more person\\- Find out the go to people and ask them questions. Your first few months should be figuring otu the right teams to ask questions, maybe you have a mentor who helps you find those people. Once you figure it out, cut the umbilical cord yourself and just go to those teams and ask those questions. Dont go striaght to the mentor anymore so he/she can baby sit you.\\- Take as much shitty tasks as you can. If a principal is working on somethign that sounds cool, ask him for even small tasks about it. Let him know that if there is anything you can do even if it's small and tedious youll do it. You want to dip your toes in everything you can.\\- Make sure you are known by other people on other teams. One of the biggest things managers appreciate is hearing someone's name in another team that has nothing to do with you. because it says you have become a go to person for your own team. If upper management keeps hearing your name from other teams or how they went to you and you helped, that goes a long way. Basically the key is making sure your name is always mentioned when your boss has meetings with his bosses.\\- Be good at getting yourself unstuck from situations. The biggest issue Jrs have is they get stuck and just sit at their desk for 2 days and say nothing. Dont fall in that trap, you get stuck, give yourself an hour to figure it out and if you still dont have it ask even a small question. In stand up, bring it up from the start and expalin it well.\\- If you work on something learn it back and forth. You can become an unoffical SME of your part of the codebase. The larger the section you master the more irreplaceable you become.\\- Make up your own work if you have to. Find something in the code that could use refactoring but nobody had time to do it. Suggest it to your manager like \"hey i saw this in the code and i felt it could use a bit of refactoring, mind if i work on that on the side?\".\\-Dont just get good at coding, get good at leading meetings. This is probably one of the bigger ones. Because JRs tend to be in the background and wait to be told what to do. if you want to move up quickly, start making meetings and presentations to display to your teammates. One advice i got was, if you complete something ask for 10 minutes post-standup to display it to the team. Because if you want to be a senior or principal that's what they will look for.",

It doesn't matter what stack you use, a lot of concepts end up converging at some point.Learn one thing really well (e.g. your team's service) and understand why it is designed that way, start coming up with proposals to improve it operationally, understand how it fits into the scope of the company (how it benefits the business and how other teams consume/use it). Get to the point where you are PoC/owner of one subject area.From there you can be a little bit more senior and start influencing your team's success and at some point you will be able to mentor juniors who are new to the stack.Once you stick your nose in the right places I think FAANG HMs will start to get a sense that you can not only join but excel in that type of environment.",

You can say Big Tech, at least that's definable. Also land of the biggest layoffs.>I also leetcode on the side for an hour a day as a long term plan for FAANG interviews.If you apply to the 5 out of the 495 Fortune 500 companies that want you to know algorithms you'll never code on the job then okay. Else you're wasting your time. In fact, stay in your current job if you don't hate it and don't get 2% raises 2 years in a row. Moving is a risk and not being a job hopper makes you less of a hiring risk.>DSA feels like a skill I’ll need regardless and I want to be able to ace OAs / coding rounds in the future.It is not. I'm mid-level and half my interviews have zero coding. It's talking through business challenges, tech stacks and maybe a design problem I draw on a real or virtual whiteboard. I don't know what \"OA\" is and I didn't know \"DSA\" meant when I got to this sub. I learned all data structures and algorithms I've ever needed from the classroom. My coworkers don't know what FAANG or Blind or Leetcode are. Coding tests are practical.>For those of you who’ve seen juniors rise fast:I saw one junior rise fast because he took smoke breaks with the senior manager. All of a sudden he became our manager. I saw another junior gradually move through the ranks. Stayed at the same employer for over 10 years. She was an average programmer but good at office politics and being well-liked.All you got to be is average at coding. You can be an excellent problem solver which for me comes from work experience. You can be very well liked which is also insurance against layoffs. You can drink the company Kool-Aid and embody stockholder ideals. Like be married to your job. Those are all paths upward. Interviewing skill / soft skills carry you further the higher you go.Problem is, getting paid 20% more to work 50-55 hours a week sucks, on top being responsible for work intake and training of new hires. I had 12-15 hours of meetings a week and my manager had 30. Doesn't include 1:1 mentoring sessions.Oh and promotion track is real. You will be told if you are on it. I was, once, then my manager got transferred and the replacement one didn't really like me.",

Everybody gets burnt out when you just endlessly chase reward but come up short, you're brain learns it's not worth it. It's just reinforcement learning. Also, even when you feel like shit, it really pays to find it in yourself to put the work in, try not to care, and move the ball.

You should understand how the parts fit together though at a high level. Masters is basically a waste of money IMO. Look at what FAANG/unicorn interviews expect and try and learn that stuff, that’s how you’ll get the most money if that’s something you care about. System design is one part and it’s basically just backend design, then there’s Leetcode, and behavioral stuff that every interview has.

Those areas always need people with deep technical skills. If you’re curious about scalability or APIs, you might like cloud backend or DevOps. If you’re interested in lower level work, roles in networking, embedded systems, or high performance computing could be a nice fit.So instead of trying to learn every new framework, focus on one path that builds on your strengths. For example, if you stick to backend, you could start learning about databases, cloud platforms (like AWS or Azure), and maybe some Python or Go to round things out. A Master’s is not required for most roles unless you want to go into research, data science, or academia. Experience and strong project work usually count more than another degree.

So you provide them with optionality.So my professional opinion is that you should focus your learning on what interests you most, and explore various domains. As you know, the field is also evolving extremely quickly, so it's nearly impossible to predict what will be in demand. Better go with your intellectual curiosity ;-)I know that it's a bit frustrating because it's not a clear answer, but this is the common approach I've seen in people with successful careers.I hope it helps!Emmanuel",

Being able to lead the UX charge to create genuine good UX for the public to access services they need, rather than designing and developing flows for \"UX\" where the true end goal is to sell products/services, has been a career shift I never knew I needed.

Something that AI can't easily replicate is our ability to engage and improve culture across teams, promoting automation through pipelines or playbooks or what have you. AI can write the code, the boilerplate or templates, but it's never going to be able to convince or cajole or influence people into actually buying in to better ways of doing things.If you're looking for advice, i'd suggest you learn some Kubernetes if you haven't yet, fuck with some Helm charts, and be able to write some basic Terraform, and then take a look at some SRE listings. I haven't seen a systems engineer opening in forever and ever, but I believe there's going to be stuff for you and I to do for quite a while still. <3!",

Generally rule of thumb is higher paying the job the worse the company culture is. However, my experience in tech and finance is there are a lot of high paying chill jobs out there its just a matter of landing in one. I am a risk quant (kinda like data sciencE) so I straddle the line of both industries.2. Do you have a visa problem, given the current political environment in U.S. it might be hard to get a work visa.3. People will talk about health care and other benefits possibly being better. These people are usually talking out of their ass and have not lived in multiple countries. Generally health care in U.S. is through the employer and most corporate a jobs have reasonably good health insurance and often better many ways in Europe i.e. specialist visits and the like. What America's problem is the the quality of health insurance is entirely a function of where you work and what plans they offer and generally poorer people do not have access to high quality health insurance either due to it beign cross probhibitive and for small businesses they may not offer it (for example a small restauarnt does not have to offer health insurance to their workers if they employ fewer than 50 people). What you will find in America is if you are in teh top 1/3rd you are substantially better off than anywhere in Europe or Canada, and if your in the bottom 1/3rd you are substantially worse off. The middle 1/3rd is ???. Software engineering is one of thsoe occupations where you are generally in the top 10 percent.4. For salaried jobs for mid career professional the normal vaction in software engineering, data science, ML would be something like 4 to 6 weeks of vacation.5. Atlanta is a boring city relative to London or NYC. Just keep that in mind. I've lived there. I also think if your career ambitious you probably will consider somewhere like austin, new york, seattle. I have lived in Atlanta and know the city relatively well. It definitely is somewhere that you will need to drive etc.",

I was an SWE for 5 years before that transition, and with this same company for 3 of those SWE years. I've been responsible for some transformative toolsets. I was positioned well and absorbed a ton of product knowledge (was on a core framework team) before transitioning. I'm also of the opinion devops works best when there's buy-in from multiple angles (if not org-wide in the first place).I'm of the opinion the best DevOps engineers are SWE first and infra/automation second, and I will often introduce myself as an SWE with a passion for DevOps. As a DevOps engineer you build natural buy-in by understanding the stack and making developers lives' easier and velocity faster.My particular company is a dinosaur in tech years (been around since the 70s in some form or another -- 5+ name changes over the decades). We are a tech company, and yet we're relatively unknown. There are people that have been here 30-40 years. There are still moments where it's difficult to break old patterns of monoliths and shared dev environments. Tools like Git and Docker are sometimes difficult to get them to use properly -- while Cloud lives and breathes containers, I introduced them to Dev just 5 years ago. Dev only just moved to git around that same time (from SVN and before that MKS).These days transformation is key. We're seeing the transformation with AI, now anyone can be an SWE or DevOps engineer. Real SWEs are problem solvers and evolve and adapt to the problem to be solved.",

This isn’t 2020 anymore, you most likely won’t land a dev job because you know a bit of react. If you genuinely want to become a dev, do the comp sci WGU degree, get CRACKED at leetcode/system design, have projects under your belt and showcase it to the world. If you genuinely become cracked than nothing can stop you, the issue comes when you think doing the bare minimum will still get you a good dev job. Btw don’t do any of your core credits at ACE credit places like Sophia or study.com, only knock out your generals from there.

Imma guess you also haven’t done much to branch out of strict IC work into people management.Ideally you should’ve been gradually working towards growth, e.g. react isn’t particularly hard to pick up, and hopefully you can also speak coherently about idempotency or optimistic updates or JWT or db normalization or whatever. And surely you would have had at least some technical mentoring opportunities by now. Or maybe you do have all of that under your belt, but your resume just doesn’t reflect it",

So your equity in the first year is 100k, second year is 125k, third year is $150k and forth year is $175k. But in the fifth year, your initial grant is gone, so your annual equity drops back down to $100k (your annual refresher). This is what is referred to as the pay cliff.

I got my BSCS from WGU a couple years ago and it was incredibly nice to be able to use my existing knowledge and skillset to get through a fully accredited program in just under a year, while still being vastly cheaper than other options. With your background, I’d assume you could do the same. While I haven’t personally done the MBA program, I’ve also heard positive things about it from people who are motivated to work hard and get it done quickly. Happy to answer any other questions about my experience too if you want to DM me.",

However, I can say that today, every Salesforce developer I know has no problem getting a job, even in this shitty job market. When Google lays off 1,000 people from their engineering teams, 998 of them are software engineers and 2 of them are salesforce developers. You're competing with the 2, not the 998 that everyone else is competing with. Those 998 do not want to go anywhere near Salesforce, they see it as a downgrade that is below them.Additionally, the Salesforce development talent in India / overseas is notoriously horrible and you'll interview literally 100 people before you find one that isn't a net negative for your business, so there's not much overseas happening (also, Sales people want to talk to onshore, english-speaking Salesforce developers, they don't want to be talking to Indian developers at 2am). AI models are really mediocre with Salesforce concepts because Salesforce codebases are very rarely public and are not often represented in training data, so AI is not a big job risk either. Salesforce themselves can't even produce good AI tools for their own product. But again, nobody knows, that's the reality. Salesforce *could* go poof and disappear somehow.",

It’s obviously not true but somehow still true at the same time: applications to a job take a lot less work than to a college (also college applications take money). Most problems asked in coding interviews are honestly not Leetcode hard level for big tech. You can get unlucky but they ask a lot of medium with follow up to hard.

Managers will manually review the 100 applicants down to 20 they are interesting in doing phone screens with. The phone screens are ~15 minute conversations where the manager asks some very basic questions.* **Interview Stage**: 4 - 6. Managers will conduct phone screens with the 20 applicants and from that pick around 5 +/- a one or two that they want to interview* **Interview Rounds**: In my group we usually do two rounds of interviews. First one is typically remote unless the applicant lives nearby but the second one is always mandatory in person. Each round is pretty similar but with different groups of engineers. The managers will sit in and watch but let the engineers do all the actual interviewing. The actual interviews are about 30% behavioral/personality and 70% coding checks. The coding checks are pretty simple. Nothing from leetcode. Just basic programming questions or prompts to write simple functions. We are mostly just looking to see if you actually know how to code and didn't cheat your way through college. The questions barely get harder than fizz-buzz level and yet still like 50% of the applicants fail massively at this stage.So if we use 2K as the total number of applicants. Then ~5% of resumes are actually looked at by a person. ~1% make it to phone screens. ~0.25% make it to interview stage. Keep in mind these percentages include all the non-eligible candidates which are all automatically filtered out.",

You should be fine as long as you can be an adult and take the challenges of your chosen profession with stride",

Most fin-techs operate more like tech companies, but as they've grown they are starting to build out some of those risk and compliance functions. Some of them act as vendors to banks and are effected by bank regulations due to having to provide turn key solutions, so they are effected by model risk functions. For that reason they are familiar with banking background and more likely to also employ people from the banking space.Also as someone whose been in quant model development at large banks, its very common to exit from mid-tier banks into Big Tech. You just need to brand yourself more in the tech lingo and bank acts. Certain banks wear the tech company cosplay like capital one and its relatively easy to move from those places. I've seen people of all levels move from banking to tech from model validation or quantitative model development, usually in some kind of data science role.I also think some of this is how you sell your self. I mean lets be real what is teh difference between model risk and AI risk conceptually?",

You are willing to leave the company if they force you to do so...Second, you can accept the QA work but start asking around on that team like do people actually move into dev roles or onto other teams? If the answer is no, then chances are you’ll be stuck in QA. At the same time, make it super clear to your manager, like every other meeting, what your career goal is (to become a dev). Don’t let them forget.I went through something similar myself. I was hired as a new grad software developer, but they threw me on a IT support team where the tasks were just SQL ticket work. I told them no, I was hired as a developer. My manager was mad, my lead was mad, leadership was mad, I honestly thought they’d fire me. Eventually I found a frontend role on another team, and they let me switch, but it was pure luck.Then it happened again because I wanted to do backend or at least full stack work. So I started telling my manager I could handle and i know backend too. For a few months, I worked 11–12 hours a day, but telling my manager that i finshed my frontend tasks in 6, and then asked for backend tasks. Slowly, they let me help on a Spring Boot app, then Django, and eventually they trusted me to do backend and fullstack workSo yeah… if you’re not planning to just straight up tell them no, then you’ll have to do the QA work for now...because a job is a job...but still keep asking for dev work whenever you can (and continuing looking for outside opportunities)",

There are masters in CS geared towards quantitative but not CS backgrounds. You should look into those.

For banks and insurance companies, look up their local branches or regional offices and find the IT managers on LinkedIn - they're usually more responsive than corporate recruiters. Credit unions are actually goldmines for this stuff, way less bureaucratic than big banks and they're always looking for people who can modernize their systems. Manufacturing companies are another sleeper hit, especially if you can stomach learning some legacy systems - places like John Deere, Caterpillar, even local manufacturing firms need people who can bridge the gap between old school operations and modern tech. The key is positioning yourself as someone who can work with existing infrastructure rather than someone who wants to tear it all down and rebuild it. Also don't sleep on government contractors - they move slow but once you're in the ecosystem it's pretty stable. For getting past the portals, try reaching out to people with titles like \"IT Manager\" or \"Systems Administrator\" at these companies, they're usually buried in work and would love to have someone competent join their team. The certification thing depends on what you want to do but honestly your startup experience is probably more valuable than any cert, you just need to frame it right.",

Most companies out there hire SWE's. People working at those companies, even if they aren't SWE's, can refer you to a SWE position.Referrals aren't insta-job tickets. That's why they still give you technical interviews. Referrals are *character references*. It's somebody the company already likes, saying another person isn't crazy and will be a good fit for the company. That's a *huge* benefit for the company over hiring a rando off the street.",

And better social skills = better interview skills + better soft skills if you want to look at it soley in professional terms. I'm somewhat lucky, I got into tech because of my friends in school, so I've got them, when you meet new people its only natural to ask \"so what do you do for work?\" and given how big the tech industry is, you just make these contacts by talking to people.

It's a **huge** risk and pay cut.Given that you already have a full-time role and you're very early in your career, \"brand recognition\" is less important than you think. Skip the internship, look for a new full-time gig.",

You can start by learning tools like Excel (advanced level), SQL, and Power BI or Tableau. Once you’re comfortable, you can move to Python and basic statistics. Yes, data analysis includes some stats, but you don’t need to be a math genius. You just need to understand basic ideas like averages, percentages, and trends.For courses, check out Google Data Analytics on Coursera, IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate, or freeCodeCamp’s Python and SQL tutorials. They're beginner friendly and look great on a resume. As you learn, build small projects like maybe analyze public datasets or create dashboards so you have something to show employers.",

Entering into business partnership is like a marriage, and there is a non-trivial chance that the friendship will end if things with the company go sideways (which they likely will given startup failure rates) 2. Do you care about the equity? Usually if you get 200k+ in base salary, you’re not going to get the kind of equity you would if you started for minimum wage and lived off ramen for a year. Even in the best case exit, the equity may not be life-changing unless your friend is naive enough to give you both generous salary and generous equity 3. Are you willing to devote your entire life to this project for at least a year? Six months isn’t enough to get anything done, and being a founding engineer is all-consuming. I did it as a young man, but after I got married, I started turning down early-stage startup roles because I can’t afford to make work my entire life If you’re ok with the downsides that come with all of these questions, then yeah, take a risk and do it!",

Some basic functions will be the front page, inventory page, how you do filtering, sorting, etc. How do you build login page for users, authentication, etc.With the help of AI I think you can do that under an hour, but here's the thing: You have to understand what's your code is doing, because people will drill you about that in your interview. Now you can do all of that through a public repo, where you can create pull requests, write tests, setup CI to run tests if possible, and deploy them to a public site where others can see it.I guarantee if you can do that, the chance of getting an interview is significantly higher",

I think when I was interviewing for the job I had now, they did briefly ask me to talk about it. But it was much later on, early into it I was mainly being tested on ability (lots and lots of tech interviews and a take home)Don’t pick a project to impress recruiters. Help yourself out and pick a project that’ll help you improve. The more it grows the better, because that’ll help prepare you for when you do get a job and have to learn a gigantic codebaseBut focus on improving for now",

I don't mind working with both roles but I am always open for programming because I wanna grow in that field but customer service is also part of my retail job I enjoyed while working so to me combining them is great and I open for any role. He said we are not looking for programmers, we want IT customer service but I will write your name down and get back to you as soon as we need programmers. No way of knowing for sure why they passed, it might be something totally unrelated, maybe you were giving off bad vibes, but here it sounds fairly straightforward: the job was IT customer service, and you said you wanted to do programming. You also seem to have given off mixed messages: \"I don't know what I want to do, except I sort of do, but I also don't really care.\"What you do instead: you figure out what the recruiter wants to hear, and match that unless it's a complete lie or dealbreaker. If the recruiter wants someone to do customer service, and you're open to whatever, then you tell them you also want to do customer service listing XYZ reasons. If you have a slight preference for programming but are OK with customer service, you tell them you want to do customer service, with the understanding that that's what you're signing up for. If you don't really want to do customer service but will do it if you have to, you still tell them you want to do customer service, leaving out the \"because I have to\" part. If you absolutely don't want to do customer service, then the role wasn't a fit anyway.Based on this post it sounds like you might have missed some signs that the recruiter wanted to hear customer service stuff, and you could probably have pushed for more details on the job, if only to stall for time.",

That's pretty strange.I don't recall *ever* being unexpectedly called by someone representing a company I actually applied to. When I've applied to companies, the initial outreach is always an email from an HR person asking to setup a call with me. Just calling me out of the blue would be crazy.The only unsolicited calls I've ever gotten are from random 3rd party recruiters that are spray & praying phone calls in the hopes that someone bites. Same as they do with emails. I don't bother with 3rd party recruiters at all, I don't answer phone numbers I don't know, unless they're calling specifically around the time I already have a scheduled interview at.So that's who I would assume you were talking to. A 3rd party recruiter that didn't have a single specific job they were calling you about, or that you had applied to. You didn't miss out on getting hired, you just missed out on getting picked up by a 3rd party recruiter.But to directly answer your question, it wouldn't be unusual or rude at all to immediately ask: \"Hi! Thanks for reaching out. I don't recall having a call scheduled for right now, could you remind me who you are?\".As for a mistake... I don't think you made a mistake per se. You were just honest about your preference for programming over IT customer service, even though you said \"both\" your preference was still clear. The recruiter probably didn't want to try to jam you into a role that wasn't your intended career path.",

I wanted to say what he wanted to hear but he wasn't really straighforward with his question but I think I should have picked up on it when he mentioned my retail job that it is IT customer service.I do think I gave bad vibes because I think it is due to the fact that I have never recieved any answers so when he called about a job I didn't know what to think and I was like \"uuuhhh\" and stuttered and I knew right then I fked it up.
