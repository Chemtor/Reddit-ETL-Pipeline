No development since - engineers were not allowed to work on it - even in their free time. If a PR was created to improve something, it was not merged. **The only way to get changes through was when a production pipeline broke and there was no other fix available without modifying the framework.**I mentioned to the leadership, if they could just allocate 40 hours of engineering time per quarter (!!) for minor improvements, the engineers using the framework plus the downstream consumers would be much more satisfied.I joined in August 2025. One of the issues with the framework became apparent pretty quickly. I found that Airflow logging was not working - in case of failure, stderr was printed in the logs, but nothing from stdout. There was another logging interface configured, but stdout was missing from there as well. The only option to see the error message was to rerun the step again directly on Airflow through SSH. A step usually took 5-30 minutes. So if there was a failure, an extra 5-30 minutes had to be spent instead of just seeing it in the airflow logs. The fix was just 2 lines of code. **The lead engineer had to wait for a production pipeline to fail so they could bundle (sneak) my change into the emergency fix to get it deployed.**Yesterday was my last day.",

Otherwise I could never join the data products from one domain to the other, based on say, customer_id.The issues it tries to solve (consistent view of the same entity over disparate systems) aren't dead, we're just not making any leeway. And, every discrepancy is solved as it pops up. Alternatively, it actually is a hard question to determine whether there is value to a consistent view of enterprise wide entities or whether it's more valuable to have different context data in different systems. Anyway, just try and think of a bank. They'd want to know if the same customer holds multiple products (say, a mortgage and a checking account) so they won't unnecessarily cross-sell, or make other mistakes.",

        "body": "If your company's strategy is to grow by acquisition that means you will continually have to integrate new customer, supplier, and item data sets. You'll never be able to truly answer how many unique customers, suppliers, or products you have. That uniqueness is required for the denominator of your KPIs at an enterprise level. Yea I'm sure it's not needed at an operational level but that's not the level that your execs and ultimately your board is looking for.If you acquire your competitor and say you both share the same supplier but have different supply terms which are more favorable to the company you acquired then you would be smart to use that contract going forward. You will get to that answer sooner with MDM.MDM helps us get in front of these types of data challenges. Yes the tooling is bloated, expensive, and hard to implement and maintain. Regardless, the need will always be there. Another easy example, what if your customers are subsidiaries of other companies. How does Finance calculate the consolidate line of credit if it doesn't know or manage those relationships in the systems. When your company decides to change and modernize their ERP there is a huge effort to migrate accurate master data. If that master data is wrong it could put the whole migration and implementation in jeopardy causing millions in damages. There's plenty of risk if you don't accommodate for the needs of MDM that you might not see now but will when you eventually cross any of these bridges. So the need is not dead. Trying to use these dinosaur technologies and banking on your people and change management to work is where it tends to fall apart.My hope is we start to see some true LLM based matching and survivorship rather than the age old algorithmic matching routine.",

It Has to be able to rewrite all of the data in scope so that the ordering can work properly, so it would necessarily rewrite all the data. That would conflict with concurrent merge/update/delete operations, as at the time of finishing the ZOrder you would revert the rewritten data. However, if you run ZOrder on a single partition, then you can still merge/update/delete data in other partitions.The same goes for performing merge operations -- if you can isolate them to a single partition then the system can know for certain that you could not have possibly rewritten data outside that partition, so you can have concurrent merges working on different partitions.But that's all you really need it for now. You might add it for `is_active` on an SCD2 table because you will generally fundamentally only be updating current data and frequently only querying it, but you wouldn't be trying to optimise tables with partitioning. The new metadata-driven clustering is much more flexible and effective at that.",

Instead of physically co-locate files to nested folders (partitions) it just mark in a metadata that \"this parquet file is related to cluster (partition) X\" in a corresponding metadata JSON-file. This is not my understanding. Liquid clustering, and clustering in general, is about how the data is physically written in a specific order in a file. It's not just metadata (although there are). If your clustering keys change, then the files do need to be rewritten. (Edit: to benefit from the new clustering. But Databricks actually allows keeping old files with a previous clustering, see reply.)Please let me know if you have a source stating otherwise or if I misunderstood your comment.The difference between liquid clustering and simple clustering, is that liquid clustering is dynamic based on the access pattern statistics. If your access pattern is shifting, the optimizer will decide at some point that it is worth it to rewrite some files to reduce cost. This dynamic aspect is great, but it may also create new unexpected costs. A quick way to remember the main difference between partitioning and clustering: - partitioning → directories: determines which subdirectory a record goes into.- clustering → files: determines which specific file a record goes into and how records are arranged within files.",

I modelled everything myself, in a working solution, where the data indeed was really messy. It helped me tremendously, compared the on on-job-training my DE colleagues got. And later on I was dragged on to DE projects in various roles, and while not certain to get your anything, it sure can help a ton.* As for point 3: In general true, especially from a technical point of view. But in my part of the world, northern Europe it is becoming more the standard, that customers ask for x% of consultants to have Y certificates. So with a more commercial point of view, you can say, that while everyone can study and get Databricks' data engineer associate+engineer data professional without useful experience, they matter for contracts. And if you have the choice between hiring 2 candidates that are rated quite equal, I would take the person with the certifications, because you don't have to ask the new guy take certs on company time.As for your last point, with no number; that is where I really disagree. The majority don't work in companies where they work with the most modern tech. Then you let your company decide the ceiling of your skills/knowledge. The few paid certifications and courses your get on company time every year is usually focused on already established topics. When your boss (or his boss(es)) asks about stuff from outside the regular box it is worth a lot to be able to know about it. You get to lead test projects, you get to be placed on actual projects.

If Bob and Sue are dragging and dropping a measure from the same model that doesn't happen. And if Bob and Sue both think their one is best, then there can be a process for working out which one becomes the single source of truth instead of them going off into their silo and doing their own thing.Organisationally it sits at a good place too, in that it can be a product of a central data team to enable business unit-adjacent analysts and BI teams to get straight into their value-add (engineers do the engineering, business users do the questioning, presenting and interpretation) .

Data products mean anything that the end users need. One of the biggest challenges any data warehouse has is keeping the data between data products aligned. You always create your data products from the core layer for this very reason. As a general rule of thumb, your core layer doesn't specifically address any business need (actually it has to address all of them). You may be asking, why not just query the core? Data products are created to align with the business needs. What finance needs is not necessarily what sales needs. When you create something like a star schema, you are layering on business requirements, processes and definitions that may not be the same across the entire enterprise. Just that one data product. It is often very tempting to reuse a data product that has close but not entirely overlapping needs. Don't do it.

We've been working on improving JSON in ClickHouse as well.We released our native type last year, and just recently did a big update (https://clickhouse.com/blog/json-data-type-gets-even-better). We originally designed it so that you could pick (or let CH pick) about 1000 paths to store as native columns, and then pack the rest into a shared part file. It worked really well, but as more people used it, we found that a lot of people have A LOT of JSON paths. Either huge objects, or just huge variance between objects, which results in tens of thousands of paths. At which point you have many thousands of paths being bundled into the shared parts, and losing much of the efficiency (i.e. trying to aggregate a field that is packed into shared parts was slower and used a lot of memory compared to a real col).We redesigned it so that we can essentially do hierarchical indexing of buckets of shared parts - the post above explains how it works in detail. We managed to get some pretty impressive gains - about 58x faster when querying paths in shared parts, and using 3300x less memory, when you have over 10k unique paths.It's a pretty interesting area to work on as not many OLAP DBS handle JSON very elegantly, typically you just flatten it which is pretty annoying and brittle.",

Troll farms also play a role since you can hire a “PR consultant” that contracts with the troll farms. They’re really cheap too, think Amazon Turk but for astroturfing (Amazon Turf?).

Don’t be explain to your client architect what you did and why. LLMs are tools you are still responsible for the product. 4. point to the time pressure when you explain where you ended up and tbh it is a normal process - get it working - optimize - make it cheaper and maintainable. The architect will understand this.5. don’t make excuses and take on-board the feedback you are getting. Make a plan how to address and implement.6. many or almost every developer getting to the right solution eventually. The difference between average and high performer is the time and iterations and cost to get there. More mature developers need less iterations and code is maintainable, therefore cheaper overall.

It sounds like that’s exactly what you did, and you met the goals set out for you - just maybe not the consciously part. Don’t be so hard on yourself and take that as a learning opportunity for the future.When going into a complex project or task, always have that decision-making process in mind, and clearly communicate them throughout the implementation process. That way you eliminate the possibility of that meeting ever happening again. Of course there will be things to improve after launch. No such thing as perfect, feature-complete code",

You can find a Medium article about it (Ducklake on Apache Superset by Daniel Lewis).In short, you just create the database connection pointing to the Ducklake metadata database. If you set up your DB user properly (so that it doesn't actually see all the metadata tables there) you can see the schema right under the DB connection from Superset SQL Lab. The schema looks funky, as it lists all the secrets you've used (so it's not really 100% production ready) but if you select it, you can see all the tables you have created there.I tested this approach also with Metabase, but unfortunately I didn't get it to work. Somehow the sessioning does not allow multiple simultaneous queries against the metadata and I couldn't build dashboards as the graphs wouldn't display at once. TBH, I didn't investigate this further, as I knew that Superset does not have this problem.With 7 billion rows (in total), I haven't had any issues yet",

I work for a mid-size CPG company in the US that has more or less the same framework:- ingestion: raw data lands in redshift, separate schema for each source (raw schema for transactional source, separate raw schema for crm, another for customer support platform, etc). Method for ingestion varies by source, but the end result is the same. On our side we use a combination of stitch for some prebuilt connectors for SaaS applications, lamda for unstructured data that lands first in S3, and some custom python scripts hosted on ec2 for the various odds and ends- transformation: dbt transforms raw schema in redshift to cleaned data marts. I recommend putting thought into how you want to structure your transformation layers in dbt, and then just try to stay consistent. Dbt has their own recs on how to structure, and that's more or less what we do (staging, intermediate, and marts): https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/how-we-structure/1-guide-overview- analytics: some sort of viz or BI tool that references the cleaned data marts exclusively. You don't want business users building reports off the raw staging dataYou can probably find lots of sample dbt projects online, that mostly look the same in terms of structure. Just figure out what works for you, write out some rules for your org, and try to stick to it.",

And for the orchestration you have two options, the aws way is to use ec2 batch with a Ami that you built with all the dependencies that will have the dbt project on ir or will pull it from s3, that aws batch will be managed by a step function and schedule with event bridge. The other way is to set up mwaa and just create the dags and move them to the s3 buckets linked to the dags for mwaa, that will be a much Simplier management but is costly.",

They should all already be identified and catalogued someplace, as part of a data security framework. If they're not, that's a problem in and of itself. You need to know where the PII actually exists, and ideally section it off into separate, higher-security datastores. Less sensitive datastores should only store identifiers to the records in the secure datastores that contain the actual PII. This step alone can dramatically simplify the process of keeping things secure, and can make it safer to allow production access for developers to debug issues. It's rare that a bug involves needing to know actual PII, even in production.Once you know which datastores/fields contain PII, you can set up automated ETL pipelines to mask or tokenize them during the process of being copied into non-prod environments.A good practice is to have (at least) two non-prod environments: development and QA/staging. The QA environment should be automatically overwritten with a fresh, sanitized copy of production data, on a regular basis. The development environment should have finer-grained controls for overwrites, so as not to erase work-in-progress changes that developers have made to those datasets. Ideally, each team should have some control over whether their data domain is merely appended to by the automated ETL jobs, or overwritten/reset entirely.",

        "body": "I've tried and seen a couple of approaches, usually starting with using open-source [Cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos) to orchestrate dbt Core projects so you can see each dbt model/seed/test as an Airflow task in the DAG for additional visibility and to see the dbt docs in the Airflow UI (side note: this feature will be back for Airflow 3.1 with Cosmos 1.11 that should come out next month).The next \"level\" is to use Asset (in Airflow 3.x) / Dataset (in Airflow 2.x) scheduling for cross-DAG dependencies. That way the Asset graph (exists in 2.x and 3.x but imho is much easier to navigate in 3.x) serves as a proxy-lineage graph. Side note tip if you need both, runs based on time and upstream DAG dependencies, there is a combined [AssetOrTimeSchedule](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/airflow-datasets#combined-asset-and-time-based-scheduling).From there, yes, some people implement custom solutions, often based on dependency information gathered from the Airflow API or use the OSS OpenLineage integration to get \"true\" lineage and then visualize it with Marquez. How well this works highly depends on the operators and hooks you use, if they already support lineage extraction (there is a [list of supported classes](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow-providers-openlineage/stable/supported_classes.html)) or if you need to add extractors to your own custom operators. Inlets and outlets (so Assets again) are also evaluated by this integration.If you want an out-of-the-box solution there are paid products like [Astro Observe](https://www.astronomer.io/product/observe) which is based on OpenLineage and reads in that information to create a lineage graph with additional fancy features like SLA definition, alerts, cross-deployment lineage etc. There is also a list of potential up and downstream impacts in case of failures. The upside is minimal setup needed and managed service support.Disclaimer: I work at Astronomer :) and a lot of the above was inspired by [this blog post](https://www.astronomer.io/blog/the-road-to-reliability-implementing-pipeline-observability) (and the webinar linked at the bottom of it) from our internal data team. They don't use dbt but their pipelines center around Snowflake and they had the same goal of getting to end-to-end visibility and documented their journey to that there.",

If you go with Airflow I'd recommend looking into [DAG Factory](https://github.com/astronomer/dag-factory/) (or creating your own), it is an open source package that abstracts the Python for the Airflow pipelines behind YAML, it is especially useful for simple and repetitive pipelines. I've also seen setups were almost all of the Airflow code was abstracted away by one or two engineers and the analysts only wrote SQL (an OSS example here is [gusty](https://github.com/pipeline-tools/gusty)). Might be a way to help the drag and drop team members to slowly start to see the beauty of code-based abstractions and pipelines, once they see that can just fill in a few values in a template instead of clicking around when adding a new source etc.Also if you ever end up hating one of the GCP tools you can still switch them out against another tool and move towards a hybrid setup later.I haven't used data transfer service/dataform before so can't speak to those vs Fivetran/dbt. Just FYI you can use dbt Core with Airflow, a great way there is Cosmos. Disclaimer: I work at Astronomer, we made Cosmos (which is OSS, so you can run it no matter how you run Airflow), adopted and maintain the DAG Factory and do managed Airflow, so I am biased towards Airflow. Though in this case I guess I just gave an assist to cloud composer which is our competitor. If you want to look into Airflow we have a lot of beginner resources like the [learn guides](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/intro-to-airflow) or [Marc Lamberti's academy course ](https://academy.astronomer.io/path/airflow-101)that are relevant no matter where you run Airflow. :)",

You get the bonus of having quality control by having your SQL (dbt models) version controlled and peer reviewed via pull requests. Also control over deployments. Your dbt code should be in a repository with a CI process that tests it and then publishes an image to Google Artifacts Registry. Cloud Run will pick up the image when Composer runs it, just use the Cloud Run Operator.Sure newer orchestration tools like Dagster and Prefect a bit sexier.

ClickHouse is great to run analytics on very large immutable data (super fast because of the vectorized engine, sparse index etc), I'd only use it for that and only if your data is actually very large (or you anticipate it to be in a reasonable time frame) and move the SCD and model layers into a proper OLAP db. So: raw, very large and will never change in ClickHouse, anything aggregated or that needs to be updated ever in Postgres/BQ/Snowflake etc. But honestly for a first PoC if your data isnt that big, which I assume based on the current CSV/SharePoint/PowerBI combination, you can also skip ClickHouse for now.2. Sorry no first hand experience with PowerBI+ClickHouse. From what I've heard it works fine for basic dashboards but complex joins are not fun with that combo.3. I'm biased here since I work for Astronomer so I have a lot of Airflow and only very little Prefect experience. I'd recommend spinning up a small dev environment of both and creating some mock pipelines to see which fits your needs better. For small projects it's often the case that several orchestrators can do the job and the decision is made more based on personal preference. Some tips for Airflow: * Use the Astro CLI to spin up a local dev env in containers to try it out (its free and does not need a sign up). * If you are combining Airflow with dbt you have to use [Cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos) (ok, technically you don't *have* to but it is really the best way!). It is an OSS package that lets you render dbt projects and dbt docs in the Airflow UI. * You said your ingest is pulling from REST APIs using Python: you can use the `task`decorator in Airflow to turn any Python function into an Airflow task, thats probably the fastest way. I think Prefect has a similar decorator too. So with either tool hopefully you can reuse a lot of your existing code there. * If you end up passing data between tasks that is more than just small jsons in Airflow, for example larger pandas dataframes, you'll want to store that data in a blob storage. This used to take a bit of setup but about 1.5 years ago a class was added in the Common IO provider package that is very quick to set up via env vars ([a tutorial](https://www.astronomer.io/docs/learn/custom-xcom-backends-tutorial)). * PSA: top level code in Airflow is executed every time the file is parsed, so don't connect to your db in top level code (i.e. outside of tasks).4. If there is a good way to do SCD with ClickHouse I have not found it yet. There is [ReplacingMergeTree](https://clickhouse.com/docs/guides/replacing-merge-tree), which I haven't tried myself but generally, yes, that is definitely a good reason to have the modeling layers somewhere else.",

You can run it as a simple single server to start with and it'll scale when you need to. It's not a transactional store so you'll want Postgres for that side.

That might sound like an expensive, bureaucratic thing to say, but even when you ignore Data Governance, you're still performing a form of governance.So, before asking yourself questions on good data quality, ask yourself: what does good data governance look like? How do I make sure we are efficient, effective, self-learning, have decision-support structures, remain lawful and above all else: have clear accountability? Who decides? Who decides who decides?Then ask yourself: what about the security of my data? How do I balance integrity, confidentiality and availability? What does integrity mean to this organisation? An accountancy has different requirements than a gaming startup.Once you have that setup, you can begin to ask yourself some questions about data quality, and this is a big balancing act between different data quality dimensions:* Accuracy* Credibility or reputation.* Confidence* Availability* Usability* Fit for purpose* Representational Consistency* Timeliness* Completeness* etc.As you will see, only a limited amount of these dimensions can be validated using so called 'data quality tools'. The most important DQ dimensions are difficult to measure, but will determine the success or failure of your efforts: reputation, confidence, fit for purpose, usability. You can have 100% accurate data in one table, but if another table has many flaws in them, the reputation of your data team is going down the drain.Another dimension that's very important, but overlooked is availability. That's not just that the data is in the data warehouse, but also that it can be found, understood and applied to the right business problem at hand by those who have the skills to use it.Moreover, you can do everything right wrt DQ, but if your primary stakeholders have no way to influence the decision making, or there are questions w.r.t. the lawfulness of the use of specific data sets (GDPR), your data still is useless.",

In practice: use Azure OpenAI with VNet + customer-managed keys or AWS Bedrock/SageMaker via PrivateLink, make them sign a BAA, and opt out of training. Put a gateway that enforces DLP and field-level access; Presidio works well for PII redaction. Run RAG so only vetted chunks leave the DB, and keep vectors in pgvector/OpenSearch with KMS. Turn off chat history, force prompt templates, and log everything to CloudTrail/SIEM. Egress is deny-by-default through a proxy. For glue, we’ve used Azure OpenAI and Bedrock, with DreamFactory auto-generating locked-down APIs so only approved columns flow. If security still balks, self-host vLLM on EKS. So rather than block LLMs, keep them private with strict network, keys, and redaction, and you’ll meet compliance.",

If you're not sticking with Talend/Talaxie, you're in for quite a lift whether it's on another commercial platform or a free open source one.The big vendors include Databricks, Snowflake/Snowpark, Fivetran, Matillion, AWS Glue, Azure DataFactory, and Informatica Cloud. Most of those can give you the capabilities you asked, but implementations vary and none operate quite like Talend did.The open source options include DLTHub, Airbyte, Bruin, CDAP, Nifi, Trino, and a few others I probably missed. That comprises at least the ingestion pieces, but you'll likely need other tools to supplement that such as dbt/sqlmesh and a workload orchestrator. You will pay in labor what you saved in cost, but it's rewarding when you get it right.Hope that helps.",

The problem is that each of the workloads tend to get in the way of the other. i have seen DW with very light OLTP or OLTP with very light analytics but not even workloads. It is the same reason you can sort of get a way with a federated RDMS in OLTP but not OLAP of any size. Also, most organizations don't do \"best in breed\" they use \"good enough of breed\" that barely meet the requirements due to cost. The top end RDMS systems are almost all proprietary. The only thing that open source has going for it is price. In almost every other feature they are playing catchup to what the proprietary systems had 10-15 years ago.",

With properly partitioned tables, compressed and using a columnar format (like Parquet) I'd think Athena should be relatively cheap. Are you reading from something nasty, like uncompressed Avro or JSON, with mostly full table scans? Even if you stay with self-hosted Trino, you could probably improve performance significantly with a more efficient data storage strategy.",

I've never heard of a workload where running your own EMR cluster on a large, well-structured dataset with read-heavy operations ended up being cheaper than Athena. Are your queries actually processing petabytes of data, or do you just mean you have petabytes on storage and are more typically performing reads in the multi-terabyte range? I'd assumed the latter, but if you really are performing petabyte-scale individual queries, maybe you're just hitting some scaling inflection point in terms of cost?",

Come up with a plan to have him do a structured knowledge transfer to MULTIPLE people in the company (yourself included). Have a series of meetings to go over the various parts of the data processing, structure, control, etc. And make sure that everyone understands. Your DE is going to resist this or play passive aggressive with you. Keep asking questions until it is perfectly clear to you what is going on. You may want to have that manager attend (or announce he will be there) for the first meeting or two. He has a vested interest in this. Don't let the DE consolidate the data flows until after the training and don't let him do the consolidation alone. ~~If~~ When he doesn't like it, this will give you ammo to demonstrate to the manager why this is a good plan.",

Start by building the MVP (minimally viable product) THEN add features and improvements. Build with the intent that things will get bolted on. They are doing a classic waterfall approach. Deliver the final product all at once. So in this method, building in certain features first might be more efficient to get to the final deadline. Agile is faster, more flexible, and some variation of it is the new modern standard. Waterfall is good for building something with core features that are extremely well defined. Of course, there's the other option that they are just building what they want to build whether it is needed or not. With data scientists, you can't rule that out. Here's the catch, every data scientist I have ever met HATES Agile. I suspect it is because in academia, you design your entire experiment, make your hypothesis, do your research, THEN do the experiments THEN publish your results. To them, Agile is following a poor practice of finding something 80% correct with the end goal of getting something better in the next round. Plus, if they are building a gradient boosting regression with specific variables now, the 90% correct version may require completely different variables with a Random Forest Regression. In other words, a complete rebuild. Data engineers can add features much more organically. I'm not saying that the Data Scientists are right. There is a very good reason while Agile has dominated tech, and there is a reason Data Science projects never get anywhere. Understand where they are coming from, but ultimately, you're more likely than them to be following best practice.",

Typically data scientists work in a sandbox environment when they model. If you’re talking delivery, then I assume you are building data pipelines? They need to figure out what model works before they can tell you what data they need and how they need it. It’s a lot of exploratory work. When I worked on an agile data science team, we just wanted access to copies of raw prod data from different sources while we figured out approximately what worked. (Honestly, even if it would work.) Training can involve significant amounts of data. If it was something large and complex, like a simulation, this might take weeks. At review we usually had draft models to talk through with business and often changed or added data as a result. We didn’t get involved with engineering until we had a good idea of what data we needed and how we needed it first (and where we were putting it). If business needed something faster for a particular reason, we’d just refreshed our working draft. (They usually had access.) “Productionizing” something like that as we worked would have been wildly expensive and time consuming. We had conflict with one of the engineering teams at one point because they thought it was inappropriate to give us access to data until we could tell them exactly what we need. Then they would decide how to model it, spend time modeling for us, and it wouldn’t be modeled in a way that worked, the back and forth arguments took forever. (No, six months of data isn’t enough. No, the most recent value replacing the old value doesn’t suffice. Actually, we needed those variables you deleted, etc.) It was a nightmare. They considered us “non-technical” as just told us we didn’t understand best practices. No idea if this applies to you. Hopefully not. But you might ask them their reasoning. Data science is not a software dev discipline and follows a different life cycle than the standard SDLC. I have seen multiple issues with tech people over my career who could not wrap their heads around this. They can be overly perfectionist, yes, and I can’t tell you if yours are or not, but I’ve lived it long enough to know they might not be.",

If I didn't need the DBT plugin I would look at SQRuff in preference to SQLFluff.For DBT we publish the output of DBT Docs to cloud blob storage so clients can download it into whatever internal websites suit them. Again, interactive data lineage comforts auditors and people who query business data.In the past I've used products such as Redgate SQLDoc and Innovasys DocumentX to document databases. As the company I was with went with a plethora of other databases I ended up writing my own version. For any tabular DB my app needed a DB connection and a folder to hold that DB's equivalent of queries whose output was a defined contract. Again, this comforts the auditors.Code quality tools such as SonarQube, Sonarlint are useful. In JetBrains PyCharm there us a \"Problems\" tab that provides code improvement suggestions. I've found these to be useful. I think VS Code has some useful extensions that do something similar.JavaDoc is over 30 years old, most languages have an equivalent. Its only as good as the human content put in, but as a mechanically solved autodocumentation facility, its up to you to avoid shooting yourself in both feet....then reloading and shooting both kneecaps etc.I do a lot of work with AWS. I've found that their APIs, for the products I use, need a lot of calls as an API call answers a question but doesn't always provide the info to feed directly into a related question. Using Mermaid markup allows the relationships between various cloud artefacts to be autogenerated. I'm crap at graphics so Mermaid is about my limit. Again, a diagram comforts auditors. A comforted auditor is a comforted management team.Data testing can be DBT Test, Soda and more specific queries. Its easy enough to generate AWS cloudwatch metrics from the results of a query. From AWS Cloudwatch metrics, its easy ti generate AWS Cloudwatch alarms. An example would be average expected sales +- 1.64 standard deviations as the acceptable range, anything outside of that range needs investigation.In all honesty, the tooling is not the important thing. Its thinking about the goal you want to achieve, the benefit of achieving it, and the process by which you can achieve it. Only then do I look at tooling.",

You should do the math yourself but being an actual employee is not trivial. That being said if your spouse has health insurance and can get you on his plan this might not matter.2) SF will likely lead you to more opportunities long term. There’s a lot more in-person jobs coming back and it is highly advantageous to be here for future jobs moves. During my most recent job search, most if not all of the roles I found were in-person, and all of the highest-paid ones were in or around San Francisco. The same is true of my other friends in tech. Many of them who have roots elsewhere are struggling to find jobs that won't force them to relocate to SF. And a lot of places will pre-screen for candidates who already live here when searching LinkedIn. I likely would not have found my current role if I wasn't already based here.3) $150k is still a lot in SF. People talk a lot about the high COL and it's true that the bang-for-your-buck on rent is terrible. But how that usually shakes out is you just rent a place that's smaller/shittier than you would otherwise rent elsewhere, and then are left with more money than you know what to do with. I have plenty of friends who get by just fine on less than $100k/year here. With $150k and your spouse having an entire second income you'll be more than fine.4) the weather here in SF is way better",

But they should never need the formal approval process from the end user.I mean, sure, if they are \"conscientious\" they'd do that. But who says they are? If your organisation is big enough then all sorts of things typically can and do happen. Now, I am not saying that the approval must come from the consumer domain necessarily (you're right, that's probably a bad idea...), but some sort of sign-off should come from someone. Thinking of it, probably the official data product owner or steward should give that, BUT the downstream data product consumers should receive a notification of change.In any case, this does not fundamentally change my question or argument. The main point being that data products would have some form of enforced and versioned schema, and you could not simply consume a data product by circumventing that contract, nor could you simply change the schema without any formalized and versioned change request.",

        "body": "Thank you! Looking briefly at this post, it does seem to touch on what I’m asking. The post calls it a “monster query”, which is accurate. A composite metric fact table is just that - rather than a period snapshot, or transactional fact (or other) it’s literally taking data (facts) from many adjacent places and smashing them together - in my case to create “supply vs. demand” - adjacent facts include production actuals, production schedules, inventory (on hand, consignment, with vendor, in transient, etc), stock received from 3rd parties, projected sales, actual sales, goods issued, etc. There is like >17 datasets that comprise the formula for “supply vs. demand”, and each data set is multiple ETL jobs / facts broken out by different companies / regions of the world (in a large multinational). Hence, you can see my concern about potential challenges about different points of time due to unexpected failed or delayed ETL jobs, and ensuring to write an artifact to the fact for data quality purposes. I don’t need to expose this to my end uses (who are restricted to views on top of my table) but I would put in in the physical table for quality/explainability. Also, I’m only concerned with the explainability part now (best practice design). Obviously, the more important part is the proactive portion of who you programmatically ensure all combined data is from the same point of time. For example, you can break the metric up into regions of the world (NA, EMEA, APAC) to ensure it’s computed relevant to their time zones, you can adjust your “subqueries” to enforce timeboxes, or time travel / time restrictions to ensure they are all consistent, or you might do some sort of staging tables that can be “frozen” (for example frequent loading upstream but frozen into daily buckets, etc.). I’m sure there are a few good options.Again, I’m starting with “hey they this is very complicated since ETL doesn’t always work as intended and error free” so how do I assure quality given the many challenges. Thanks again - it’s is a great link, very helpful and exactly what i was asking for.Edit: the blog post called out something I forgot to mention that’s pretty critical. The subsets of data are all aggregated, so what’s included/missing from the aggregation is very important. For example, if we are calculating MetricValue = Inventory on hand [region | material | day] - goods issue [region | material | day ] + projected sales [ region | material | calendar day] —> and each of these are very volatile. The different businesses in different regions of the world will change their sales forecasts through out the day (especially as we near quarter/year end, or other business target dates), inventory changes drastically, and goods issue (reduction of inventory) is very dynamic. So, if I’m after a daily level, as in what’s my EMEA inventory for material 111 on 10/23/25, this value could be very different if my subquery executes at 1am vs. 4am vs. 7am. Where as in a transactional fact table, i would simply be adding rows (ie: additional sales invoices to a sales fact table) and the differences are easily understood - I’m summarizing inventory per day, so the differences in values due to timing are a mystery. I like that the blog post is pointing this out as a challenge in the “monster query” which aggregates results into a “common grain” (which is exactly what I’m doing here).",

The data coherence has to be assumed entirely but your ingestion process.Another great advantage for you is that Clickhouse is natively multi-tenant, and built to scale (which is never fun, though)Least but not last ( having worked with Clickhouse for 4+ years) Clickhouse community is great and you can easily reach them out on their slack or support.",

What helped us in ClickHouse: use ReplacingMergeTree with a version (updatedat) for idempotent upserts and late-arriving fixes; resolve surrogate keys via ClickHouse dictionaries so facts can map to dimension IDs without heavy joins at write time. Put tenantid first in ORDER BY and partition by month (toYYYYMM(ts)) for fast pruning and easy drop/backfill per tenant-month. For custom fields, store a Map for long tail, but promote high-usage keys into real columns; add bloom filter indexes on common filters and a soft\\_delete flag with TTL DELETE to keep storage sane. Row policies work well for tenant isolation if you expose direct SQL. Tinybird is great for serving pre-aggregates, but keep ClickHouse as the source of truth and rebuild from staging when mappings change. I’ve used Airbyte for ingestion and dbt for tests/backfills; DreamFactory helped us expose secure REST endpoints over the star for internal tools and partner integrations without hand-rolling auth. The main thing: tenant-first sort key, ReplacingMergeTree + version, and a small canonical layer will save you when schemas shift and backfills hit.",

The `@Autowired` annotation on something means that dependency is being injected by the framework, and it could come from anywhere. All you know is that you're getting an object that implements the `MyServiceClient` interface. It could have been made by half a dozen different implementations of that interface, or it could even be a mock object created in a unit test. You treat all of them the same way and don't care where they were constructed.If you think there's something wrong with the way the object is being constructed, looking in the code that is having it injected is the wrong way to inspect it. Look for any implementations of that interface that have `@Bean` or `@Component` annotations.",

If it was that good, every other language would be copying the patterns. Instead, what we see is Java trying to copy other languages while maintaining backwards compatibility, which naturally makes the language harder than needed. See the \"wonders\" of how string interpolation is stuck with a kind of nasty format, because all the more reasonable ones were used in other libraries first, and they didn't want to break backwards compatibility. See the streaming api, less comfortable than the equivalent in every language with monadic collection operations. The Option class that has no nullability guarantees, so it's not reliable, And since 95% of all Java for services is written in Spring, the annotation salad is what we've got.So yeah, your best bet is to cope via heavy IDEs that do all the work and will track usages, including knowing the autowiring logic.",

        "body": "I think that code readability has a lot to do with one's experience with the particular paradigm being used, as well as one's understanding of the abstractions and the underlying platform.Sorry for the essay - hope it makes sense for someone out there :)I teach intro-level Java-Programming as well as Spring programming, and it is interesting to see how different students grow into the different paradigms at wildly different paces.Understanding **imperative code is easy for everyone**, first line does something, then second line does something else, then the third line does another thing. The hardest part is learning that when you write `int weeks = days / 7;` on line 14, and then change the number of `days` on line 20, the value of `weeks` doesn't change along with it. But you get used to it, and learn to read code.Then comes **procedural** code, with loops and functions/methods (we ignore the objects at first), and it gets a bit harder to understand that the loop does the same thing over and over, but with the values changing - so now changing a value on line 20 **DOES** impact the calculation on line 14, if they are inside the same loop. Or a function behaves differently from time to time, because it depends on a global variable, whose value might have changed since the last call ...Then you move into **object oriented** code, where objects ask each other to do stuff - but it still mostly reads like procedural code, where a single thread of execution goes through methods living in different objects - you get used to having to jump around in different files, but most of the time you can still follow along. The hardest part is knowing when the objects are instantiated, and who \"owns\" the reference to them - but other than that you begin to abstract away the actual program flow, unless you really need it.But you begin using frameworks, and suddenly you don't see all the code - you have objects that extend existing objects, who then call methods in your object. You don't know exactly when or why your own methods are called, you just get CVS-receipt-length style stack-dumps when something fails, and you sit \"outside\" the code, looking in, trying to understand what might be happening around your own code - mostly you are guessing or using information from other people also guessing.It becomes very hard to follow, even for experienced programmersAnd then you move to Spring, which is **aspect oriented** programming, where you don't even write, nor see all the code, but only add annotations and interfaces, and then some magic entity behind the curtain reads your code, and changes it! Sometimes before compiling, sometimes after! And you have no idea how your code is being used, who uses it, what for, or when. You just hand code to the monster, and it does something - now it is literally impossible to follow what is going on, and you need to know what the platform does, what the framework does, how it uses your classes and methods, and why it uses them in the way it does ... And you either have to read through 35 years of accumulated specifications, or watch days of indian youtubers explain it, still somewhat on the surface-level ...So to answer your question, **yes**! Modern Java is actually very hard to read - and Spring is outright impossible to understand if you don't know a whole lot about it beforehand!",

        "body": "I'm in a similar boat, but I happened to figure that problem out as an undergrad. You're probably ahead of me in skill and prospects. **Work on skills related to finding a job:**Set a block of time, every day after work, for applying and upskilling. No exceptions, even if it's as little as 30min for one and 30min for the other. Every time you feel like you're not skilled enough (which may be true), remember that people less skilled than us ARE getting jobs.Figure out why. Are they applying in novel ways? Do they have really good interviewing skills? Are they personable? Did they do x, y, and z? Improve yourself based on your findings. There are A LOT of unique ways to get hired while being less skilled. At the very least, you can improve your interviewing skills by failing at them and learning what to learn. Don't be afraid to look for more technical, but still retail-adjacent/low-level roles as a start. Don't allow yourself to settle for this either - keep searching and improving your process. I'd also try doing Neetcode 150 as well. Spend 15-30minutes failing on one question, watch the solution to the video, and then learn why the solution works (you can use AI as a mentor, not a solution solver). Rinse-repeat. Don't worry about \"not knowing the answers.\" Even experienced developers struggle on optimizing Easy's.So, 30 minutes of self-study, 30min of applying (even \"knowing\" you'll fail), and a bit of LC-style learning when you're bored. .**Work on your technical skills:**There are just as many paths forward in this as there is on the above. My advice as a beginner? Figure out what domains you liked during your studies, research what it takes to get into them, and then follow an online roadmap learning those resources. Don't have a preferred domain?Then either read some books related to learning how to program, ones that are heavy on coding along and building things, follow a bootcamp, or go straight into \"github project-based learning\" repo and start building with your preferred languages. Focus on your preferred languages and up your skills.I recommend that path the most.At the end of the day, school primed us to be very good at intaking new information and thinking like a computer, so now you have to learn how to be a craftsmen, building new projects and applying your theory. Too overwhelming? The Odin Project is a free online boot camp that will essentially take you from 0 to the very minimum skills of a junior full-stack developer. You'll learn how to research, use version control, and build projects. This will solidify your programming foundation, especially if you go a layer or two deep when using the additional resources/reading books.Don't forget to keep applying. When you're done with Foundations, you're not going to be \"cracked out junior\" level, but you'll be \"meh, *maybe* I can teach him the rest\" level. If you haven't been applying due to being an imposter, you want a job or what? At least start at this point. The more you improve at learning to program, the workflow for it, the rigor it takes, etc, the better you can pivot to other domains of programming. This is just one method of trying to open that door.You are free to learn whatever else (project-based building in your preferred domain, reading books about programming, following tutorials on building a game, etc) as long as you complete that block of time for applications (or learning novel ways of getting a job) and dedicated self-study (this example being The Odin Project).It's important to have fun during it all and not try to speed run yourself into burnout. You may find you learn the most in that period of fun/exploration..Sorry about the wall of text! I don't know the correct/most efficient path since I'm stumbling along as well! If you want someone to chat with, feel free to DM on here. I'll give my Discord.",

We only had to choose in year three and then could also choose multiple paths at once to test them out.Some jaded opinions from having done all of that a bit (my formal background is databases, chip design, robotics and cognition psychology):- Cybersecurity is steady but boring. It sounds flashy on paper with hacking and 0-days, but in practice it's about managing risks, audits, and doing lots of trainings for Rachel from accounting and writing stern memos for Herbert down in the archives to not write passwords on a postit. I've come into that via formal certifications we had to do to get projects in certain industries and I'm in contact with the legal department of a client for risk management there.- AI is buzz. There's money there, but you have to be able to suppress any remnant of morality to get that money by promising the sky and unicorns. The actual tech is cool and fascinating but can do a lot less than what sales people promise and unless you can get into one of the big players, you'll be eternally chasing their work. We do get project requests related to that and at least half of them ask for applied magic.- Databases is steady and boring and a bit frustrating. 99% of what people need from databases can be taught in a simple SQL course, the rest comes up if you either need to scale a high performance setup for 100000 users or when the new manager Timmey suggests we move all our data into a MongoDB on his notebook because he can scale with kubernetes or something like that. As I said, my formal background, and the MongoDB example is only half exaggerated.- Avoid Web. It's been the lowest common denominator in coding for decades. It will be expected that you can do web in addition to your \"real\" specialisation.- Game Dev... as you said, not a good option if you want to eat.Edit: added a bit of context, also some more specialisations to consider:- control unit and embedded is surprisingly complicated and rewarding. Pretty much all machinery out there runs software somewhere, but it's not talked about a lot.- graphics programming is also surprisingly large. Medical imaging, HUDs and sensors for vehicles, big data visualisation etc are all non-trivial, and the algorithmic side overlaps with the nitty gritty details of running AI.- robotics is cool, but not a lot of jobs in my city.- signal processing is an absolute rabbit hole. Take it at least as an elective because it helps immensely with compression theory, cryptography and video encoding.- if all else fails, there will always be jobs for stupid, boring enterprise software. The electronic version of a clipboard and a document binder. It's soulless corporate work, but it pays the bills.",

        "body": "Check out what's taught in the core curriculum for these specializations: subjects, courses, technologies, topics, languages. They can teach anything under the name AI. It could be generative AI, ML, or complex but important topics, but also things that are completely irrelevant to today's world or the job market. Similarly, other cybersecurity categories will likely include theory, encryption, encryption algorithms, and more, but there's a good chance they won't include what everyone expects—hacking or active intrusion prevention. Web can also encompass anything, perhaps focusing more on network administration or web application development (more or less latest technologies, languages). Depending on how the university keeps up with the times, databases might have a well-developed foundation, but they might also include cloud computing, Azure, data warehousing, Big Data, and more.Based on what these specializations contain, you can make a more informed decision, and we can recommend one over the other. Of course, it's also important what you're interested in, what you've done, and what you felt good about. This is especially true for things you didn't particularly enjoy; this can strongly steer you toward a particular specialization. However, the names of specializations alone aren't enough, as they can encompass many other things.Additionally, look at the job market in your country or the location where you'd like to work. For example, you probably won't find a job as a junior game developer or Android developer. Job offers based primarily on databases should be available, although you'd likely need to learn something, such as data science. If this specialization truly teaches the topics I mentioned and others, you could easily find a job, for example, one related primarily to Azure and databases. There are jobs for web developers, but they involve a vast array of technologies. Unfortunately, you'll likely have to learn many of them completely on your own due to the limited number of subjects and hours to even call yourself a junior. It's also possible that the technologies they'll teach you for creating web applications aren't entirely aligned with market demand. Therefore, it's crucial to check what they'll actually teach under the term \"web\"—will you have the skills to administer networks, for example, or will it be a mishmash of everything, not necessarily up-to-date, and will pose a problem later.",

They aren't an \"attractive nuisance\" in the sense you're thinking. They're not \"polluting the public view\" any more than *any* random website on the internet is (and I'd argue infinitely less so). Instead, by posting how you *started* in the form of your newbie, beginner-level code (that, yes, might \"suck\"), and then posting a steady progression of how you learn, you would show evidence of by far one of the most important skills a programmer can have: the ability to learn. I feel this is especially true for a modern software developer. If all you post is your \"perfect\", fully complete projects, how am I to know that you didn't just have AI write it for you (and yes, fellow devs, I am *fully* aware that AI does not write perfect code)? How am I to know that you can adapt to unknown coding situations? How am I to see that you can learn, adapt, and above all *think* like a dev?",

You already know how to program, too. That doesn't change much. Neither does computer architecture or networking principles. Same for OS design and for parsers/compilers (the purple dragon book is still likely going to be the book you read for compilers and that was written 40 years ago).What you want to do at your stage is to continue passing your math and engineering classes because those are extremely important if you want to do anything with CS that doesn't involve basic software engineering. And the reason for that is going to be that the math classes you take will likely gate what upper division electives you can take. Go through your course catalog and look at the electives for your major. THOSE are going to lead to high-level, interesting stuff that *does* require a college education. For example, machine learning as a college junior or senior is severely more intensive than what you're going to experience through online tutorials aimed at people who don't have a CS background.The important thing is that a lot of interesting stuff that you can learn as a CS major *isn't necessarily CS.* If you want to learn about simulation, you might end up looking at stuff for civil engineers (and realize that you need to take more physics). If you want to learn more about data science, you might end up looking at economics and might need to take way more philosophy. The more interesting networking classes are usually tied into management of information systems. The split info embedded is likely going to land you in electrical engineering if not directly into computer engineering. If your school has an informatics program, you might even want to change majors. If you want to manage software projects and your college doesn't have any sort of specialty in that, then you're going to need to learn the Project Management Body of Knowledge on your own *anyway* if you want to become a project manager... and then software project management is a subset of business management anyway. A ton of tech project managers can't write a lick of code. So at the end of the day, look at your upper division electives and think \"Does this sound interesting?\" If it does, go for it and make sure the path on your curriculum leads to it. As for personal development, I always tell people to just work on something, ANYTHING AT ALL, just for fun outside of their school hours. The only people I know that managed to finish a CS degree but then never did anything with it were people who never wrote any code for fun on their offtime. If you simply want to flex what you already know and want to broaden that, then look up coding challenges or attend a jam of any sort.",

For me, building a simple game engine taught me more about systems design than any tutorial ever could. The key is choosing projects where you'll naturally encounter those deeper concepts - memory management, algorithms, architectural patterns - rather than just learning them abstractly.Since you're already doing full-stack and LeetCode, maybe try building something that bridges to ML or game dev?

Above that, HTTP is a conversation that usually happens on TCP port 80, and HTTPS is a somewhat different conversation that usually happens on TCP port 443.The important difference between the two is that to speak HTTPS, the server needs some sort of certificate that proves its identity. You can create a little temporary one for local testing, but if you want it to actually serve traffic on a domain name, it needs a real, trusted certificate. That certificate might be provided by whoever set up your domain, and often these days people use \"Let's Encrypt\" for this sort of thing. It provides little apps that can handle most of the work of getting and renewing certificates for you.",

        "body": ">But what if my application doesn't directly run on that server and the request will be forwarded, the server would send the decrypted regular HTTP for the rest of the path to my application.You can look into the concepts of a \"reverse proxy\", which is basically a web server deployed by a service provider that takes web requests and forwards them to some other service. The forwarding can happen through HTTP calls, but in modern data centers you may also encounter request forwarding through other protocols that are more suited like gRPC. Reverse proxy servers can also handle load balancing, i.e. if the same application is deployed multiple times behind the reverse proxy the reverse proxy can choose the application with the lowest load as the forward target so that no server becomes overly burdened.Reverse proxy servers can perform so called \"TLS termination\", where the reverse proxy handles the TLS handshake (and is aware of the TLS private keys that are used to prove service authenticity). This effectively strips the TLS functionality from the requests so that an application can focus purely on providing functionality, while the secure connection responsibility remains with the reverse proxy. However it is also possible (and encouraged) to encrypt a HTTP / gRPC connection that gets established within a data-center from the reverse proxy to the application server with TLS. You'd do this if you don't trust the network infrastructure in the data center, e.g. because it runs a co-location server model where the server hardware owned by different entities is deployed within the same physical location.",

Practically speaking, quite a lot of places will just have some kind of gateway / proxy thing handling all the SSL and your application can just speak HTTP inside the private network. It's good to understand it of course, and you have a pretty good grasp of it there, but it quickly just becomes, \"part of the infrastructure\", especially in this cloud based world.

Way back in the day, a variety of simple hacks made it easy to imitate a web site through dns poisoning/etc. SSL certificate and encrypting the data between client and server was a huge step in resolving that.

Then I didn't use it because I 'needed' a spray booth. Got one about 18 months ago. Still didn't do any because 'I need a dedicated space'. Recently I got one. Still didn't use the airbrush because I 'needed' running water, power and internet (because of reasons) in order to spend time down in that area.All of these things that delayed me starting were, if I'm honest, because it scared me. The whole journey off learning to use the airbrush properly and learning to clean and maintain it, scared me. So I didn't use it.In the last few weeks I finally used it. First time was okay. Cleaned it and left it all there. Came back and had problem after problem with the airbrush.Turns out that that was the best thing that could have happened. I had to repeatedly strip the brush and work or what was wrong and how to fix it. All of these problems completely destroyed my fear of it. The problems (and solving them) were the perfect thing to educate me on how to use it and have me experience and confidence.The lesson here is that problems are good. Problems teach and instead of fearing it, it's just best to dive in and confront the problems.",

You may or may not use that knowledge directly to build fault tolerant systems but the skills you gained on how to think about a problem and judging trade offs is somewhat transferable when building projects/products.So both go hand in hand one way or another. But this is just a recent discovery for my own experience. I cannot generalize this.

Hell no, but also you don't need to.But you should be building up a baseline of knowledge over time.What's the system to learning all of that faster? Make it *hard* for yourself to look the information up. Brains are inherently lazy - if it is easy to look something up, your brain won't bother spending the energy to remember something. But if it is a royal pain in the ass to look something up, eventually your brain will just be \"alright, fine, I'll remember it because I don't want to have to bother looking it up again\".This is part of why any kind of self-testing where you look at the answers right away sucks. Your brain will be \"whatever, I'll just get it wrong and then I get to see the answer\". Where if it is more like \"I'm going to sit in this goddamn chair as long as it takes to get it right\" you'll start to get better at actually putting your brain to work.This is one of the reason actual honest to god paper books are actually really good for learning. They've got great info, but they slow you down and make looking up that information take a bit of time. That's actually really good for learners.",

Sometimes there are smaller job boards more focused on those areas and maybe others where you might have better luck assuming you haven’t been down this road already. I was unemployed with several years of experience for several years and ended up working in pharmaceuticals. I was able to automate things (usually side projects to my main job role) that they didn’t even think of because most folks didn’t have the skills. I emphasized those things on my technical resume which helped in finding other jobs. I ended up in political tech which has been much more satisfying and fulfilling than my time in traditional tech even if it pays less. These days I program in 4 different languages and get way more say in the design and ensuring the quality of the product than I ever did at past traditional tech companies and people value what I do much more.",

When you look at coding as another skill you have to do any job it becomes a “value add” for a potential employer. It is similar to how a degree in liberal arts isn’t about how well you can speak to classic literature or art history. It is a degree that *should* show that you know how to do research and writing. I got my BA in design and minored in marketing. I’ve been doing automation programming (mostly GUI based) for almost 20yrs. I use some elements of my degree when I write change orders, tech notes, and the rare times I need to write a scope of work, or design a UI. Similarly most of the code I deal with is just XML but on occasion I do need to dive into a Crestron module. Right now I’m writing Zoho scrips for a sales intake form for our sales teams.

When you merge, either you'll get a clean merge, or you'll get merge conflicts that need to be resolved.The key thing is that any new changes from the base branch may or may not matter for your feature development in that 4 day period. It depends. A major factor there is how orthogonal the team members are to one another. If people are working on completely different things that don't affect the other, then you could potentially defer merging the base branch into your feature branch until your feature branch is done, especially if it's pretty short-lived.Sometimes, you'll encounter merge conflicts when you attempt to merge the base branch into yours. Depending on what they are, I usually prefer to reconcile those sooner than later, just to not have that looming over my head, but even so, you could potentially hold off if they're not critical and don't affect how you develop the feature.In some cases though, even non-conflicting changes can be problematic, either in the sense that the code is no longer working (a semantic conflict, rather than a textual conflict), or they could just muck up your build in some way and force you to have to rebuild. In either case, if it doesn't affect how I'd build the feature, then I tend to defer merging until my feature is done, unless there's some good reason I should merge sooner.All that said, it's a judgment call, and ultimately you'll want to ensure that in the end you're merging quality work to the main branch that is well tested against the main branch's latest changes.",

But you should be committing and pushing often, and you don't want to push something incomplete into master.A minor change having a dozen pushes is perfectly fine. But if you always plush to master, and you've done work since you realized that feature you added broke something, removing it without removing the in between work is a pain. It's also harder to go back and figure it out.We branch from master when we start on a new major update. These usually are usually a very big deal - features being added. We don't merge a major into master until we end support - master holds the oldest version we support.When we patch, we branch off the major branch into a patch branch. So most of the time there will be master, major, and patch. There can be two major branches, though it's not common. When we release a patch we merge it into the major, so that doesn't get cluttered.When a developer starts working in something, they branch from, usually, the patch branch. When they're happy they submit a pull request so someone else can review it, then merge once approved.This makes it very easy to keep things organized. If you need to pause work on one incomplete task, you can just swich branches, do what you need to, switch back and, if needed, rebase to bring in the thing you stopped to work on.And commit often. Lots of commits make it easy to change your mind and go back to something you did earlier. It also makes it easier to put notes into a pull request, and to see what you have been doing.",

It may feel like you're hitting a wall all the time and making the same mistakes over and over again - but recognising that you're making mistakes is what will enable you to learn.

        "body": "Just my two cents... it's important for kids interested in programming to understand that it's not all (or even mostly) about cool graphics and 3d shooters. Personal experience. One daughter who really loved \"programming\" in scratch took a Python class and decided coding wasn't for her. She'd made some really fun stuff in Scratch, with graphics she drew herself, but there's quite a bit more to programming than dragging little boxes around. Don't get me wrong, the understanding kids can get from a tool like Scratch is helpful for things like understanding program flow and conditionals, but \"real\" programming--even game programming--isn't like that. I don't know how your particular nine-year-old is wired, but seeing what's involved in actual code couldn't hurt, IMO. So it's a chance to see if he's really interested. And plenty of kids play Minecraft, which isn't peak graphics, so I wouldn't focus too much on that.I think picking something relatively straightforward is a good plan. You might also make sure that you understand how all the libraries you'll be using work and have maybe tested them out a little (in case you've forgotten something since the last times you used them). It can be boring for a kid to sit and watch while you try to figure out how pygame's init module works.",

In Europe/US as far as I know, Python, C# and Java are still pretty common, Go, JS and Ruby (and rust) exist, but at different and lower frequencies, I have seen only very few Kotlin backends, even though I love how it is done in the language. If you want real numbers, go on job portals in your area, and look through a few hundred backend jobs. (Yes, it will take 2-3 hours, but you will have an accurate answer, which did not come from the subjective, 2 years out of date experience of someone from germany)2. I mean... Not sure what you mean? A Backend REST (or GraphQL) API will work for any frontend, as long as that frontend can do network requests. You can use the same backend for a python Frontend, a JS Webapp and an embedded C controller, and I have done so in the past. 3. You will have to learn the concepts of backend. This is not optional, and will be about the same amount of work for all of the options listed above. But once you know how it works and how to set it up, it works pretty much the same in every framework (+/-, different things will be included, there wil be different names and slightly different details). If you know what middleware is, or how a request/a form is handled, you can migrate frameworks pretty easily. If you don't know those things, you can't really work productively in teh backend. 4. I don't think that there is a huge difference between languages/frameworks here. If you want to shorten it, use a language you already know. (So I guess Java or Kotlin, if you come from Android). I have built a toy project in Kotlin, but never anything in Java. I can't really give you advice there.",

The issue is on the apple side of things, to develop apps for iphone, you either learn swift, or you learn a cross platform framework.In java you have ionic, i'm sure there's something similare with kotlin.Or you go with react native if you chose the JS route.There's also dart and flutter, but the problem is how little is the job market for this particular tech stack.There's also C# if you want to build video games with unity, but that's not my domain",

I kind of suck in putting the button in the middle of a div or whatever. Styling stuff is not my thing. I can get it done but I would prefer a backend task.Just being a frontend developer will limit your options. Yes, there ARE jobs for frontend developers but in general it is more likely to find a job as a person who can do both backend and frontend.But if you did not mean frontend but web applications/services then focusing on that is a fine and valid choice. Sure, the job market is saturated with web application developers and you have to stand out of the dozens or hundreds of other fresh graduates, to get hired. How will you do that is up to you. Will you work on your portfolio, will you try to get an internship, will you start as a freelancer, or something else? You choose. But you do have to push harder to be able to stand out.

To do this you'd need to take some more advanced math (college-level linear algebra and statistics, at a minimum) plus many more of the college CS courses would be quite relevant and important. For this type of job, many applicants will have Master's degrees.A level up from that would be doing AI research - coming up with new models and algorithms.

I could list a bunch of stuff I believe are important to know, but more than likely, miss quite a few in the process.A more broad answer is that the fact that you are aware of gaps in your knowledge is a great place to start! If you find yourself unaware of why an implementation is done the way it is - investigate it! Many of the frameworks you're using are likely Open Source, and likely developed in the open, with open issues, RFCs, etc. that describe exactly the sort of information you're missing.Now I don't know your skill level, so I don't know if you are well adept in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP, etc. But I would add that you should know what the frameworks you're using are doing for you. If it is a frontend UI framework - your first question should be \"Why am I using this?\", \"What problem is this framework solving for me?\" If your answer is \"because this guide tells me to\", then that's an issue.Understanding basic design patterns is also something I consider to be quite important. Sadly I think many traditional methods of showcasing these patterns are quite poor in terms of teaching the way one can internalize the patterns and use them - even if programming in a different language than the one being used to show examples in, and even if the implementation details differ to the way the patterns are shown.So, to summarize, my take is that the fact you're asking questions is half the way to progressing, now you just need to look for the answers. Mastering all of this is a craft, and it is ever evolving. But if you want to look past the frameworks as \"the stuff you learn\" and get to \"I use them to solve specific problems\", you need to be painfully aware of exactly what those problems are. This is also the only way you will ever gain a proper understanding of when to switch to a different framework. Remember this industry moves fast, most of the frameworks in use now either didn't exist or were quite new 10 years ago, and going back 10 more year will yield the same result. But knowing all of the fundamentals, as well as how and why the frameworks evolved as they did - that will always be relevant.",

Then at the beginning of my work day, I decided to google keywords for my problem, and there it was, the solution to my problem, which was a program that did what I wanted to do for the past week, and it finished in less than an hour. I might not remember the exact specifics of my problems, but I remember what got me to the solution, which was to search for keywords rather than my entire problem, (e.g instead of ‘migrating from cloud database to local database to backup’, I searched ‘backup cloud database’ ) usually helps you find the solution you want much faster. So, while you might feel that it was dumb not looking in the obvious place for your issue, you now know, if this problem arises in the future you know where to look first, and to take it a step further, whenever you find something that’s not showing up, instead of redeploying, you first check the configurations needed for it to show.

What information do they need to communicate? What tech stacks will they use?\\* Once you've got that all figured, write the smallest sliver of one part of it that can possibly be tested.\\* Then write another small sliver that connects to the first one you created, see if they work together.\\* They probably won't work together, so rewrite as needed.\\* Repeat until you have a big enough chunk of functionality you can show/demo to see if it actually meets your requirements.\\* Revise your requirements as needed, write more tiny pieces of functionality, test them with everything else, rewrite, repeat.Anyways, don't be afraid of scrapping code and starting over.

Mostly small scale and/or personal projects right now, but I have experience with medium sized project (50 devs, over 1k active users, < tens of millions of datapoints)There is not one perfect order. This is the first decision you will have to make: Where do you start, and what project style do you go with.Since I am currently building a one man project, I can give you the order of operations as I did it:1. Rough outline: What is my project? Why would people care? What problem does it solve? What solutions are already available? Who are the potential users?2. Feature list: Itemized list of all features it should have. For each Feature I wrote down for whom it is useful, and what I need to to technically to get it to work. (Networking, database, things like that)3. Feature details: I then added something similar to user stories to my features: Basically, short descriptions of how a user would interact with it, and what they would expect to happen/see. On my whiteboard, I then drew a lot of boxes, denoting my features, and connected them with arrows: \"Feature A needs Feature B\", or \"Feature C leads to Feature D\"4. I took everything I've built up to this point, and made UI mockups. First \"wireframes\" with a pen and paper, to roughly block out what could go where. then I made a single page in detail, to decide on a style for my UI. With those two in hand I went to some potential users, and used them to \"test\" my idea. I put the papers in front of them and asked them to perform a task (and I ended each test session by letting them choose a few tasks themselves) This resulted in me changing quite a few of my designs and intended workflows. It is good to catch errors as early and cheaply as possible. Changing the blockout version of a site costs a few hours in drawing, changing a coded version would take days or weeks.5. Then I sat down with my new UI and double checked, that all planned features are present, and that all parts of the UI are part of a planned feature. If not, I adjusted either side until I was happy. Then I used my feature List to plan my tech stack (yes, I did it this late in the game) Now I knew everything I wanted my (web)app to do and what it needed to do. So I chose rust(leptos) frontend, rust(axum) backend and postgresQL as my database. (shocker)6. With my new tech stack in hand, I made some rough diagrams of the architecture of the front and backend, something like a UML diagram, but much less formal. (because I am alone, as long as I can guarantee that I understand it, it's fine, and I have been using the same \"almost-UML\" since year 2 of university) I also mapped out the DB, but in excruciating detail, every nullable field, every relationship. Then I double checked again, that every feature, both in the UI and my docs, is present in my database.7. Then I started implementing a vertical slice: Meaning a single feature, from the DB to the UI, \"fully\" functional. I took this to even more testers, got feedback and did a final round of adjustments to my UI style plan.8. This is where I am now: I am currently implementing version 1 of my app, in it's entirety. This will be interrupted by testing with real users from time to time, but I am hoping that no major issues will come up, and I am confident that my architecture is strong enough to support refactoring most features.This is not \"the best\" way. But I was bitten by agile too often in the past, so for my free time, I wanted something a little more waterfally. I am certainly not moving as fast as I could, and if I was dependent on external funding, this might not be a path I could afford; but since it's only my spare time, I chose to take the time and try to get it right the first time. If I get it 75% right, I will be more than happy.EDIT: I forgot Step 0: I actually built a prototype. The UI was shit, and I only had 10% of my final featureset, but I wanted to see if the \"demand\" was there. It is. The UI was built sloppily over a few weeks with no plan, and was very unmaintainable. I learned a lot about the domain though, so it's not wasted time, it made my second attempt so much easier and better.",

Some of the best code is dumb simple understandable code, not big fancy machinery.",

Nail down the frontend with dummy data, then start on modeling data for backend to connect it. I do this when learning a frontend framework for the first time, for instance. And I’ve done all backend first, just boring little unit tests, inching forward one little piece of functionality at a time. Modeling all the data just so, then UI.The latter is my preferred way when all said and done. But there is no right answer.

Maybe not. You should expect to have to rewrite parts of your code as you discover errors in previous assumptions, find better ways to do things, find that your requirements change, or whatever else comes along. That's why you try to have strong separation of concerns and loose coupling between well defined functions (and architectural layers) that can be swapped out at a later dateI would generally advise writing an end-to-end solution as early as possible, including installing your app on an iPhone/iPad to prove that it works in the wild.A good starting point for an architecture is to separate your app into 3 separate layers: data, business logic, and presentation logic. The data and business logic would be in the 'M' (model) of an MVC architecture, while the presentation logic would be in the 'V' (view).Try to think about how easy it would be to swap the components within one of those layers for other components with minimal impact on the rest of the app. The fewer changes you have to make to interfaces between layers, the more decoupled they are.> Can someone please breakdown their typical workflow, do you start with back-end? ground level framework stuff, and then work your way up to re-usable shared features that can nest into full components later?If you imagine your architectural layers as being stacked one on top of the other, with the data layer at the bottom and the presentation at the top, then my approach is to design the architecture from the top down, then again from the bottom up, then finally once more from the top down.I start from the top because that's where the user lives, and it's the user experience that will drive the app. There's always a bit of tension between the the best implementation for the UI and the best implementation for the data, and that tension has to be resolved somewhere in the middle (e.g. at the API); so once you've established your data models from the perspective of the user, it helps to look at the system again from the perspective of the models, make sure you've established the best way store and query those models, then see how your UI will interact with those models. With your new understanding of how the data will be modelled, you might find a better design for the UI, or at least refine how your UI interacts with the models.",

Ces frameworks sont relativement simples à prendre en main, et avec des tutos, tu vas vite progresser !

The project should be like Lego, and you should be able to swap in and out its different pieces, I’d say. Knowing what each programming language is best for is important; they are tools. If time isn't a problem for you, I would even consider checking out C++. And absolutely a must is learning Python. In my current project process, I use C#, TypeScript, Python, C++, Rust, and Go.

There's really more harm done by misunderstanding or forcing others to look things up, than what you are saving.Preferred language by whom? Why do you care? If you're already at a school, shouldn't you just do what your teachers recommend? Specific tech stacks don't matter at all, you're getting a degree to learn how to think, not how to use languages.Data structures and algorithms are often taught in pseudocode because the principle mattes, not the implementation. Sometimes metaphors are used like lightbulbs or searching a phonebook, etc. Nevertheless, the C language is often used for more practical examples because it is barebones. There's not much high-level fluff and it feels closer to the actual memory implementation, which sometimes makes it feel more relevant to learn about sorting algorithms when working directly with raw arrays. A language like Python works just the same, but the ecosystem around it will throw high-level standard libs in your face, which already take care of all data structure and algorithms for you, so it feels more pointless than a lower level language.I've never heard that C++ or Java would be preferred for learning DSA, why would they? C++ is like C, just with classes and more high-level features, which aren't applicable when learning about the fundamentals. Java is a memory-managed high-level language similar to C#, therefore still in the root vein of C, but with many more features, all which are irrelevant for DSA.Use whatever your teachers/mentors know best to reduce the friction of setting up any environments or getting stuck on syntax features. Then ignore the language and learn computer science, it goes a far longer way than any single language.",

You’re keen on typescript and react, great that’s your frontend sorted. So do both. You want to make a web app which will have to do something or talk to something. Ideally just throw together an api to process the front ends requests. Front end should be light and the backend should be the brains of the operation. Probably just put something together with node so you can see the full end to end experience. Start with data early if you’re gonna do it. Don’t just throw things in a json file if you’re planning on using a database later. If you want a db soon just use SQLite and swap it out when it becomes inconvenient. That’s a full web app right there using both technologies you mentioned. Do that right and you’ve kick started your cv. Of course throw in version control (git) and unit testing and you’ve got everything you need. A little bit of docker compose to run both front end and back together… Personally as someone that started my JavaScript knowledge with typescript, I’ve found it hurt me more to an helped me. I would suggest doing everything without typescript so you get a good understanding of what JavaScript really is, and then learn typescript separately. It feels like trying to learn how to sing before you know how to speak. It complicates things. Your call though. Very doable.",

So, if you know how a hash table works, if you know how to explain binary search in detail, if you can visualize the call stack when doing recursive binary search or merge sort, then I think you're good to go and you shouldn't worry if you forget syntax. If you forget the underlying concept, then I think you should just try to practice more by yourself and force yourself to think. So, if you get an exercise that says \"sort this array using bubble sort\", then instead of just using the memorized bubble sort implementation that you have in your head and then going to your code editor, instead open up a notion document or a google docs and write pseudocode or go to excalidraw and draw some diagrams to visualize bubble sort with 0 code so that you can make sure that before you implement it in your programming language of choice that you actually understand the concept and you're not just using the memorized implementation of bubble sort that you saw in a course. That's usually what I like to do, make sure I can analyze and explain the concept BEFORE I implement it in code.",

The features available in ARM7 aren't so overwhelming that you need to worry about advanced instructions you'll find in x86.As for fundamentals you want to make sure you understand - try to find some good resources that explain registers, addresses accumulators - it might be easier to start with a simpler microprocessor like an 8051/Z80, just to keep things simple and not overwhelm yourself. A lot of universities would start with M68k, which I think is too complex to throw people at as a very baseline beginner architecture.",

If you're told to find the factorial of 1, it also can't help you, because there is no simpler problem.So write your program in a way that solves the problem, given that it has the magical other function to help: def fac(n): if n == 1: return 1 return n * magic(n-1)Then, just replace \"magic\" with your own function name, and you're done!",

At university in a single semester I built a raytracer in C++, had a hacking course in python and a parallel computing course in Java. It's okay. if you switch projects too often, they are probably too big. Start smaller, like go over old advent of code assignments for example. Then build something small: a calculator, tic tac toe, a web scraper that notified you when a certain youtube channel uploads. You are allowed to choose a new language for every project, but you must set a max amount of concurrent projects (I suggest 3), not switch the language during a project, and finish all of them",

You could compare/contrast the two. You could even make a blog post about if there's interesting differences.

Maybe there's psychological techniques you could apply or something?",

I would strongly advice to NOT find random tutorials, walkthroughs etc. to help you with this. The main skills you want to accomplish solving these problems goes (IMO) something like this:1. Creative thinking: How should I even tackle this problem? When I think of \"create a program that does X, Y, Z\" - which subproblems does X, Y and Z actually consist of. This is a skill that you cannot really read your way towards, you have to DO it. If you find yourself stuck it is of course alright to look for solutions to subproblems, but again I would avoid copy/pasting code, look for general ideas you can apply to the problem solving at hand. 2. Just experience writing and debugging code. This is another area where reading the answers just don't help. You need to learn the error messages of whatever tool you're using and how they relate to problems in your code. This is probably the most frustrating part of all of this, as sometimes it can take hours only to realise it was some small silly thing that was wrong. But just to give an example of what I think about here (I don't know if this is still the case or not), but back in the day whenever reading error messages, regarding syntax, from PHP, usually the error was on the line above the one mentioned in the error message. Figuring out stuff like this, finding shortcuts for yourself in how to debug your code and general issues will enable you to write code for yourself. 3. You need some experience designing systems, as you become more and more skilled your systems will become bigger and probably more complex - and likely also more messy. I cannot remember how many years I wrote code before I was able to look back at code from just a year prior without thinking it was total crap. Nobody expects a junior to create beautiful architectured code, but you need to have experienced this epiphany of \"I wrote this, and it's trash, I should have done so and so\".Of course reading about code, be it design patterns, or something else entirely is also good. But you need to ensure that actually writing, debugging, testing code is the main part of what you spend your time on. I would suggest only reading for an explicit aim in solving something you are currently working on for the foreseeable future. It is very easy to fall into the trap of reading instead of doing and then thinking that you're becoming better book by book. You need to put what you're researching into practice, without it, it won't do you much good.Good luck in your adventures",

If you don't know any framework yet, just take the one with the biggest userbase / selection of tutorials. That will make your start easier, and switching a framework later really is not that hard. It's just like learning your first programming language feels hard, because you are actually learning programming. Once you pick up your second language, it will go pretty fast, and your third language won't even take an entire weekend to start getting productive. Same goes for frameworks: Once you know how a backend is structured, they are all pretty much the same. (They are solving the same problem, and there are only so many ways to do that) So I would suggest, staying in JavaScript (although it pains me to see it used in the backend), and choosing the framework with the best community support. There are a lot of alternatives, and you probably should use many of them at least for one project, until you feel you've found something you like. Python has Flask, Django and FastAPI (among many more), PHP has Laravel and CakeSomething? I think. .NET, Kotlin, Java all have some, Go is great for backend, and although personally I really enjoy axum in rust right now, that is really hard to get into for beginners.",

I say in your area because it does drastically change depending on when you live! JavaScript is often miserable for employment, especially if you are BE only.\\- If your goal is to learn some stuff, I would stay with JS/Express. You are already familiar with JS, so you can learn the server-side concepts more easily without having to relearn the language. But learning comes in any shape, so it would also be perfectly fine to switch to a different language if you want to.\\- If your goal is to become a full-stack dev with a decent developer experience, definitely stay in the JS ecosystem. This way you will be able to leverage both the fe and the be to a very high degree while writing the same code, reusing types, etc. With time, you will probably move to Next or some other full stack framework instead of express.Notice that I answered your question regarding JavaScript in general. Thats because the specific technology doesn't matter in your case. Yes, express is minimal and somewhat outdated, but its perfectly fine, and even great, at teaching you concepts and getting you started. You will shift your stack and ways of writing code a million times, but fundamentals stay.",

Learn as much as you can from the school program and try some of the stuff you are interested in.I get what you mean by *\"wanting to work on more advanced stuff\"* but from my perspective, programming and computer science in general is much like a skill tree. You can dive deep into the various branches or dabble a little in each. But all of them have to start from some basic fundamentals.C and C++ are in my opinion great languages to start with because they are:1. Simple and syntax and flow2. Imperative so you don't need to concern yourself with complicated design patterns just yet!3. Much lower level languages compared to some more modern languagesIt essentially forces you to understand how things are handled and how they work. Which hopefully will help inform you on what the best design practices are even when you move on to higher-level languages and frameworks which abstracts away many of the boilerplate or underlying logic.Things like Machine Learning, Deep learning or even Game development are complex fields, so don't worry if they seem confusing or out of reach! If you want to work on a project in C and C++ that sort of forces you to work with both the language and the system you are using: Try implementing your own custom terminal shell! *(I know its not as flashy as a game or building a website but the terminal is one of the most fundamental tools programmers use)* It gets you used to it and helps build of a lot of fundamentals.",

        "body": "I remember that. I like Qt Creator and Godot for letting me drag stuff around. But I do not like to work on other people's projects in those things.There are a few fundamental tradeoffs here:The code is the truth. Whatever the wysiwyg editor makes must translate to code. Whatever the code says must be presentable by the wysiwyg editor. This usually breaks down as soon as you do something with the code that the wysiwyg editor can not handle, like some custom widget for example. To make that work you have to write extra code just to make the wysiwyg editor compatible with your code again.On the flip side a lot of the frontend code has structure that the wysiwyg editor can not show. DOM has a box model that doesn't allow you to simply drag/drop a button anywhere. The only way to do that is to position it with absolute. You wouldn't do that because it breaks responsiveness with different view-ports. Instead you would work with padding, margins, grid layouts etc to get the desired effect - but the wysiwyg cannot show that. It can only hint at that.This in turn usually leads to people who're used only to the wysiwyg editor to forget about the underlying structure. There's plenty of precedent for that. LaTeX for example is about code representing structured text and styles to render headlines differently than normal text, Microsoft Word simply allows you to make text large and bold to emulate a heading. But the loss of structure also means you can't do the other stuff LaTeX can do like creating content listings and reducing page breaks immediately after headings. Designers who create mockups in Figma _can_ do really great work, or they can simply slap some shapes there and call it a day. But since the code will be the truth eventually, someone has to translate those shapes into the structure anyway.Lastly, the people who work with code all day have a different problem than the people who rely mainly on wysiwyg editors. Graphical user interfaces are about discoverability of features and a quick preview of the final product. Material pipelines in Blender for example work very well as boxes connected with wires. Code has about information density, and is easier to work with. No graphical tool can fit as much information on a screen as well written text. Copy and pasting text works between tons of editors, but copy and pasting graphical elements only works in the same tool. You can check text into version control and get diffs or even move detection, that doesn't work for graphical elements unless it compiles to text first.",

Find some information on these topics and then try to turn that information into working code. The things you create don't need to be big projects. Simple things will do, but it is important that you fully understand everything you create. That understanding is what is difficult, as you may have to spend time researching the bits that you don't understand.But if you do this for month, you should find you are suddenly getting confident in these topics.At that point, once you have that confidence, that is would be the perfect time to start looking for more advanced topics to learn.

This is connected to the fact, that the frontend is very visual. The backend works on data: You get a request, you react to that request ba returning data of some kind, often after running multiple layers of checks (authentication, authorization) and fetching data from a database. You might like both, but I would still suggest that you stay with frontend for a while, at least until you are pretty well rounded there. Afterwards you can try backend and decide, if you want to pursue both (fullstack) or even switch over to backend. You seem to have the best learning strategy already figured out: 1. learn a little bit of theory2. apply that theory and incorporate everything else you already know3. repeatIf you want something with a set curriculum, go take a look at the odin project [https://www.theodinproject.com/](https://www.theodinproject.com/) . I have not taken it myself, but I have heard good things. The Foundations -> JavaScript Path looks good to me.

Then it's not as straightforward, but very possible and quite easy to figure out where the data is coming that you actually want to search using your browser's dev tools. Say you're visiting funerals.com or whatever, but the site actually fetches its data from funerals.com/funerals?start=2025-10-24&end=2525-10-25 and populates the website dynamically.Now you have the API (application programming interface) endpoint and you can just fetch that data instead of the whole website.Once you have that working, you can look into cronjobs or scheduled tasks, if you're on windows, to make your script run automatically at specified times and then look into notifications.

In this case, an API might consist of something like a web request to `api.localfuneralhome.com/deathNotices` that returns only the list of recent deaths. The alternative is just requesting the whole user-facing contents of `localfuneralhome.com`, which you'd then have to scrape the notice info from.I would be surprised if local funeral homes support this kind of API, but you never know. If it does exist, it'd be a lot more straightforward, but I wouldn't spend too much time looking into it. If the info is available on a web page, web scraping should get you there either way, albeit with a bit more effort on your end.",

For me it starts with my planning and it follows through what I’m doing as I work, so if I get pulled away to something else or pick up a project again after a while I have detailed note on what I was doing and (maybe more importantly) what I want to do. notes.txt: this file is just for my revision and work, I don’t share it with anyone. 1) Concept. I start by explaining the idea of what I want to do and what I might need to make it. Brief 4-5 lines as an intro to the project2) Aims and Objectives. Here I detail exactly what I want and what it needs to be a success. This help keep things on track and prevent scope creep as I can always focus on what I really need and the real objectives in the background. 3) Plan. First through rundown of how I think I’ll build it. You don’t need to be exact on every detail but figure out what you’re going to need. Login section, landing page, diff options, processing input for ‘x’ or ‘y’ and how it’s done/what the out put should be. 4) Components. List out the big bits you need to do. Parts that need to be put together with key functions and features. It’s to track that plan you did earlier and figure out what needs to be done at a glance. 5) Variables Functions libraries and Header files. List out all the variable you’re using and why you use them, do the same for function. Very basic ones can just be named with type, you don’t need an explanation but if you won’t know at first glance what it does write it out. What are we importing from this library. Why did we make that header file and what’s in it/how does it work. Keep updating as you move along6) Working journal. This one might branch into a different file depending on the size of the project. Start the project, write out what you need to do first and what you’re planning to work on. I usually put the date in but that’s just for me to be able to look back over it. Every day I start by bringing unfinished tasks forward and writing out the next set of tasks I need to finish. Copy across what you’re doing and what’s not working and the final version when it is. Anything important or interesting I need to note for later goes in here. “Had to scrap an entire section and restart it”, throw that in here and explain why. At the end of the session I list out what I did today and what I need to do on the next session (cuts back 10-15 min of figuring out where to start when you sit down next time). 7) Closing Brief. I usually move this up after the objective section once I’m finished. How did the project go? Did you achieve your goals? What was difficult how did you get around it? What would you like to improve further? And finally are you happy with the finished product? 8) Lessons learned, at the end of the file, where did you go wrong and what do you know now about doing “x”, “y” or “z” for next time. .Read Me file:After the project I’ll make the read me file. 1) Update the Concept, Aims, Components and Brief so I have a concise document that anyone I share the project with will be able to understand what’s going on and why it’s built this way. 2) Features:Detail what the project takes in and what the intended out puts should be. If it’s an API detail the call and expected output if it’s a web app follow a trace of how the user progresses through the app. Think of it as a guide on how someone else should use the application. 3) Components:List out the key functions and methods, how they work and how you’ve used them. No need for major details just let people know why it’s important and what you were thinking with it. 4) Closing Statement:Detail what you achieved in making this application. What needs more work and whether you intend to come back and work on anything else. .It’s a good habit to start tracking your projects as you go along even just for your own notes. When you look back at this in 6 months or 2 years are you going to know what you were thinking on April 3rd when you need to fix/plan around a similar issue in the future. The notes.txt file is just for me and I usually put it in the gitignore. It’s helped out in interviews when I was asked to walk through some of my work I’ll pull up my notes file and can quickly find key details on what I was doing and how I did it. I’ve shared my screen to show some of the details or pulled up A specific part of my journal where I figured out a problem. Really helps to have actual example of what you did and how you processed the problem before finding the solution. You can also then say “Well I know about this library now that fixes this for me but I could build it myself again if I needed to”. Very small concept projects or feature test I don’t do this out. It’s only for projects I might show people or a 10 min glance wouldn’t explain what’s going on. Sorry a lot in that comment but that’s how I do it.",

Just look up Triangle Numbers.But is it possible the input doesn’t follow that interpretation of a “sequential number” and could be 234? Or 1679? If so, that formula won’t help you and you likely do need a loop. Since they’re not allowing you to cast to a string you need a mathematical solution. One that loops through each “place” (1s place, 10s place etc) and gets each value to sum together.IMO the question as you’ve described it above is a little ambiguous but I’m not sure if that’s how it was presented to you verbatim or not.",

So, there is this function f and when you use different inputs, you get different outputs.|i|f(i)||:-|:-||1|1||12|3||123|6||1234|10||12345|15||and so on||That means there's a function \"g\" that also returns f(i) but you instead only insert the last digit of \"i\". f(123) = g(3) = 6 f(1234) = g(4) = 10 and so onlet's say that \"g\" takes \"n\". So, i = 123, n = 3, and the result is 6.As you explained, it is n+1 more than g(2). In this case n is 2 and 2+1 is the 3 from above. The last number to add is just \"n\". However, there's a trick. More on that later.You could use recursion here, but that's not necessary. But just for fun:g(4) = 4 + g(3) Or more generally (for natural numbers): g(1) = 1 g(n) = n + g(n-1)Now it's just simple maths. I hope you like maths.g(n) = n + g(n-1) g(n) = n + (n-1) + g(n-2)g(n) = n + (n-1) + (n-2) + g(n-3) If n is 4 then g(n-3) = 1 g(4) = 4 + (4-1) + (4-2) + g(4-3) = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1OK, so far it checks out. But that didn't help. So let's so some more analysis:1 12 123 1234 12345That looks like a triangle. So, it's like a right-angled triangle with a side length of 5. Duplicate and flip it:1 54321 12 4321 123 321 1234 21 12345 15 rows with 6 digits. f(5) = 5\\*6=30 But we copied the triangle, so f(5) = 30/2 = 15It works with",

        "body": "I mean, this just sounds like a random selection of buzzwords to me. You should always start with the question: What are my requirements? Otherwise, if you just spam \"corporate tech stack\" things, you will end up like this: [https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition) (yes, the joke is 10 years old, and still relevant today)Just as comments to your list: 1. all of this seems okay and important, for most java/spring backends2. Why? I mean, microservices CAN be great, but they always increase complexity, both to develop and to deploy. If you can't give enough good reasons as to why you need microservices, a monolith might be better. 3. I don't know what you mean by \"completely\"? It is probably not necessary to learn postgresql \"completely\" (that would take a loooong time), because in all seriousness: your app will most likely not need 100% of all possible performance out of your database. Even if everything you write is 10x slower than possible, it will still be more than fast enough in reality. 4. Monolith is simpler, Microservices scale differently and can do a clean separation of concerns. Monolith should be your default!5. afaik you can just deploy docker images to kubernetes, no? My understanding is, that kubernetes is just a more fancy way of managing deployed images, and stuff, but I am not very experienced in deployment. 6. Again, why do you need this? Ci/Cd sounds good on paper, but especially the CD part adds a lot of complexity to your deployment phase. If you can't articulate, why, default to a normal, manual deployment whenever you think a release is ready. 7. Cloud is just an invisible server. You can get a VPS for very cheap, which doesn't run the risk of increasing your cloud bill into the stratosphere, if you use too many CPU cycles. Start there. As with CI/CD and Kubernetes, this is really not a developer issue. It's a deployment and DevOps issue. At small scales, you can do it yourself, but you really don't need a lot of complexity, and when you are working at a company, there will be a separate position for this. 8. This is legitimately the most important point on your list for a developer, and there is no single correct answer. As with all design decisions, there are a lot of possible tradeoffs. While I don't have a good book for that handy, I would suggest reading up on your favourite API Design (REST for example), because much ink has probably been spilled about that topic. Also: experience. Just build some APIs and see what works, and what gives you more issues in the long run, when you try to refactor a new feature for example. 9. So, this is complicated: Most backend system have a proper event system / observer pattern thing going, like flask or axum both have pretty good signals internally. As long as you build a monolith, this is really good and should definitaly be used. Kafka is just a way to send signals over multiple microservices, which CAN be useful, or it can just add more unnecessary complexity! As with everything else that adds complexity, start with the assumption, that you should not use kafka, unless you can articulate why you need it!",

You can practice by coding, and by doing stuff, that helps you switch abstraction levels (which you can also learn best by coding imo). The important thing is: no one can have an accurate mental model of 10k lines of code, and that is pretty tame as far as big codebases go. In the last corporate project I worked on, we had 3 main (and several smaller) microservices with about 30k-60k loc each. So instead of memorizing files, I learned the structure of the project. When I was asked, where to find a feature, I could then think through it logically. This only works, if your project is internally consistent, so if you have every piece of code placed correctly. For example, we had all models in a folder, all endpoints in a folder, with subfolders for very large collections of endpoints, all validation code was together, all signals where in a single folder, and so on. At that point, it's just like following a map: \"Okay, you want to know about the bookmarking function for an article. Let's open all models regarding bookmarks and articles, the endpoints files, the signals and start looking if we can find what we are looking for anywhere in there.\"",

Requests look like this: GET https://www.domain.tld/api/user/17 to get a user with the id 17, orPOST https://www.domain.tld/api/post/5/commentto create a new comment under post number 5. The data for the new comment would be transferred in the body. You should read up on REST APIs in general.

Advanced courses in Algorithms and Data Structures give you a wide knowledge of how and why different algorithms work, which is useful for the same reason as leetcode3. Do mock competitions. Start with things you already know. Start easy and work your way up like a double linked list, a heap, a red-black-tree (they are tricky to get 100% right). Write your own tests or search for a testing set online, they should exist for most common algorithms. When you feel comfortable with simple tasks, go online and search for problemsets. There are really a lot. Advent of code is also a fun way to train. It's not too hard, but if you take it seriously, you can definately get practice.",

The idea is to keep your problems small or break them up into smaller pieces. It is also easier to understand code when written this way. You can trust the small methods to work since they have a simple goal. And if there's a bug in one, it is much easier to resolve",

        "body": "As a college graduate - I don't care what language you learned in college.Introductory materials only teach you the grammar and syntax. You're not learning how to USE the language, and they're not teaching you problem solving skills. Your programming classes give you some context for your other classes - computation theory, DSA, applied mathematics... It also gives you some exposure - this is the job, staring at a screen, walls of text, arbitrary decisions, bastard bugs. Is this something you want to do all day, every day, for the next 45 years?When you graduate, your education didn't finish, it only just begun. You don't pop out an expert. The end of college is only the beginning of the rest of your life. WE KNOW you don't know shit. THAT is why we hire junior developers - not because you're cheap, not because we couldn't afford a senior, but because juniors tend to multiply the force of a senior, because we can mold you into what you need to be successful here.I'll bet when you're done with this semester you couldn't actually tell me what OOP even is or adequately demonstrate it. It's not a judgement on you - all programming and college courses are saturated with dogmas and traditions. They call it an OOP course but don't actually teach it, typically because your professors don't actually know, either.So when you graduate, your programming experience isn't terribly relevant. C++, Python... What I need to know is how you think, if you can learn and adapt. Can I mold you into the person I need here to solve our problems? Ostensibly, the answer is \"yes\", so the major difference between you and another candidate is not what you \"know\", but the aptitude you both demonstrate. Obviously I'm going to hire the one with the greater potential, insofar as my hiring process can deduce. We don't have great tools for this - your GPA is SOMETHING but only tells a particular kind of story. It can mean you can learn a lot and make connections, or it can mean you can memorize the material long enough to ace a test. So GPA alone isn't enough. Your personality also counts for something - can I see myself working with you for the next 5 years? Are you going to mesh well with the personality of the team? You don't have to be smarter than the other guy to be the better fit.Once you get hired here, we'll teach you what you need to know to be successful. So don't sweat it. If you're hired, it means you're good enough, you've got the right stuff, and that we want to build you up and see you succeed. We know that's going to take time.Watch out for puppy mills - places that want junior graduates to also paradoxically have 3-5 years experience. That's not junior, that's not entry level. Also, if a company doesn't hire you - they're doing you a favor. Often it's because it's not a good fit - and that there is a TWO-WAY street. You DO NOT want to work for a place you don't fit in, that kind of misery WILL take years off your life.So focus on your fundamentals, your problem solving skills, and your joy of the craft. A good GPA won't hurt, either. Very quickly, the programming language fades away, and becomes a tool, a means to an end - you won't even see the code anymore. What you'll see is the problem before you, and your solution will be sculpted and painted - the epitome of elegance.",

One difference though in my experience is they would ask you a leetcode question of appropriate difficulty and first you do the abstracted solution(like c/c++ code) then they ask deeper and deeper levels to mostly digital electronics is where they stop. So they can ask c++ code -> assembly level( not to write but to point out to show knowledge) -> CPU instruction level -> talk cache, talk core parallelism etc. etc depending on job and level however this is mostly intership for me.Edit: TLDR In my experience you have to solve an algorithmic problem, usualy leetcode style, and then explain the details of the solution through the lens of hardware",

        "body": "Everything will be overwhelming. Don't learn how to very slowly move up from ToDo, but instead, how to find comfort in your discomfort. Falling back on familiar concepts to help learn new concepts is a great idea, but what you're doing now isn't learning new concepts. It's switching your tools to revisit a concept you're comfortable with. Your issue isn't needing a new language or framework, but to continue down a singular path, even when it gets difficult. That will expose your weaknesses. Only then can you see them for what they are and improve upon them. I'm a beginner, so I don't have any meaningful advice regarding what to do next, though. .Perhaps search up \"github (insert text here)\" repos that can help you get more project experience. Things like \"project based learning, how to build x, app ideas, beginner projects, intermediate projects.\"As you go through them, think of how you'd do things differently and do it. Think of an idea or two you can add, and attempt it. Think of how you'd add a new feature once you're done and get to starting. Don't copy line by line, but actually learn as you're interacting with them. if you can't do anything but copy line by line, then pause at certain points and see if you can recreate everything from scratch up to that point. If you can't remember, keep going through it until you can memorize it and understand why things are happening the way they are. Then, see if you can make small changes at this point.Get familiar with how they break down these big and difficult topics, then try to do so yourself with your own ideas. The moment you hit a roadblock trying to break it down, don't run away from it. Instead, confront it. What's the issue? Is it still too hard to code when you broke it down? You can't think of any other way to break it down or even start to break an idea down?That's a sign you need to research how others break down their ideas. Usually, when that wall is hit, it's a sign of a lack of knowledge on the subject. You can watch videos, read articles, check out docs, or follow a tutorial or lesson on that specific thing. Then, when you know enough about it, break it down more. When you break those things down but hit an early wall, repeat the process. Do this enough times until you get to a stage where you can build something yourself (or can follow a tutorial to build that sub idea). You should have a bunch of very broken down ideas that you can build up again, layer by layer. .During this, feel free to explore different book recommendations (there are github repos you can search online for that, too). Try to keep to one language if you can for everything..If all of this is still too much for you, perhaps try going through The Odin Project if you haven't. You may find some information/resources that you haven't considered. It ultimately wants to get you to the point you're at now, but with clarity on many of your doubts.",

From memory, these are drawn on the UML diagram using solid or dashed lines.The 'has a' relationship can also be of differing types, for example 'one to one', 'one to many', 'many to many' etc. Again, from memory, these can be captured on the UML diagram using circles, triangles and other symbols.The UML is just simple diagram that allows the OOD to be captured on a piece of paper. That is all there is to it.The harder part is learning the OOD itself, but that too is not overly complicated as it is about things like attributes, visibility, methods, abstractions, encapsulation, relationships, polymorphism etc.**EDIT**: I used properties in my description. Google suggests using the term attributes instead.",

For html and js it’s better to use webstorm, c++ is CLion and I think php is phpstorm specifically but you can also use php in webstorm. You can use plugins or use multiple languages sometimes in the same ide but they designed ide’s specifically for specific languages so you’ll have to research what to use best. Since you need an account and a license, your settings will sync over all jetbrains ide’s. As a student the ide’s are free to use, if you’re not than the licensing is still affordable with a package that you basically get all ide’s. You can buy seperate as well but I think it will be more expensive.",

Basically, learn what’s *underneath* Python and JS.Your Dobble generator is a great example of a dynamic project; absolutely do more like that, but start connecting it to other layers. Turn it into a small service with an API, database, or queue so you get experience with I/O, concurrency, and data flow.Piping data just means moving information between parts of a system instead of keeping everything in one function or variable etc.. That could be OS-level pipes (cat file | grep something), streaming data through your program (read → transform → write), or combining components: web server → worker → storage → response.

It won't build you a portfolio. You won't even use it in your daily work. So, forget that.It will be DSA vs web application development for you. Well, both are needed. And you'll need DSA also in web application development. You can learn both on the go. Have a DSA lesson and then try to make something practical with it by using web application development skills. And I do not talk about simple web pages where you need just HTML, CSS and some Javascript. I talk about web services.But if combining both is way over your head then pick DSA first.",

The only way to avoid DSA forever is if you only build stuff like tiny one-off websites that never get a lot of users.I think of it like pilots learning to land a plane in zero visibility, or doctors learning about rare illnesses. It's not that you use this knowledge every day - it's so that when it does come up, you need to be prepared.95% of my job is exactly what you say you like - building websites, backend systems, and so on. Most of the time DSA isn't relevant.But that 5% of the time when it is, I'm really glad I know it. I know what to do when we discover one part of the code is getting too slow, or when we need to walk all of the nodes in a nested data structure.In the real world, nobody cares if you have every possible case memorized. It's fine to Google it. But you need to understand the fundamentals so that you know what to look up and you know how to use the solution when you find it.It's true that leetcode problems in interviews can be annoying and many companies do it extremely poorly. Most of us just treat that as a necessary evil. Some people just avoid those interviews and there are companies that do technical assessments of coders without ever asking leetcode problems.Competitive programming shouldn't even be mentioned, it's extremely niche. 99% of working programmers have no interest in it.",

They’ll test your practical knowledge- things like frameworks, databases, APIs, debugging, and deployment- not abstract algorithmic puzzles.• Service-based companies (TCS, Infosys, Accenture, etc.):Here too, DSA generally isn’t a major focus. The hiring process revolves more around basic aptitude, communication, and fundamental programming or project knowledge.• Product-based companies (MAANG, etc.):For general SDE/SWE roles, DSA is very important. These roles are not tied to a specific tech stack. Once you’re in, you could be placed in any team- frontend, backend, infrastructure, data, or even something entirely new.That’s why they use DSA to evaluate your problem-solving ability and learning potential. If you can think logically and break down problems efficiently, you can adapt to any technology later.However, if you’re applying for a specific role (say, Android Developer, Data Engineer, ML Engineer, etc.), then the focus will shift more toward domain-specific concepts and tech skills. DSA might still appear in a few questions, mainly to gauge your logical thinking rather than deep algorithmic mastery.In short, you don’t need to become a DSA wizard unless you’re aiming for product-based companies’ general SDE roles- but you should still know the basics.Understanding arrays, linked lists, trees, recursion, backtracking, and a bit of dynamic programming will help you think more logically and write cleaner, more efficient code in any development role.",

If you want to have fun and explore maybe some more niche languages, then you might run into these situations, where you wish you had that one data structure that is appropriate for the situation. You might even find it interesting to write it yourself. And in very few jobs, you might even be given the chance to work with elegant but non-mainstream languages or technology stacks.Having a good grasp of data structures is and will remain respectable. For imperative data structures there is tons of code available online to work with though, and you need to know how to look up what you need and then you will be able to deal with the issue when it arises. It gets a lot more difficult to find good examples or even explanations for functional data structures. There is not that much literature, most lectures don't even touch the topic, and papers can be hard to follow/understand. That's already quite niche though.",

You're also bounding the array size, so it can't be larger than 100 elements, so we can instead create the array with a single static allocation like `int array[100] = { 0 };`. Unlike in Python, C won't check the boundaries for you, but now we know that anything trying to access `array[100]` is definitely an error.Your number handling logic may work (I didn't bother validating it), but it'd be much easier to validate if it was split into a function that took an array of N integers and sorted it according to the same rules. Then you can collect the input into an array, pass it into the sorting function to sort in-place, and write the results to stdout for the user.If you haven't yet, absolutely check out K&R (\"The C Programming Language\" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie) and \"Modern C\" by Jens Gustedt. They'll have everything you need to know about writing useful C code.",

If positive, set element at positive position and *decrement* positive position.You will end up with an array that contains all the negative values in correct order followed by all the positive values in reverse order, and your insert position variables tell you where the divide is.

So I put it aside and started reading a more beginner friendly book called \"C Programming Language: A Modern Approach\" by K.N King who does a great job at making C look fun. Additionally, I did check out K&R and although it is respected since it talks about the original C created in Bell Laboratories for the UNIX system, many people mention it as being outdated cause of the introduction of C99, is that true or does the book offer more than it is being said?",

So I’m kind of wondering if there is another better method to sort it?

There's not really a great use case for VLAs compared to just using `calloc(3)` when you need a dynamically allocated array of `N` items each `M` bytes large. There's not usually a significant amount of memory overhead for declaring an array of 100 ints if we know we need fewer. This can change if you start doing embedded development, but it's generally fine to have unused array space. Save worrying about memory usage and efficiency for after you're comfortable writing code in the language.2. Yeah, pointers are where things get tricky for most learners. You use them all the time in python and other languages without thinking though, like when you pass an instance of an object to a function, or use `self` in methods. C just doesn't hide those sorts of implementation details, so you have to learn them to be productive, otherwise you won't be able to solve certain problems efficiently.3. K&R may be technically outdated, but if you get the 2nd edition on ANSI C (first standardised version), it's still an excellent learning resource. Pointers will still be baffling at first, but once you start messing with them more it should start to make sense.Fun fact: your sort in place function would have to take a pointer argument, as it can't possibly recieve the unsorted array otherwise without it being a global variable. It should have a signature like `int sort_values(int *array, int list_length)` if you want to return a value indicating success/failure/already sorted or `void sort_values(int *array, int list_length)` to simply perform the sorting. You'd then call it like so: `sort_values(array, size);` after collecting input.",

The majority of early career devs I've seen have def degraded in skill and understanding over the years regardless if they're bootcamp, new grad, or \"self taught\".I'll ask questions about projects on their resume, not even technical assessments, just a discussion on their experience in a no-stakes setting, and they can't talk about it without wanting to pull up search or AI.Sometimes it's because they used AI and just accepted/copied what was given. Other times it seems it's because it's in their muscle memory: they get a question and, instead of listening to understand, they're listening to engineer a prompt. Instead of pulling from their pool of knowledge, they reach for the laptop. It can take 10-30 minutes to get the person into a frame of mind where they can remember and talk about their experiences instead of trying to give the \"right\" answer. At this point I'm thinking I need to make a meetup to help early career folks think like an engineer instead of a student. Fwiw I've helped engineers from self taught to \"elite school\" grads, early career to sr staff (but haven't interviewed in a while). I'm involved in my local community and talk with other engineers about their new hires. I've only got my anecdata to go on but it's a significantly more informative pool than what most people get exposed to.",

Some were some of the worst professionals and developers I ever worked with. Couldn’t function like basic people and do things like respond to emails. We had a very casual project with a client, and I was pretty terrified by some of the things they’d say. It was mostly over-promising. They got laid off before I could give feedback. I assume quite a few were not actually working. I don’t assume all new grads are bad, but a company needs to have some structure for them. Also, I laughed at people being passionate about a lifestyle and money rather than the subject matter. I can picture it though. Something that doesn’t make sense to me is students with a 2.0 GPA sprint be getting interviews, especially in a down market.",

I bitched out a Comcast representative one night in the car because I couldn't make a call during a normal time. Everyone in that company was super on edge.

To me anytime someone from a non FAANG company asks a leetcode question I just know they put 0 thought into their hiring process and probably have a revolving door of engineers. FAANG does it because they have 10s of thousands of applicants and teams etc. You are just copying them when you only have one product, you are not the same.Its like you said companies that don't ask leetcode or are smaller tend to pay less but they still pay well.

Pay is shitty but would you personally take a job with shitty pay for swe?I was at a private non-tech company in a non-tech city working on safety critical medical devices, think dialysis machines, for 15 years It was my first job at out school in 2006 and I made 42.5K. At the end I was leading teams of 20 SWEs on multi-year cross functional projects making 110K.People will ask, why didn't you leave? The answer was I was never good enough to find another job when I decided to start looking. The problem was my experiences didn't match the YOE or title at other companies.At the end of the day I was working at a non-tech company, their goal was pumping out features and meeting the bare minimum of FDA guidelines, not creating quality code. Lots of things I know tech companies do this company had no interest in doing.I even worked in my free time to develop a prototype of how something like Jenkins could help by running automated tests nightly. When management found out they literally told me \"if you want to work extra on the weekends work on project priorities or don't work on anything at all.\" The issue was management didn't care about things I was trying to solve.They were content with the speed of development, which was slow. They were content with how automated testing were run at the whim of people who owned the tests and sometimes issues would be found late in to the process. They were content with all the tech debt, because it wasn't preventing them from meeting their goals of getting FDA approval.At the end of the day they know creating an FDA approved medical device takes a long time and they were confident they could talk away any issues that did not affect patient safety. There were 100's of bugs that did not affect patient safety in the bug tracker, but fixing them was only priority when doctors or patients complained. I'm not saying ever place is like this, but that has been my experience which really soured me on working at companies like this. Sadly I'm not smart enough to get in to real tech companies, so I just have to deal with what I can get.",

I had a friend who worked as a pharmacist for 15 years as their main pharmacist. One day he showed up to work and there was a sign that the company had been sold and they were liquidating. Basically, what I'm saying is, don't look for the job that will make you feel comfy and safe, have good financial habits. Have a plan for if you do lose your job. Have savings. Have investments. Keep your eye open for opportunities, don't burn bridges, connect with people, etc.I'm not secure at Meta in the fact that I'm layoff proof, because I'm not, I'm secure at Meta because I'm confident in the network I've built, the skills I've learned, and that I have potentially years of runway to cover my bills, and that's without reducing my spend which if I was unemployed for a while I absolutely would tighten up the belt.",

If I get laid off again, that's freeing tbh. Because then I can explore something else and it's not at the expense of me being worried I quit my job, I got let go. But that's also because I have no debt and a healthy safety fund. I've also interviewed for jobs that weren't even swe jobs but the domain knowledge from my swe gigs was very valuable to them. So become interdisciplinary early on or seriously make sure you understand whatever field you're in bc a liaison between tech and something else is invaluable.",

Do some stuff on LinkedIn to raise your profile, maybe take a look at some JDs of the kinds of roles you're looking for and ask whether your resume accurately shows how good you would be at those jobs, or if it's missing information that could help you.I asked ChatGPT about this and, obviously take this with a grain of salt since it's a robot, but it suggested to me that the niche that good senior engineers are in is like \"person who can run projects\", people with lots of years of experience just pushin' code and gettin' paid don't get as much inbound since they're really only staff level on paper.Not sure what nugrads can do tho, it seems like the market is just awful for them.",

It probably didn't help him get the initial interview, since I think that was more about the fact that we were recruiting at his school, but it definitely helped him stand out during the interview process. When we were in discussions about the new grad class, that project was mentioned often and certainly kept him above the fold. It should be noted that he had to pass the interview solely on technical merits.One side point with this is that he was extremely difficult to work with because of this. He kept mentioning how he had built an app with thousands of users so he knew what he was talking about. We were building a company at petabyte scale with millions of users, so his experience was not particularly applicable. Not saying that you're like this, but it's something to be aware of. It shows that you're a go-getter and good at figuring things out, which are important qualities of a great SWE, but a SWE role at a big company is an entirely different skill set than a successful app builder.On the other side of the coin, I was able to land my first internship through a successful project. The thing that made my experience different from yours is that our app had very few users but a ton of publicity (it was kind of a wacky idea). This helped recruiters find us. All of the members of our team landed internships by responding to social media posts about our project. I also think that the companies liked the marketing aspect of \"look at these fun young founders working for OUR company.\"In short, I think having a successful project is great during an interview, but having a highly publicized project is better for getting your foot in the door.",

(Yes I know that's what NDAs are for, but I've meet some really paranoid people in this industry). If I were you I'd try to downplay how many paying customers you've got (congrats on that btw, it takes a lot of work to get anyone willing to pay for an app and that number is not insignificant), and focus more on your technical abilities.Good luck on the job hunt, from the sounds of things you'd be a great asset for any company to bring on, and hopefully one of them will realise this.",

The question I am going to poke at is how well will you work on a team. What are some bad habits I am going to have to worry about? I am going to poke to see how arrogent you are, This followed up by how well do you take being wrong or pushed back on. Also see how well you will take being assigned grunt work. They are general items I always poke at but I poke a little harder on people who have their own apps as juniors as they tend to react more negatively to them and more concern about them effecting the team negatively more.

Until people start developing a sense of common cause among all their brothers and sisters who work (this \\*includes\\* commonly demonized people like H1Bs, Indian workers, people on temporary contracts, etc), instead of approaching it from the direction of \"but how can I get mine?\", talk of unionizing is dead air.I'm hardly a labor scholar but I think an important precondition is a shift toward cultural solidarity of workers over employers. The first movers here, as in any labor struggle, will likely be casualties. Workplaces will -- as has been happening -- retaliate. People will be fired and blacklisted, whole departments shuttered, etc.In the \\*absence\\* of a broader cultural context around labor consciousness, the lesson these retaliations teach is \"that was a bad move, you can't win\". Whereas in a context of solidarity, it is more acceptable to take personal risks to advance the greater good. You have to be willing to do things that might get \\*you personally\\* fucked, in order to advance the interests of labor, the common good, which I think most people today are very, very far from.",

        "body": "Unionizing is a great idea but unfortunately there are problems with this idea that in my opinion this will exacerbate the problem. First and foremost, if software devs unionize then it will give the companies a golden opportunity to push for more AI and outsourcing. Simply because the people here are complaining about work hours, pay but hey over there in this other country we can abuse the living shit out of people and our operating costs are lower.Secondly, software developer position is highly dependent on the thing/service the company is trying to make. For example, a person sitting in pakistan or india can make the same website/app that any person any american software developer can make. Moreover, these people will bend over backwards to adjust to the american demand. Thirdly, unions will demoralize and depress the high salaries one can find in tech companies. Again, for example pilots in air canada are paid bonkers and the union has to constantly fight against the corporation to hold a bargain. Fourthly, the supply of software engineers is slightly higher than the demand at the current moment. This will overall negatively impact the strength of the movement. A new grad software developer doesn't have the leverage to bargain for higher salary because of inexperience.This is however, not the end. If you want, push the law makers and politicians, collective force to lobby the government into taxing the companies which outsource or use more AI. The way I see the current problem in software industry is that, the big players want to cash in on the AI demand, the mid level companies are trying to make a product which will earn them the attention from big companies. The government is only interested in sucking rich peoples' cocks. There is nothing to stand in the way.Other commenter u/dontping mentioned some other pathways, which are viable but they demand more time and effort than the current market is willing to deploy. Don't get me wrong, this is a great idea but to do this there has to be a way to back industry into a corner without getting the economy fucked.",

An executive's job is to run a section of the business, make it work well, and be accountable to its results.An executive's job security is based on how important their piece of the business is, how hard/risky it is to remove them from that piece of the business (either to replace them or reorg the function away), and how politically influential the person is (like who else will leave or become a problem if I fire this person). If your org can just be eliminated or you can easily be replaced, and everything else will stay standing without you, then you have no job security. If you are directly driving the company's financials, no one else can run your machine, and everyone else that is important to the business likes you and will be pissed and follow you if you are fired, then you have near-infinite job security. The title means nothing. It's just about what power you have. Generally, the title of an executive is supposed to be descriptive, not prescriptive. You are VP of eng because you are the person controlling eng. You aren't controlling eng because you are VP of eng. Where these are misaligned, the person with the title needs to be pushed out and replaced with who's actually in charge, and will be in any functional org.

Extremely senior roles actually have less equitable job prospects in the open market at any given point in time, and as a result most businesses will \"sideline you\" while you figure out your next move. Senior SWE? You can get interviews tomorrow for that. VP of software engineering? Takes time to connect to your network, make a role for you, or work into an existing hiring process. What it also may look like in a mass-layoff type scenario is that you need to layoff a significant amount of your team, then you \"get fired\". You would be critical in rebalancing the existing work on the new owners but consolidation may drive your role to be redundant anyway. You can't justify the scope of work or w/e.",

Those who aren't are asked to go back to IC. That also meant that directors with limited spans were asked to take on more areas, but I didn't see any directors laid off.I think layoff risk decreases higher up you go, but firing risk increases. As a manager or director, you're responsible for certain OKRs and project deliveries. It's inevitable that there will be some bad projects out there, either in tech talent of the team, bad product vision, or operational politics, only some of which the manager can control. The last director I knew who left not on his own accord was fired (or you know, replaced, 'left to pursue other opportunities' or whatever) was fired because his project went against architectural guidelines which led to risks that the business was unable to accept.It's also expensive to lay off directors, and VPs especially. At a certain level, you can negotiate your own exit package that is nonstandard. So, I think there's some second thought that always goes into laying off at higher levels because of that.",

Theoretically, the current stock price bakes in all the assumptions about future growth. For the price to grow further, it has to beat those expectations. Also, consider the alternatives like public companies. Their stock and compensation grows too. Where I currently work, most people get excited about the stock price growth every time there’s a new 409a. But performance has slightly lagged the S&P 500 and many other companies.",

And the junior hiring pool has been crushed.I don't think they could keep up this hiring pattern for 5 more years. And even if every software engineers productivity goes up 2x or 3x. There are a lot of lesser tech companies that could expand and benefit from more capable software devs with better tools.At least until they get AIs that can outthink humans reliably.

Shortly before the dot com crash just knowing a little HTML and being able to do it would get you job. it was nuts from people I know from the time. Due note most of the people are near retiring or have retired and even fewer are still actively developers. it was a long time ago and this is the close thing to it and reality is this is no were near as bad as the dot com burst.

H1-Bs are a good step, now they just need to tax flat +20% to any business that decides to contract overseas. Any dev shop needs to have a physical location in the states and virtual offices don't qualify.Until that happens then things won't change much but FAANG will certainly pick by up heavily, then following the rest of the industry; however, the only reason they'll be hiring is because they have to replace H1-Bs, which is a low amount of workers.Subsequently, if the Guardian catches wind they're just replace H1-Bs then they'll fire out propaganda against Meta so they want to avoid PR stuff. Therefore, a lot of people will be hired (not like COVID) but enough for you to get some. Unfortunately, unless AI burns and crashes (3-5 year reset, until LLMs are run onsite), then we won't have a true recovery, just slowly getting better.It'll be funny when AI startups realize how expensive it is to run an LLM with the latency of the big models. Nvidia will release their increasingly more powerful local LLM devices; however, the LLM computer will be more like a laptop you get at a company. Probably have some fancy case to put everything in and there are some distributed, blockchain-y kind of things you can do with them.That's why I believe these corporations are calling for back-to-office, not because of real estate money so much, but these smaller, compact LLMs need to be physically near each other to keep the costs the cheapest they can. Look at Morgan Stanley's updated trading floor, no elbow room.Eventually the LLM will be stuck in your head with neural link and you can really be a slave node at that point.

Both fields have their pros and cons, for me tech was more what I wanted to do and had a lot less cons.As far as electrical goes the pros are you will always have a job, you don’t need to worry about being replaced by Ai, you aren’t getting laid off and not finding a job (there are layoffs, more so in residential if the economy has a downturn but there are other jobs you can get quickly still). The pay is also good state dependent, I made about 70k year 1, year 2 I was close to 6 figures, and the next several years I was ~120-200k depending on overtime and how much I wanted to work.The negatives: you often get shit work days (weekends, nights), poor pto, work holidays, work in hazardous environments, it’s hard on your body, and you work with people who HR would have a meltdown if they heard for 5 minutes (gay jokes, teasing you, political talk, stuff some aren’t comfortable with I didn’t mind but I’ve seen several people quit a week or 2 in over it). I’d recommend industrial if you go the path. It’s more dangerous as you work with big stuff but you keep plants running like you can work for a refinery, brewery, stuff like that. You aren’t in peoples houses and you aren’t messing with code stuff all the time and you have constant work, they usually get paid the best depending on the place.If you have any questions or anyone else does feel free to ask.

Work in your own home is very different from someone else's, because the reward centers in your brain are different.I renovated my current house. I did 90% of the 120V work myself and 100% of the low voltage. I had some of the skills and watched hours of YouTube and asked contractor friends' input for the gaps. I fucketh not with 240V so my electrician FIL did that and the rest of the 120V that was a gap in my (electrical) code knowledge because I'd never wired a kitchen.While I enjoyed the work of running cables and changing outlets, it's physical labor that I couldn't see myself doing to bread on the table. It's something that I will enthusiastically undertake to help someone else.I'd recommend trying more development roles before exiting for skilled trades. Try a big company. Try a medium company.

I went 21 months unemployed.Jan 2023 I decided I wanted to start interviewing for Senior roles (yes, at the time 15 YOE and I wasn't senior, long story short - don't hit cruise control). Surprisingly, Sr level interviews felt easy, but I would often get to the final round but never the offer.I could have given up but I was already 15 yrs in. I knew I was good at what I did, I still enjoy it, I just needed to refine my skills. I realized that I actually had a lot of gaps to fill (self-taught). Those gaps spanned anywhere from DSA to not having a command of what i was coding. So I slowly filled those gaps, eventually I gave a solid interview and was made an offer.My thing is, if I wasn't made an offer - maybe the other candidate did just a lil better. Maybe I shouldn't have hesitated on this answer, maybe I shoulda known that thing I shoulda known. I'm able to navigate through these interviews - but its just another candidate with theoretically a similar skillset, that gets to the offer. It's ME that needs to be better. I absolutely cannot imagine starting from scratch in a new area of work. I have twins, 3.5 y/o now. My finances are wrecked. But this is the kind of job and level role that can pay me what I believe I'm worth, so I can eventually dig myself out of that hole. I did a lot of work over that 15ish yrs; I'll be damned if I cant make sense of working through an algo.And so, this is just my situation, I don't know the exact details of yours, but 17 YOE is hard to give up.",

When I was in university, throughout the 3 years we had multiple instances where we had to build projects from scratch. I remember that at one seminar we were given a list of 30 ideas for projects, with no requirements at all, things like:* \"4-way chess game\"* \"Musical composer\"* \"File browser and manager\"* etc.and it was up to us to come up with our own requirements and build something. Some of these projects were group work too, so that made it easier as you had other peers to brainstorm with.That said, I wouldn't worry too much. Job interviews for juniors don't usually have you build a whole project from scratch, and when you join a company you will be supervised and given a lot of structure. I would suggest joining a more established company rather than an early startup, because they would offer the structure, the product and technical requirements, and you will be given ample support and guidance (ideally).At the interview for my first job they had me write a small function to determine whether a given string was a palindrome (i.e. a word that reads the same forwards and backwards, such as \"madam\" or \"racecar\").

And while reducing cost is always a concern for a contracted workforce, generally in product companies, the thought process is a bit long-term.Usually, any decent boss would focus their energy on three things: a. Hiring good people (with good skills and high ownership), b. Getting them excited about the domain and deepening their engagement in the company business by growing them, nurturing them to be a team player, finally, c. Weeding out the bad apples - hopefully fast.In a long-term play, a few days, weeks, sometimes months of lean periods do pop up, and that’s the opportunity to clean house (reduce tech debt, refactor, cross-learn from other modules, do hackathons, and have fun, etc). And good bosses keep their own backlog of these things ready for these low periods.Tech work is not as transactional as some other careers. The value generated by good engineers compounds with time as they improve their skills and understand the domain better. 'Keep them busy - no matter what' attitude usually leads to a sub-optimal outcome.So no, bosses don’t look for ways to cut their teams as soon as they run into a low patch.This doesn’t apply to situations like contracting, a dying/loss-making company, bad performers, over-hiring (which happened right after COVID), and teams run by bad management/bosses.",

However all businesses have work hours and coworkers or customers might need you at work hours. Also you might have meetings at anywhere in work hours.So you cannot simply work 2-10 because you want to. That means nobody can reach you before 2, and you won’t make it to meetings before 2.In my experience permanent deviations from work hours usually require you have a special situation and need accommodation for that. Then your manager can arrange this and everybody knows they cannot reach you at some hours. And meetings that need to involve you are not scheduled to those hours. But even in this case 2-10 is a big stretch. Practically no company will support this permanently.I sometimes do and see people do something else: You start your day at the beginning of the work hours, check in and be available but do not actively work. When somebody needs to reach you, you respond. If you have a meeting you join. Then when it’s 2, you start actively working. After official work hours end you continue working until 10, but tone the communication down and stop answering to people who want to reach out, until next day. But this is usually more difficult than working regular hours. And I only do this temporary basis. Edit: Apparently this only makes sense for remote work. If you need to go to office at 9, there is no sense in not actively working.",

I’m still with that client and am pretty happy.Revature has changed a lot of things with regard to how they do their training. Now you have to take part in a self study / unpaid training, do well in that and they may allow you into the actual paid training program. Not sure which clients are Revature ships out the trainees to anymore.Recently I was given part of a class action settlement with Revature. Shams vs Revature, It was claimed that Revature included illegal language in their contract such as enforcing repayment of training fees. Also having associates use their own equipment for training.One of the craziest things I experienced was that we spent some time learning AWS. We were asked to input our own credit cards to setup our AWS accounts. Then spin up EC2’s etc. If you kept your EC2 running for too long you would be on the hook for any charges",

There are also people who literally do not care. Having worked with some hiring teams, there are devs who care more about their work deliverables than interviews. It's possible the feedback you received is valid, it's also possible it's wrong. That being said, I'm not sure you should be so sure you submitted what they were looking for. I worked at a place that intentionally left take-home assignments vague, because they wanted people to impress them. One person made a solution that technically did what was asked, and my assumption is they knew what they were doing, but the submission was so non-standard, we ended up rejecting them and wasting everyone's time. I think you just need to realize hiring is an imperfect process, and some company passing on you isn't necessarily an accurate assessment of your ability to do the work. You have to just forget those who passed on you and keep looking for a job that will fit. Also, don't assume people are spending a lot of time doing a really personalized candidate tracking process. They probably just clicked a \"reject\" button in some candidate tracking software, and you got an automated message. I've worked with HR people who do less than the bare minimum contacting candidates. It's not a reflection on you.",

Juniors don't get jobs becuase they are useful and make the company money, they get jobs because we all know we need juniors to skill up to become the next generation of seniors. B) Build Build Build. Pick a specialty you like, and start building large projects with it using popular libraries so you can get a feel for how it all works together. Focus on using the framework and libraries that the industry commonly uses first, you want those names on your resume and cover letter. >but I feel like machine learning is too competitive now I am not really a top programmer material The entire industry is competitive as hell, ML, like all CS, has roles for top talent hat make the **REALLY** big money, and roles for regular developers who are still learning or just want a stable job. When you look on social media, or listen to others, you're only hearing about the top developers, you don't hear about Jim who spends his days doing the grunt work that allows the top developers to have the time to do what they do. You don't need to be genius to be a great developer, you just need to build and listen/learn from your colleagues every step of the way. And maybe in 10-15 years you'll be a top developer, or maybe you'll prefer work life balance and just be a regular developer like the vast majority of us are. >What are some directions I should chase? https://roadmap.sh/machine-learningLearn from those who came before and follow their path, or make your own path, but you'll have to learn the same basic things so following other people's paths is generally more efficient.Also, as someone else mentioned, you will almost certainly need to learn leetcode questions. Don't panic they're easier than most people think. The easy level questions shoudln't be too hard, go through 20-30 of them to see what sorts of questions you'll be asked. But before moving to medium or hard, first learn DS/A. Data Structures and Algorithms is what Leetcode is there to test (not entirely, but basically). Most jobs will almost never need it, but really complex problems solved at scale (think Google Map's directions handling hundreds of millions of requests a minute) do, so Google started using these questions to test their recruits and the rest of the industry couldn't be bothered to make their own interviews, so now we all have to answer them. This youtube channel has some great lessons on how DSA/Leetcode all works:https://www.youtube.com/@mycodeschoolThey don't cover every element of DSA but do cover the most common. Either watch a video, then go to neetcode.io and practice the questions related to that video, or get a question on neetcode.io, look at the answers, then go find the videos that cover the answers and watch the video and then learn how and why the answers work. Sorry if that's unclear, my point is don't sit and try to \"learn\" how to answer leetcode questiosn on your own, lots of them are not \"intuitive\" and you will only get annoyed. It's much simpler to understand the question, then find the answer soemone else already fine tuned and learn that. If you want to fix a car, you don't just go smashing on things and see what happens, you get the manual. For leetcode, DSA and neetcode.io togehter, are your manual. And no, you don't need to pay for neetcode.io for it to be incredibly useful, you get better organization if you pay, but it's all still very usable for free. Though I will say, its' a pretty useful site, so I did end up paying, but I actually got the lifetime membership after I got my job and had some money coming it. More of a \"thank you\" than anything else, plus I'll have it for my next job hunt, though hopefully leetcode questions will be fully gone by then, they're definitely starting to disappear which is nice.",

Might want to spend an hour or two a night getting ramped up on running LLMs locally and MCP/RAG for the agentic stuff as that’s where all the funding is right now, and you already have solid domain/industry experience. I know downskilling sounds like an attractive option but sometimes you just gotta put ten toes down and stand on business. There are plenty of hands on CTO roles out there looking for real experience right now. I’m not saying don’t try for the SDE roles but just pointing out there is a path where you can both get more hands on and keep a path in the csuite. Check out stuff like execthread and wellfound, and just know that recruiting for this stuff doesn’t happen on the normal channels so try to figure out what’s the best path in your ideal industry and what’s available around your local market as well.

Social skills are you biggest net if you not exceptional technically, connections, or have a good track record interships.3. Its number game. You will have to be willing to move, take maybe not swe position but it/cs role, and starting out experience not pay.4. Record your interviews and play it like game footage to figure out the type of questions asked, weak points resume, and how you articulate yourself.5. Mock interview yourself with someone 1x week.bare minimum. Try to have them dig in your resume and go in depth extract down to mutiple layers of why you did x, value brought, trade offs, etc. Interviewer wants to understand your thought process and most people including me beyond surface level struggle to articulate mutiple layers deep unless they really know their shit.6. Aim for lower barrier entry gov, defense healthcare, retail, etc.7. If your resume is not getting hits, let say least a 4% ration. 100 apps least 4 interview. I would use online resource, friends, or pay services update resume.8. Star when answering questions interview.9. You should be sending out say least 15-20 apps every other day during work week imho.10. If you have any social skills or your kinda funny, try find some way to relate it could be as basic as small talk b4/after interview to even little banter if your confident enough. 11. Always send thank you email after every interview and give or take 3-4 weeks no response fine send follow up.",

Right now the job market feels like a luck and numbers game but in your resume from what I've been noticing from recruiters within the past couple of months is that you really do kinda have to keep your resume readable for a non tech person but also hit the \"buzzwords\" that they are looking for. What this means realistically is that its harder to find \"generalist\" roles outside of specific early career/new grad roles. Do you want to stay on the cyber security side, do you want to branch off into other aspects? Web development probably has the most jobs but its also extremely competitive and saturated right now. Embedded programing is an option but there doesnt seem to be a lot of jobs there. Everyone small or large is hopping on the AI agent stuff so if you learn how to build out agents that'd probably be eye catching.",

I'm just grateful to have a job related to the degree I'm pursuing, honestly - it's really hard to get even just a job like this. Obviously the most polarizing experiences are those with good/bad customers, which comes with the territory, and yes even the more frustrating experiences do make me go \"Man I'm doing all this for $X/hr?\", but then I remember that it'll all be worth it when I move up the CS ladder and finish my degree and move into grad school.Plus, my job will soon allow me to be able to move out of my parent's house, which is something I'm excited about.",

Aside from that based on your resume I'm assuming you are targeting web dev positions in which case I think you'd need to up-skill a little bit more. So doing projects that involve cloud infra or general dev op CI/CD pipeline I think would be really helpful. For example if a job posting goes up and outside of the basic \"must know javascript/react bla bla\" theres probably also going to be a line or two somewhere about knowing something in cloud like AWS Lambda and knowing some infrastructure stuff. Even for the \"SWE I\" roles. If a recruiter sees your resume and cant instantly draw that link for AWS Lambda for example they are likely to scrap it. Its annoying but that how it is with cold applying right now.You also have your degree in computer engineering, im curious to what job positions you are actually applying to. You should still qualify for early career new grad stuff along with internships which sounds like you are also applying to but have you tried stuff out side of the web dev space? Like embedded stuff/robotics etc? Heck honestly you could probably read a C/C++ book and open up a whole new world for yourself.",

On paper i was supposed to do 8 hours a day but it was so flexible that you could do your 40 hours hoever you liked. SO most would do 9 hour days M-Th and leave early friday. My 2nd job was FAANG, I worked my ass off 50+ work hour weeks, etc. This was salary based. In the USA, lunch is technically part of the law. But there are a lot of \\*wink-wink\\* in manager conversations. In the USA going home for lunch break is uncommon, nobody wants to stayt at work longer than they have to so most just eat at their desk and work and just do their 8 hours. Bosses will not be on your ass about that unless upper management says something. Especially in the jobs with bad work culture there is a lot of \"we dont expect you to work more than 40 hours \\*wink-wink\\*\" or other statements like that. The problem is when one person starts working over 40, gets the praises and the more people do it. When one person doesnt want to do it, they get questions like \"well why are you so behind you co-workers?\". Even if you complete the work required in 40 hours, tehy will compare you to your co-workers not was is expected of you. I got bad reviews at FAANG because my coworkers were pulling 50-60 hours and had 50-60 hours worth of work where i had 40 hours worth of work.",

Here are a few thoughts (just from one dev’s 15+ yrs of messing around):You did great figuring stuff out yourself. That takes grit, so don’t discount that.Zero onboarding + teammates treating each other like competitors = big red flag for long-term team culture. If everyone’s solo, you’ll keep spinning your wheels.Since you love the tech and are learning, ask yourself: Is the **pay + tech** enough offset for the culture cost? If you burn out or slide into isolation, the pay won't feel good.**Try this:** pick a small target for change. Could be *\"Meet one teammate for coffee/virtual chat this week and ask what their blockers are.\"* Or *\"Offer to pair on one small task.\"* If you get zero response, that’s an indicator.Keep the radar up for your next move. You’re already coming from a team with good support... so you **know** what better feels like. That’s strength.If it keeps feeling lonely and unsupported for 6-12 months, seriously weigh whether high pay + poor teamwork = “worth it” for you.Bottom line: you’re not stuck forever. You’re learning, you’re doing good work. If this place starts to eat your joy or energy in a non-recoverable way, it’s valid to move on again.Hope it gets better for you.",

At slower and bigger companies breadth isn't too valuable because they probably have experts in each domain who they'd prefer to leverage to do things more optimally. Also when it comes to landing interviews for all types of jobs to begin with, it's usually easier if you send strong signals that you're an expert in the tech stack that they'll have you work in as your main responsibility. The reason is, an expert won't have to catch up to speed and will be able to contribute at a deeper level (they know valuable stack-specific best practices and optimizations).EDIT: One hiring advantage you can leverage if you are a generalist is that you can probably build cool projects all by yourself to show off on your resume.",

This isn’t an “I’ll TRY and have this fixed…” type of thing. You’re a professional, in a professional job - you should have began this by having an attack plan with set deadlines. Ingest the data and get the report could be step one. Step two find the problem and FIX it. Step three maybe do a thorough investigation to see if other data is being missed. Step four have a test suite or some way to monitor so this scenario doesn’t happen again. If the urgent steps are not completed by noon on X day - you’re going to contact the manager or team lead and bring in help. You’re also actively communicating the status of these issues during standup / keeping your manager updated. Also - if you know you’re doing dumb stuff then you need to stop and take a step back. Don’t push forward and make things worse.",

Clarify if that's not the case.All that aside, if you want to change jobs, line one up before you quit this one. Even if this one blows, you're making an income, and your resume shows you're actively employed. Those are both massive boons.

Feeling trapped between financial obligations, career dissatisfaction, and the loyalty you feel towards your team, especially with such significant projects on the horizon, must be incredibly isolating. It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed when facing such critical decisions, particularly when they involve your health, your peace of mind, and your ability to start a family. When you're dealing with such frequent panic attacks and the daily drain of a job you dislike, it's natural for your brain to feel like it's in overdrive, making it hard to see a clear path forward. Prioritizing your mental health is never a sacrifice; it's an investment in every other aspect of your life, especially when you're considering bringing a child into the world. It might be helpful to explore different ways to manage the acute symptoms of anxiety, especially since your current medication situation is changing. Sometimes just having a toolkit of techniques can make a big difference in those overwhelming moments. There's a free [podcast](https://youtu.be/72ZhaR-aWNI) that covers common anxiety symptoms, coping strategies, breathing exercises, and techniques for controlling panic attacks, which you might find useful to listen to in your own time as you navigate these challenges. Thinking about your long-term health and happiness is really important here, not just for you but for your future family. God bless.",

What would happen if we didn't do this? Would we experience pain when working with this code? Would it be easier or harder to make a mistake/bug?* KISS - keep it simple, stupid. Onboarding new devs is going to be more difficult the more abstractions you add. Then maintenance becomes an issue. Then mistakes are made because the new guy doesn't understand the code.

In my experience \"clean code\" is very much in the eye of the beholder and is more a matter of whether the author and the reader are on the same page rather than any objective superiority of any particular method of coding. Just like any other sort of writing. There are of course some general principles that tend to make things better, and it is certainly possible to make *horribly unclear* code, but past a certain point a lot of it really is a matter of taste.So essentially a person who has strong opinions about specific details of how code should be written is similar to a person who thinks their preferred genre of music is superior to others, or otherwise thinks their taste is superior -- they are wrong, but it's going to be very difficult to convince them of that, and the more persuasive you are the more they will probably dig in and get pissed at you.So you'll need to decide which things *you* care about and which things you don't. If you don't actually care about something, just go along with what they want and smile and nod anytime they try to justify it, content that they're trying to justify it to themselves as much as to you.If you do care, really think again about whether you actually do care. Lots of people don't actually care about things they fight for but rather let ego get tied up in it and are instead fighting over ego. Try to avoid that if possible. So really think about whether you genuinely do care.And if you genuinely do, try to act in good faith. Explain what you think, then invite them to explain what they think and walk you through their thought process and be genuinely open to it. They might actually have good reasons, and so *you* should be open to changing *your* mind. But inviting them to explain will both make them feel like they are valued (which is important to them if they have strong opinions about how the code should be written) and also let them talk themselves out of ideas that are bad (like, if you explain a good idea and ask them to explain theirs, they will have a hard time denying yours is better if they actually have to explain it, and because it is them talking it through and deciding they will be more likely to compromise than if you order them to).Inviting them to explain also gets both of you on the same side -- rather than arguing you are instead both looking at the same problem and talking about it as a thing separate from yourselves. And that change in perspective is helpful -- it makes them feel less like *they* are being devalued if their ideas aren't used.In my experience, most workers do ultimately want to get along and do good stuff, and if you can diffuse their defense mechanisms and avoid getting defensive yourself you can usually find a common ground.But if a person truly is an asshole and can't be reasoned with and truly is my way or the high way, and you really do care about the thing they're digging in on, your best bet is probably to try to go around them. Build support for others / get others to validate your view. After all, if the person is an asshole to you then they have probably been an asshole to others as well, and so you probably will find support. Try to avoid getting ego involved, as that will only make it harder and also pull you into petty drama.",

The reason why people are unwilling to compromise in many cases is that the benefits of clean code are large. i.e. The more readable, testable and maintable, and reusable your code is, the faster you will go. You actually accelerate as your code base grows, rather than slow down. You say over-abstraction. But you didn't say how you defined that. Clearly define what over-abstraction actually is.One simple one is speculative design.Adding inheritance when there is no code-reuse, (or no good reason at the moment) is speculative design.Anyone who does test driven development typically is very good at avoiding speculative design. Maybe suggest that to them?",

Your stutter affects your speech, but it doesn't affect your communication. I definitely don't think of a stutter as having any impact on communication. Getting stuck on words isn't really related to good communication. So your boss may be thinking of something specific. Maybe *because* of your stutter you end up speaking up less in meetings? Maybe you're talking at too technical a level for non-technical folks, or vice-versa? Maybe a million other things.I'm sure your boss meant something besides the stutter.If after having that conversation with your boss, they literally say \"just stop stuttering lol\".... that'd be shocking.

An acquaintance of mine ended up doing front desk at a hospital after trying to pivot around.If I'm a hiring manager hiring for Vue I don't necessarily care if you know React or Java or anything else. Casting a wide net for a job search makes sense if you have a broad transferable skillset, but if you're already somewhat niche with something like Vue, it might make sense to just go deeper in the niche since the pool of qualified applicants also tends to shrink the more niche you go, since depth isn't as easy to acquire due to paretto principle.",

My team recently laid off a new mom after her maternity leave for \"performance\" (the company was not performing well and pushed everyone to work longer hours which she did not do) and it felt very scummy.I feel like you have 3 routes you can go. The first is to find a job at a company that has a relaxed WLB. That's hard to do on command, at any company, in any role. Historically the best option has been government work, which right now is more volatile than it has been in the past. When I've seen this work out for people in the private sector, the situation is usually that they got hired into a \"boring\" company that doesn't pay particularly well, and they stayed long enough that they're performing well and worth more in the market vs. their current job so therefore they have the leverage to push for a great WLB. This isn't your situation. So if you can find a company like this, great! But I wouldn't bet the house on it.Option two is to accept that you're going to end up working longer hours than you want to for a while. I don't think it actually matters whether you stay in software or pivot to sales, PM, solutions engineering, or recruiting (which are the most common pivot options). Those may be more people oriented and may be a better fit if that's what you want in a job, but you aren't necessarily more likely to stay employed, or have an easier time finding work. This is kind of the time where leaning on family for help with the kid is going to make a big difference.Option three is to take a few years off until the kid is in school.",

Metrics should be meaningful and this is a little bit of projection but most metrics I see usually are something like \"improved api response time from 1 minute to 1 second\" or \"Speed up data fetching by 60% by optimizing a SQL query\". Like theres realistically only so many of those that can be put out before people (initial recruiters) start catching on to that kind of fluff. That said participate in hackathons. If you cant or are not willing do that pick a few companies and roles that you'd like to target. Read the job description and find out exactly what they are asking for. build a project or contribute to an open source project that is based around that jobs needs. For example if you are applying to netflix streaming, it might be useful to either contribute to ffmpeg or build a quick wrapper application around ffmpeg. If a company is looking for someone to help with their AI/ML stuff it would probably be useful to make an AI agent.Most of the jobs/recruiters are just matching keywords and things that align with their goal. Your projects dont have to have major impact or be meaningful. They should just demonstrate that you used and have somewhat of an understanding of the technologies that the company is going to want you to use and implement.",

The three that were let go had 35 yoe combined. I have no business being in this position and I've been very clear about it.. but America's civil workforce is under attack and there isn't much anyone can do but hold out hope for 2026.So development has slowed to whatever pace I am comfortable with.. nobody with any technical expertise knows anything about the project. Replacing me wouldn't be cheap at this point, and if someone wants to come in and insist I can go faster, I'd gladly make way for them to show me how it's done.",

As you scale you gain more leverage to incentivize companies/clients to implement their own pre-processing (or provide as a paid service) to gain access to your tool. Probably worthwhile to keep the client-supplied data in a different database for posterity.This is pretty basic first-principles stuff but I’ve been shocked how many people don’t do this kind of thing",

So I'm not worried that he'll try to screw me overThis is what *every single person* who has been fucked over by family has said. You're literally playing into the trope. Nobody loans someone money thinking \"This person sucks, pretty sure they're gonna fuck me\".There's 2 very different questions baked into your post. One is how to bill yourself. The other, and one you're neglecting, is doing business with family/friends.Go ahead. Google what doing business with family/friends is like. No matter how good my sister's tech idea might be, in no world would I ever consider working for her. Same for my friends. My friends are very smart, they have lots of good ideas. But we're friends. Not co-workers. That's why I'll never in a million years do *any* sort of work for them.It's very well established that you should never do business with friends/family. And if you do, you should do so expecting to never be paid. You're working for free. If you expect to be paid, you should not do the work.For the other side of the question, you mention you have an aversion to an hourly wage..... why? There's a reason that's what a lot of freelancers do. There's lots of hidden costs you don't think of that can pop up during a project. It's really tough to just say \"Yeah, just pay me $X\". If any of a million things come up, $X suddenly turns into $X+$10k. Now you're out a bunch of money because you tried to do an upfront cost versus an hourly rate.As for the actual rate, a lot of SWE's tend to charge $50-100 per hour.",

Then people realised cloud is $$$ and we're back to square one.On prem has some pros - e.g. a lot of costs are capital expenditure (CAPEX) rather than operational (OPEX). You buy your servers from Dell, HP or similar and then rack them. That's then paid rather than paying $$$ to AWS, Azure, GCP or similar. Cons are that you're limited on what hardware you have deployed - you can't just spin up more hardware quickly. Also you'll be responsible for maintaining this hardware, and the corresponding operating systems etc on it. It can be cheaper, but the overheads mean that it's not necessarily a simple choice, in particular if you need to hire co location space etc - all of this adds up quickly.For what it's worth, I'd go for cloud first and only go on prem if there was a very good reason for it, and that all of the points I made above had been considered.",

Even if you survive the pip maybe consider finding a new job anyway; several things you mentioned in here make this place sound terrible.This comment is especially concerning:>I'm the only guy on my teamI assume you mean you are either a one man team or the only developer.

I think if you're starting with a design pattern, and working backwards, that's really backwards. Sometimes with enough experience you short-circuit the logic though. For example, I'm a big fan of step builder pattern in the main language I use ( Rust ). Why? It's pretty ergonomic and it makes it so invalidly using the API is a compiler error rather than a runtime error. So whenever I have a highly customized struct or state machine, I tend to lean towards step builder off of prior experience. But I also don't just roam the codebase with patterns in my hand ready to force them anywhere.",

So, its probably quite uncommon that most people aren't using design patterns in some capacity.That being said, I think design patterns are a thing you should be able to understand and reason about but I actually think they are overused and can be harmful, hot take incoming and I'm sure I'm gunna get downvoted into oblivion.The problem is design patterns draw your focus away from the problem you are solving and make you focus on the organization of the code itself. Nothing about design patterns makes you're code A) correct or B) performant, and most the time you end up taking what was a really simple problem and making it wayyyyy over engineered and over abstracted. The worst is when people go to build out something and they start with a design pattern in mind that they want to use and the first implementation is driven by that pattern, rather than the actual problem that needs to get solved. Outside of stuff prescribed by a frameworks, starting with a pattern is a terrible idea, you have no idea what functioning code will look like and even worse, you have no idea if a pattern is even necessary for what you are trying to accomplish. Depending on what patterns you are even using, you may actually be affecting the compilers ability to optimize the instruction set because it can't reason about the amount of misdirection you have introduced into the code.I'm not saying there is never a use case for design patterns, but more often than not, if you just keep it simple and straight forward, your life will be easier. At a minimum, get the thing working and see if a pattern can be applied, never start with design patterns.",

So if its a recruiter that's been in the game for a while, they have a bunch of candidates they've contacted before, or they already know where to lookIf its someone who sounds a bit new, they send that initial contact msg and if you aren't responsive thats when they keep pressingSo not sure if you've noticed but sometimes you'll get hit up by different agencies where the JD is eerily similar if not identical minus the usual text replacements. It's because it is in fact, the same role for the same companyIn either case, if you don't get any response, some other candidate likely already bit, and they've submitted them for the role (obvi they can submit multiple candidates) but you can see that you've got a better chance the sooner you respond to their initial contact. Maybe you did, but maybe there were also 10 others and they chose to go with candidates that gave them (the recruiter) better chances for selectionI've mentioned this several times before with regards to recruiters - we're just race horses. If you show promise, they give you all the attention, because they're betting all their money that you get selected for the interview process and hopefully all the way to an offer.If you're behind, or lacking, that's when you get ghosted.

It's tough. And some people can be very condescending and difficult to work with. I found a new job in the country I currently live in for this very reason and I will give my resignation very soon. Just remember, we are always being held to higher standards when it comes to technical skills. Because their assumption is that we are just not as technical as them. They don't do it consciously and if you mention it to them as a feedback to your manager they will 100% get defensive and you will come across as \"oversensitive and blaming them for sexism instead of responding positively to their feedback\". But it's been my experience, my friends' experience and I ve seen it countless times.There have been times that I saw men in my team doing things in a certain way and their PRs got merged. I tried to use their approach and my PR got scrutinized. I try to just stay on the facts, avoid making any accusations, just sharing code snippets and say \" we used this approach here, how is it different now?\". Most of the time, they don't have an answer.Just try to look at your output objectively. Are they really right to what they are saying? If not, try to remind yourself that your output is just being scrutinized much more than theirs. If yes, try to improve on the things they are right and also document what you worked on/what you did to improve. I also found that these issues significantly reduce when I work in teams with a more balanced gender ratios. My current experience at this job, has been really extreme and it makes sense since I am literally the only woman in a team of 15+ people.I wish you good luck! :red_heart:",

You got a CS degree and that is a testament to your knowledge and ability to learn and grow in this field.I don’t know what companies are looking for with respect to new grads these days. It used to be the case that companies hired knowing you had zero experience but the capacity to learn and grow into the role. These days, since there’s so many new grad applicants, the bar for hiring has been raised and so you’ll need to improve your resume to get interviews and improve your interview skills to increase the odds of performing well.Think of it as levels in a game, you'll want to focus your energy on one level at a time (more or less). Since you're not landing interviews, this the first level to pass. Get constant feedback on your resume. You should be iterating on it — share it with friends or redditors to get feedback, make improvements, and send it out to companies (job boards, networking, etc). If you get callbacks, this means your resume is good enough. If not, keep doing that iterative feedback loop until you do. Once you feel you're landing interviews a bit more consistently, then you'll need to focus on the interview rounds. I don't really know what that entails for new grads, but you seem to be on the right track. Practicing leetcode as a way to prove your understanding of DSA is good. Working on personal projects is also good. Keep track of what problems you encounter and what you did to solve them, and be able to communicate that. They don't expect you to be an expert, just want to know how you think and tackle problems. It's great that you're focusing on infra and LLM projects btw. There's no right or wrong path here, the field is too broad so it's best to do what you're interested in because enjoyment is a crucial recipe for making progress and preventing burnout. It's better to have some depth here rather than shallow breadth. It really sucks that this is the market you’re graduating into, but you’re definitely not a fraud, and you're definitely not alone in this experience. Do what you need to sustain a living and be sure to socialize, exercise, and eat well to keep your mental health in good shape too! Good luck.",

        "body": "For the feeling like a fraud part: I used to think this way as well. but after a few years on the job, I realize that you can't prepare for everything. A lot of our stuff is internal, so its gonna be new anyway. I think just have a good foundation, and learn on the job is the best. For the job part: If you don't have the job or interview, focus on getting the interview. if you got the interview, focus on passing the interview.Worry about the not knowing things part after you get the job. Not all companies have a good onboarding/ramp-up time for you, but that's not something you can control anyway. Once you get there, find out what you need to know for your team's projects and tech stack. Go from there.I didn't have AI to help me when I started, but I think AI makes it way easier to learn quickly nowadays. Use it to understand the code base. Like if you need to modify a part of something in the codebase, use AI to find where the code is and understand what patterns this codebase use and get suggestions.Need to build something from scratch? Use AI to quickly understand parts of the tech stack you don't understand. Feed it documentation and ask questions. Clarify your understanding, but be skeptical about what it tells you. ask it to confirm, ask it for direct reference sin the documentation if you're unsure.I don't really know what's best for a junior in this era of AI-assisted tools. But my personal opinion is that you use it to augment your learning potential and gain experience. Once you have more experience, perhaps you can use it to vibe code or output tons of code. Because at least, you tell tell if the output is good or bad.",

        "body": "The problem with academic programming in school is that business has an entirely different set of needs, tools and development processes. As a junior-level person, you're not expected to know all that stuff. There are a couple of exceptions to this rule -- startups frequently expect new grads to know as much and be able to perform at the level a senior with full implementation level knowledge of their tech stack in the first week. FAANGs might also have higher expectations and be more unforgiving as well, depending on the FAANG.Larger corporations that aren't FAANG will generally have well established IT groups who can offer a decent level of mentorship. Maybe focus on trying to find a spot at one of those.The more you know in general the better. Being able to set up docker instances and CI/CD pipelines is a pretty good skill to have, even if you don't find devops particularly interesting. You might even want to go look at hashicorp's terraform and tools like that, that allow you to stand up a huge amount of infrastructure with the wave of a hand. I don't particularly care for terraform's configuration, would much rather do it in python, but it's still a pretty neat tool and a good one to have in your toolbox. You are very much building out a toolbox now, and it's good to know the things you have at your disposal.I wouldn't suggest coding directly with AI. There are a couple reasons for that and your instincts are good that if you just blindly copy and paste AI code, you're not really going to learn anything. Poke at the problem a bit and use the AI for inspiration. If it writes code for you, try to read and understand it and possibly even rearrange it a bit. Rather than \"Write some code to do X\", focus on \"How do I do X\" and try to understand the underlying concepts.Also, relax! Back in the 80's when I was getting started, there was already way more to know about this field than any single person could know. Math has been like that since Isaac Newton's day -- before him, one single person could know everything there was to know about math. He gave us the map to an infinite landscape. Programming is similar, an infinite landscape of the mind. Don't try to understand it all at once and accept that there will be things you couldn't have even imagined were out there. Maybe you'll even invent one of them one day!Got a couple of funny stories for you if you care to keep reading.Funny story about relaxing: I decided to learn how to skydive when I was in my early 40's. My instructors kept telling me to relax. And I was all like \"I'M ABOUT TO JUMP OUT OF AN AIRPLANE! I AM NOT GOING TO RELAX!\" A few months later I went to the indoor skydiving wind tunnel and told my instructor I just wanted to mess around today and not focus on learning anything. As soon as I hit the wind I felt my whole body relax and I realized that *I'd never done that before!* And I flew so well that day. And knowing how to relax, my driving (which I'd been doing for ~30 years at that point) immediately improved as well. It took a somewhat extreme experience to get me to that point, and it's something I wish I'd learned much earlier in my life.Funny story about people skills: Empathy is a human superpower. We have the ability to think about what another person might be thinking and feeling and act on how we think they're feeling. Hone that power to a fine edge and it's as close to telepathy as we're gonna get. At some point along the way, I found that while reading code, I could get a sense of how well the programmer who wrote it understood the requirements and even their mood and how they were feeling when they wrote the code. It's weird when it happens.So back in the poker craze of the early 2000s there were a bunch of guys around who'd go to bars and set up tables to run free poker tournaments. They'd arrange to get a small kickback from the bar for each customer they brought in. I got laid off from a company I was working for at the time so I started frequenting these tournaments, as they were free to enter and usually offered a free $30 bar tab to the winner of the tournament. I could pick up one or two of those a week and get one or two halfway decent meals out of them. Playing poker taught me to look at people. I can't read people as well as I can read code, but the first time I knew what a guy's hand was just from watching him while he was thinking about betting, I felt like a sorcerer.So learn what you can about computers, but also learn what you can about yourself and the species you belong to. You'll find some surprising things there too, I think.",

I found a lot of people are more likely to bomb those than the coding stuff. Fortunately the amount of studying you have to do there is small for the amount of value you get out of itPersonally I would never skip an interview. Every interview is at worst practice.
