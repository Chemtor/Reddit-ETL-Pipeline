I had to ingest that data as if we were getting it in real time, we needed that simulation over the historic data that was divided into 4 sets of 75 GB chunks each. I used Kafka to stream each static dataset which was in a CSV format, while also collecting and performing feature engineering using Spark Streaming in realtime, passing it to a pre trained ML model that simulated classification in realtime. You can stream that data using Kafka, no memory issues, Spark streaming can handle all the known formatting issues, the ones that are not anticipated, can be sent into dead letter queues using Kafka. Then, at the end look at that data to understand why it failed, put all the newer checks and run an iteration again on those failed records. Dividing the data set into smaller chunks can definitely help like others suggested and also, someone suggested to do it using a terminal, that's a good one. Streaming seemed very useful and an out of the box idea to me during that hackathon as I was struggling to think how someone would process this big of data on RAM. I was fresh out of college then.",

That’s rare.* **Zero-Copy + Arrow Interop**: Shares memory with Arrow without copying — great for performance.* **Pushdown Compute on Compressed Data**: If supported, this is huge — filter/compute without decompressing.* **Forward-Compatible WASM Decompression**: You can ship a new encoding + its logic *inside* the file.* **Handles Ultra-Wide Tables**: O(1) access to 100k+ columns using FlatBuffers.# :cross_mark: What It Gets Wrong (or Needs Work)* **Still immature**: Tooling is limited. No wide adoption (e.g., no Spark/Presto/DuckDB support).* **Too complex for most**: Great for low-level devs, but not plug-and-play for typical data teams.* **IPC Format = WIP**: This is critical for streaming/cloud-native workflows — and it’s not finished.* **Limited language support**: Rust and Python are solid; Java/Go/Scala? Not there yet.* **No benchmarks vs Parquet/Arrow**: Claims are strong, but I want charts.# :balance_scale: Bottom LineVortex is **not** a Parquet replacement (yet), but it’s potentially **better** in specialized cases — like in-browser data tools, embedded systems, or custom DB engines.If you love performance and control, it’s worth watching.

Each tool ends up with slightly different calculations, and nobody knows which version is the correct one. A semantic layer gives you one source of truth.But don't you need to derive the data that's going to provide this unified view? Doesn't that involve precisely the calculations that drift apart over time? So what's the semantic layer doing other than adding yet another bunch of transformation?> The key is the semantic logic layer, abstracting the physical world from the modeling world.That sounds like horseshit to me. Both layers are abstractions, both layers are models, neither layer is physical - or rather, both layers are supported by physical hardware and eventually boil down to fluctuating voltages and so they're both physical in that sense, but neither is any more physical than the other. The question isn't whether one level of abstraction is more physical than the other, but what the new abstraction provides that the old one didn't and whether it makes life easier.",

For example, the CEO and the CTO mentioning a different monthly revenue at the all-hands meeting, because the first one checked the finance BI tool and the second one ran his own SQL script on the transaction database. Not a good look! It's in the reason 1 in the article, which should have been better highlighted as the definition IMO. The other reasons are secondary nice-to-have.> 1. Unified place to define ad hoc queries once, version-controlled and collaboratively, with the possibility of pulling them into different BI tools, web apps, notebooks, or AI/MCP integration. Avoid duplication of metrics in every tool, making maintainability and data governance much easier; resulting in a consistent business layer with encapsulated business logic.Typically, it appears to the final users as a list of metrics and dimensions they can select in a BI tool UI. For example, they would click on the metric \"revenue\" and the dimension \"monthly\" to get a table of \"monthly revenue\".For the BI engineer, the semantic layer can be written in the definition panel of a graphical BI tool, in DBT with SQL or YAML, Python with `boring_semantic_layer` as in the article, whatever vendor specific definition language like Look ML for the Looker BI tool etc.",

You can store things in columns such as ID - Atrribute Name - Attribute value without flattening them, which makes ingestion transparent. Or you maintain link tables and cross referentials, without having to decide upfront what the precise grain isSo your gold layer can be:* the PowerBi datamodel, Tableau view or anything an analyst generates directly* a curated layer specifically for a consumer (Marketing datamart, Sales datamart on another grian, pre-aggregated finance figures to show year to date on the book year, ...)* views or tables designed to be consumed by a specific consumer, such as pre-filtered reports or tables that generate a daily outbound file to be consumed by another toolThis may not be \"by the book\", but this is what I've always seen in practice",

The layers of the three-layer model, for over 35 years. have been stage, core and semantic. Calling them by those stupid marketing terms adds nothing to the conversation. Yes, this is my personal pet peeve. When you start joining things for the semantic layer, you are assigning purpose to them. For example, if you create a star, how you join the dimensions to the fact table gives meaning (explicit or implicit) to the data that may not be true in all instances. Those data products are meant to keep your core available for all purposes and not any specific one. That being said, you could query to the core layer directly, but it may not perform as well as the semantic layer. The core is more about the relationships of the data at an overall business layer. When you are conforming and loading the core, you don't want the business queries getting in the way.",

We'd also add filtering flags to get it to the level that the business looks at. Then, another team wanted to make a gold semantic layer, so my DE team only made silver. It IS a source of truth, but anyone using silver has to join to other tables to properly filter data, there are numerous IDs for the same thing and the users have to figure out which one is useful, etc. We've yet to see the Gold layer work the way they want it to. As for another item you mentioned regarding aggregation, I'd support still having gold data at the most granular level, and letting BI aggregate the data in a final semantic layer per business requirements. Some people may still aggregate in gold which is a fine approach though. Probably depends on the business.",

It works quite well for adhoc reporting which is often what I'm doing. If we moved off Power BI this fourth layer would be wide tables.

You're expected to mentor juniors, which is again more soft skills, and assign them work challenges just beyond their comfort zone.

I’ve completed over 70 customers data projects (often 1-3+ systems per project) averaging between 6 months and 18 months a project with some spanning multiple years. They’re vastly underestimated and require dedicated resources, which should include a project manager, business stakeholders, and engineer(s). The worst project? A migration with no validation, a lack of business user validation, and/or a rushed timeline. Projects without validation are almost always dead on arrival. The exception being an incredibly straight forward system (with low customization) that you’ve handled multiple times. I can tell within the first three months if it’s going to flop based on business users lack of engagement and/or validation. You could do everything right as far as schema to schema and wind up with the destination enterprise software handling the end result poorly due to rules represented outside the schema (or api) definitions. Even something as simple as moving files is often overlooked in data migrations between systems, which can range from super straight forward PDFs to custom templates you need to rebuild by passing data into. File type compatibility issues, number of files per record and representation of those files on the front-end, file size limits, etc. The fact you’re doing migrations straight into production without validation rounds (using production data) raises a :triangular_flag:for a potential long term headache. Again, this is assuming these are complex systems and not a handful of tables. What’s worse than a bad migration?

Either way it’s going to be expensive and you question whether just scaling up make more sense (bear in mind there is a risk that the OS can be “flaky”).

This experience was a catalyst for my professional growth.In that role, **PySpark** was our main framework. We used it to build scalable ETL/ELT pipelines capable of processing massive datasets efficiently. For orchestration, we relied on **Apache Airflow**, which was a game-changer for automating and monitoring our data workflows.To manage our code and documentation, we used **GitHub** and **GitLab**. This ensured that our development process was organized, collaborative, and easy to track. For data analysis and validation, I used **Hue** to run queries and visualize data directly on our Hadoop cluster. And for database administration, **DBeaver** was my go-to tool for managing both **MySQL** and **Oracle** environments.This exposure to a modern, integrated tech stack was invaluable. It not only deepened my technical skills but also prepared me for the demands of the current job market.# > Is It a Bad Career Choice to Stay?Yes, in terms of professional growth, it absolutely is. Your current role is a maintenance position that doesn't challenge you or equip you with the skills needed to be competitive in the modern data engineering field. You're not building new solutions or working with the tools that most companies are using.# > Would You Take a Pay Cut to Leave This Situation?Yes, I would. A pay cut is not a loss; it's an investment in your future. Accepting a lower-paying job that uses modern technologies will significantly increase your market value in a few years. Think of it this way: a small short-term loss in salary could lead to a much larger long-term gain in earning potential.Given that you're in your early 30s, you have plenty of time to pivot. Use your current low-stress environment to your advantage. Take the time to study and build personal projects using tools like **PySpark**, **Apache Airflow**, and cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure. By actively building this experience, you can turn a potentially stagnating situation into a stepping stone for a dynamic and rewarding career.",

The complication is necessary.Another contributing factor is a simple lack of knowledge of the fundamentals. If every build vs buy decision is automatically \"buy\" because the team doesn't have the ability to build, then you are going to end up with a complicated mess of integrations, configurations, and impedance mismatches between systems without clear boundaries of responsibilities. As with everything, the solution is found in the tradeoffs. Understanding the right balance between NIH and YNGNI, between DRI and premature abstraction. Between simplicity and generalizability. Between time and money. That, and having a good team applying sound principles.",

        "body": "Obviously, great work if you did that alone without much DE experience beforehand. I guess a few points to consider:1. How will the pipeline behave if the UI changes on the website you are pulling the data from, or if the website is down or behaving slowly? In my own experience, Selenium is quite limited to basic actions like “wait for page to load” or “wait until the export button appears.” I would assume you, as a BI Analyst, would probably know when the UI change happens since you are closer to the business user. But still, you don’t (at least you have not mentioned it) have any sort of monitoring or alerting and are just relying on everything working smoothly. So I would advise thinking about adding logging and alerts for those cases.2. Again, this kind of follows the second point, but it would probably make sense to add some retry logic when pulling the data if the website is slow on that particular day.3. Raw data is usually pretty fucking bad, and it’s the task of a Data Engineer to make the business see only pretty fucking good data. What I mean by that is: do you have any validation in place to prevent bad data from getting into your Power BI models? You mentioned you are pulling customer data profiles and geolocations, and this kind of data is soooo easy to get messed up - it’s insane. For example, postal codes being bad, or missing pieces of an address, like the street being available but not the city, etc. So I would think about adding some sort of validation for your data, if it’s not already part of the transformations you are doing.4. You are pulling the Excel files, applying and saving them, and then reading them and saving as parquet. Why? Literally, no offense, but why? You have two versions of the same file in different file formats stored. I would probably store the raw Excel files somewhere for archival purposes so that if you need to check the raw data, you don’t need to re-download them. But I would store transformed files directly in parquet to avoid unnecessary reads/writes.5. Create/replace tables is a simple, working strategy, which is cool, but really inefficient for big tables since you have to reload everything. I would suggest checking out `MERGE` or `INSERT...ON CONFLICT` statements for incremental updates so that if a row is unchanged from the previous table version, you don’t need to reload it. Also, I assume your SQL commands look like: `CREATE TABLE t1 AS SELECT * FROM 'file1.parquet';` Which is normal, but I would advise wrapping it in transaction logic. What does this mean? Imagine your tables fail in the middle, and you have 10 tables. Now you are stuck with 5 updated and 5 old tables - sucks, right? To ensure that your group of loading operations is atomic (meaning they either all succeed or all fail together), you must manually wrap them in a transaction block. That way, you know for sure that either all of them were updated, or all of them are in their previous state, but the data is still consistent between them.Again, what you did is really solid, especially for your first time, but maybe my wall of text will help you a bit. I am also open to any comments since I suck at DE and maybe messed up somewhere. Be very proud of what you designed.",

Yes, obviously GPUs have become big — if you’re paying any attention to either the tech or finance space you would’ve seen Nvidia dominating with their explosive stock growth (you know, during a gold rush, sell shovels and all that). A much more interesting discussion around this is how the AI boom is basically keeping the (American) economy sustained; how we’re on the verge of data center infrastructure bubble bursting similar to the telecom bubble the late 90s; how we’ll have trouble feeding electricity to all these new data centers and how electricity prices will continue go up because of that and because policy makers are putting the brakes on renewables; how all this new AI tech is amounting to little more low quality slop being generated at an unprecedented rate and we’re essentially stuck with it forever. Yes, I know these technically different topics but I find them much more relevant and the educated discussions around them much more insightful.This article is just about shifting more computing resources to hardware designed for matrix multiplications… like, yea no shit. The title is clickbait, the content is feeble, and the whole premise is weak. Regular CS fundamentals are not going anywhere and will always be a core element of computing. I find Andrew Ng and Andrej Karpathy’s statements around this much more interesting — that with each paradigm shift, the makeup of software (and hence hardware) just shifts. I get that this article is essentially saying that, but there just isn’t much there besides the obvious.",

Do a great job? Feel proud, but don't let it get to your head. People being shitty to you when you're trying to improve? Ignore them and keep your head down. This is all part of learning and improving.Second advice - if you want to be concretely better at stuff, only use LLMs when you want to save time doing things you already know how to do. If you use LLMs to completely generate the output you are looking for, you will end up with huge gaps in your knowledge. People hate the idea of spending time learning things, lean on LLMs to do everything for them, and in a few years wonder rage on Reddit about how they can't get a job because they get rejected for trying to use an LLM during an interview.",

You've already got the job and it sounds like you are producing at a level that is expected/acceptable.

Everyone starts at the beginning, and NOBODY learns EVERYTHING in school. Get to know them and you might find that they have some additional resources for you that are directly relevant to the kind of work you are doing. You may even find out that a few of them struggled in the beginning, just like yourself.If you don't want to get too personal, you could always just ask them directly about some of their favorite resources like books, YouTubers, or podcasts because you want to continue to grow.

It encourages knowledge gaps and creates a weird time dysphoria. Your work starts getting done pretty quickly, and you know that you don't quite know the material yet. But there's no time to study because you've submitted work and now there is more work on your plate. Then, you try to do something yourself without the llm and find out that there is no way you can possibly learn the material and submit your work before the work is due. OP Will have created an unachievable time frame for submitting work. However!! I think that you're downvotes are a little bit unfair. I absolutely believe that OP can learn a lot from LLMs. There is however, a responsible and ethical way to go about it. In order not to create a weird time dysphoria and knowledge gaps OP still needs to be the one producing the work. LLMs make a great research and reference tool for anyone looking to learn a new skill or improve upon the skill they already have. The trick is to ask better questions. Stop worrying so much about how to get your task done and instead ask why it should be done a certain way. Get deeper with the strategy of approach. Write the code yourself, and ask it for a critical review based on your goals. \" What have I missed?\", \" am I using best practices?\", \" what does it mean to have traceability?\"These are all questions that an LLM can help clarify and fill the knowledge Gap. OP needs to learn the language, so they can communicate with the senior developers in a productive way. Anyway, I gave you an upvote so that hopefully your comment is seen and taken seriously. It was very positive and encouraging.",

Moreover, being proactive and active on DE innovations and new products is of utmost importance. For example, If someone is still struggling with Fivetran/Airbyte to ingest data, and is not aware of dlt, even with LLMs they will keep struggling! And thank you so much for writing a detailed response and saying you gave me an upvote (hahaha), you must be a very kind person. I would love to be friends with you, I will follow you!",

Ultimately, that lies with the business and BAs, and application designers and owners to spec the data quality they want, and ensure data quality up front. For example, I can look at a view the business has recommended, and point out that it may have flaws and not return the data they are expecting from it, but it is up to them to decide what data they want to have. Where I do draw a hard line is if I know that there will be significant impact on a database that will hurt long term usability and cost for everyone.

Treat S3 as the \"immutable log\", partition by table then ingest date and hour using the Debezium event time ts\\_ms, and write Parquet with reasonable file sizes so Redshift can scan fast.In Redshift, instead of the sink, optionally, you can create an external table over staging for cheap ELT, then build a deduped view or table by using row\\_number over partition by primary key ordered by ts and the Debezium op so you keep the latest non delete.If you need a current table for BI, schedule a merge from that deduped view into a skinny current table with sort key on the primary key and updated\\_at. This avoids constant vacuum churn from doing small upserts, and you still get perf. If you need point in time queries, keep the bronze and build a silver that is deduped by key and day.Do you need only latest or point in time? Do deletes happen a lot or rare? How big are the hot tables and what is the 95p change rate?If you opt for the \"zero-ETL\" approach, for organization, keep your data in S3 partitioned like `s3://your-bucket/db_name/table_name/dt=YYYY/MM/DD/hr=HH/`. That layout plays nice with Redshift Spectrum and makes pruning way more effective when you're querying or loading batches. Helps a ton with downstream compaction and dedup too, since you can scope it to a smaller time window instead of scanning everything.Dedup pattern is primary key plus Debezium ts\\_ms or source commit lsn, with a tie breaker on op where create beats update beats delete. Partitioning matters for both Spectrum pruning and for batch merge windows, so compact small stuff like five minute files into larger hour files.Alternatively, if you want a no fuss route, Estuary can land CDC into Redshift with append only and handle dedupe and merges cleanly.

Do one pass to get the roster of IDs, store that set, then on each poll diff the set to find new and missing IDs.Here are a few things that worked for me in the past on similar issues: For updates, fetch in batches but avoid refetching everything every time. Keep a raw bronze table of the exact JSON per employee keyed by employee_id plus poll_time and a content_hash. If the hash changed since last poll, mark it changed and upsert into your modeled tables. If an ID disappears from the roster for a few consecutive polls, tombstone it. Add last_fetched_at and last_changed_at in your modeled table, and keep headers like ETag or Last Modified if the API gives them.Start with a tiny script using requests plus a small state store in Postgres (or just a json file), and land raw to object storage or DuckDB. Polling is still fine here, but tier it by heuristics. Recently created or recently changed IDs get polled more often, long lived records get sampled less. Backfill can be a manual trigger, then switch to a low frequency poll. This avoids full refresh while staying honest about data quality. roughly how many employees and what rate limit do you have, do you need SCD2 history or is last write wins fine, and how should deletes be represented in the warehouse?",

Easiest setup, no need to find duplicates or changed values. Daily rewrite of all employee data shouldn't be too bad. If there are limitations or API is really slow then you can fetch only new employees data daily and all data weekly, for example. You can used ID to figure which employees you already have.Slowest API I'm currently fetching data returns 5000 rows with one query and it takes little less than minute.

How is something not total shit? It depends on the feedback from your manager and your team as long as it's constructive and makes sense rather than comments like \"I don't like it\".Conceptually, most things you are going to make for a company should have the ambition to reach production, thus, it should be as complete as possible.If it's something only you use personally, then it doesn't matter what it looks like.If it's something somebody else will see or use, it shouldn't be shit. It should be predictable, easy to understand and use. Simple to make changes. Flexible for reuse. Testable to some degree (depends on your platform). Observable at all required points.

Usually you know what you are trying to achieve with a policy, so you can just go through the docs and find the right arguments. * Do you typically modify existing templates that your company has already created?Sometimes. Sometimes it's from scratch-ish if I'm setting up something that doesn't already exist. * Or is this task often handled by a dedicated DevOps, Cloud, or Security team, especially in larger companies?I don't know about larger companies, and even then I expect it would depend on the company. In the companies I've worked at (startups / medium) the data team had their own AWS sub-account where we could implement whatever tools/policies we wanted - the official devops folks were focused on production architecture. We definitely worked with them and did some security reviews tho. \\> Should I dive deep into the IAM JSON policy syntax, or is it more important to have a strong conceptual understanding of what permissions are needed for a pipeline, and then learn to adapt existing policies?Don't bother learning the syntax unless that's going to be 90% of your workload. Copy paste is going to be your friend, and then you can adapt as needed. Keep in mind the principle of least privilege and you'll be fine - you always start from zero and only add access to what you need. But what you need is gonna depend on what you're trying to do (read? write? etc.) Architecture is much harder than the syntax piece.",

But the majority of all that configuration/security stuff is handled by the other more senior Dev at my company who initially set up the AWS stuff. In my case its more like, \"Hey I'm trying to deploy this lambda that needs to access an S3 bucket but its blocking the access for the functions IAM role\". He then jumps on and configures whatever access my user account needs to be able to access. But then I still need to figure out how to write the Infrastructure correctly in the cloudformation template to tie everything together when I deploy it.Its literally just me and him though who are developers and we are just getting our feet wet with AWS at our company. So our infrastructure is not very complex and still not too tied into the AWS ecosystem. So the policies are quite basic.",

I'm probably not following what this subreddit would consider to be best practices, but here's what I did:* Built out a Python ETL platform that allows me to generate pipelines using JSON config files. The pipelines ingest Excel files directly from our local network, transform and clean the data, and pop it into an on-prem SQL Server database. My platform is modular and extensible, so I tend to add/update functionality as needed.* I use dev/test/prod environments in the DB but haven't done bronze/silver/gold layers. Monitoring is manual right now (log files!) but I plan to migrate to Prefect and/or implement some Power BI dashboards that consume my logs.* I avoid manually-managed documentation wherever possible, because that will be the first thing to go out of date. Instead, I'm using JSON schemas and GitHub Actions to automatically generate documentation for my config files on push, and docstrings + pdoc + GitHub Actions to do the same for my codebase. Only manually-maintained documentation is the top-level README for the repo.* Power BI is a star for me. Getting the on-prem gateway running was painful, but I've established dev/test/prod environments where I control access. Users can access the dashboards via Teams or, in some cases, export the semantic models to Excel for further analysis. I'm also using PBIB files so I can manage dev in GitHub.In terms of general approach, I would start slow and be responsive. Full-stack data analysis means you're also your own PM, so be sure to communicate well and be able to justify your choices to stakeholders. Figure out your P0 items that are crucial for what you're building and then go build it. As you work on this, you'll naturally identify new concerns and priorities and be able to respond to those. Having a vision for what you want to do will help you build for the future--for example, I want to manage my configs via a website, so I established JSON schema rules that unlocked automated documentation--but your vision should remain flexible.Good luck!(Edit: Formatting)",

You may be able to implement this with your ingestion pipeline. However, it seems like the next logical step is to get an actual database, like Postgres or SQL Server so that you can do indexing and schema enforcement. Then, design an API to push data to the database and ingest out of the database rather than sharepoint.If you cannot do this, one thing that might help is to implement data validation within the xls files.

We have detected that if there were cancelled/refunded orders on 29th/30th/31st, the total revenue of last month taken on 1st day is different than taking the total revenue on 3rd/4th day, where all the updates of the orders status should have been done already.I guess I am thinking about the \"true\" values that should exist on the database and in the API itself? I am sorry if I cannot explain it that good `what practical or business needs require a report that only needs to be updated once per month`Right. I am new to the job and this is a report requested from me by the team lead. We handle ecommerce websites and we want to determine the placements of the products on home page and best selling items section depending on the last month and last year's sales. Home page items are the most popular items and the best selling products are the top performers in revenue -- they could have some overlap.The once-per-month refresh is only on this report alone, but the rest of the reports being asked are all standard.",

        "body": "You are going about it in a weird way. Go back to your management and convince them to apply the concept of an analytics window. I have worked on this problem multiple times already, most notably with logistics. It’s the same concept with deliveries in that open orders on the last few days of the month will only be closed many days after. My advice is that you get the highest possible time that the order is closed, use that as your window, and only calculate by then. This is similar to intra-day calcs where hourly measures have maybe a window of a few minutes, a variance expectation, and an end-of-day resolution via batch job. As an example: if closing an order takes 4 days maximum like in your case, then calculate your close rate on the morning of the 5th. Basically, you’ve given all open orders from the previous month the appropriate waiting time to close. This way, you can properly report on them already.What of the still open orders by then? Consider them unresolved. This is an analytical tradeoff your management should accept on a monthly basis. If they find this problematic, then do multiple checkpoints: an initial view a day after the month (highest number of open orders), a view after the initial window, i.e. T+5, and a view maybe 2 weeks after. At that point, you should be able to have extreme confidence in your data. Variance should be very low, except in extreme outlier circumstances.If revenue is being tracked using this order system, well… you’re doing it wrong. Or rather your company is doing it wrong. They should be doing that off of your invoice system, not your analytical data. It can be a placeholder, sure, but nothing says money earned as well as money that actually arrived in the bank etc. The best you SHOULD tell your stakeholders is that this is estimated revenue from orders and that it is not indicative of actual money coming in. That is for the finance department to resolve, not yours. You’re a data engineer. And unless your name is Harry, you’re most probably not a wizard either.Overall, your approach can be solved by educating your stakeholder/client/management and reaching a compromise with them. Otherwise, you are in for a world of pain.",

Good data engineering benefits from a perspective that plants trees you'll probably not enjoy the shade of. Comment your code with intent, explain the reason why you are doing what you are doing in that moment in documentation and note when you are doing the same thing multiple times. When you first start it is often easy to build something that works initially but is ultimately not going to scale or isn't maintainable. Learning from those times helps you think about the bigger picture and understand the true scope of a given ask. Example: the company is recording things in Excel files and they want you to make some of the data available in a consolidated dashboard. You could just grab the specific data/fields from the files and write them to a database then point a dashboard to it. That would fulfill the request but then in 6 months they realize they want other data from those old Excel files and you need to reprocess them again to get the rest of the data. Whereas if at the start you consider the durability of the files and potential future needs vs. Cost of storage you may have taken everything from those files. Then when the ask for more of the data eventually comes you can provide the data in a fraction of the time and you've ensured that everything is backed up in case some accidentally deletes a source file.",

On one hand, you will have access to unlimited opportunities, use cases and business problems you can take on and go after yourself. On the other, you’ll find yourself cursing alot due to persistent frustration while this rocket wobbles all over the place. I tend to describe working at a startup as “an unlimited buffet”. You CAN eat until you throw up. But you must love the interim experience upto the point of throwing up in the metaphor. In terms of learning and growth, don’t expect someone to hold your hand, or build you a structured learning path or tell you what to do or how to do it. YOU are going to be doing all of that for yourself. Lastly, you will need to have a very high tolerance for frustration and lack of documented information, well defined standards and processes, crystal clear priorities and just pain overall. If you get frustrated easily because the business requirement wasn’t clear for you to immediately start coding your data pipeline or SQL query, then startups aren’t a viable place to work for you. Having said all of that, you WILL NOT find a more buzzing, lively and exciting opportunity to work and learn. It’s the same kind of thrill people get when going on those super risky rides, knowing that you might fall from the sky but the adrenaline rush of doing one is rewarding enough to go for it.

I haven't yet read the former but am reading through the latter. It's definitely a complicated book as it greatly goes into detail on different paradigms and applications. In fact, it may be a bit too dense too soon; either beforehand, or as they arrive, I would also look into tools that are similar to what your company is using. Learn what the differences are and try to understand why one may have decided to go with your current stack, and why one might want to move away from it.Lastly, for now, I stress paying attention to soft skills. I've been burned before being the only person at a start-up (kinda, it was complicated and I was largely separated from anyone else who may have been able to help, and they have largely different priorities). My boss had certain expectations that were tough to realize, partly because of these different priorities. I could've done better to manage them, to an extent.

Large Language Models use randomness in their response generation anyway, so there's a good chance this will give you some results in the case of a minor error. Just make sure you clear the LLM's cache if necessary so that it doesn't always give you the same result for a given input. More advanced approach would be to include the error message and the previous iteration of the pyspark code along with the repeated request. Yest more advanced approach would be to store error logs to disk and use those to generate some sort of repair prompt to be used in case of errors.Most important thing is to remember that if you've been doing any of these for more than five or six iterations and it still isn't working for you, that you're wasting time and should just write the code yourself.",

Also if you are using execute script type processors (especially with python), you should revisit to see what new native processors exist. If there aren't any that suit your needs then python as a first class citizen enables you to make custom processors. Lastly I know it was touched upon but there was a shift from flow.xml.gz to flow.json.gz, so depending on what your version is on 1.x you might need to hop twice for the encryption (mentioned) and conversion as both files exist for some later versions and only the json is needed in 2.x",

They did a lot of the coding in Python for the backend framework and I was working on SQL. My coding time was reduced to about 70%. The other 30% was largely meetings. In July, I got added to a second project. I became the lead on it and the project with the contractor. For the most part, I am now coding about 10% of the day, in meetings answering questions and asking questions about requirements for about 70% of the day, and the remaining 20% is architecture diagrams and code reviews. Except for this week where one of my contractors for my first project is OOO, and I am coding about 50% of this week to backfill him. TBH, you can't and shouldn't do this job if you aren't good at coding. Honestly, I have some gaps in my coding skills that I wish I didn't, but I don't have time to work through them.

Log-based CDC solves that but yeah, the tooling is mostly built for full-on streaming pipelines, not lightweight batch.There's a couple open-source options like `mysqlbinlog` or libraries like `go-mysql` and `maxwell`, but they’re super low-level. You end up writing a lot of glue code just to get something usable. Some folks hack together scripts that tail binlogs, write them to disk, and then batch-load into analytics systems, but that’s pretty fragile long-term.Are you pushing this into a warehouse? How often do you need fresh data? And how complex are your schemas (lots of deletes/updates or mostly inserts)?For what it’s worth, I work at Estuary, and we actually do log-based CDC (including MySQL binlogs) but abstract all the hard parts away. It’s more like “click to connect” and you get real-time or batched syncs with very little to manage. Kind of like Fivetran but way more flexible and with a transparent pricing.",

This compares to e.g. traditional Kimball approach where you must generate the identity keys on the dim and then join to reference then in the fact.The only dependency you would have is if e.g. a link table joins e.g. 2 source systems, the source data from both systems must be loaded before you build the link table to ensure you represent the complete relationship.",

The entire purpose behind RDBMS like Postgres is that it gives you these commands to operate on data locally with all the tooling to make it as efficient as possible because it understands the source and destination table structures.Merge statements would be very generic. You could make a pretty simple jinja template to use as a code generator, just putting the target table name and column names as params. Make that output a procedure definition, and as long as you stick to the pattern that's all you have to write manually. You should be able to automatically scrape all the parameters you need using information_schema -- the whole thing could be a single python script to automatically generate everything.You have your spark insert to a staging table (truncate first if you don't include a partition column), then run the procedure.If they don't want to deal with all of these objects too much, they can have a separate schema to put them in.Ultimately making spark do the work if figuring out what is an insert, update, or delete, is going to be very wasteful in shuffling data back-and-forth, and you're running two sets of compute when it could be one.",

        "body": "\"Azure Synapse SQL Dedicated and Serverless\", what? You've just used words from different technologies and slapped them together. Fabric offer pretty much nothing that Synapse doesn't - the \"one Lake\" approach is a new feature that dilutes the whole concept of \"single source of truth\". And Fabric doesn't support data flows.Synapse is a solution for enterprise needs, it can be optimised as you'd expect for that level of usage.Fabric is aimed at \"citizen\" developers, e.g. people who operate as individuals and pull reports together from different sources. The one thing fabric genuinely does better than Synapse is allows you to connect to data sources easily. It's not difficult in Synapse, it's just not very intuitive.The easiest way to envision is it: Data Factory does a bunch of legacy operations and support basically everything that on prem does, with no need to rewrite it all. it also offers newer ways of doing things but that's not what makes it useful IMO.Synapse offers true \"PAYG\" data processing which takes the load off your internal systems, and generally will be cheaper than Data Factory but needs a significant rewrite on new technologies (Such as Spark, Python) and a whole new approach to how things are processed. The upside is the power of the servers you can provision is massive, and you only pay for what you use - instead of paying for them 24/7.Fabric offers most of what Synapse does but has a very different interface to Synapse. It also leverages One Lake. The main difference is pricing. In Synapse you need to pay for each resource individually, but in Fabric you pay for \"capacity\" which can range from storage to processing - but it all comes under one payment.The reality is that Synapse is a great product that can operate alongside DF, and both of them utilise each other for specific functions, but Synapse is a whole new world. Fabric is aimed to try and give non technical people \"democratised\" data processing - which is a great idea but functionally is very close to giving someone 15 excel files and hoping they know what they're doing when they copy paste from them all that the data is correct at the end.All of these technologies need a data platform and approach - trying to sell Fabric as \"better\" is just wild. I know MS are pushing it, but having worked with all 3 technologies AND on prem, i can safely say there are more headaches in fabric than the others because it's solving a problem that data engineers didn't need solved.",

Yes, you need a data platform in both. But there are genuinely significant improvements in Fabric that aren't in Synapse.Yes, Synapse is a very capable platform. But it's also a challenging platform to use well. Synapse SQL Dedicated Pools make you choose between best performance (storing in its proprietary internal tables) and open formats (external tables). Scaling is offline, and disruptive. And they require a lot of tuning to get good performance out of them. Synapse Serverless SQL pools are better on that front, but have a lot of limitations of their own.I genuinely believe Fabric Warehouse is better than them. It gets rid of that division, and has many, many improvements elsewhere, from provisioning (scaling is online like Synapse Serverless SQL Pools, but faster and more intelligent), query optimization (overhauled and distinct from either Synapse SQL Pool offerings), query execution (improved beyond both previous products), and so on. I have worked on all 3 products, seen the customer experiences on all 3, and that's my honest opinion.Similarly, if you look at Fabric Spark, it has NEE, based on Gluten and Velox, to improve performance and lower costs:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/native-execution-engine-overview?tabs=sparksqlNote that Fabric Spark has a pay as you go billing option:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/autoscale-billing-for-spark-overviewThere have been discussions about expanding that to other workloads where it makes sense, but that's a question for PMs rather than me.Feature development is focused on Fabric these days, so the engines in Fabric will continue to improve further with time. And as I said above, I genuinely believe they're already significantly better than what we have in Synapse. And unfortunately, many of those improvements are not really feasible to bring to Synapse - we had to do very significant rearchitecting to deliver them, and that rearchitecting means it's not really feasible to put the improvements into the older products, they just weren't designed for it. Anyway, you don't have to agree with me, that's fine. This is my personal opinion; that's your personal opinion. Reasonable people can have differences of opinions.Thanks for sharing yours, hope this helps you understand mine a bit better too.",

Basically, each connector has a set of identical tasks, each one of which is a virtual thread in JVM. The tasks are distributed through all Kafka connect nodes, so each node has approximately the same number of running threads. Source connector tasks each have Kafka producer inside, while sink connector tasks have consumers. If you understand how simple producers and consumers work, you should easily understand why distributing Kafka Connect is much easier than Kafka itself, since most of the work is done by Kafka itself (storing consumer group offsets for example). The state of Kafka Connect is stored in special topics. Debugging should be the same as with any other JVM application. It's usually possible to run connector or task locally outside of running Connect cluster, and it's even easier so with SMT. It also supports JMX out of the box.The real problem is that many connector plugins are not open source (for example the ones from Confluent), so you have to rely on documentation and forums.",

What you can try to do on your local machine is setup a Postgres or MySQL whatever database, and install confluent Kafka. From there, set up a source connector that reads the latest inserts into a table and into a Kafka topic. And then after that, set up a sink connector to read from that topic and put it in another table. If you want, you can even practice doing some data manipulation in your config files as well. This is just a simple flow for Kafka connect that you can get to work on your own machine. Kafka Connect is simply a json file that you deploy to do all the easy pub and sub for you",

Typically, data engineers focus on analytics/ML pipelines where small delays or errors are tolerable, but customer-facing use cases demand strict correctness, reliability, and low latency. While data platforms (SQL, Airflow, Kafka) can support this, they weren’t originally designed for transactional, real-time customer interactions. In most cases, such logic is better handled by application services or APIs, with the data platform serving as a downstream system of record or for batch/analytical use. Mixing the two often increases risk unless the data platform is explicitly built with real-time, mission-critical guarantees.",

Many modern systems leave that complexity to the user, to make their implementation simpler. I've seen your posts and comments in r/MicrosoftFabric.So I'll point out this is exactly one of the places Fabric Warehouse excels - multi-table transactions, zero-copy clone to allow snapshotting without requiring duplication (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/tutorial-clone-table-portal), or Warehouse snapshots for Warehouse-wide snapshots without data duplication (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/warehouse-snapshot). Or time travel (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/time-travel), but that's more manual. If sticking to Spark, your best bet is likely to leverage its \"time travel\" too: (https://delta.io/blog/2023-02-01-delta-lake-time-travel/) But you've gotta manage what timestamps to query each table as of, which can be a pain.",

There are lots and lots of interesting programming resources, but *you* probably won't find them interesting because you don't find programming interesting.If you want to keep working at programming, let me suggest that you stop trying to learn to write code for a little while and instead learn about computing.

Not always in the nicest terms - I can remember one time the head of QA came to my desk yelling - but even then, he was just really focused on doing things right, he wasn't really mad at me as a person. And there have been a million times when I asked someone \"hey, can you take a look at this\" and they really went the extra mile.I started out thinking I would have to figure everything out for myself, but teamwork really is important even in this industry. Everyone that's been working in software for a while has experienced the frustration of being stuck, most folks enjoy feeling smart, and even most grumpy people know it's better to have their colleagues working effectively and not putting poorly-understood code into the code base.",

Interviews were all about algorithms and solving problems in isolation. on the job, 80% of the work was reading existing code, debugging, and figuring out how to add features without breaking stuff. Nobody expected me to know everything. Asking questions, googling, and learning on the fly was just part of the job.Another big surprise: how much soft skills matter. Clear communication, writing clean commits, and being able to explain trade-offs ended up being just as important as writing code.I’ve also noticed interviews themselves are changing — some companies now test you on real-world problems, system design, and even how well you use AI tools. Honestly, that feels closer to what the job is actually like.By the way, I recently wrote a detailed guide about how programming interviews are evolving in 2025. If you’re curious, it’s linked in my profile.",

        "body": "Well, my situation was a very different time initially: the 1990's. But since you asked... Ya, what surprised me was just how desperate a company was back then, and well into the early 2010's for anyone with programming/admin/networking/tech-support capabilities. Essentially, if you showed any prowess in those 4 areas what-so-ever (and especially if you had cursory basic knowledge of all 4 of them) then wow! Suddenly you became a kind of semi-hero in the work space? A kind of defacto tech support and programmer (even if that wasn't your main job!). ------------------------------The need was so great that... At that point, there's was pretty much nothing you could ever do to get fired! Like ya... I was younger at that time, and foolish, so even though I didn't control my emotions at some point and even yelled back at the senior founding partner of our firm, I still didn't get fired! I kid you not: I even got caught late at night in a rather compromising position with a certain colleague, in which her and I were inappropriately hitting it off... and then... well... hit it off one late night, when wouldn't you know it: that same senior partner came into the office unusually to check something. And kinda freaked, then backed out, and never spoke about it to me! (Ya, if that was today, I would have been long fired multiple times!)------------------------------Anyways... So, I actually got hired by a pretty well known international law firm as a technical writer, since I had done two entirely separate university degrees: one physics, and one English Literature. Ya, I know: that's a strange and weird combo, but those are my 2 loves in life! Despite the fact that unfortunately I'm not all that good in either of them, lol! But the law firm dealt in many aspects related to the sciences and engineering, ranging from patents to immigration of highly talented people, etc... So they needed someone who could read scientific papers, and be semi-decent at writing. (As you can see from the length of this comment, I'm a pretty crazy writer: always constantly writing. Just not anything all that good! But still always writing, and I can type at about 90 to 100 words per minute.) ------------------------------Finally to get to the point, not only did I do technical writing... But if anyone had a problem with their computer in the office, my phone line would light up and ring (if the main tech-guy/admin wasn't there yet in the morning, or was already busy). And then people would approach me to help them automate some tasks. So believe it or not, I would actually use C++ (taping into Win32) combined with a program called \"Autohotkey\" to do scripting and automation! Like who uses C++ of all things, to do quick scripting and automation tasks!? Well apparently that would be me! ------------------------------But ya, I got the job after I graduated with my second degree, and boy was I surprised by me being thrust into that role, and just rapidly utilizing anything I knew to get the job done, even if it wasn't anything close to 100% the correct language or solution model for the problem. Just as long as it worked, mostly glitch free, then nobody gave a flying F what programming language or tool I used to get the job done. And because of that, they never-ever-ever wanted to fire me, even though they had to scold me several times. ------------------------------Fast forward to today, and ya... Times have really changed, mostly for the worse in this field unfortunately. I worry the good old fashioned crazy pure days of fun are behind us now in the tech sector, and companies have turned something great into something of misery... Aka: the enshittification of everything by corporations, CEO's and MBA bro culture.",

        "body": "I've been on the other side: interviewing candidates for entry level back-end focused dev positions. Here's my thoughts. Active Github profile (daily commits) - not important. \"Daily commits\" is especially not important, some days you just aren't going to have code worth committing. The important part is _having worked on a project of nontrivial complexity_. You had a problem and you tried to solve it... how did you approach the problem, and why did you choose the solution you did? Talking about the candidate's prior work is very valuable as the person trying to understand if the candidate in front of me might be a good fit. Well-structured and documented programs (Modular & uses Swagger) - maybe of interest, but just having used tools like OpenAPI (which is the name of the spec for what was called \"swagger\" btw) or readthedocs or redoc doesn't actually tell me anything. Remember, I'm trying to figure out your approach to solving engineering problems. Does slapping swagger-ui into a maven project mean you're any more informed about how or why to use such a tool? Not necessarily. Now, if what you developed had an external API with users that needed to know about/test your endpoints, that's something worth asking about. This could dovetail into asking about other tools like Postman. \"Well structured\" is too vague of advice and honestly I'd be wary of anyone preaching this to a new developer. Trying to perfectly architect your work in progress ToDo app is not a good use of time. Get your hands dirty. Learning from mistakes and iterating is the name of the game. Waxing philosophic about how you wanted your first app to scale to thousands of users might be relevant if you're interviewing at Netflix, but anywhere else it's probably just signalling that you didn't really understand when it's appropriate to use the tools at hand, or worse, that you might be the kind of junior dev who needlessly introduces more compexity. Projects - yes, very important. Your plan is simple but if you follow through you will be fine. The only thing that stands out to me is that you don't have concrete examples for your projects. You should pick problem(s) that sounds interesting to you and then just work on them. You will inevitably run into topics that you know nothing about (how do I hook up my server to my database? how do I expose this API endpoint? how do I secure my endpoint behind basic AuthN? if my project is depending on other services, how do I rate limit my service so that I don't get angry emails/IP blocked from those services? is there some way I can process this data more efficiently?). If you are able to work on any actively maintained open source project, you can get some \"real\" dev experience before getting your first job.Here are some of the kinds of basic questions I have in my interview template: * What do you do in your current position (if any)? * What side projects have you worked on? Which languages do you use or which are you learning?* How familiar are you with ? (e.g. Spring, React, etc)* Have you used git or other source control tools? Have you submitted (or reviewed and approved) a pull request before?* Do you know what a unit test is? What do you think is the point of tests?* Walk me through your side project (if any). What was your role, how did the design go, what were any challenges you ran into? What would you have changed?* * Can you talk about a situation where someone disagreed with your recommendation, or vice versa, on an important aspect of a project?",

This works ok for relatively simple code bases, but any job you will want will expect it, even if the code seems trivial.Rather than manually testing your code, just write unit tests. Want to see if something you wrote works? The first time you execute it should be with unit tests. View the tests as a developer tool to give you an easy way to execute the code you are working on.As the complexity grows, manually testing all the scenarios will become infeasible and a waste of your time. Tests will safeguard you from accidentally breaking something, and tell you exactly what is broken when you do.As for test driven development I think that is a bit extreme. I rarely write tests first, usually only when I have a bug I want to make sure the test exposes so I know the test exposes it and the fix actually fixes the issue. But once I have enough code written to start executing it, I execute it with unit tests until I’m reasonably confident it works as intended. Then I run it a few times for the gratification of using it, then move on to the next enhancement.Demonstrating that you do this in the code you are writing to demonstrate an ability to be a junior dev will help you stand out from the huge number of people that don’t.",

It's good to copy once or twice and follow along tutorials to get a baseline, youve got that part down, but you aren't proving you've learned how to build shit by doing that. You need to reframe how you go about this and treat it like learning an actual spoken language. You learn some nouns and verbs (keywords in programming), then you learn some concepts and combine those with your vocabulary (grammar), but you will never be able to speak with just that (speaking = programming).You can pass a Japanese test and technically \"know\" Japanese this way, but you'll never be able to express your own thoughts to a native. In the same way you can't program your own apps. If you want to progress beyond the beginners at your stage and speed up your learning, paradoxically you need to slow down. Pause the \"studying\" and \"learning\" you're doing for now and do the same thing youd do for learning a spoken language. Take what you know and form your own sentences and evaluate where you get lost and what you need to learn more of. Speaking a language = coding a project. Coding is NOT and will not ever be the most difficult part about being a programmer. Coding is hard for beginners and anyone that tells you that coding is the hard part likely does not understand what programming actually is. Build something, and when you finish build something else. Occasionally rebuild something youve already built, maybe add some new tricks youve learned to speed the process up or add features you were unable to the first time.And \"i can't build anything yet\" is not an acceptable answer. Day one of a spoken language course you learn how to say \"hello\", day one of a coding course you learn how to say \"Hello World\". Thats a project in the same way that a simple sentence in Japanese is. It's not impressive, but it is by definition a project. Now add complexity to your app. Can you print \"something besides Hello World? Can you make it print that new phrase 10 times? Can you print out what a user types? Can you make that phrase print 10 times? Can you take in more than one string of user input? If you know how to do those things, you should be able to bang your head against a wall and build a calculator. A little more complicated than \"Hello World\" and takes quite a bit more work, but building it is a lot more feasible than you think. Coding isnt hard. But it takes practice. You've studied, thats great, but you need to put the books aside and go to the gym and get some reps in.",

Knowledge acquisition doesn’t always require understanding before exposure, often repetitive exposure to things that don’t make sense is the foundation of knowledge. It’s how we all learned to speak. Our brains are actually designed to work this way.So if you are retyping programming basics like loops, syntax, the use of built in methods, turning an array into a map, the elements of a form that go together, and the js methods that move the info from the front end to the back end, the shape of classes and functions, event listeners and their methods, etc… I think that stuff is okay to copy as long as you type it out line by line. It’s hard to tell while you’re doing it, but you are learning things just by transposing them from the screen through your keyboard. You will inevitably miss a symbol or a letter and you’ll have to scan through and figure out what went wrong. This will help you gain deeper understanding. Eventually you see the patterns. Seemingly disconnected confusing things start to become connected and organized. At its heart programming is us training ourselves to be conscious of subconscious steps. Like we never have to think of every individual step of putting on a t-shirt. We just know how to do it. I believe when we program our brain begins to subconsciously understand what is happening which is why (after it clicks) sometimes coding can feel like magic, and why we have to reread and relearn code we wrote two weeks ago. If you find yourself copying something that looks familiar too often I would say take some time and focus on the use of that thing by itself. But if you copy paste you’re mostly not learning.",

Start by figuring out the data types of the parameters and return value.1. Next, implement the base case.1. Take a leap of faith and assume your recursive function magically returns the correct value, and write your recursive case.1. First Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call cannot be the original argument.1. Second Caveat: The argument to the recursive function call must ALWAYS get closer to the base case.The main thing to know is that recursion is mostly overrated. If your problem involves both 1) a tree structure and 2) back tracking, then it's a good candidate for recursion. Otherwise, if you find yourself asking, \"Why couldn't I just do this with a loop\" then you're right: it's a poor candidate for recursion and you should just use the simpler loop solution.",

But you'd need one stack for the file scanner objects (representing the system's view of the directories you had descended) and another for the data you were building for each directory... and you'd carefully inspect each file object, and push a new file scanner if it was a directory, and carefully handle your end-of-scan issues at each level, popping both stacks... it could get tricky.Now consider doing it with recursion. You imagine the functional interface you want – let's say, a File, and a DataSoFar. Consider your base case – is the File a simple file, not a directory? Great, you're done. Produce your output. Otherwise you need to recurse – okay, it's a directory: update DataSoFar, create a scanner from the File, loop through the scanner and call your function on each of the files. Boom, done. The book-keeping and boundary conditions are handled for you by the program stack, and you stick to familiar function calling and error-handling idioms.The key leap for me is always that imaginative step: *what's the functional interface I wish I could use to solve one step of this problem?* Recursion sometimes allows you to achieve that interface with minimal effort and great clarity.",

If you can/are allowed to, try putting the messy codebase into a LLM, and use the prompt to query about it.

        "body": "Don’t aim at perfection. Aim at what other people thinks is readable and comprehensible. You will find out with time that different teams have different styles. Any large enough codebase is very arcane at first. At a job, you have team mates that can help you make sense of it. You know you understand the code when you start to see what could be changed.That being said, there are actual practices that can be part of the team style that will result in messy and unreadable spaghetti given enough time. The thing where you said ”we just override stuff in CSS” rings some alarms in my head, but it all depends on how and why things are overridden. Are you overriding stuff because they were defined inside a library code? Could be good, you don’t want to modify anything inside the node_modules folder, and you being weirded out by it is just inexperience. Are you constantly overriding whatever the previous css was and now you have 5 classes that aren’t used anywhere? Really bad, your whole css packbcould be a giant mess.About the JS being hard to trace and split every where… it’s also really hard to infer if you are right or wrong here without looking at the codebase you are criticising. Keep in mind you haven’t sent it all yet, and sometimes, once you see the logic and decisions that are behind a certain way they organized their files, what looks messy to you now becomes manageable. Large code bases will take time to grasp even with a team that can guide you thru it.With the tutorials…. Are you really looking for ”how to make an endpoint” or are you still looking for ”how to create the thing in my head exactly”? Here’s the deal: authentication: that’s an endpoint. ORMs: do you understand what and ORM is? You can build endpoints without databases, but for a project that DOES something useful, it rarely makes sense to do so. And with databases come a lot of boilerplate that you have to code every time but really would rather not…I understand the desire to study things separately, but a lottor tutorials mash things together because they make sense together. Keep in mind that in the simplest form, an endpoint is just an ”URL” that sends you back something specific. You can make just send ”hello” back, or some hard coded object and not setup a whole database and ORM for it. That however, teaches you about endpoints, but not exactly why you’d want to use an endpoint for. Now if I slap authentication into it…. I’m teaching you not only ”using endpoints for authentication is common”, but also how to do it in an ok way, and that you probably dont want anyone accessing a database without authentication. There’s a chance here the tutorials you are watching aren’t great. A 2minutes tutorial really barely has time to show some very specific example, let alone explain the reasons for anything. I can recommend blue collar coder tutorials. He will explain why he’s doing this thing this way, so later you can decide for yourself if his approach works for your project or not.The deeper you go and the more knowledgeable you are, the less tutorials will help you. Once you dive into advanced enough territory, there’s no ”find a video who shows me how robust this library in this way”. You either have to find tutorials that fit for parts of what you want to do, like how do I use this specific ORM or dive into docs and leave tutorials behind altogether.",

        "body": "I think it might be a little bit of a misunderstanding to hear different programmers experiences about their work hours and relate that to their efficiency as a programmer. Some of us are working on legacy systems that are so vast and full of engineering debt that we could never hope to make more than small changes at a time, lest we cripple an entire business model in some catastrophic way. And sometimes the expectations of the work environment dramatically shift leaving programmers with much more to do. Environment has everything to do with it. Programmers who are first in line at a start-up building brand new products from scratch are going to go blazing fast, while those working in enterprises with bureaucracy and existing customers will need to move much more purposefully. Finally, you have to consider that different programmers will target different career velocity.With that out of the way I also have an answer to the specific question about productivity.**Become a master of your debugging tools**Knowing how to use breakpoints, conditional breakpoints, logging services and query languages for interpreting your logs is critical. If you're operating live services you probably also want to start picking up the ability to analyze and understand crash dumps and memory dumps. The difference in velocity between a developer who can do these things, and one who can't is immense.**Find the true requirements**Don't trust your managers, PM's, or customers to be able to convey what needs to be done. Communication is the hardest part of the whole job and it's everyone's responsibility to be engaged and active in the conversation. That means you are speaking up, asking questions, understanding the why and how. When appropriate, suggest alternate solutions that make more sense than what comes out of the requirements machine. You'll save yourself a huge headache and a lot of time over massaging semi-correct requirements to be a functional product.**Code isn't always the answer**To a hammer every problem is a nail, and to a programmer every solution is code. But what makes a really great developer is getting out of the IDE every once in a while and getting a birds-eye view on the whole operation. There are mountains of tools available to us that aren't code for solving problems. It's all programming at the end of the day, just with different primitives. But if you can meet a business requirement with a $20 off the shelf solution that already exists... define a process that eliminates your requirement at no cost, or hook up some existing set of systems in such a way that you solve what would otherwise have been a large problem with little to no code that's a big win.Remember, every line of code you write needs to be tested. Kept up to date with changing requirements and compliance demands. Maintained for the lifetime of the product. Code is expensive.**Cut out the distractions**Yeah, I know, you work better while listening to youtube and passively grinding your firemaking cape isn't really that much of an attention suck. You're still getting work done. But... how about just doing those things later because regardless about how you *feel* about your distractions impact, they are slowing you down. Humans aren't particularly good at multi-tasking. And while you might be moving forward, you won't know what things you wouldn't have missed without the distraction. I listen to music without lyrics while I code, that's my personal compromise. Over the long term of many years examining myself it's evident that I'll be less productive with anything more engaging than that in front of me.**Collaborate**I wish I saw more of this. Especially in a world where many of us are working remotely, or in isolated cubical/office spaces. All of the things I've described above are easier to do when you don't do them alone. Get a teammate who's on the same page as you in terms of increasing velocity by taking your work seriously and then do it together. Sit side by side and engage in coding 'sprints' where you push for continuous progress for 20 minute periods at a time. Then rest, then repeat. Have pair programming blocks, where you work together on the same problem for an hour. Give space for 'state of the code' discussions where you just talk about what engineering problems you're encountering, and what choices or projects might change things to improve the engineering environment.**Take breaks**After so many hours of cranking out solutions, you'll get fatigued and slow. I remember grinding in school, getting stuck and getting frustrated near the deadline for a project. I'd spend 4 hours making meaningful progress, and then 8 just being confused, tired, and frustrated. Only to get 6 hours of sleep, wake up in the morning and look at my project and suddenly it was all clear. Take your breaks. Eat regular meals. Get exercise. Be well. When you're in a healthy state your brain will function better.",

Any time you have to change the domain the amount of work to accomplish anything becomes dramatically worse.3. While not trying to prematurely optimize your code, focus on creating DRY code by building libraries of common functions.4. Identify common patterns and create snippets or generators to quickly reproduce them. This offloads a lot of cognitive overhead and is far less error-prone than cutting and pasting code.5. Emphasize sold engineering practices from the start. Far too often people skip unit tests or write brittle code to move faster, but you're building the foundation of your system on sand.

Ideally, you would plan out your work using pseudo code for more simple problems and take it from there.The reason why you, and many novices draw a blank, when approaching problems is because you are not used to a kind of “split thinking” that eventually resolves as you gain programming experience:1.

(I still get stuckIt's important to bring it outside your head, or you'll just sit there thinking in circles.A basic example. I want a flashcard app for learning language L. First thoughts is I need to have two sets of words, I need to display them and I need to take input. Maybe a database? A gui? Do I know any database? No, okey... do I know any gui? No, do I learn one? Where do I get the words? Do I input them? Do I use any cloud solution?This never ending circle of questions, or you could just write a function that takes a word of language L and a word of language K then it returns true if it's correct. Internally it finds the L word in list L and checks if K word matches the word at the same index in list K. This is your core mechanic AND database. You can go even lower and make sure you can match strings at all.GUI? Once you start considering libraries and frameworks... thats a whole can of worms on it's own...print to terminal first. Solve it \"yourself\" as much as possible first because many 3rd party software is not helpful for you yet. They are complicated and huge because they can handle so much.. add them later.Wordlist? Hardcode it, then use csv or json. Same as above, switch when it is more work not switching.The app prototype is done and now you have a much better chance of planning anything or finding answers.Don't be afraid to write bad code. It's much better to \"fail early\". I recommend googling that term.",

The next time you are building one of your own creations, you have some ideas of what pieces you have and how they could be used, so you disassemble some of your sets, and try to use the pieces in different ways in your own creation. Maybe it'll work, and you have to order more pieces like it - or it won't work and you have to imagine something else.When not building you are sorting your pieces, experimenting with connecting them in different ways, trying out small techniques outside of large projects, and you get ideas for how you also could use those pieces, maybe you even get an idea for a large project using the pieces that way!Also, you follow builders on social media, and talk with other builders, asking for inspiration, looking inside their creations, and you are always learning!When you have an idea for something, but absolute no knowledge of how to build it, you try sketching it, experiment with the pieces you have, will this fit? No, well how about this? Maybe if I turn that one that way?You won't always succeed, and some projects might be abandoned, but you are always learning! Don't ever expect to \"see\" the magical piece that will solve your exact problem, if you have never worked on anything even remotely similar, or even seen pieces anywhere close to what you need!And don't think that you'll immediately get to know thousands of pieces and how they connect - sometimes you will have to make things \"the wrong way\", or simply \"fake\" them, make a function that pretends to do the work for you, until you learn the right way. Take a look at the LEGO creations by young kids, they almost never look exactly like they should, but they are an appromixation.So, answer 1 is: always be learning, experiment with what you have, try to solve it close enough. And answer 2 is: Don't try to look for the perfect solution when you only know 1% of everything that is - look around you, and see if you can get just a little closer to your goal!

If you come show it to reddit you might get responses of \"that's neat, but why didn't you just use `${standard solution you didn't know about}`?\" In that case, worst case you've learned something, best case you've inadvertently created the next standard solution.When asking for help it's also good to try to avoid the [XY problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem) where you have problem _X_ but you think _Y_ is the solution, so _Y_ is what you ask about.There's also often no _one right way_ in programming. We have ideologies, just like in other walks of life, and different preferred solutions and strategies as a result. Generally you just want some solution that* gives you the output you want using a reasonable amount of resources (this one is pretty universal), and* does so in a manner that _you_ understand (this one varies a lot).",

One thing that helps me is using something to keep track of that sort of thing - a folder, a bookmark app, anything where you can drop everything you come across that makes you go \"that's cool/useful/whatever\" but isn't directly related to what you're doing *now*. Without that, a five minute research search can end with me realizing it's 2 am and I've gotten nothing done. As for the rest... it really is just experience, and not feeling bad about the fact that you still need to look stuff up X years in. For example, I've been using PHP for like 20 years and I still have to look up simple functions because I forget the syntax *all the time*. Who cares, though? I know what it does and how it works, not remembering what comes first in a substring isn't the end of the world.For me, at least, becoming a better programmer is less about memorization or always knowing what the right \"piece\" is, and is more about a general understanding and \"feel\" for how things work. You might not know if a specific function exists to do what you want, and it sucks to spend the time working on something only to find out later it was as easy as using a function that already exists, but it's probably going to happen to you more than once - but now you know the function exists and you know how to work without it. Figuring out how to do something, even the most trivial \"I'll never need to do this again\" thing, is never a *bad* thing and will help you grow. Maybe later you'll be learning another language that's similar but it doesn't have an applicable function for what you were doing, and it's not a problem because you know how to do it by hand. This probably isn't the most realistic example, the point is that I try to never look at \"I just did more than I needed to\" as a negative as long as it's not causing you to miss deadlines (and as long as it's not happening constantly).I'm hesitant to push AI as it's really easy to become overly reliant on it, and you should never rely on code AI slings out without vetting it yourself, but if you treat it like a search engine it's certainly a lot easier to say \"I'm trying to do X with Y and am wondering what methods others currently use\" than to try and get the perfect Google search or scroll through docs.It never hurts to join a coding community, either. I haven't done that since usenet but I'm sure there are discords or whatever out there.",

I would also suggest that you start making games in your spare time and maybe look at Unreal Engine that uses C++.If you don’t have anybody to network with within the industry it will be very difficult to get into too, you need to find game dev gatherings for regular meetups to get your name out there.

It's another package manager like poetry but imo is easier to setup, and faster. Does the same thing as poetry but just better in most cases I've found.Other languages usually have built-in tools (npm for nodejs, and cargo for rust) or have 3rd party tools (yarn for nodejs) that manage this stuff for you.You can always just build a .venv yourself but you generally have to track package versions yourself and ensure compatibility.",

But I'll share a book you can start with: System Design on AWS, by by Jayanth Kumar and Mandeep Singh. The first 8 chapters are a very decent intro into the foundations of system design (and you can stop there if you're not ready for AWS specifics yet).",

But when the complexity of your tasks increases, it becomes a completely different language. So you might argue that it's \"flexible\" that way. Easy to use for easy stuff, but can support any level of complexity (and gets harder to use as complexity grows).Rust is also great because it's a very modern, very safe, relatively easy language to use for systems programming; as a replacement to C or C++. It can be used for embedded/micro-controllers as well, it just isn't very popular in that regard yet.Admittedly, I started learning Rust and built a few projects in it. However, I eventually dropped it in favor of Go (which better fits my use cases). Additionally, at this point in time, Zig looks a lot more interesting to me than Rust (if I were to dip lower-level again).I have no clue if the book is worth reading or not.",

(I joke, I like Rust overall).Once you get into writing things the Rust way (TM?) you get to worry less (but not forget about completely) memory bugs that can cause crashes or be exploited. The benefits are many and varied. Rust also has a nice type system if you're into that, and nice language-level support for tagged/discriminated unions, and matching. If you're into function style/idioms, you'll feel at home, but if you're used to OOP there's plenty to recognise too, e.g. struct/impl/traits. I've often said my ideal general purpose HLL would be a cross between C and Rust (yes, I know about Zig and Odin), because I like both but find Rust annoying to write (especially when code involves lots of explicit lifetime annotation) and visually quite information-dense (IMO).I much prefer C, me/my teams rarely have most of the issues that the Rust compiler guards against, but nobody who likes Rust believes you when you say that :) I like to configure debug and release builds from the get go, and use the sanitisers (address etc.) in debug always. I have a big list of flags I use for compilation config built up over the years. LSPs and a parser (e.g. treesitter) catch some typos (e.g. . instead of -> or missing a \\*/& etc.) too.Rust has no bearing on your Azure cert AFAIK, and to be honest it hasn't seen massive uptake commercially (yet?). I know lots of businesses (previous employers or places friends work) that are still using C and/or C++ with no interest even in committing to writing new software in Rust, let alone rewriting anything existing, anecdotally. I say this to say that the Rust job market isn't what it is for other languages (e.g. your C#, Java, others like JS and Python) which are seeing lots of use in recent years.There are also better languages if you want to learn how to manage memory freely, as Rust enforces it's particular model.TLDR; Learn Rust because you want to. Don't if you don't. You aren't disadvantaging yourself by not learning it, and it's fairly easily picked up if need be once you've been programming a while. It can be used to write fast, robust native software. I use ripgrep, fd, every day.",

What makes that example hard is that you're trying to have it learn from just the pixels and there are millions of pixels in the image.If you have a problem that just has a few numbers as input, classifying that is going to be easier.As an example if you wanted to classify whether a book is a novel or textbook based on the width, height, number of chapters, and number of pages, you could probably do that with 100 examples.",

I tell you what, writing all layers with backprop on your own gives you insight like not many people in AI actually have. BUT I noticed that it doesn' matter, WHY? because you have to look at what you're doing with life from perspective of risk / reward ratio... pytorch is great place to start, with llm copilot in chat only. so you'll have to learn theory then practice on small things... I thing classification is enough for you to understand that you're at the day 1 of rabbit hole which can take you years... I've found best solution is to leverage existing codebases of communities and combining these into your own api as true engineer should have... but yeah I get it without getting hands dirsty first I'd not be able to do this... To answer you question you would be surprised on how small neural nets can outperform PR shit from open AI... just recently I read PR article how someone came up with udoku solver reasoning model, that was aha and suddely haha moment when you realize they just pulled bazooka to kill the fly only because it's trending :)",

There is no tutorial, there is no shortcut.Tutorials/courses can teach you the basic skills; they can lay the *foundation*. It is upon you to build the house brick by brick, floor by floor.You start with small, simple games and work your way up.Take the game engine of your choice (I'd recommend Godot for starters) and build something simple, something like e.g. *Tic-Tac-Toe*. Then venture into more complex territory, e.g. something like *Battleships*. Then, move on to more complex tasks, e.g. *Sokoban (Box Pusher)* - these are all fairly simple to make games that will each teach you a lot. To get something more dynamic, the classic *Pong* or *Breakout (Arkanoid clone)* are good starts, but only after you have progressed enough. Make a *Pacman* clone. Using old games has the advantage that the entire *game mechanics* are well known and well documented.When you gradually build up your skills you can always venture into larger, more complex games, make the switch from 2D to 2.5D (often also wrongly called Isometric) to 3D.With each game you make you will improve your skills, *provided* that you don't just do tutorial after tutorial that creates the game *for* you. At utmost, use the tutorials as inspiration and try to make things on your own. Then, if you fail and can't find a solution, look at the tutorial to see how they did it. Don't just copy the tutorial. First, try on your own. Experimenting, trying, failing, fixing are all part of learning, copying is not learning.Also, games are developed *incrementally*. They start with simple mechanics, e.g. how to interact with the player, how to set up the levels, etc. Then, they work with the collisions, and so on. Commonly, the *game art* is quite far towards the end of the development. Sure, you need to know roughly how big your game entities (players, enemies, background, etc.) will be but you don't need to have them fully developed at the start.Get things working first and then make them good and pretty.",

For example the theme might be \"Light and Dark\", what kind of simple game can you come up with around those two concepts.A more complex game would be perhaps a platformer, keep it to a single side scrolling map and add in the things you want to try.Don't try a first person shooter, and definitely don't try an RPG as your first games, they are ridiculously complicated in comparison.There is bound to be a local game development community in your country you can connect with to get help in various aspects and collaborate with people on.

Feel free to google those keywords yourself, but to start you could look at Vue.js for your frontend, Python’s Flask for your backend, and a NoSQL option like Firebase’s Firestore for your database.Alternatively, if you plan on running the website off of your computer, you could straight up just use file storage on your device as the database with CSV, JSON, or XML files.Explaining how all of these parts work together up front would turn this into an essay, but for reference I have not worked with web technology, HTML/CSS/JS, or Python in over a year and I have a solid prototype web app up and running after only a week (40hrs) of development time. All it takes is a lot of googling and some patience. You don’t need to know the entirety of each language to get this up and running, honestly just start developing and learn as you go.PS: please do not attempt to use AI to make this whole thing for you. It will make up functions that don’t exist and do many other incorrect things and the end result will be you bashing your head against a wall wondering why your website doesn’t work.

Something I would recommend, if you are in the US, is looking through your state's ETPL list and seeing if there are coding apprenticeships you can apply to that can be covered through WIOA funding. This way, you can get the experience without more loans and sometimes they will even pay you. Sometimes, the companies offering the apprenticeship or their clients will hire the apprentice, which is an easy start in the industry. Also - don't fear AI. AI needs developers and coders to survive. You are on the right path!",

Maybe you are learning a new language, a new framework, a new library. That is useful as a preparation for other things to come.Work? Yes, yes ... That will be how you sustain yourself, but most likely, if you are a craftsman, or artist, work will be less interesting, than your own projects. As you progress in skill, your work will probably be simpler, more rote, than your own projects.About interviews: Don't forget, that interviews are a stress situation. Depending on the person, mostly what they test is stress resilience, not your computer programming skill. What you are describing about being given 2h and a bunch of files ... That might as well be badly designed code, that is a trap into bad design. In such a situation you might have to deal with the shit you are given as code, but keep an open mind to alternative solutions.I have been working for 7y mostly using Python and still I did no good in interviews with live coding. Sometimes it was the requirements, that were too narrow, them expecting one particular solution. Other times I was too nervous and simply couldn't think straight. In contrast to my work experience, in which I basically built a company from the ground up, at least on the technical side, and on my own designed and developed multiple still maintained services, that make the company their money.So mostly my interviewing experience has been quite shit, and it can happen to everyone.

Build something where you have to think on a higher level of abstraction than while-loops and if-statements, struggle with understanding the framework, and use all your knowledge of the language to build something 'standard'.You are \"done\" with learning the programming language, now you have to learn how to build programs - and the easiest way to get started is to follow advanced tutorials, and notice repeating patterns in the way they build things!Also, don't forget about the interview-exam - store it somewhere, and pick it up again in a few weeks, try to see if it suddenly becomes easier.",

Actually do the documentation and planning as if it were a company and write a report after explaining everything and going through pros and cons. Do it on a basic project you think you can do first to see how you’d like to implement it. Then pick a framework Python -> Flask -> Jinja, web app. Use your next project to learn that framework work. Do the analysis, do the planning, make the design and run proper testing and reports.

Do you mean how the computer even starts up, where it gets the programs from?If so:Every computer has some form of persistent memory, the BIOS (Basic Input Output System) where the bootstrap code is stored (in modern times, this is the UEFI BIOS with some more data and programming).A CPU only knows one thing: to look at a certain address in a memory (typically address 0) and execute whatever is there.The BIOS of a computer has the bootstrap program at exactly that address stored. In the former days, this was an actual ROM, now it is usually some form of erasable programmable memory, like an EEPROM.The BIOS then has all the code to carry out the POST (Power On Self Test), plus libraries/functionality to talk with the various hardware components, and the code to then start, in case of a PC, the Operating System, of which the boot-loader is stored in a certain place on the hard drive (SSD, nVme, etc) of the computer.In case of the modern UEFI BIOS, this system is usually also stored on the computer's hard drive, but also exists in a storage on the main board so that when you change the hard drive, the computer can still boot.A good start to understand how everything of this plays together is to look into Microcontrollers, like the 8031/8051, Atmel (Arduino) as they are basically the same as a PC minus the operating system.",

For example:```rubybinary = Fisk.new.asm do push rbp mov rbp, rsp int lit(3) pop rbp retend```Fisk is a vanilla ruby package that uses metaprogramming to create an x86 assembler within Ruby.

Don’t jump between too many languages at once.Rebuild small projects you already know — a todo app, a notes app, a basic API. The muscle memory comes back fast.Use AI tools as your coding buddy. These days, knowing how to prompt an AI and debug its output is almost as important as raw coding skills.Document everything. Push to GitHub from day one (even tiny projects) so you never lose progress again.Think portfolio, not perfection. Build stuff that excites you — it’s way more motivating than tutorials.I actually wrote a piece about choosing the right programming language and career path based on your strengths. A lot of people who come back to coding after a break get stuck on where to restart, and that’s exactly what I tried to answer. It’s linked in my profile if you want to check it out.You’ve already got the mindset right — just starting again for yourself. That’s honestly the hardest part.

If the goal is *learning*, AI gives us something no classroom, no course, no forum, no coworker ever could: the freedom to ask any “silly” question without being judged. And that’s the essence of learning — keep asking questions until you really understand. If you asked the same thing on StackOverflow, most likely you’d just get “duplication post.”As for AI giving overly complex answers: that’s where prompting is part of the skill. You can always tell it to “make it simpler” or “show me the beginner version.” Prompting itself is a learning process.",

Here's my suggestions for what's been helping me.First start your own open source project. Work on a project you want to build, but look up the work flow and follow a basic structure large repos might use and make a CONTRIBUTING file based on some real ones from other projects. You can use it to learn forking, how do write an issue, how to write a PR, how to merge commits. When you're doing it make sure you write everything like you're writing it for someone else and tag any really easy things with good first issue. These will often get picked up by others. Then you'll get a chance to see the basics of what maintainers are looking for in other people's code, and you'll get experience with light collaboration with others. After doing this for a while you'll feel way more confident in how to contribute. Then you just have to find issues that are within your scope. That's easier said than done, but I'd look for medium sized projects that aren't as well know. At that point you'll have some experience and you can look to helping out in larger and larger projects.It's not a fast process, but I've found it rewarding so far.",

If after almost 5 years, and you can’t find the spare time to study coding this might not be the profession for you.I know very little based on your post about your current skillset, but if it as bad as you make it out to be, you might be better off going a product manager route for your upcoming project. These roles are always undervalued and under represented in big team projects in university and schools. Some people might partake in this role, but usually the team doesn’t take the role seriously. But that is usually the way it is with product managers - they have to make themselves useful, so that the team can see the purpose in the role.Even though you can’t code, I’m sure that’s a lot of things that you’ve caught on about - use that knowledge to support the team in every possible way. Communication is key - as it is in any successful endeavor.But you won’t learn enough in a month - it is simply not enough time.But if you do choose to study hard and try to make lost time, here’s a few suggestion for you:Stop focusing on fancy called examples or guides from people that tell you that this kind of projects will get you jobs - find something that is within your scope of capabilities; even if this means this is simply a small blogging website or a simple web crawler or even a calculator. Finish that project - and do not use AI tools to complete it.Don’t get me wrong. AI tools are extremely powerful and in the industry we use them daily. But at least where I come from we have a saying, that the AI is only as good as your own understanding - but understanding doesn’t come, unless you put down the groundwork.I’m sorry if this is harsh, but I truly wish you the very best in the future.",

Circles is loser talk!* Stole animated gifs from another implementation of this program* Created 2D array, filled it with gifs. Displayed them* Break for lunch* Google `how to catch mouse clicks`* Click away happily for a few minutes* Use some advanced math (uh, division and modulo) to convert a point on the screen to an element of the 2D array* Change the code to say \"You clicked square x, y, which contains a blue blob\"* Use my advanced CS degree to do find all the blobs of the same color connected to this blob (flood fill)* etcI can go on for a lot longer, but I hope I've made the point.

Any Turing complete language, which is effectively all of them, can manipulate state, which is what programs do. Any general purpose language, which is most of them, can do most tasks.However, where those languages can be used is a function of implementation. OS broadly, web browser narrowly, your favorite game, maybe Lua.> Can you give me examples of where some feature is not implemented in a language because it would directly block another feature? How about [type systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system)? How a language lets you define and handle types tends to be a defining feature. It also will impact every aspect of how you develop a program in that language. Choose one, block the other. A strict type system catches errors at compile time, a loose one might only catch some errors at run time. Write your tests accordingly.Along the same lines, [mutablity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object). This is the break point between imperative and declarative. The level to which that can be dictated by the programmer also defines a language.[Function overloading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading) comes to mind. It's extremely popular, lots of languages do it, and lots don't. There are pros and cons in implementing such a feature. There is implementation complexity but also programmer expectation.Garbage collection? How resources are released is a big deal in all languages. In some languages, all clean up is the responsibility of the programmer. In others, the programmer barely has a say.Virtual machines? Java and .NET, among others, run inside a sandbox. This is good for portability and stability, buy denies access to the OS; you get what the sandbox gives you.Last, but not exhaustively, libraries. The standard libraries available to a language might dictate its use. If what you want to do only has a library in C, you're either porting it to your favorite language, creating an interop wrapper for it, or writing in C.",

Most of them can do the task. It's just what you like.Think about C++ and Objective-C. Both were attempts to make C object-oriented. Did one stop when they heard about the other? Did C++ win because it was the best for the job? No, C++ won because it was part of AT&T which was a much bigger entity than the folks that developed Objective-C.It's just like natural languages. Is English the best language? Some (who natively speak it) say yes, but it's only because they speak it. Others insist that their language is best. We could learn Esperanto which was a designed language where the ease of learning was a key objective. Yet, it's not popular because people love their own languages, and maybe ease of learning isn't that important. Some people love how complex their language is (or how many feature it has).To get to your second question, there are languages that try to avoid using null, so they have to create Option types (that's one way to do it). This creates a level of mental overhead that those who have never used those types find unimportant, yet others, who think null pointer exceptions are evil and the cause of many errors feel it's justified.Or languages that want to be pure functional have problems with I/O, such as printing, and have to use complex math structures like monads, when everyone else feels printing is really easy, but it's counter to the functional philosophy.Prolog was built to have a backtracking mechanism, and for most, it looks like nothing you'd expect and is hard to get your mind around, and because of that, hard to figure out. Erlang, which was inspired by Prolog, has a syntax that's hard for those used to C-style syntax (which is most popular languages) to understand, partly because it was designed before language designers decided languages should look like C.And was that because C was a great language? No, but it was hugely popular in industry, so to design languages that looked like C was considered beneficial because people were more likely to try out your language if they didn't have to struggle with the syntax as much.Functional languages don't like having state, so they don't have plain old for-loops because the looping variables change values. So, they use functions like: fold, map, filter, zip, etc. to achieve looping capabilities without a looping variable.

Pretty much any programming language that you will think of (not mark up language) is turing complete. Even things you dont even think of as a programming language are often turing complete like powerpoint.Now if we think of this extreme example. Power point was never intended to be used as a programming language but you can use it to programm anything and thus it also wont ever recieve a lot of the common features so you would have to write them your self.A more relaistic example are garbage collections. Some languages have them others dont. And this is not a this language just hasnt gotten to the point of implementing them, its a deliberate decission to leave it to the programmer to do deal with it them self so they wont ever get that \"feature\". You can also argue that its a feature to not have a garbage collection.This goes on with other things, like some languages are made in mind to be used with oop and thus have strong support for oop. Other are made in mind with procedual code. And the maintainers of a procedual language wont implement oop features. So no its not about just speed.",

Even if the database in question uses some other query language (Neo4j uses a special language to query graphs called Cypher, Mongo uses a specially crafted JSONs, etc) the ideas for data selection and aggregation are often transferrable between them. So, doing good at SQL will open doors to data science, business analysis, database performance work, and in general will make you more valuable for every developer team in the future.Another one such \"language\" is regular expressions. Python may not be a good language to learn and use them because AFAIK it lacks special syntax support for them, but Ruby, Rust, JavaScript have better syntax for them. Learning regexes *well* will help you work with unstructured data, extract data form text, logs, do data migration between systems, and do quick changes to text files including some advanced search-and-replace operations in your code editor. It's a very good supplemental skill to have.Learning Shell scripting is my third recommendation. Learning how to combine programs together, build pipelines, learning SSH tunneling - all of this will be useful over decades, too.A large pert of programmer's work is spent outside of their primary language, so getting comfortable with the world besides `if`s and `for`s is always a good idea.",

And tbh i didn't care about any subjects, i just wanted to go home and play with computer (game and make other things).",

I will say that generally, to learn and understand something, people need that thing to be connected to their existing understanding of the world. For example, I didn't really \"get\" the quadratic equation until a teacher did a proof of it, so I could see how to get there from what I already knew.The other big way to connect new concepts to existing understanding is through analogy, but different people have different existing knowledge to connect to. For example, most math students wouldn't be helped if you said \"domain is the set of all valid arguments for a pure function, and range is the set of all valid return values\". In your case, though, that may be a useful analogy. So for the function: int.ToString(), the domain is all integers from - 2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647, and the range is the set of all strings that match the regex \"\\-?\\d{1,10}\"",

On Windows you could make a pure Windows app for Pong, on Linux you could make a pure GTK Linux app for Pong. On some platforms like macOS or Android you could write an app that's 99% C with a tiny bit of another language to set things up and write Pong. None of them would be the same.What msot C books or courses will teach you is stuff that's a little more abstract - just problem solving and data manipulation, rather than building a complete app. That reflects how C is used these days. It's the foundational language used behind the scenes of everything so it's really important to know - but it's not the main language used to build apps and the software people actually use.My advice would be to start with Harvard's CS50x.

I've had similar experiences with courses where the instructor seems to contradict themselves, and it definitely slows things down.From my own experience, I'd suggest a couple of resources that are great for getting a solid foundation in PHP:The official PHP Manual (PHP.net): It can be a bit dry, but it's the absolute source of truth. Whenever I was stuck on what a function did or the right way to write something, I'd go there. It's less a tutorial and more of a reference, but it's essential.freeCodeCamp: They have a full, comprehensive PHP course on YouTube that is completely free. It's well-structured and a fantastic alternative to a confusing paid course.As for how long it takes, everyone's different. My biggest piece of advice, based on my own journey, is don't get lost in a forest of theory and code at the start.Just learn the absolute basics—variables, loops, etc.—and then immediately start doing. Try to build something super simple. A huge help for me was using an AI assistant. You can literally tell it, \"Explain this to me like I'm a child,\" and it will break down complex concepts into really simple terms. Use it to guide you as you build your first small project.Once you have some hands-on experience and things start to click, then go back and learn the deeper theory. It'll make so much more sense because you'll have actual context for it.You got this, good luck",

You can learn different languages in a playful way, which I thought was really cool for JS, for example. That's just how it is in my training at the moment.

At least so far, I have hardly received any points with PHP in my training and therefore I don't know how my boss imagines me learning PHP.

And you learn by doing or using, not by reading documentation, no-one can remember everything anyways.Use documentation to look up things that you don't remember - and gradually try to read a bit more of it, either guided by your curiosity or when you need to solve a new problem. Don't read them just to read them - nobody normal does that! \\*) *\\*) I actually read through the entire HTML 5.3 specification - it was the most boring reading I'ver ever done, only managed a single page each day, and I've since forgotten large parts.

I'll answer them separately:>is it necessary to read ~~all of~~ the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?I'd lean on the side of yes. Reason being - each language has it's idiosyncracies/hidden gotchas/pitfalls. Most (if not all) of these are usually spelt out in the docs. In fact, several questions people ask on reddit/stackoverflow have their answers lying partially or wholly in the docs.That being said, there are caveats to how much of the docs one needs to read. I've added some context around this further below.>is it necessary to read ALL OF the documentation for a programming language to fully understand it?No. It's recommended, but not necessary to read ALL of the documentation. My personal opinion is that you should only read the docs for things you're explicitly working with (though it's always good to go above and beyond).>I ask because documentation often contains a lot of specifications and information that can be overwhelming. I have been advised to read the \"reference manuals\" first, but even that is difficult.I feel you. Docs can be overwhelming especially if you're just starting out / are not familiar with the language. Here's how I do it (may or may not work for you) - I tend to generally only give docs a very surface level read/ avoid them until I'm fairly well versed with the language. Then - once I start doing more complex stuff - I tend to simply use my IDE to read docs for specific things I'm working with.E.g. in Java, if I'm using a class from the core library, I can hit F12 in my IDE to go to the class's source code and read the doc comments directly within that class.I find that this compartmentalizes the doc information to only the specific pieces of info I need for my work. It's much less overwhelming to me that way. YMMV.",

Nope.While you certainly can, it may not be the best way to approach it.Ive been learning since jan, ive been using udemy courses, yt vids, projects and docs. Nowhere could i find a methodology to go through the documentation to find something and honestly its kinda confusing especially with poorly written docs.What i have found to help is to start high level and zoom into specifics as you get a better idea of what to do. Heres a recent example from my side while building a crud app. I want to create and view a blog article so what do i do? Assuming the html forms and express server is already set up. Ok so i need to be able to firstly log the inputs, what does it look like, how do i do that, and if its not in a useable state, how do i transform it. Ok then i need to be able to access the json file and also somehow save to the json file. Ok then lastly to view the article i need to again access the json and somehow display the info somewhere in my html( or in my case ejs template). Again what would happen if the data is not in a useable state? This breaks down all the steps which you can then go looking for your methods. So as an example (im using node and express for the backend) i want to access the json file. So you can google that and read around or go straight to the docs (if you know roughly which module) and then look for various ways to read a json file. And then when you find, ok so in the fs module i have a few methods to choose from, .read().readFile().createReadStream(), so among these methods which one is applicable to my situation. Now you're reading the docs, looking at specifics, comparing methods with a specific goal in mind. You can even test each one to see if it works or not. I have found this to work for me... And yes its very time intensive as compared to just getting the code from AI in 30sec. Like i said, im still learning, but im keen to hear your opinions and any more seasoned professionals on how they approach docs. Its something that doesn't get explained on how to navigate and find what you need.",

The problem you need to solve is _text processing and XML handling_, but what you're asking about is _fully understanding Python_. These are two different things.Python as a language lets you be productive with only a small understanding of the language itself (that's how I got started with it; I've actually forgotten how or when I started writing Python, at some point I realised that's what I was writing my scripts in, rather than Perl or Bash).In programming, as elsewhere, a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. The stuff you write with only a minimal understanding of Python will look awkward to someone more experienced, including yourself some few months from now.Generally what you want is:1. a _good enough_ understanding of the language semantics itself. \"Good enough\" is poorly defined, and varies by language: * A language like Rust will require more investment in learning up front, but deliver very few gotchas down the line * A language like Javascript or PHP will require very little investment in learning up front, but deliver more gotchas down the line * Python is kinda more middle-of-the-road. * For this bit you kinda just gotta read a book, preferably a good one so you don't fall asleep, and do some exercises to get a feel for it.1. A decent understanding of engineering in the language, as in, how do you write long-term maintainable code? * This includes which libraries and external tools you're expected to use. * For Python you kinda have to check /r/Python and other resources, but currently Astral tools like `uv` and `ruff` are good to have in your toolkit, and a typechecker like Microsoft's `pyright` until Astral's `ty` gets to 1.0. * Static analysis, both typechecking and linters, will help you catch weaknesses in your understanding of what you're doing.1. A decent ability to discover relevant information in documentation, especially reading API docs. * Generally searching is better than trying to memorize everything. Your brain can only fit so much information. * Language servers / IDEs can help a lot with discoverability.",

        "body": "It depends on the scale of the project and the needs of the customer. Though very often there’s multiple phases and kinds of documentation. Consider “gathering requirements” this in itself is some documentation you want to create before you start developing. You probably also want to pin down any quality attributes and relevant SLO/SLAs, and a workable architecture or design for your software. Basically you start by producing a pile of documentation that you reference throughout your development, and while developing you may produce documentation about certain methods or functions, or a quirk of a third party system you interact with, and so on, which will help the future developers (likely you) maintain the project. You’ll also want “user facing documentation” that the people who use the software you produce can use to help them get the most out of it or answer questions for them when they stumble across a workflow quirk.Further I consider the value of a SWE to not just be code output, but “knowledge output”, so alongside development or while making architectural decisions or soliciting requirements, or after getting user feedback, they should also be learning things about the domain and ideally producing some documentation that can help the whole team understand the why and how behind certain domain-specific things. Code is almost inherently technical debt, and knowledge is the only thing that lets you pay it down.It sounds like a lot, but all of it can usually fit in an agile sprint or whatever. And to some extent it depends on what level of developer you are, Jr. dev will likely not be getting customer requirements, setting quality attributes and SLOs, nor drafting architecture. However, a Jr. dev will likely be expected to write some unit documentation for the code they create, and may be expected to write user-facing documentation for the feature they implement.",

The only issue is it's slow relative to other languages, but that's something you'll only notice when you run really intense calculations.SQL is used for interacting with databases and it is fundamentally very different from any other language. It's probably most useful if you have lots of data and need a fast and organized way of storing/retrieving it.HTML + JavaScript is a great starting point, but it probably won't help you with your work until you also learn PHP, Java, or backend JavaScript and get it to inferface with a database.",

Clear them up with the instructor before you go out the door.* Take detailed notes in class IN A NOTEBOOK. * Physically writing with a pen on paper engages much more of your brain than typing on a keyboard, and far more than just listening to the lecture and reading the slides. * You don't even have to read them later! Writing is the most important part. * Reading the notes *does* help... but you don't have to do it if you don't have time.* Read the textbook. * You should really read the relevant material BEFORE class. * This way, the lecture is just review, and it can clear up any questions/doubts you have.* Do all the homework, and aim for 100%. * Do the bonus point problems if there are any; each program you successfully write makes you a better programmer.There is little need to study other materials (such as YouTube) if you do all of the above.",

Instead of completely switching, maybe add React or Vue to your JS skills? That way you're building on what you know rather than starting over. PHP backends with modern JS frontends is a killer combo that lots of companies want.The Spring Boot frustration you felt is totally normal.. Java web dev has a steep learning curve compared to Laravel's elegance. Most Java courses do start way too basic which is annoying when you already know how to code.If you really want to explore Java, maybe try building a simple REST API first instead of jumping into Thymeleaf. But honestly? I'd probably spend that 6 months getting really good at Laravel and a modern JS framework. The ROI might be better and you're not starting from scratch.",

Yeah, the DSA question is mostly because it seems like you need them to pass the interviews. I’ve luckily not had any of these in my former jobs. Basically they were more interested in projects and more every day application than DSA. My BIL works in FANG, and said he could get me an interview, but PHP is not allowed to be used to interview. I could probably interview in JS, but then the stack they use is definitely Java, so I’m trying to interview in that. Trying to find the right balance, which was why I jumped into spring boot.

Bear in mind that if you do things like wildcard queries, you will end up scanning the entire \"users\" table on every search.If you care about scaling to large numbers of users, then you'll want to use a full-text search engine that can use an index for efficient searching.I'm not familiar with Prisma, but it seems to be a wrapper around Postgres, and Postgres supports full-text search using the `tsvector` and `tsquery` types. This allows you to create an index on a *tokenized* field, so that searches can efficiently find only the rows containing those tokens. You can customize the tokenizer to do things like approximate searches, where the tokens are partial words instead of complete words. All of this is relatively straightforward in Postgres, but I'm not sure whether/how Prisma exposes it.If you need even larger scale, and you don't want your database to become a bottleneck for searching, then you'll want to use a search engine that's separate from your DB, such as Elasticsearch or Solr. This adds a lot of complexity because whenever the data in your DB changes, you have to synchronize those changes to your search index.",

A service must be designed with the intent to be runnable in multiple instances for it to be considered horizontally scalable, not all applications meet these criteria, and once they meet them, other services they depend on (e.g. databases, queues, weird disk based sharing) must also be able to meet demand, or else the service will just bottleneck outside of its control.Resilience can be broken down into three categories, what happens when the service breaks, what happens when the services around it break, and what happens when the service is used incorrectly - all three must be covered for it to be resilient, and cloud helps with none of these.What you probably have in mind is *availability,* which yes, load balancing a service which supports it in the cloud, whether automatically or manually, does to an extent solve availability (*to an extent is doing a lot of heavy lifting here).* This is what happens when *one or more* instances of your service are no longer available.Security is not only authorization and authentication, but also what information I can receive from your system while being a legitimate user, whether I can abuse timing, delays, your concurrency model, false requests, rollbacks and a thousand other things.However, most job postings don't really mean all this, it's just a fun thing to write these days.",

Usually vertical scaling isn't an issue for us, we use Django and Celery and they run on separate instances to reduce load on the main API server, for that we use RabbitMQ in the mix. I can't remember the last we needed to tweak a box specification. We run everything via ECR/ECS, the AWS Docker solution.**Performant**: Well to some extent this goes back to initial software design, choosing the most efficient algorithms, libraries and your own data structures. For example, me being an big fan of Lisp, Haskell etc I tend to use \\`deque\\` instead of the stock Python list as it handles certain types of insertions faster than the List (possible premature by me?), then you can hand it back as a list() if you want later.[https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)and I have added this: [https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity)**Secure**: We use at rest encryption for our RDS instances, plus certain data models have custom load and save to perform encryption prior to sending fields to the database for double protection, using the SECRET\\_KEY value.Also, we use asymmetric encryption on the JWT token, using the AWS Parameter Store to manage all keys, our environment configurations, TaskDefinitions etc are all setup to reference the keys so that they are available to Django at runtime through a simple AWS API call, and some are pushed into the running environment as we use \\`decouple.config()\\` quite a lot as well.So, that's what we do!",

The platform can do it, no stress, but whether the app can handle it is up to the app. If you slap an old stateful app into kubernetes and make more replicas of it, you're pretty likely to get bad behaviour, as in erroneous responses or crashes.We had high availability designs for apps before cloud providers, they were just a bit more of a PITA to get the other replicas for.One guide to getting there is the [12-factor app](https://12factor.net/). The guide might look a bit weird to those of us who think those are just normal apps, and work with gitops and distroless containers on a daily basis.> And would using the cloud platform's built-in authentication and authorization services be enough to ensure security?Yeah, nah. You can still leak your credentials and do lots of stupid shit. Vibe coders do it all the time. You need to have some idea of what authn and authz means, _why_ you do it, and which bits of information can go where. If you think the cloud services provide all the security you need and then push sensitive information out to any client, you've fucked up.Security is also something of an eternal cat-and-mouse game. Like some algorithms need to pretend to be slow just to limit their vulnerability to timing attacks. Security is an entire rabbit hole of its own.> I also see job postings that want experience designing \"performant\" software. Aren't you always trying to make code as efficient as possible? What is performant software and how would software not be performant?Software is non-performant for a whole host of reasons, and getting it to be performant isn't just one thing. One thing is bad [big-O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), but people also do stuff like bad structuring of network calls, and to some extent choosing the wrong language (program design usually matters a lot more than language choice).",

You actually have to have the aptitude and interest. Learning to be a developer takes years of dedication and hard work. Most people who think it sounds interesting give up once they realize how hard it is.If you're interested in being a developer, the only solid route is a 4-year Computer Science degree (or equivalent), then a few years of in-person employment to get experience, then you might have a chance of going remote eventually.",

        "body": "I'm going to disagree with the other two posters a *bit*, and post my own definition. Firstly, you absolutely, 100% should learn classes. They are used everywhere in every facet of programming, *including* Frontend Dev. Modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, Lit, etc. use them, so they're absolutely necessary to have at least a basic grasp of.I'd also disagree that the \"description of an object is called a CLASS\". This is like...90% accurate, but there's a small bit of distinction that I think is important.# Classes and ObjectsFirstly, let's define what the word \"object\" means. I like to think of an object in programming as a *noun*; it's a \"thing\". It has can have some **adjectives** that describe it (it's \"old\" or \"blue\") and it can have some **verbs** that it can do (it can \"drive\" or \"honk\"). It's also got a name usually that describes it (so we can refer to that \"thing\"), and often times we can say that it's a particular **kind** of thing. Now, instead of using the words \"adjective\", \"verb\", and \"kind\", let's replace those with more programmy words: - `property`: properties are the adjectives. They describe something about the object. Some of those properties can be changed (I may get taller or shorter as I age); other properties cannot change (I will always have been born in my hometown; that cannot change). Generally speaking, properties don't \"do\" anything; they're just descriptors. Each property has a \"key\" (what it is) and a value. For example, our car has a property with key \"color\" and value \"blue\". - `method`: Methods are the verbs, and they usually have a pair of parentheses somewhere in their name. I can `program()`. I can `write(message)` (write a message). I cannot `fly()` (that's not one of my methods!). - `class`: The class of an object is, roughly speaking, its _type_. I am a human (my class is Human). The `old`, `blue` thing that can `drive()` is an object of type `Car`. All objects of a particular type are defined as having certain methods and properties. Classes can also be thought of as \"templates\" for objects. I want an object that fits the template \"car\" (i.e., does things a car can do), so I'll use the Car class.Here's an example of a class in JavaScript:```class Car { constructor(color, age){ //roughly speaking here, `this` refers to the object we're talking about. this.color = color; this.age = age; } drive() { alert('vroooom!'); }}```And to use this class, I'd do something like this:```const myCar = new Car('blue', 'old');console.log(myCar.color);//'blue'```So why would I disagree that the description of an object is a class? Well, in describing that old blue car, I'd... well I'd describe it exactly that. An old, blue car. _However_, the adjectives \"old\" and \"blue\" are _not part of the class_! Instead, they're values (see above). Instead, a class describes a _template_ for an object, not that actual, specific object. Every person alive has an `age` property and a `placeOfBirth` property, but mine is almost certainly different from, say, yours. # WhyClasses allow us to organize our data in a paradigm of programming known as Object Oriented Programming (OOP). It's not the _only_ paradigm, but it's a pretty popular one. Classes: - Allow us to define a particular behavior _once_ and then reuse that behavior - Can be \"extended\". For example, I might have a `Pet` class with properties like `hungerLevel` or methods like `makeSound()`, and then I might \"extend\" that class with something like a `Dog` class (with a `bark()` method), or a `Fish` class (with a `splash()` method). Again, this allows us to define certain, common behaviors only once!The first point is particular important. Imagine if every time a person signed up for FaceBook, a team of programmers had to write functions to deal with that person's account. Oh, /u/Maleficent_Speech289 signed up? We'll need to write a `login()` and `getPictures()` and `postMessage()` method for them! Instead, with classes, you can just say: ```const someUser = new User('Maleficent_Speech289');someUser.getPictures(); //this behavior is already defined, so we can just use it!```# TL;DR:You absolutely, 100% need to know classes as a programmer. It doesn't matter if you're new, senior, or somewhere in between; you'll need to know them at some point, and it's never too early to start learning them. Anyone that hires you will expect you to have clean, structured code, and while there are other programming paradigms, OOP is one of the most popular to the point that it's kinda a \"default\".",

        "body": "In JS, a class, aka object, is not really an object, it is ***a prototype *** This difference was emphasized in many older books but has been forgotten since around 2012. The last book I know of that adheres to this differentiation though the author did not explain the difference at all was the book Javascript the Good Parts by Douglas Crawford. You should think of a prototype as a ***generalized object/class***, it is a ***meta-class*** so to speak. This was something discussed in a very old book called The Art of the Metaobject Protocol by Gregor Kiczales. A typical object is very easy to understand as others have no doubt explained to you already. It is basically a list of data and a list of methods that operates on those data and those data only. You can create a new type of object from an existing object by inheriting all of its data and methods + nee ones you specified. You should think in your mind as a circle engulfed by a bigger circle where the smaller circle is the old and the big circle now containing the smaller circle is the new. This is pretty much all you can do with objects if JS were really an object-oriented language like Java -- I wrote some stuff bashing Java the other day, people interested should search for the keyword Scratch in my comment history. I basically argued why Scratch is better than Java, but that's just a click-bait title. With prototype, the relationship between the old and the new is not a circle in a circle but two circles connected by a line. Yep, that's it. We are done.To truly appreciate the difference, you have to ask what happens during the ***construction of a new new-object***. In the circle-in-circle model, you simply get another circle-in-circle. However in JS, creating another circle-line-circle new-object can be done in ***two ways***, hence all the weird constructors in JS. When you use the keyword 'class' you are creating a brand new circle-line-circle. This is the standard method since ECMA6. However there is an older method using the keyword 'new\". With 'new', you do not get another circle-line-circle, you get a new circle attached to the existing circle-line-circle, and the relationship is a triangle. The you have circle-line-Circle-line-circle where Circle represents the old-object and the two 'circle's are the created new-objects. Why does this matter? This means both child (new-objects) share the same parent. And either one can ***modify the parent's data or add new methods to the parent*** and that information will be propagated to the other child. This is an important feature because it means you can modify the parent ***at run time.*** You can use this for all sorts of purposes. It would take too long to explain all the things you can do with this, just consult the book I mentioned or use your imagination. I do want to mention something that is not in the book and I do not believe it is implemented anywhere. In JS at least you can do it pretty easily. Imagine now you go to the new 'class' constructor and you use that to create another circle-line-Circle-line-cicrle, now you have two families of the same objects, but they can follow different ***dynamic*** paths during program run time to become something else entirely. One obvious application would be for games where you have different creatures from different families but as they evolve, they can split off from the main tree. But, it can even go back through its ancestor tree and start ***rewriting history.***Anyway, this is long enough.e: JS was originally derived from Scheme and the book was written for LISP based language which is the root of Scheme. The creator of JS wanted to create a Scheme language to be used as the scripting language for the then best browser Netscape. However, Java had just taken off and was seen as the future of the programming world. So the investors of Netscape insisted on a ***java-like*** language thinking it would make JS compatible with Java in the future. Obviously you should never let non-tech people make tech decisions. So the JS creator took the matter into his own hand and created a ***java-look-alike***. It looks like Java but it has nothing to do with Java, it is way better because it runs on Scheme under the hood. Yes, that's all it is. He took a Scheme engine and created a cosmetic layer over it. This was how he created JS in 3 days. And God took 7 days to create the Universe. Not too shabby.",

But the exact meaning of \"sensitive\" and \"secure\" depends on the situation.If you're doing payment processing, then presumably you have an agreement with some financial services provider to actually handle the movement of money. That provider will almost certainly have its own rules about how sensitive data can be handled. For instance, I think credit card processors typically forbid you from logging credit card numbers in plaintext, and from storing CVV values in any way whatsoever.Also consider whether your system falls within the scope of laws like the EU's GDPR or California's CCPA. These rules don't necessarily forbid you from logging sensitive personal data, but *if* you do log it, then you'd better have a process for scrubbing your logs in case somebody asks for their personal data to be deleted. And the GDPR has a very broad definition of what counts as \"personal\".",

For example on ARMv8 and above there are 4 privilege levels, which they call Exception Levels, with EL0 being the unprivileged level under which regular user applications execute, EL1 being intended for kernel supervisors, EL2 being intended for virtual machine hypervisors, and EL3 being intended for firmware security monitors.On macOS you only have access up to EL2, and that requires using either the Hypervisor or Virtualization frameworks to create a virtualization environment (the Virtualization framework is a very high level virtual machine implementation on top of the Hypervisor framework), but you can run unrestricted EL3 code on all AArch64 Raspberry Pi models, so if you're interested in privileged bare-metal development, the Raspberry Pi is likely your best option. On the other hand, M4 Macs are already on ARMv9, which is pretty similar to ARMv8 as far as unprivileged code is concerned but significantly different for privileged code as many system registers were added, changed, and removed since ARMv8, plus the M4 in particular also has 512-bit Scalable Matrix Extension support, so depending on what you want to do, that may or may not be appealing to you.General purpose AArch32 and AArch64 HTML documentation:* [ARMv6M, ARMv7, and ARMv8 assembly reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0801/latest/);* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 instruction set architecture](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0602/latest/)* [ARMv8 and ARMv9 system registers](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0601/latest/)Documentation specific to the SoCs used by the Raspberry Pi 4 and 5 and their derivatives:* [Cortex A72 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100095/latest/)* [Cortex A76 reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/100798/latest/);* [ Generic Interrupt Controller core reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0471/latest/);* [Generic Interrupt Controller v2 specific reference](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0048/latest/);* [PrimeCell 0111 UART](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0183/latest/);* [BCM2711 datasheet (Pi 4)](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/bcm2711/bcm2711-peripherals.pdf).Other resources:* [Bare-metal section of the Raspberry Pi forums (I help there sometimes under the same name as my reddit account)](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewforum.php?f=72&sid=de4c2c97b2b1372281ef64d6aed3dc5f);* [Tutorial that got my feet wet on AArch64 (I already had experience with AArch32 from decades ago)](https://www.rpi4os.com/);* [Rust HDMI audio driver that I made for the Pi 4 and 5](https://github.com/CodexTextor/rpi-hdmi) (will not work on the BCM2712 D0 stepping SoC used on models of the Pi 5 introduced after I wrote that code because the physical addresses of the hardware are different).Note that there's no public official documentation for the BCM2712 SoCs of the Raspberry Pi 5, so all my code targeting that platform is based on my own reverse-engineering research effort that included reading the official Linux driver code from Broadcom, messing around with hardware registers on Linux to figure out how they work with a proper driver, and deriving knowledge from my experience with and available documentation for the BCM2711 SoC of the Pi 4, since there was very little community work done on this front when I got my first Pi 5. If you go the Raspberry Pi route I also recommend getting the Raspberry Pi Debug Probe, installing OpenOCD, and reading [this thread](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=362067) on the Raspberry Pi forums for the OpenOCD script.As for setting up the environment for native development on macOS, you don't really need much beyond Xcode's command-line tools, which you can install by typing: xcode-select --installAnd then following the on-screen instructions.---Edit: Added Xcode command-line suggestion.",

Repeatedly search for the character `s1[0]` in `s2`2. For each match, it checks whether the substring of `s2` starting at that point actually equals `s1`The trick is that instead of those steps being implemented directly as loops, they're implemented by calling methods on `std::char_traits`, which in turn call the standard C library functions `memchr` and `memcmp`, respectively.And depending on the platform, those functions in turn can be implemented using highly-optimized assembly code, which is likely faster than anything you would write by hand in C++. For instance, on x86_64 Linux with glibc, `memchr` has various different implementations using SSE2, AVX2 or EVEX SIMD instructions, depending on which CPU features are detected at runtime.",

Honestly, here you'd need to get deep into the machines, learn the CPU instruction set and how the Assembly Mnemonics translate to *machine code* (Z-80 Assembly, the Mnemonic `RET` translates to the machine code instruction `C9` - from what I still remember when I played around with Z-80 Assembly).You have to understand the following:The first Assembler was built by hand-translating the Assembly Mnemonics that represented the program for the Assembler into machine code, pretty much like the well documented \"AppleSoft BASIC interpreter\" written by Steve Wozniak for the Apple computers. Steve wrote the entire program in 6502 Assembly - on paper - then hand-translated everything in the numeric machine code that then could be loaded on the Apple computers. You can find plenty information on how Steve did it on the internet.When I learnt 8051 Assembly in my degree program we initially also learnt to hand-translate the Mnemonics into machine code and vice versa. Can highly recommend to learn that with simpler CPUs, like the 6502, the Zilog Z-80, or the 8051/8031/8080 series Microcontrollers.Assembly is just a 1:1 translation of machine code and therefore is closest to hardware.",

Well the first assembler would have been written in machine code. With the tedium of converting the bytes of the assembly code into something you could work with to eventually get machine code out. But the CPU you design in the book doesn't have file access etc. And I think the book is more interested in teaching the fundamentals of an assembler, rather than how to do that in pure machine code.

I generally agree with your tech stack, but I'd recommend only using an LLM for the extraction part, with human in the loop verification. the AI can't be trusted for open ended tasks like data entry. instead, I'd recommend hard-coding the data entry part. your loop could look something more like:AI PDF Extraction > Human Verification (if needed) > RPA Automated Data Entry > AI Verification (if needed)this entire flow can be built out and executed by MacroForge in 5-10 minutes depending on the complexity. our demo video for this PDF to automated data entry is in the queue; however, I'd be happy to connect with you to see if it will match your requirements.

But if you want more structured learning, Chad Darby's Spring Boot course on Udemy is solid. Covers everything from basics to connecting with databases and building REST APIs.Also, since you're coming from a React background, you might want to consider the MERN stack instead of jumping straight to Java/Spring Boot. Node.js with Express is way easier to pick up when you already know JavaScript, and you can focus on learning backend concepts without learning a whole new language at the same time.At Metana we actually see this transition a lot. Frontend devs wanting to go full stack. Most find it easier to stick with JavaScript ecosystem first (Node/Express) then maybe explore Java later if needed. But if your project specifically needs Spring Boot or you're targeting Java jobs, then go for it.Either way, the key is building that project while you learn. Don't just do tutorials tho. Actually build your backend API as you go through the course material. You'll learn way faster that way.",

I believe you need to know how a program runs before you start coding. Also, I believe beginners don't know how to pick an appropriate size project, and that if they start projects right away, they fail to learn the basics, in particular, control flow. That is, imagine you're a debugger (a program that lets you go step by step through a program). Could you do that without using a computer, that is, if I gave you a simple program, can you determine what it does?**Alternate approach**Many others find the standard method I've described boring and therefore hard to motivate themselves. So, they do the following* Pick a project* Google a lot to find enough relevant information to code it* Learn enough about coding while doing the projectWhat they like about this approach is they are building something which is something they *enjoy*. Does everyone enjoy this? No, they don't. But for those that do, this kind of thing is super rewarding.However, there are problems with this approach. The first is it works for only a small number of people. They're able to find answers to what they're looking for. They are able to learn enough about programming to accomplish the task.To me, this is the equivalent of going to a foreign country and trying to pick up the language on the fly. You read a few common phrases, and trust the people know enough English and can decipher your accent enough that you get by. Some find that approach better than an academic approach where you learn how to conjugate verbs and learn grammatical structure.When someone opts to do projects, they want to find something interesting and cool, but even the most boring programs you can think of (Hangman, Tic-tac-toe) are quite difficult for most beginners, and they want to write 3D first person shooters or have some AI or do some image or video processing. There are things they think are pretty easy, and it's incredibly difficult.However, you'll see more people posting \"do projects\" than the more academic approach.",

The secret that no one selling courses will tell you is that they arent providing information that isnt publicly available, how could they in this industry? If you buy a course you are actually buying the structured learning environment and guidelines, not the material. And imo, if you are past the very beginner stage, you should be getting used to researching and solving problems. Thats the main skill you need as a programmer anyway, so what are you truly getting out from a course you pay for? Not a lot to be honest. A degree or a certificate (a valid certificate like the cyber world has) is another thing that may make paying for a course worth it, but you arent getting that from Udemy or CodeAcademy.Seriously, go check out the thousands of playlists on youtube for free. Hell, you can go take Harvards CS courses online for free if you really dont believe valuable knowledge is out there for free and see for yourself.

So, focus on building stuff and on doing things. Using the knowledge you know to build something will teach you more than any course, because you get hands-on experience as to how something works and why it works.So, are paid courses worth it?

But it doesn't parse your code thoroughly enough to do things like autocompletion, real-time syntax checking, and so on. So to handle that job, VSCode invokes a subprocess which does know Java syntax (the Java language server) and communicates with it.The language server is a program that should have been automatically installed when you installed the VSCode Java extension. If it's broken or misconfigured somehow, it will crash or exit instead of sticking around to handle requests from VSCode. If that happens, it should print some kind of error message saying why it's crashing. You should be able to see that message by going to VSCode's \"Output\" panel (View menu → Output). There's a drop-down in the top-right of that panel to select output from various different kinds of plugins, extensions and subprocesses. One of those should be the Java language server process.You'll need to investigate why the crash is happening in order to have a decent chance of fixing it.",

If there's an existing `results.csv`, is it being truncated (replaced with an empty file) or just left untouched?Are you sure that the different behavior isn't explained by differences in the input files?What command is in the `$(interpreter)` variable?

Can you add debugging to it, or run it in a more verbose mode?If none of those troubleshooting steps shed any light on the problem, I would probably start reaching for a tool like `strace -ff` to inspect exactly what the `$(interpreter)` subprocess is doing, both inside and outside of `make`, and look for anomalies or differences.

But “uncomfortable” is where self improvement lives. When we don’t have new people to defend ideas to we get Echo Chambers. And I wonder sometime how much of death spiraling in struggling companies is seeing people leaving as a way to decrease expenses instead of as a way to bring in new ideas without raising expenses. Even if your company is doing shitty, might still be good to bring in one new person for every two that leave. AI is an arrow pointed in the opposite direction.",

Anyway, in other areas of life, I've had people suspect things about me that weren't true, but they just \"knew\" they were right and were completely wrong. If a candidate's not using AI is so important that the mere suspicion of their using without the actual confirmation of it is enough to get the candidate essentially black-listed, then companies should only test candidates in environments in which using AI is not an option.",

The rise in AI-generated content has blurred the lines of authenticity in online discussions. Here are a few reasons why it might *feel* like that:# :brain: Why Posts Might Feel AI-Generated1. **Overly Polished Language** Posts are increasingly written in this weirdly structured, “essay-like” format. People don’t usually talk like that on Reddit — especially in tech circles where tone tends to be blunt, sarcastic, or informal.2. **Generic Advice & Vague Details** A lot of posts give surface-level advice or talk about issues in super broad terms without getting into the gritty technical details — which is common with AI output unless prompted very specifically.3. **Repetitive Phrasing and Templates** You’ll often see similar turns of phrase or story structures across different posts — things like “After X years in the industry, I realized Y” or “Am I the only one who feels Z?” It starts to feel formulaic.4. **Influx of Low-Effort Engagement Farming** Some users (or bots) are using AI to mass-generate posts and comments to farm karma, drive traffic, or build fake authority on niche topics.# :robot: Signs a Post Might Be AI-Generated* Lacks personal anecdotes or uses generic placeholders.* Echoes common sentiments without adding anything new.* Oddly balanced tone: too formal but pretending to be casual, lol.* Uncanny ability to sit on the fence on controversial topics.* Unnatural use of :pile_of_poo: emojis.* Overuse of the em dash (—).# :puzzle_piece: You're Not \"Schizo\" — You're PerceptiveIt’s unsettling, yeah. And it *does* erode trust — not just in content, but in online community culture itself. Part of Reddit’s value used to be real, lived experience and human nuance. If that’s being diluted, it makes total sense to question what you're reading and who's actually behind it.If you're feeling disoriented by all this, it’s not paranoia — it’s pattern recognition. You’re seeing a shift, and you’re trying to make sense of it. That’s a sane reaction.Want to talk about how to filter for more authentic content or spot AI in the wild?",

You could feel that every single crypto asset is bullshit, but even then I’m not sure you could deny that selling services to people who want to use and trade those assets isn’t a real business. I think Pokémon card investing is bullshit, but if someone built a website to facilitate buying and selling of cards and took in real revenue, I’d still call that a real business. And all of those trading venues and lending venues need developers, often to build rather complex products that can’t have much downtime.An area that’s bigger than ever are stablecoins - crypto assets pegged to (generally) the US dollar. The companies that offer these digital assets hold things like US treasuries to back them, so the company can earn revenue off of the interest while also ensuring that each digital dollar can be redeemed for a US dollar. As far as crypto things go, these are probably the most useful. People in countries with volatile currencies and poor banking systems can now receive, hold, send, and earn interest on US dollars with just a phone and an internet connection. They can send them anywhere in the world and be paid from anywhere in the world. And with the crap going on with Steam and itch.io having to block NSFW games because of pressure from credit card companies, I’d argue we actually could really use a digital dollar that’s as free flowing and censorship resistant as a real life physical dollar. And all of the software that runs this, as well as the apps people use to engage with it, require software devs.So they’re either doing that, or trying to pump out another meme coin. It’s a pretty harsh dichotomy imo.",

Decentralization is a complex problem to solve, and its difficult to figure out consensus with seemingly decentralized nodes in a network.Its why I got into block chain, because its just a cool computer science problem. I think the crypto hype is what has really killed it. And so it has made blockchain as a technology feel less legitimate. But its still fairly legit as a problem to solve. The issue is that its may not be solveable, or you can only have solutions with trade offs.I really see the same problem with AI adoptions. It also has some fundamental problems.

On the other side, there are two cases.1. low quality mass job applying scripts/bots/farms(yes it exists, believe it or not). Sometimes it's by \"motivator/influencer\" who gives away list of email address to whoever attended their \"motivation\" program. Most of these are likely from 3rd countries(including my country, not dissing anyone) and since people are desperate, they are doing it. Meanwhile, their names are added to blacklist of companies, in contrast to the \"successful stories\" of those talkers. There were 3 or 4 people who get job by doing it, out of thousands, and these fuckers are misleading people to apply job in that way. 2. Targeted operation. Either rampant scam call centers, not properly prosecuted(or sometime outright negligent) from India or China(and remaining Southeast Asia bases. Fuck you CCP, cleanup your house properly) or just like in recent news of North Korean taking jobs in USA companies.",

I'll hit em back with a \"Aight, I'm tied up right now. Get started on debugging, I'll sync up with you later\". This then very explicitly creates the expectation that they need to take a stab at it before we sync up.I find more often than not, if I invent a little bit of space, people manage to figure out their issues by themselves, or at least get further along and try various things.Instant gratification, and spoonfeeding people answers, is what cultivates this kind of culture where at the first sign of any sort of issue you immediately go to Person X. And when you've cultivated a culture like that.... why wouldn't they? Why in the world would I read through logs, find the error, google that error, and spend time figuring out what's wrong and how to fix it? There's no need for me to do that if I can send a message to Person X and get an answer dropped in my lap.Not everyone is coachable that way, and that way isn't an instant-fix either. It takes a lot of time. Way more time than if I just kept doing it myself and sending them answers. But I have significantly improved my work life when I've landed on teams with people like this by slowly but surely coaching them to do things on their own without just abruptly telling them to pound sand.It makes a great story for interviews when asked about mentorship as well.",

To users, it solved a deep, nagging problem perfectly, and they paid handsomely for it. The “product” itself? Three (3!) lines of assembler code. The point is that the value delivered always outweighs the elegance or depth of the implementation.",

Its impossible to estimate \"potential and problem-solving ability\" from a single interview. Companies were not hiring for specific tech stacks before because the demand outweighed the supply. Hiring juniors is always a bet and now companies have the luxury of choosing among a vast pool of them. Of course they will rather choose the guy who aligns somewhat with their tech stack rather than the guy whose only coding experience is C++ console programs. Risk is still there but at least the first guy wont need 2-3 months to start being productive.",

Anyway, that guy got lucky by knowing a CEO who could raise VC, and he ended up as a \"solutions engineer\" at google. No idea how, but he's managed to stay there for almost a decade. I don't even know what \"solutions engineer\" at google means, like there's people specifically trying to be good at that? A good out for start up CTO is leading teams of people building new software, but that guy just turned left.So something like that: get lucky early with a position you in no way earned, then flop into a corporate role where what you do is largely non-technical.",

I wish there was a way to report it or something but I doubt it would go anywhere based on how they played it.They started with IT and data engineering, now they're doing the same with the business analysts.

I’d pick one thing to get depth of knowledge on, but most seniors and above tend to have one area of depth but a lot of breadth. It’s just much more valuable than only knowing one thing. You will be fine with being a jack of all trades. But keep in mind the market sucks, so don’t consider that a reason if you can’t get a job. Also, 33 isn’t that old - not old enough for fears of being left behind. I’m 2 years your senior and also had a less than normal background. I have a lot more depth in front end and react, but I can still muddle my way through other things. And my focused areas for depth of knowledge has changed as the industry does (nobody needs the depth of knowledge I do about CSS or mixins anymore lol), but that’s fine. Understanding data pipelines etc is something I believe is very valuable if that is what you’re interested in, and I’m always grateful to have other devs on the team with some understanding of what I do (React) because it means we can articulate needs ro one another easier (which is why breadth is so important)",

It was also my first developer job as well. A lot of what I learned was self-taught since I had very little experience with APIs, databases, and frameworks initially. I was able to learn a lot, but one harsh reality I've realized is that there is a lot of stuff that I did that doesn't fit in with current industry standards and best practices. I've only gotten about 5 interviews over the last few months, and I've been struggling with the technical interviews as well. It's been eye-opening for me to see my shortcomings. I've also questioned whether I'm still good enough to remain in this industry. For now, all I've been doing has been trying to better myself for what my role actually requires. I've been doing courses, studying up on terminology, and I've even been studying my resume to make sure I can fully explain anything I did that's on it.Every rejection is demoralizing, but for the interviews that I do get, I take it as a learning experience since it highlights another thing I need to work on.",

I think my strategy is probs to do a little bit of study over a longer period of time and try again. I don't think I have the time/energy to do the 1 month grind I did in uni lol. Also current market is bad, I've completed the solution in coding interviews before and still been rejected, Am just thinking of staying in my current job even though am not super happy because finding a similar paying role rn seems not to be worth the risk.",

It builds confidence faster than just grinding alone.\\- Dont ignore behavioral - a lot of rejections happen here, even for strong coders. Write down answers to the top 20-30 common ones (“tell me about yourself,” conflicts, mistakes, etc.).\\- For tech rounds, you don’t need to master everything. \\~100 leetcode mediums will carry you through most screens. If you feel shaky, you can also lean on [https://techscreen.app/](https://techscreen.app/) or interviewcoderOn the mental side: it’s fine to take breaks.

The broadness of the prep really messed with me too.I think I still would of been boned if I had to start over but know what I learned from this layoff.I know what you mean, I thought I was out of the industry too. Out of the 23 attempts I only got 2 offers, and one was laughably bad compared to what I used to have. For me specifically, even though every company was vastly different - I eventually kind of caught on there is overlap to an extent. Try to identify that, and leave the rest up to chance.The reality is you have to get 90-100% on the \"exams\" and your competition has to screw up at our YOE ( tie breakers will usually go to most YOE or whoever stood out more). I had more than one job give me feedback that I actually did really good during the interviews, but my competition would have triple my experience and have a similar performance. I lost twice for a 6 round top 2 finalist.. right before I started my job I nailed round 3/4 for a 130k remote job then ghosted. It's just unfair lol. The job I got my final competition was 20 yoe, 8 yoe, 15 yoe. I won at 3 yoe because I was the only one who solved the coding challenge, answered every question correct, AND they liked me / personality fit went well. It took 23 times to set up that scenario. That day was crazy. I had FIVE onsites in a week for 4 companies. I had TWO onsites the day I finally won one stupid job. Funny part is it was the one I thought I did bad on because their API challenge was absolutely stupid. They were like YOU HAVE 7 MINUTES TO MAKE A GET REQUEST API ON THIS CODEBASE HERES A LAPTOP.I was like ??. I survived being nearly interrogated by 3 men answering every question and had to completely switch gears. I've failed so many interviews due to stress and pressure. This particular time I think I was jaded that I had so many onsites in a week and had to go drive to my 2nd one literally right after this I took a breath and started. I talked out loud my thoughts, reiterating the REST pattern of controller implementation repostiory layers. I copied a different GET request in that file and started asking questions about the method and made the params or wrote comments what I wanted to do. I updated the same in the interface/model. I went into the repository layer and just copied how they're connecting to the DB and started making it. I ran out of time and couldn't make it run. Left going screw this place.Turns out I did the best and got further than the others... But the catch was it's a government job so it took 3 MONTHS to get a start date due to a lot of background checks.For me personally, I wasn't getting leetcode that often towards the end. I did lose at least 3 positions because of failing the leetcode, but most of them didn't have it. I lost 2 positions to system design. What I did get almost consistently was this \"tech trivia\" interviews in my market. Asking very specific concepts or language questions and building off off it. I used free tier LLM's to give me 20-30 questions and go in depth prompting and trying to understand all the concepts. I would use the mic feature to simulate interview questions 1 by 1 and get feedback. I found that greatly helped me pass that round even if it wasn't perfect.Turns out some companies were getting questions from the same bank as me, and I would occasionally get some verbatim things I studied. Like what is async and go into detail. What is a Singleton. How would you debug an expensive SQL query. I also found by simulating those questions I had a higher chance of coming up with at least a passable sounding answer.I still suck at it - but to work on the little debugging / API / leetcode easiest / fill in the methods.. I went and did leetcode easy problems and put a timer for 10 minutes. My goal was to talk out loud and explain everything, and make a solution, test, run. In those simulations I could still feel pressure even then. Being at 8-9 minutes and I missed an edgecase and scrambling to fix it. I think that was the right path to work on the pressure part. If you're struggling specifically with crud api's I'd use LLM's to help you make a simple crud in your stack and study it. You could time urself to make a stupid crud or analyze a piece of code it generated / something open source ( I didn't end up doing this)So in return, I basically was like my odds of passing are lower if I get Leetcode med or hard, system design, or something I haven't seen before. It's just too vast. You do want to work on it all but if I were to go again, id try to perfect a \"section\" of the interview during downtime, and cram like hell for whatever the current interview is gonna be.It still sucks, I don't know the answer. I still can't believe I went thru all that. My actual job a month in isn't easy but it's kinda laughable how much lower expectations are vs the interview I had there. I'm getting a month to build a GET request, make test cases, consume it on the front end. Not 7 minutes... LolI think if I had 6 more months to study I'd be closer to a top candidate but realistically I just need more resume experience for right now.",

The easiest way to do that is probably getting a programming job, observing the various roles around it, and making a switch.RE your self doubt, you’re smart enough to get a degree in CS, you seem motivated to get some credentials, to me it seems like you have a strong skill set. You made a game and open sourced it, that takes skill.If you make a plan and present that to your parents, they will see it’s not your lack of initiative, it’s the fact that the rug (tech job market) has been pulled out so quickly from beneath you and there’s little to no support systems in place.Also +1 to stop searching for remote gigs. Execs want new grads in office, your search will be much harder if you are trying to avoid this. Additionally, the first couple years in office were so beneficial to my skills and career.",

Cool, i learned something new, moving onThen same thing \"errors as values\", i hear that frequently but I realize I don't actually know what that looks like. Ask Claude, the show an example and I think, oh, I've prob written that before, I kinda like that, but now I know what that looks like, i can put a name to it, maybe useful in the future.that's just at home - at work it's a little bit like that (starting a new job tomorrow!)i try to avoid asking it for code, but it helps sometimes when ur REALLY stumped.

You cannot leave opportunities on the ground especially when they throw themselves at you. You can always outlast a bad manager or coworkers—one of the most important things when determining work satisfaction. You can’t always find a good opportunity to advance yourself. DevOps is close enough to what you’re already doing that you could transition back if you wanted to and it’s a step in the right direction if you decide you want to do more dev stuff. A potential issue is the lack of dedicated support structure or guidance regarding best practices, the future of your company ops, and career development. Certainly in your team, if not the org at large. Been there, done that. That means your trajectory will be up to you to make or break. It’s hard to be a trailblazer, but the benefits can be huge. If you decide you need to go somewhere to do some learning in a year or two, it will be that much easier with the title under your belt. As for being rusty with programming, I wouldn’t stress it too much. I’ve never held the title explicitly, but as a data engineer who has only worked at small companies, I’ve done a lot of ops stuff. Coding is an important tool but it’s not going to be the make or break issue. You’re managing other people’s software and writing simple middleware not building an in-house operations management tool (yet).",

At the time, I was absolutely against this because new hires, particularly jrs, are basically a time suck and I felt like I'd be putting in basically a lot of work for pretty much no return and I already was burnt out and didn't have a whole lot of time. The intern ended up starting and he absolutely exceeded all expectations. I felt like I could give him a task and with only a little guidance, he would figure it out on his own get it done and was really quick to pick up on things. I also didn't have to explain things to him multiple times. He would complete things quickly and with the enthusiasm of someone still fresh in the field.Despite me never wanting an intern in the first place I ended up pushing to hire him after the internship ended and after he finished out his last semester in school. He is now with us full time and whenever raise time comes around, I'm asking my boss what if anything I can do to help him get a promotion/raise- the answer is usually nothing, but I want to keep him because he has proven himself to be super valuable to the team and I know that earlier on in your career is when you can make moves to other companies for the biggest jumps in your career. I guess to me what made the difference was that, he learned/improved quickly and was fairly independent. I didn't have to spell out each and every little step like I would to a chatgpt prompt. He had his own mind and could think through things instead of just follow my step by step instructions.",

You're establishing professional boundaries and making it clear that your working hours are 9-5, M-F. You'll be working 100% of your working hours.I don't know how cutthrough the consulting scene is, so take my advice with a grain of salt, but that's the advice I normally give to people suffering burnout. People always think in extremes. \"Put up with being miserable working 12 hour days\" vs \"Quit without anything lined up\".In reality there's usually a less extreme option: \"Enforce your professional boundaries, and work 8 hour days, regardless of what's going on around you with the project and management\". And immediately start job searching with all that extra time.The thing about that approach is even if that ruffles feathers, they usually don't fire you right away. They'll heckle you about your performance, they might PIP you, they'll desperately start looking for your replacement, maybe the client will drop you... but all that often takes months. Firing you outright is a much larger impact to the project than letting you work \"normal\" 8 hour days until they hire and train your replacement. It'd be a stupid management decision to react prematurely.So in that time before they fire you... you're job searching *and* collecting a paycheck instead of draining your savings. And the best part of that approach is if they do end up firing you before you line something else up, you're *exactly* where you were about to put yourself voluntarily: Unemployed.That said, at the end of the day quitting without something lined up isn't the end of the world. It's a calculated risk and an expense. If you decide that's worth it, go for it. If even after reducing your workday to 8 hours you're still feeling miserable, then that's likely not going to help, so quitting ASAP may be the best option for you.I'm surprised you lasted 3+ years of 12+ hour days... I would've be gone in month 1. WLB is my #1 priority. I'm a 9-5 employee. If I'm ever at a company where that's not sufficient, I take the above advice.",

You hinted at it with the personal finance remark, but you didn’t explicitly say that overtime at consulting firms are often compensated (and often at a 1.x multiplier of regular hourly rate). From the company’s perspective, a billable hour is a billable hour, but overtime hours are expensive, so it’d be perfectly reasonable to work with your leadership chain to cut overtime and hire more people instead. If relying on overtime is widespread, you can probably even rally support from coworkers by getting everyone to complain to leadership simultaneously.The time tracking thing doesn’t need to involve micromanaging. All they care about is for time to be plausably accounted for, you don’t need to annotate every tiny minute. Nobody has time to audit everyone’s time sheets anyways, so you can usually get away with just blocking the whole day with your client’s project.",

What is complexity of accessing a hashmap, what is an interface, what is REST, what is ACID, what is an index and when do you use it, would you choose monolithic or microservices architecture for a startup?2nd round - live coding: TDD approach, language of my choice, editor of my choice, testing framework of my choice, AI disabled. Create a very simple bank account and a way to do a transaction between 2 accounts. Then make it work in a multithreaded environment.3rd round - still live coding but very pseudo-code stuff. Write very simple load balancer (no network stuff, just simple code no real integration), make it random, make it round Robin. Then few stuff about SQL, what is pessimistic locking, what is optimistic locking and how does it work, write SQL for it, show me how to use it. What is a transaction, a dead lock, etc..4th round - system design.. model a system that solves this simple X real problem found in our domain. Just a chat basically.1st round quickly filters out people who don't have basic knowledge2nd round verifies skills in OOP, TDD, multithreading (locks, dead lock, race conditions).3rd round again verifies skills in OOP (bit redundant tbh), but then goes into the DB and verifies that you actually know what is going on under the framework4th round verifies that you know more high-level architecture stuff.. message queues, redundancy, gateway/api/reverse-proxy, sharding... and that you can think bigger than just a few classes.I think these 4 rounds could be compressed in just 3 and be just as effective. Phone call was 15 minutes, the 3 rounds were a little more than 1 hour each. A total of roughly 5 hours that could be shortened to 3.5 or 4. I am very confident this process filters out 100% of the people who can't do the job. They verify all the skills needed to do the daily work that people apply every day. Perfect, imho. I don't get why it is so difficult for other companies to do the same.This process is applied by a tech unicorn, so it definitely works at scale too..",

Start putting out feelers to other teams internally to see if you can transfer.Ultimately you have to operate as if you're going to get fired soon. Unless your boss herself comes to you asking to reset and mend the relationship, I would not assume that you can unilaterally do so, so I would not bend over backwards trying to fix it. Be professional, be cordial, but more than anything cover your ass, document everything, and prepare yourself to play counteroffense so that you can at least make their life difficult.PS: using the specific term \"hostile work environment\" is key because that is HR code for \"I can sue you\". Calling her a bad boss, saying she's mean, toxic, bad at her job, unfair - all of that doesn't matter if HR doesn't think you can get them in trouble. But if they think that - were they to fire you - you might hit them with a lawsuit for wrongful termination and hostile work environment stuff? At the very least HR is going to have to spend some time making sure this boss isn't the problem and that they have everything they need in place to make sure you don't have a valid lawsuit.

She is not only making your life miserable, she is wasting company's resources. Maybe don't go full on with the proof from the get go, but ask to change your manager, if they brush you off or not understand the extent of the problem, show the history of the comments as an example. Explain that the only reason you bring this up is to better illustrate the extent of the problem and that you are worried about how the team resources are managed. Show it as an example of a general pattern. If they agree to change your manager, no need to show them anything. The less back and forth you engage in, the better. Only do it if needed.

PIP is a one way thing, she can give you a PIP, but you can't give her a PIP. HR exists not to protect you, they exists to protect the company from lawsuit. If you think you need to stay in the company a little longer while looking for a job, I would suggest you be her bi\\*ch while you were there, and when one day, you finally leave for a different job, give an exit interview to the HR and let them know what a piece of sh\\*t this manager is",

The two different environments come with trade-offs. Big Tech companies are going to have very clear mentorship pathways and career ladders. In those roles, you'll learn how to build and operate scalable software that interacts with a large number of other teams. Start-ups will allow you to wear lots of different kinds of hats, solving more open-ended problems. It's also easier to work for a start-up on a personal level when you have no dependents or mortgage, since by-design start-ups should have a limited runway.The advice I generally give is, it matters a lot more what you do with the opportunities that you're given.",

I think I saw someone comment on this sub they were debating applying for junior engineer positions or become a CTO at a startup. >Skills like working under deadlines with limited constraints, communicating effectively with non-data scientists, and knowing when to pursue a project or to decide that it’s not worthwhile.These are super-generic and can cover a lot of ground. My previous \"startup\" was led by someone who had years of experience, but he really only cared about the tech and didn't care about management. He skipped tons of important meetings and would get angry at teams when they couldn't build applications without requirements because he felt requirements had already been shared and were \"obvious.\" When I discussed edge cases with him, he wanted to dismiss them. What kind of limited constraints? I know very few things in life are ideal, but constraints can cover things like, \"we don't know the final format of the data we're going to receive, but we'll have time to refactor once we do. And we have a good starting point of what it will be\" vs \"the technology we want to base this solution on doesn't really exist yet, our data scientist who finished a bootcamp two months ago is still trying to create a working model.\"",

My advice would be to not even care about the title and just apply to what you feel suits you. If the listing says Sr and says 3 yoe+ then apply to it. If it says Sr 10 yoe+ that's going to be tougher, and mid lvl probably suits you better for that company. Titles are inconsistent so you should really just ignore them for the most part.",

Knowing someone who can refer him to a company 2. Him reaching out to people on LinkedIn personally, asking them to refer him (usually after a coffee chat or a Google Meet call) 3. Really having his interview skills down. Get off Cursor and any auto completions. If he cannot do the Blind75 questions, or Neetcode150, that is also a reason why he isn't landing an offer. 4. Yet again, get a referral.The first job (even so now) is the hardest to get. I remember when I first started my career almost 10 years ago, no one wanted to talk to me. Recruiters ghosted me after smiling at me in video calls, and just causing me to get no where. After I got my first job, exactly at the one year mark after starting, I had recruiters in my mailbox daily.Persevere. He will make it.",

It will only demotivate him. Save his time and energy for building better projects, and applying for jobs that he is a better fit.Keep in mind that the CS job market is curently the most brutal out of all popular majors, so what I'm suggesting is only gonna eliminate a bit of pressure.Oh, he can also do some volunteer developer work for experience. Find non-profits, send out emails, see if he has any luck. By doing that, when the market gets better, he'll have a strong enough resume to apply. It'll also give him a sense of purpose for now.If possible, he can also go to a college for 2 years, get a diploma in healthcare-related profession. Or join the military/police. Switch out of CS, basically, because if he stays he has to expect 2-3 more layoffs in his career.",

Also, just embracing that as an area of growth might be simple enough. Just apply to regular engineering positions. That lack of explicit support experience might be valid. It might not.

I don't have any Engineering or Dev friends. Lot of tech peers and friends in PM and Data, but no one to really ask for close advice.Probably the reason why you got rejected, is the reason why you want out.

I have an EE degree and worked as an EE for several years before trying to pivot to CS. Even with the STEM degree in a closely related field I had trouble landing interviews, and basically had to start over to be a SWE.

The head of HR was biased against unemployed people, even though she herself had been laid off before. Another engineer felt they could lowball a specific candidate. Unless you’re an absolute rockstar, you don’t have much leverage without a current job or competing offers. I got laid off recently. I was making a very good base comp. Enough that I had a small case of golden handcuffs. When speaking to a recruiter, I decided to give a number a little lower than I had been making. The market is rough, and I didn’t want to price myself out. I got an offer. If I hadn’t been laid off, I could have asked for more money. i usually try to avoid saying my number first, but I didn’t in this case. I may have cost myself money by doing that. When I told them my number, they said it was very doable. So, they likely had more budget. I explained my situation to them. I ended up getting more than I originally asked for, as we had some more decisions around comp, but not what I was making previously. I’m OK with it for now. I'm of the mindset jobs are temporary, but I’d love to find a long-term place. Of course I wish I was making the same or more. FWIW, I was honest during my interview process. Most people seemed reasonable, and they did offer more than my original stated number. But who knows what they said on their own? And they didn’t give a lot more than I asked for.",

Employers have so much to choose from, they'll easily find someone who has experience with the stack they use and will be productive on day 1.Given that you are a recent grad, you have no previous job but you have your coursework, your projects, your interests. Try to find jobs that align with those.If you are going to keep contributing to OSS or building projects of your own, try to stick to a theme or domain. Using a particular language, or a specific stack. Or writing code that is used by a specific industry. Basically look at the kind of jobs you want to target and try to develop the skills they want and need.I am sorry you graduated in the middle of a downturn. This is literally night and day compared to most of the recent 25 years if you forget the dot com bust and the massive 2009 real estate crash. The economic system being upside down in the first place, and the people in charge of it being increasingly incompetent, this is just one of the many \"once in a lifetime\" economic crises you will have to go through.

Honestly, imo just try just learning math until you find your interest. It's easier going Math to CS than other way. Fundamentals transition well into other subjects...like how one physics B.S. makes for easy masters in any engineering field. Be aware that academia isn't the career for every personGood jobs come to plenty who graduate with bachelors in CS and navigate the corporate ladder. Companies may prefer industry knowledge over \"papers and degrees\"~ my favorite class is Cloud Computing if you like H.P.C. though it's more data science than CS!",

Add a career summary at the top of the resume that rounds out all of your experience and the skills that you picked up. I would then consolidate the skills section to just the important skills that are referenced in a job listing. 2. Leave out the career gap. They can infer that from gaps between one job to another. 3. I don't think the awards section is relevant personally. If you want to keep it for sentimental reasons then I'd suggest having it last. 4. You have far too much job experience to still warrant having projects in my opinion. I'd remove them. 5. Add more information on the jobs that you had. Simply listing the jobs is not enough. Explicitly mention the technologies and tools used and what projects you did. 6. Languages is not necessary in my opinion. Most applications ask for this before you input your resume. But it could be different for you, If so, then it can be kept. But I'd make it a single line.As for the job application, I prefer Indeed to LinkedIn personally and got my last job through there. Also I'd suggest applying on the company website whenever possible, companies have separate pipelines for applications and pay attention to the ones that come in through their website. I'd also say that don't just fire off the same resume hundreds of times. Tweak it slightly for every single job and ensure that it meets all of the minimum and most of the preferred qualifications. Also, I somewhat disagree with what another user on here said, the goal of your resume nowadays is to pass the ATS, not talk to a live person. Your resume should obviously be in human readable format but it should be jam packed with enough key words from the job description to get a high enough match and pass the ATS. After passing the ATS, you just have to convince a real human to hire you... which is far easier than some automated check that fails damn near everyone.",

I know the standard answer is always therapy, but I do think you'd benefit from discussing this with a therapist because odds are this is the type of stuff where you kinda need to do some work. Like, you need a plan, you need someone to hold you accountable, etc. My wife also has OCD, and that has always been an issue for her - it's that feeling that if she doesn't do it, and then it doesn't get done right, that it's all her fault and the worst possible scenario will materialize. Like, she did a masters and had no less than 10 breakdowns where she thought she was going to fail a test and get kicked out of the program... she got straight As bro. For 2 straight years. So yeah, I know a lot of people here are jumping straight to \"IT'S THE COMPANY CULTURE\". It doesn't sound like it is, it sounds like it's literally just you not letting yourself believe that you can take the time off without everything falling apart.There are things you can do to help - like, you can put together a plan for when you're out, you can talk to your boss and tell them you have this irrational concern so that she can let you know that's not the case and you can totally go.But it might be trickier than that.",

Not to disparage you or anything, but i view it as such a waste. Making millions for a company while you make pennies, the constant stress, this pressure of always having to make more money, this societal idea that a persons worth is based on their career, and to a lesser extent, money. In the end, we all die, in a random spot, at a random time. In that moment, all we will have are our memories, which will either be of fulfillment or regret, no money, none of ypur coworkers or bosses to comfort you, none of your worldy possessions. If working genuinely makes you happy, and if that is how you wish to spend your life, then good. However, if this thought gives you anxiety, maybe you should rethink not taking PTO.",

It also isn't great for your ability to be promoted if you're seen as the only person who can do your particular job. This would be a GREAT thing to talk to your supervisor about in your next one-on-one. \"I've found that I feel guilty taking PTO because I worry that things will break down while I'm gone. What can we do to make our team more flexible, so that our ability to function well doesn't depend on me specifically sitting in that chair?\" Maybe have some suggestions - more comprehensive documentation, perhaps some cross-training with others on your team so have more of a grasp of each other's particular roles?

The compliments were crazy like, Ah you're angel, you're so smart, you're so handsome, etc etc. It was a LOT from different people and honestly I felt like a celebrity there.Japan has a heiarchy of age and mentorship. Japanese call this like a Senpai-Kouhai relationship. Basically they view their job as an older person or mentor to guide you, treat you, and sort of mold you as best they can. It can be weird from a westerner perspective because work time is work time and there's no \"relationship\" besides training you. I personally wouldn't be alarmed by this behavior but I'd still maintain distance. A lot of these type of people are fascinated with having foreign friends. it's largely a selfish relationship for them. I often felt like a token foreigner friend and many girls wanted to date me just for being a foreigner. I sense this guy is the same. The other part of this is that a lot of these people use you as a way to feel some sort of acceptance outside their own culture. Like, oh I have a foreign friend that accepts me, I'm cool out of my own normal societal circumstance. Just be polite and keep saying I can't do X or Y. Japanese sometime will take the initial no as polite no. So you need to say no like 7 or 8 times until it goes through. Be persisent but gracious and you won't have any issues.",

If this is for senior+ level roles, then not having had many technically challenging projects with wider scope and ambiguous requirements that you need to drive discovery in addition to implementation for is legitimately something that will (and in all fairness should) work against you, because those are exactly the types of projects senior engineers are hired to work on, and companies want to see proof that you can successfully do that type of work.If you're interviewing more for entry to mid level roles, then I think you can make this type of project feel more impressive and impactful by talking about the business need that drove the work, any technical design decisions you made (however small - like researching and deciding to use some third party library), any collaborations you were involved in for the project (both engineering and cross functionally), how you tested and deployed your feature, and what the business impact was.For instance, maybe the technical piece you worked on was just calling some API endpoints to fetch data and building a dashboard in React - pretty straightforward project. In addition to talking about what was involved in coding the dashboard, you should talk about things like: why your company wanted this dashboard built, how you worked with the design team to build your dashboard to their design spec, how you wrote unit/functional/e2e tests and UATed your dashboard prior to deploy, how you used feature flagging and log monitoring to ensure a successful deploy, and what business goals were accomplished after you successfully deployed your dashboard. Even if these things feel like standard process and not that interesting to you, talking about them shows that you understand what goes into the things you build at a higher level beyond just the code you are asked to write.",

This is what executives do - it's not that they're guaranteed employment, it's that if you let them go you're going to have to pay them like 2 years of salary in a severance package. Because yes, in the US, because of how employment contracts are built, the only way for someone to guarantee you 3+ years of work would be by signing a 3 year employment contract - and even then, that doesn't guarantee your employment, it just clarifies/defines the remedies you have if they try to break the contract early. Which again, can be literally \"you have to pay me the remainder of my contract\".So yeah, next time don't ask if they can guarantee employment (they can't), but ask what their standard severance package is at your level, and then tell them that since this job would require relocation to a very expensive city (from a very expensive city), that you'd like to negotiate a more substantial severance package to ensure that you're financially able to relocate back to your city of choice.Mind you, depending on your level, they might still say no - especially large companies tend to have pretty inflexibly policies for this type of stuff for rank and file employees.

So pivot your answer to that.Leadership changes and freezes doesn't stop *growth*. It stops the formality of an on-paper promotion. Who cares about a promotion if it doesn't actually carry with it any growth? If a SWE 2 is doing the exact same work as a Senior SWE, and the only difference is title, does that matter?Like, if you tried to fib and answer that you have been promoted, that's not going to be the end of that question. They're going to ask about what growth in tasks/responsibilities that promotion came with. The promotion itself is just a formality.",

You could get screwed *even* if the company becomes worth something- there are ways to dilute stock such that VCs get paid out and the others get nothing. If they can't afford to pay you right now, why would you have faith in the financials and solvency of the company?If this is all you can find right now, it's something and you'll get some experience. In general I'd say no to startups in general unless you really just want to build something (it very rarely works out favorably), and you're taking a risky version of the risky",

This would include guarantees about things like how much they’ll work over that 4 year period.You’ll need to make sure that the shareholder agreement outlines what happens if a shareholder becomes a liability.Ideally they offer you a reverse vesting deal as a founder. All your shares vest immediately at the price today and if you leave or lose your shares for some reason the shares that would not be vested at that point are forcibly sold back to the company. Sometimes the company buys them back at a predetermined value (often FMV at the time of issuance) but other times that’s not possible for a number of reasons and you may get a different price if this occurs.Essentially you want guarantees for yourself and from the other shareholders with a significant stake.If their company is only worth $1m today then a 2% stake is only $20k. Thats about $5k/yr or around $5/hr at 20 hours a week. That’s not really worth it as it’s impossible to know what the future may hold. It’s exceedingly rare that a significant amount of unrealized future value gets baked into share prices.",

It’s not a requirement at all to find a job, but it makes the search a little easier due to networking and possibility for return offers etc. STEM in general, and especially CS, job hunts take longer than normal but it’s not a death sentence to have a few months gap between graduation and now. There’s no data from 24 and beyond but 23 and before shows that our unemployment is high, because our industry is cyclical, but under employment is super low so job hunts turn out good.",

Managers often have most power to give a good salary bump during actual promotions, but even then.... you'd probably get better by switching jobs.So what that means is yes, it does set the tone at your current employer. Some employers are very pennywise and pound stupid and will be penny pinching salary, while others recognize that quality and craftsmanship has a value.",

I could go into the issues with advice subreddits in particular.... but I don't need to to make my point. Dont make major life decisions off anecdotes you read on *any* subreddits, doesn't matter which one.If you want to pursue CS, pursue CS.There are *plenty* of new grads that are lining up jobs just fine. You know where they are? Not on a CS Careers Questions subreddit. They're not here talking about how easy their job search was. They're enjoying their life.The unemployment rate for new CS grads is 6.1%. While that number is high, and puts us in the top 10 for highest unemployment rates by degree.... That still means 93.9% of CS new grads are employed.The underemployment rate for new CS grads is 16.5%. This is the number of people employed in a job that utilizes their college degree. So it filters out the people that gave up and went to McDonalds. *This* number for us puts us in the *bottom 5* for all degrees regarding underemployment. We're doing pretty damn well. Or I should say 83.5% of us are doing pretty damn well.The 6.1%? The 16.5%? Those are the people that make up the majority of an advice subreddit's demographic, *because they need advice.* The 93.9% and 83.5% aren't normally posting here. And when they do (hello, it's me), they often get downvoted because it hurts to hear that you're in the bottom 16.5% of the industry. I understand it hurts to hear that, that percentage translates into a lot of people, but it's something people need to hear.And people not in the industry at all, like you, shouldn't be blinded by those peoples experiences.",

They usually do these round more than once, sometimes in person (on last steps, when they are almost ready to give you the offer). Its relatively simple to prepare for it, you either grind leetcode (solve \\~100 mid problems, and you will be in a good shape), or use tools like [https://techscreen.app/](https://techscreen.app/) or interviewcoder \\- system/tech designs. For you most likely will be 1 round (and 2 for senior positions). If you've built any personal projects - you should be all set with this one, since they dont ask for that much. Examples from my experience - design autocomplete or url shortener. \\- Final round, on this one the company runs 1 more round of something they are not sure about you. Like algorithms, or system design, so, just be prepared for more than 1 round of any type of interview.You got this! Good luck",

Be able to convince the other side you know everything from ground up and you are a rock star. And sound super organized.>I've never considered idempotency or what a hash ring is or what golden invariants are. I've never thought about CAP theorem, just that available and consistent is good. Requirements get passed to us by product managers, we never make them from a 5 minute conversation with the BA or stakeholder.This is what my friends (senior engineers) at Google told me.\"We just use Spanner for everything. For all practical purposes, Spanner is highly available, highly consistent (basically instant so the 'eventual' part is just theory for practical purposes), and infinite scale.\"So ya... now, CAP theorem states that in a real world, we have to choose Availability or Consistency as first priority. And that is true. But generally the idea is if you are dealing with money especially in banks, then choose Consistency. Otherwise, basically all the time Availability is fine.In the real world? Unless you work at Amazon/Google scale, you are going to use postgres/mysql anyways. And even at those big tech firms sql databases are used in many teams.As for what kind of databases I worked over so far: postgresql, mysql, mongodb, cassandraAlmost all companies using MongoDB are using MongoDB for no reason than \"it's webscale\" meme. It's tech debt. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs)Use case for Cassandra/DynamoDb is niche overall.Scale? Dude, sql databases have run the world forever. Credit cards before the days of DynamoDB worked everywhere around the world. Everyone was swiping left and right. Big banks hold records of swipes, withdrawals, deposits, etc globally. Those dumb Youtube videos during covid by these juniors trying to gain views about high writes == nosql (kind of true but whatever)? sql databases can when writes are properly batched in theory go over a million insert per second though in reality, let's say 10k insert per second. 10k insert per second is 10\\^5 \\* 10\\^5 sec a day = 10\\^10 inserts a day aka 10 billion rows a day.Schemaless? Unless you are dealing with e-commerce, fraud, machine learning, etc., you can shove in your metadata to JSONB on postgresql.ACID vs BASE? DynamoDB supports ACID as well. You can have sql databases have BASE like properties. Especially mysql in which you can change engine.Biggest differences are really nosql databases tend to be LSM tree oriented while sql databases tend to be B tree oriented. But DynamoDB on its sort key is B tree oriented as well.Sharding? SQL can have auto sharding. Though it is true in practice (this part I agree since I have not used auto sharding in my jobs) you do have to worry about sharding on SQL. But like what? A few days a year or two for the team once everythings set up? Ya, nonissue.It's all a clownfest at this point with each databases trying to emulate parts of the other database as well.**System Design Interview crap made more sense back when hardware was limited. Nowadays, we can have Redis instance with over half a terrabyte RAM. Many times, we can just chug the entire useful parts of database to the whole Redis.** Now caching? Lol wait till you learn DynamoDB handles that for you if you are willing to pay extra. DynamoDB comes with caching by a click of a button so you don't need to handle a separate Redis instance. Just pay more money to AWS. All these \"scale problems\" you see in system design interviews are basically being all solved by Cloud providers. Cloud providers are not stupid. AWS needs to make more money. Why not just add more features to address all the known system design workarounds of the past?",

A properly run mature firm should have had infra team do all the tooling so product side engineering can just ship.System Design Interview is just another theatre like Leetcode Interview. Don't overthink. Companies need some way to separate levels and filter candidates at the onsite.You think most engineers in tech ever built Amazon e-commerce site ground up? Nope. Maybe a few handful in the country? But you get that interview. Where do you think many interviewers get the question and answer from? Whatever they saw/memorized with their own experiences added on the Internet/workplace.If you actually do quick 'back of the envelope' calculation to many system design interviews, you will realize \"I can do this with 1 server\" (you should STILL have replica because servers always crash). You will realize vertical scaling means very different from a decade ago and today.You know when I was a kid growing up, 256mb USB was insane. Now we got portable SSDs that are in the terrabytes.

System Design interview prep alone can take months. Similar idea with Leetcode and so forth. And realistically years because you do this in sprints over your career as you level up.Basically say your job only involves taking sums (adding basic items). If you test the candidate all sorts of ideas like taking sum/division/multiplication/difference of real numbers (negative numbers, decimals, integers, irrational numbers, etc), imaginary numbers, symbols, etc. then you can feel somewhat assured the person can probably add basic numbers reliably. Is that correlation perfect? Nope. But I would find it hard pressed to find someone who can do a complex operation involving multiple paranthesis, imaginary number, negative number, multiplication, addition all nested together to struggle with basic additions consistently. It also helps you filter as much candidates as you want and make you feel \"I got the best candidate out of thousands\".",

That's the final frontier until we get some kind of quantum entanglement that guarantees 100% partition availability. I'm more annoyed that these people expect you to design the perfect system in an interview which is supposed to be 'no correct answer' so they're testing if the candidate has read a book, rather than letting the candidate design their own and guiding them to a more suitable design and seeing how well they communicate and react to feedback.Personally if I am doing these interviews and a candidate gets everything right I'd retry their round and find a system thats not covered in any guide.",

P has to be taken for granted.>supposed to be 'no correct answer'Unfortunately there is often 'a correct answer'.For instance, if you design DataDog, you need realtime updates aka streaming.If you want to store images/files, then you need to choose a blob storage over database.And so forth.The 'no correct answer' is usually the fact for most system design, you can use nosql database nowadays on a traditional sql problem. For instance, you can use dynamodb for banking related stuff which need ACID transactions. That was not something people thought a decade ago and so forth.Or given time constraints or familiarity or complexity or cost or whatever, you would prefer Y. You generally want to keep the system as simple as possible in the real world.>seeing how well they communicate and react to feedback.That is what system design interview is testing by level.Junior = Has very little general idea. Simple stuff like sql vs nosql of choosing by ACID or BASE. Needs a lot fo help and reacts to feedbackMid = Has a general idea. High overview without details. Reacts well to feedback and sounds like someone who can grow and you would want to work withSenior = Able to design properly. Experienced and starts to know the details. And the pros and cons. Accepts life has multiple options. Leads the interview and comes with good working design that the person can defend.Staff = More details than Senior. Has enough experience to even mention details that aren't on books (this is a lie again). Able to have the simplest design and depending on a certain nonfunctional requirement, comes up with a nontraditional simple idea that works.Principal = At this point you are basically god of the interview. You also consider costs as well. Can't make a single mistake. It's an extreme bar and one could argue is really luck based. There's a reason engineers at tech firms make 7 figures from here.The whole idea is as you gain more 'experience' in the real world, the way you 'talk' changes. So it really is about communication.In practice? It's a whole show of bull like Leetcode. Why? Because in an actual job unless one works in pre-seed A or seed A startup (not even then), the day to day job is going to be nothing like the system design interview. It's going to be like what you said. It's just another round to fake.Plus, if you talked about using DynamoDB for payment transactions half a decade ago, then depending on interviewer, you would have been rejected anyways. Same idea about once you calculate both read and write and determine you can for use case use postgresql for small schemaless values. It's really dumb so ya... very very very subjective.",

The other option is doing what Netflix often does and putting high preference towards those who were referred by internal professionals. That just opens up to nepotism at that point.Do we want to go back to \"how many manholes in New York\" and so forth which btw have all been solved (significantly easier to memorize. Do-able in days), completely irrelevant to the job, etc?Explicit IQ tests are illegal and so this interview format is the closest to check someone's puzzle matching abilities. And no one can know who is a better hire over another without seeing the individual at the actual job (on payroll) for at least over half a year.Outside many LC Hards (which is just bullshit and only there for filtering because of supply/demand), most LC Easy and Medium are things I would expect a competent junior could do with prep. The \"prep\" is known to everyone (as fair as possible) and scalable (an individual does not need to study per role per company). From there given there's finite time, I can also get someone's thought process and communication. And most importantly, pattern matching skills (which is honestly some of the most important skills on the actual job). Let alone LC at its fundamentals tests on the very basic concepts I would expect every CS grad should know like classes, hashmap, set, bfs/dfs, stack/queue. On an ideal interview even if the candidate cannot think of the solution, the candidate should be able to work with the interviewer to the solution (indirectly shows how adaptable the candidate is to the actual workers there).Fortunately, very very few firms give actual LC \"Hards\" directly w/o help. And those that do give the well known handful of LC Hards that can be studied for. If you are applying to Uber and Uber pays a massive paycheck, then of course you should expect artificially high standards because everyone's applying but there's only a few positions available. Most firms to this day especially nontech give LC Easy or Easy Medium. Something as simple as checking if a string is a palindrome or if the paranthesis are valid.Some companies do take home assignments on top as a byproduct. But the problem with take home is individuals have to code in a language they are not comfortable with and spend many hours (because other candidates will put in many hours regardless of what the expectation claims). But the reject from the hiring side is decided in seconds or minutes at most. It's extremely unfair from the candidate side. So ya... It's process of rational elimination. There's no other scalable option today that this field has.One could argue we should have some standardized test that gives out a score like the SAT. Well... that's basically what codesignal is nowadays.",

As a Canadian, you qualify for a TN visa which would allow you to work in the U.S.You will most likely not be able to do what you’re suggesting, that is only go into the office only 1 day a week. To keep your work permit active, you must be U.S resident for tax purposes. And to do this, you’ll have to meet the substantial presence test which requires you to physically be in the US for more than half the year. Unfortunately, there is no provision that will grant you work authorization in the US while allowing you to live abroad. The only way this would’ve been possible is if you also held US citizenship. Then it would be up to your company if they want to deal with the tax implications.",

I am a fullstack engineer and the biggest trouble I had with personal projects is the designs of my pages. I now can get AI to come up with a theme, a design, a layout, an admin dashboard, a home page and everything for me to use as a basis to build on and bounce my own ideas off.Although I think great design is unbelievably valuable, I think good design is fairly self evident. I mean, I can tell you if a site is well designed - so can my mother. I dont think its difficult for AI to grasp this concept and produce designs for you. Almost all sites have at the very least the same layout; search bar at the top, nav bar top right/left and so on. Beyond this and the small design changes between different sites, I cant see design needing to be done in the way it is now. My team at work no longer needs the amount of designers we have - we got AI to design us a new view based on our existing views and it looked great.The only exception to this (as always there are exceptions) will be exceptional designers in my option. Those designers who come up with new, unique almost game changing designs followed by many. AI wont be able to do this as easily, because AI needs a basis to train on. For example, in the late 2010's we got the gradient design you see on Stripe, with the scrolling animations as you scroll down. I think this design was game changing within the game of design, and so many sites followed this (I dont even know if Stripe were first tbh).I feel like if youre that good, original and can constantly change/push the bar, you'll be fine. However I would bet that most design teams will be shrinking in the coming 5-10 years.",

If your soon to be wife loves her job, you love your city, you're planning on having kids soon, etc... then that will need to take precedence. That might mean that you let Jan come and try to find a job in the meantime and tighten your belt a bit. Once kids come into the mix, you need to think long and hard about where you want to park for a second. Do you have any networks from college days? Is your manager understanding of the situation? If so, I would have a blunt conversation with them and ask them if you can use them as a reference or if they know anyone around the area that's hiring. Anyone you know that might be at a company, possibly hiring? The market is not great right now, and companies know this, so they're pulling whatever bullshit they can for attrition (my company is doing the same thing although maybe a softer version of yours). To answer your question about your current knowledge, you might want to give yourself more credit. I doubt someone goes into a role for 4 years and \"everyone else is doing the work\". Have you received any promotions since starting? If that's the case, then you probably did something to get there. But the fact that you know Kotlin and Java is good, the industry is full of Java roles. So you could shift to Java (or C#... they're similar enough) and see what's out there. At the end of the day, it's business to companies, but personal to you. This stuff can be really hard mentally and emotionally. I can't tell you which path to take, but if it were me, I would first ask yourself if you want to stay in mobile. If so, then focus on learning the rest of the process. Read up your code base, pick up more Kotlin, learn JetPack Composer, etc. If not, then consider a shift into learning more about Java and/or C# then try your luck there.Most importantly, talk to your partner about the move. If they will be happier where you are, then just explain that you'll be tightening belts until you can find something else. And if you need to, get a temporary job somewhere not related to CS until you can gnab that interview. Also, look for any resources in the area for interview prep, resume editing, etc. Best of luck to you.",

It’s easy to feel like you need to chase every cert or language, but that often leads to burnout without real progress. Instead, reflect on what you enjoyed most from your tech role. Was it the problem solving side of coding, or the precision and detail that comes with testing? If testing was your comfort zone, roles in QA automation or SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) could be a natural pivot. These roles often let you leverage your coding skills while staying close to quality focused work.If you’re craving something new, IT certifications can definitely open doors but you’ll want to be strategic. For example, if you go the cloud route, AWS Solutions Architect Associate or Azure Fundamentals → Administrator can get you noticed quickly. If you lean toward cybersecurity, CompTIA Security+ is a great starting point and pairs well with your testing mindset. The key is to pick one lane, commit, and build a portfolio around it. Whether that’s small projects on GitHub, automation scripts, or even freelance gigs on platforms like Upwork. Freelancing can also be a good bridge though it won’t always be glamorous, but it’s real world experience that helps fill the gap on your resume.If you can structure the next 6–12 months around one clear goal say, “transition into cloud roles” or “move into automation testing” you’ll find it much easier to cut through the fog. And if you’d like more step by step advice, practical roadmaps, and career tips, [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) shares a lot of that.

From the company's perspective they are indeed paying you at around 45k when you add it all together. Second, if you ask for more you should be prepared to justify it with actual numbers. You need to prove in a quantifiable way that you are bringing value to company through what you are doing. It can't just be based on vibes or simply wanting more.

What you do is you get some experience at one place for a minimum of one year or possibly two and then you move on. Job hopping is how you make more money asking for more in the next gig. After 2 years you could probably just apply for mid-level roles asking for 60 or 70K. Do another 2 years and then ask for 90k. Then after you've gotten some decent amount of experience, join r/ overemployed and double your salary to about 200k. Profit.",
