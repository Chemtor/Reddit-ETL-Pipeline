What helped me was changing my practice approach - instead of trying to solve a ton of problems, I focused on deeply understanding a smaller set of core patterns and writing them from scratch repeatedly until the syntax became muscle memory. I also started narrating my thought process out loud during practice to get comfortable talking through my approach. Have you tried platforms like interview query? They have some DE-specific practice problems that are more relevant than generic LeetCode, plus they offer peer mock interviews where you can practice the communication part. Sometimes just getting comfortable with the interview format is half the battle. Don't beat yourself up - these interviews are rarely representative of the actual job!",

Basically get really good at linked lists, dictionaries/hash maps, two-pointer, array problems. I haven't seen any other data structures being asked (maybe some chance dynamic programming). A good interviewer will work with you if you get stuck when solving these problems, and on top of that they should understand that you're under pressure and might not be operating at your best. The more rejections you get, the more you learn. Keep your head up and know that all it takes is one yes.P.S. don't forget to focus on behavioral/cultural questions, it's quite easy to tunnel vision on the technical portion and you might get caught off guard.",

It can easily get to micromanagement and now your team feels they need your approval for everything.I put my team in that situation and it took time to dig ourselves out. I had to coach them how to fish and make their own best judgment call, how to hold themselves accountable if something does go wrong, to think through what can happen if things go wrong, what signals to look for, and the proper channels to communicate.Over time, it worked. It took a lot of effort, but in the long run it freed me from being the bottleneck.Good luck!",

But it's a matter of identifying when you need to be more hands on, when you need to insert your opinion or knowledge on the task at hand.

If you want to be a better data engineer, just build stuff yourself. Start with easy pipelines and grow to more complex ones. Are you already familiar with tools like Airflow (or another orchestrator), dbt/SQL mesh, Spark, Kafka, Snowflake/Databricks? Just a few important ones to know.Learning is a key component of being a data engineer. The data landscape is changing constantly and more and more tools are growing to do similar things. But the industry is also getting more and more professional. It is key to understand cloud computing, auto scaling and being able to build and act upon proper monitoring, if you want to call yourself a senior at some point.",

I think one of the keys of professional success is learning to make lemonade with the lemons you're given, and it applies specially to feeling stuck. Most of the times, people that break through are people who learned something new, a new trick, or those who trained themselves on their own time, to learn to cook with better ingredients.It seems to me your best bet would be finding a healthy work place, and then finding self projects. A lot of times you really need to dig deep into what you want to learn, find the path to get there, and walk every step along the way.In other words, it often comes down to never beating yourself up. Instead, it might be from knowing yourself well enough to HAVE to learn on your own pace and with less pressure. My impression is that the pressure comes mostly from being forced to do things on the job that you're not that familiar with. Finding a solid ground comes from finding a place that will take you as you are, give fair compensation, and you show your true self and what you know. It never does well to try and be something/someone you aren't, force it, and set yourself to crash and burn.",

I think it's unfortunately extremely common for people who were entrenched in a poorly architected and/or a poorly understood architecture to be unable to see how it could be done differently. I also think hiring teams, for various reasons, are sometimes not equipped to relate the core concepts of data engineering over their own, so instead they feel more comfortable talking to candidates who have experience in their specific toolset.The skill I'm trying to build right now in my own interviews is assessing, understanding, and directly addressing any concerns a prospective employer might have about my skillset and my suitability to the job. You have to learn to speak the language they speak.In the future I'd try to give more options during interviews to the interviewers on how they want to proceed. If they want to see a project you are familiar with, pull up your notes. If they want to focus on your experience with their tools, follow up with clarifying questions about your scope and then propose a solution -- or even just relate how your experience applies to solving that particular problem.Hope that helps some. It's definitely difficult not having all the context before going into the room.",

Relying on a one man data army is a long shot at best, and even in the best of cases a road to burnout in a few years (ask me how I know and I'll tell you the companies I've left that had to replace me with a small team after I left). Analysts need not only good tools and training but a proper environment where data can be collected, cleaned, ordered etc. If you want to be a data driven company it's going to require an investment. Hiring one guy is lip service to that goal at best. Look into a team that can build out a proper data warehouse and empower that analyst to be the best he can be without carrying the weight of the world. Employees will be less likely to burnout and the business will get far more value.EDIT - Making this more practical (as I assume this is not in the current budget) - get a good understanding of what a proper data team should look like and fight like hell to get the budget to build one. Talk to your new hire and let him know you want to start with him but build a team under / around him in the coming years. Take that promise seriously, and build a vision together.

Jira and its ilk are great for management to keep track of your work not a tool for teams to self organize and deliver software. What I’m seeing is what agile was supposed to be has devolved into an employee monitoring system. We do scrums but it’s only a way to track what we do and use it in performance evaluations. The last three companies I’ve been in started out with high expectations then managers got the bright idea to use it to their advantage to monitor everything",

        "body": "A Tool cannot solve a Social Problem.If you have a healthy business / engineering relationship, then Jira (or any sufficently mature process-management tool) is great. When that relationship is not healthy, then tools, KPIs, approval committees become weights around everyones neck.If you feel that Jira is in your way, it is probably because there is something disfunctional in how the product and technical objectives are being vetted by your leadership. This vetting is fundamentally a value judgment based on how well those people get along and share a common objectives for the business as a whole.I have built software and teams in a variety of industries, lead over a dozen engineering teams from technical lead to executive management. Tools like Jira work well when the leadership (both business *and* technical) have good communication and a respect for each others goals. When either side is instead trying to dominate the other with their agenda, (whether its the Business team trying to chase every shiny new customer regardless of the ROI, or the Technical team trying to chase every new shiny new technology framework regardless of the ROI) a tool like Jira becomes a hammer that one side uses to \"force\" the other into submission or a shield to \"prove\" the other side is out of their mind.I often come into new teams in chaos. They have over-provisioned their Jira workflows in an attempt to track or prove the amount of work being done. The first step is to always get the team to a \"win\". That usually means stripping the process down to its fundamentals: what is the prioritized list and when do we need to get it out. Once you guide everyone through a cycle successfully with simple criteria, then you can do a real retrospective and ask \"how can we do better\" and adjust your tools/process accordingly.That first \"win\" is important, it gives people hope that things can actually get better and gets them to think positively about change instead of rejecting all suggestions out of hand.",

Some managers fall too in love with the tool and have devs doing a bunch of work just to keep tickets updated. Some make way too many tasks to where stuff is too granular. And try to literally account for every minute and plan down to the second. Others don’t know how to break up work into tickets that are right sized. Or over think that part of it. I’ve worked on teams with both extremes. My old job, my director was under pressure to show the team was successful by using metrics. So we spent tons of time on jira crap. And the CFO never even looked at it and just made decisions about IT by vibe anyways. Now I’m an independent contractor. And one of my long term engagements has a manager who underestimates the complexity of everything. He actually thinks it’s reasonable to have 1 ticket that’s “build entire warehouse and BI solution for client X” basically. And always tells them “6 weeks” or something ridiculous despite me looking at the requirements and thinking “oh this one is gonna be a pain”. So in short it’s not the size of the ticketing tool it’s how you use it.",

Most of the time we ended up having to do very simple local calculations which would indicate whether it needed to 'wake up' for larger processing. (Wake up in this sense being to connect to a local hub and send data over the whatever protocol was available.) Having something which can run on very lightweight iot devices, processing sensor data in real time while having a small impact on battery life could be a pretty decently marketable thing.

Learning each keyword in SQL for data engineering is like saying you want to learn carpentry so you’re going to learn what a hammer does, when to use a router and when to use a lathe. Knowing what something is and when to use it is usually easy to pick up as you go. Process is much more important to learn. Pick a problem (How have various presidencies affected various macro-economic KPIs). Then start by determining what data goes into those KPIs. Then find a way to get that data from a government or other API. Process the data into normalized tables. Then finally make a nice dashboard with the data and draw a conclusion. Finally set up some automation to updated your dataset monthly. Make sure new data is getting appended and you’re not overwriting old data. Ensure you’re not duplicating data. You get the idea. Process > Tools. You could probably go years in your career without touching the S or A or even B tier in your chart as a Junior. And that’s ok. Same way a trainee carpenter won’t be using a lathe to shape a table leg. So there’s no need for him to understand what a lathe does from day 1.",

When I have had people come up to me to ask about becoming an architect, the first question to them is, \"Are you ready to give up coding?\" Not because they won't have to, but I am looking to see if their head is in a space for the next steps. Architects have one foot in the business world and one in the tech world. The two worlds are very, very different.Hone your people skills. No matter how you move up, you will need them and they can always be better. You will have to start listening for business requirements (both stated and implied) and figure out not only what they are saying but the right patterns to pass down for the coders to implement. It is hard because the sirens in the weeds will always be there calling you back. You have to fight them. Every time you think, \"I could do this faster myself\" you need to STOP. Next level up is changing your tools. Your tools are no longer software on hardware but the software inside people's head. You need to learn how to communicate what you want done to other people. Unlike the hardware you are used to, sometimes you may need to do it multiple times to get what you want. You also have to make your people (tools) better. I think that is an obligations more senior people have to the newer ones. The trick is how to do it without being a dick.If you have any questions, feel free to ask.",

About 5-6 years later after I went to university (a few years after I graduated), the requirement for pharmacists steeply declined.Opposite story: when I was trying to become a DE, I watched a video from a popular YouTuber who described DEs as \"second class citizens\" and \"SQL monkeys\" in the data space. I chose to not listen to that person and carried on anyway because I really enjoyed DE. In the following 3-6 months after began the massive boom of data engineering and I got lucky.We can't predict the future. We can only pursue what we're interested in and adapt when the time comes.",

There is also just much more of a cookie cutter nature to analyst work than DE, which is where LLMs excel. Asking ChatGPT to make you a streamlit dashboard with some “insights” on a dataset, vs asking it to solve complex Spark efficiency issues, you can see the difference already today. My instinct is that AI will enable DEs to plug informative BI modules onto their pipelines far faster than it’ll enable analysts to stand up and maintain large data infrastructures on their own.",

However for smaller sized enterprises there will be more general data roles. It depends on maturity of data infrastructure as well.With regards to the future, I think as you are stating the data roles in general may become more intertwined also with the advent of AI where you'll be able to take on more, diverse types of work.However having had a role specific as data engineer will definitely not hurt you at this point. I think it will actually make you more valuable and capable in the end.Starting as a data engineer you can later fan out to the front end more where you take on a role as data analyst and scientist possibly.",

But I’ve noticed that data analysts and BI developers are increasingly acquiring ETL skills and taking on parts of the data engineering workflow themselvesAnd you think this is simple?

You are like a kid playing with a BB gun who is asking the grown ups if specializing to get into the covert operations special unit is a good choice. Maybe start by joining the army first.Your questions are fundamentally flawed because you have no knowledge or understanding of what a data engineer does. Thinking that a business or data analyst can replace a data engineer shows how little understanding you hold, and perhaps should start asking experienced engineers what the role consists of and what knowledge is required first, before making assumptions and looking like a fool.",

The idea is to simplify the data stack, instead of having separate tools for each of these tasks.Some highlights:• **Powerful built-in Data Quality & Observability**: Native data profiling, no-code tests, and real-time alerts out-of-the-box.• **Strong Collaboration & Governance**: Business glossary integration, tagging, sensitive data classification, and clear ownership assignments help everyone stay aligned.• **Column-level Lineage**: Easily visualize your data pipelines down to individual columns, making debugging and root cause analysis straightforward.• **API-first design**: Everything is built around open APIs, and we offer SDKs too, making integrations and automations super easy.• **90+ connectors**: Quickly bring metadata from your sources into OpenMetadata with just a click through the UI, or schedule it your way (Airflow, Dagster, etc.).• **Easy, lightweight deployment**: All you need are containers for the OpenMetadata server, MySQL/Postgres, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch, and a scheduler. Deploys easily on Kubernetes.We’ve also got an active Slack community and thorough documentation to help you get started. If you want to quickly check it out, we have a sandbox available too—no setup needed.• [**Sandbox Environment**](https://sandbox.open-metadata.org/)**:** Hands-on experience with no setup required.• [**Docs & How-To Guides**](https://docs.open-metadata.org/latest/how-to-guides)• [**Active Slack Community**](http://slack.open-metadata.org/): Super responsive for any questions or support.",

PySpark is just an API for Spark, which is a Java application that runs on clusters of nodes (different computers on the same network). When the cluster saves a file, it splits it up into parts processed on each node, but then the nodes need to know where to send the data. The DBFS isn’t on the node, it’s on some other computer. So each node needs an address (like a url) to know where to send it. It’s all comes down to spark being designed for moving data over a network.Databricks was built off of ipykernal which used classic file system. When classic python code is run, it runs on the driver, which has the DBFS mounted (like how a usb drive or shared drive is mounted) so the reference it, you just need the file location like you’d write if you ran it on your laptop.And fwiw, each node doesn’t mount DBFS because it would be a massive pain for several reasons.",

Your python session can read that path as it usually can any path on the OS you have access to, and anything running in your python session - like pandas - has to use that path.Using `dbfs:/` with a python library like pandas would be like asking pandas to open `ftp:/` or `http:/` -- it is dependent on the library to know how to use the protocol to go fetch the data. For example with the requests library you can do calls to `http:/`Spark - which you access through the pyspark API - understand `dbfs:/` so it can use that path. More than that though, the `/dbfs` path does not necessarily exist on the workers in your cluster, so sending that path out to the workers is pointless. You can't access it via workers because it isn't a local file path, and exposing it as if it were a local file path to multiple machines may confuse some users into treating it like a local file path.",

What issues do you hav there, for example, performance, security, etc.Finally, do the same with Airflow, is it a matter of managing the platform, scaling it, etc. On board with your rationale for sticking with open source. It might be tempting to try other tools etc, but change comes with a cost and if you don't have to change everything, then change the parts that need changing vs changing everything. Keep things simple, don't create different stacks for different use cases as that will add more admin overhead.Definitely look for SaaS options like MWAA, Astronomer, Datacoves, etc as that will decrease the admin overhead.Good Luck!",

It looks like you guys are doing an ELT pattern, are your transformations currently done inside Redshift? You could go S3 + Athena as well. Or do everything inside Redshift. You could extend S3 into a lakehouse with iceberg either with Athena or Spark. I think AWS has various deployment guides and best practices for modern lakehouses.

However it is currently bit more limited wrt analytics functions, as its primary job has been for moving data around rather than analysis.It uses arrow to format internally, so anything else that uses arrow in the same process - so any python lib for example - can pass batches back and forth without copying.",

You can kick the tires for free at [https://app.gizmodata.com](https://app.gizmodata.com) \\- where I've loaded a 1TB dataset for folks to query and gauge performance, you just have to register to try it out.Full disclosure - I'm the founder of GizmoData - the maker of GizmoSQL.

The small number of engineers could not keep up with the volume and variety of requests so the analytics team bought a BI solution that allowed them to maintain their own models (Looker in this case). Based on your definition this was a ‘Shift Right’. The analytics team operated for years without dedicated people to ensure their environment was well organized or resilient to new business processes that require the logic that was locked in that transformation layer.When I took over that position we started to migrate logic out of Looker and into DBT, a process we are still working through today. The pilot project here was to deal with a deviation of a legacy data model in our data engineering environment by cleaning up and replacing it with all the goodies our analytics team extended and prepared in Looker for years. Once the legacy model was replaced we also made sure everything was set to refer to the new models.We are not moving away from having analysts model in Looker/LookML, though we have also set them up with DBT Cloud. Instead we are treating that workflow more like prototyping. Once our analysts have iteratively refined those models and they are stable we find the best way to ‘Shift them to the Left’. Sometimes these prototypes are abandoned by the business or analysts. This is fine, we didn’t put any additional engineering resources into it.",

ETL is actually a very good fit to implement \"Shift Left\" because you can potentially develop your data product (from the Shift Left parlance) using Low-Code/No-Code tooling. That is extremely valuable. Now when you consider the fact there is now a trend of decentralization and building the so -called \"data mesh\" architecture, you can easily see how the \"Shift Left\" is the exact paradigm to implement the \"data mesh\". These two concepts are made for each other.In my opinion the above architecture is superior to what is currently being pushed as \"modern\".

What’s your data modeling understanding? If you aren’t sure what I mean by that, check out https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/kimball-techniques/dimensional-modeling-techniques/3. I’m guessing with DevOps you continuing working in the cloud, but have you worked with the data-centric services? If not, I’d explore the free tiers and get hands on. 4. Some of the most common languages (in order of importance) are SQL, Python, and shell scripting. SQL will always be the most importantly but sometimes you just need Python and shell scripting is always super useful.5. Being that orchestration is a big part of Data Engineering, I’d check out Airflow if you haven’t already because it is the most commonly adopted orchestrator. I prefer Dagster but don’t see many job reqs calling it out. Regardless, the important bit is understanding why DAGs are so useful and that can translate into any tool.That’s a solid start (and I apologize if this list itself is overwhelming). I always tell folks I’m mentoring to start at 1 (wrap your head around data products) as it is a good mindset shift and then just pick any of the other areas and focus on that.",

Don't know if the other examples you spoke about are the same. This is a matter of personal opinion. My general experience is that anyone can learn SQL, not everyone can learn PySpark. People who know both often prefer PySpark. Personally I would rather deal with shit code written in SQL than shit code written in PySpark. So in enterprise settings, I set SparkSQL as the default as much as possible.",

It all depends on the use-case.If your use-case is that all of the data is already in Snowflake and you just need to apply some „simple“ transformations, SQL is 100% the way to go for this - no need to use Snowpark or similar technologies.If your use-case involves significantly more complex transformations, complex data processing, machine learning or just generally things that would be significantly easier be done in a language like Python, a technology like Spark might be a better fit.There is no one-size-fits-all solution. If currently every use-case can be solved with pure (maintainable) SQL, then stick with it. In the future there might be a different use-case that might not be solved easily with SQL, then you might want to add Snowpark or something else.",

        "body": "> I find a developer easier and if I find him he most probably knows a lot about modellingOnly applies to some organisations. I've been in some where everyone come up through a more traditional analyst pathway on SQL databases, and they had absolutely no concept version control, or version control, or literally anything other than SQL. Sure, you can find these people and grab them if that's all you need.Other organisations however may be more oriented around their own internal technology, and may have more SWE around the place. In that case finding developers that can work in something like Python will be a lot easier, and they'll be a lot more used to writing code that can be run and tested locally, and they'll be more familiar with all of the tooling around all of that and they'll prefer it -- they will be aggravated by the limitations of having to only work on a remote db and not having debugging tools.So this is just about matching up with the type of organisation you're in.> I dont care about scaling because the scaling part is taken over by...Not relevant to a decision between dataframe libraries and SQL. Scaling is handled by the execution platform and is entirely independent of the data transformation and querying code you've written.> I don't care about dependency hell because there are no version changes.This also isn't really about dataframe libraries vs sql.SQL databases do go through version changes and they can change behaviour or syntax and that can break things. As an individual pipeline or procedure writer you might not see that much if you've been relying on a DBA or an ops team to handle all of that for you, or if databases aren't upgraded for years you just may have not have gone through such a process. I have been at an org that spent about a year and a few million dollars desperately trying to update their all their SQL to work on the new DW because it worked *slightly* differently and randomly broke all sorts of things.If you get things working and just stick with a version, you're not going to get dependency hell regardless, because your dependencies aren't changing. Even if you are updating... I can't recall ever having any data issues due to version updates.All software gets updated over time. All changes can potentially break things. You can have frequent changes and small easily fixed issues, or rare big changes that are horrendously painful. These are platform considerations, so they don't directly relate to whether you're using dataframes or sql.> It is quite general and I don't face problems with migrating to another rdms.For the most basic of select statements, sure, you can usually copy+paste things over. For actual pipelines and management though, you're often going to have to change syntax around to fit with whatever server you're running on.* T-SQL uses `TOP` after `SELECT` but other dialects use `LIMIT` at the end* QUALIFY exists in some dialects but not others* Does your DDL have `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` or only `SELECT INTO`* What options do you have for tables in your DDL -- they are often quite different* Some RDBMS allow partition exchanges, but they don't all work the same way* Some servers allow `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS` while others require you check first.* Some servers allow `CREATE OR REPLACE` while others require you `DROP` then `CREATE`* Some dialects have ANTI and SEMI joins, others require you to implement in a subqueryIf you completely swap your dataframe libraries around you'll have to go through a similar process of finding equivalents. Or you could just not - if your pipelines run on their own host then each pipeline can use a different library, allowing you to gradually migrate from one to another. It isn't like when you have a single SQL database you're running on, and when you want to switch you have to move *everything*.> In most cases it look's cleaner to me than f.e. snowparkYou're just used to it (though I can't speak to snowpark specifically). Personally *I* find that the composability of dataframes and transformer functions allows me to better encapsulate certain behaviours and abstract them away. It allows me to run partial transformations rather than having to faff around with reworking subqueries or CTEs, and I don't have to scroll up and down massively long queries even for what ends up being a large and complex transformation.> The development roundtrip is super fast.You're probably just more used to it. What even is the 'roundtrip' to you? What are the development, test, and deployment cycles you're looking at using?> Problems like scd and cdc are already solved million timesAnd they have the same approaches in dataframes. You're still doing the same operations, you're just expressing them differently.---> Unittests are easierThis is significantly underselling it. By integrating the dataframe library into your imperative language, like Python, you can generate synthetic data during the script. Your transformations can be expressed as functions, which means you don't even need to load data into any kind of locally-run database, you can just inject data directly into the transformation function to check for the result. You can do this interactively when developing, chaining your own custom data directly into the functions that you are testing. Everything you write here can then by turned into an automated test.---The biggest aspect you are missing is that dataframes are integrated into another programming language, which allows your pipelines and processes to be much more dynamic and much more capable.For example, I can write a function that takes a dataframe and a list of key columns and it will automatically generate a column expression to generate a hashdiff. I don't have to list out the data columns every single time, it can inspect the dataframe schema and figure that out without running any actual transformations.I could have a function that looks at a struct column and automatically comes up with the column expression that will flatten it out. It can automatically do this recursively as well, making it very easy to flatten out ingested json data.I can write a UDF that can make use of *anything* in my programming language and return the result data back to the execution engine.During a long line of transformation steps I can inspect the data as it goes to change behaviour, including conditionally sending messages or alerts out. I don't have to wait for the end of a procedure to collect a result, I don't need another system to query some logging table to poll for results.I can make use of the fact that the programming language will have an LSP in my IDE to allow me to jump between transformer functions. Every time I see some abstracted behaviour and want to know how it works, I press a single key and jump directly to that code. If I want to rename something in my logic it is a single keypress and typing the new name, and that variable reference is renamed everywhere without error.When building complex transformations I can handle what would otherwise be complex subqueries or CTEs by chaining a single function call. I don't have to re-nest the previous statement in their own `SELECT` statements, I just take the existing dataframe and chain another `.select()` off of it.Overall this gives you more flexibility and expressiveness, but requires a slightly more complex approach. That tradeoff isn't necessarily for everyone, but it doesn't make one option absolutely better or worse than the other, it just depends on what you *want*.---As others have mentioned, they're not inherently exclusive. While using an RDBMS as your execution engine may prevent effective use of dataframes, using a dataframe-based execution engine you can also write SQL. Spark allows you to swap back and forth between SQL and dataframes (https://spark.apache.org/sql/) ; [Polars can also do it](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/dev/reference/expressions/api/polars.sql.html) ; and [Daft is bringing it in too](https://www.getdaft.io/projects/docs/en/stable/sql/overview/#example)",

I struggled a lot with discreet math and I didn't have a study group, so I decided to radically change my career to Urban Planning instead. I graduated from college and worked in urban planning until I had to leave my home country due to economical and sociopolitical crises. I worked in whatever I could find in order to survive, until I understood that remote jobs that paid in dollars was the way to go. I stumbled upon Data Engineering while doing research on what remote jobs paid well and decided to go back to programming. In 2022, I took a Data Science boot camp and fell I love with it. I got a job as a data engineer in a startup and I've been there since, though tbh it hasn't been what I was expecting. I'm the only data person in the entire company and I lack so much experience that I have no idea how to organize things. I've been doing more machine learning than anything else, and sure, I've learned a lot, but I'd love to have a senior or someone with more experience to kind of show me the way, procedure, good practices, governance, etc. I like data engineering, I like organizing, cleaning, standardizing, and troubleshooting, but it's hard when you don't even know where to begin or how to do things correctly.

It can automatically buffer up to 15 minutes|300MB at a time. Or a streaming analytics setup can automatically convert to parquet for you. You could even have the function write to both blob and hub or a while, so you can figure out how to get it to work before cutting off the old feed.",

Don't worry about it for 600MB unless this genuinely matters. *IF* It genuinely is worth the effort.

Also, instead of making them do all of the joins, you do it for them and provide easier to use tables. This leads to significant dashboard performance improvements as well.At that point, your PowerBI folks are just responsible for making dashboards.This should also resolve your minimum capacity issues.",

This project attempts to simplify the state management - focus specifically on data transformation and dataset oriented - users describe a transformation flow **as if** **they're transforming static data**, and this project makes all source updates applied on target automatically. It works for a subset of scenarios (users always care the transformed result of the latest version of the source), and try to make these scenarios really easy for users.",

Under the covers the micro-partitions in Snowflake are immutable, changes to them cause a rewrite. I've managed to get great performance improvements in snowflake by:1. Selectively updating columns rather than all, if you take an SCD2 approach you can only update a valid\\_to column which can help. This is particularly great at reducing table scan time in incremental loads in DBT.2. Really spend time trying to figure out good cluster keys. Sometimes you can use natural keys in the data, sometimes you need to create them. For example, I am able to use a cluster key to refer to a general site and I am able to use another key to relate to a specific day, from a standard timestamp. This way I limit rewrites to a single site for a single day. When dealing with updating data, you are usually going to be dealing with the most recent day / previous several days.3. Design your tables so that most of your work is append only. Snowflake is most performant when you just throw more data at it, you bypass the merge issue entirely if you are able to just throw data into a table and then selectively filter.Query optimisation is a pain but snowflake has good tools available, the profiler is fantastic.",

Ingest rate is around 10k to 100k per second depending on the time of day.We ended up spinning up a local ClickHouse server, and created an EmbeddedRocksDB table with a rudimentary key-value schema. That allows us to do batch gets and puts with very little latency, and since it is all persisted to disk it is extremely durable and cost-efficient (don't need much RAM as opposed to Redis).The great upside to this is you don't really need any specialized streaming platform to do it. We use Spark, but it could just as well be in Flink or really any flavor of service you'd like, even a simple Python lambda.",

Sit down with your boss and explain that this is not right, and that you won't be working any more overtime. If they are stupid and try to force you then superficially accept, but immediately start looking for a new company with a better culture.If you really want a job with low / no code I would suggest roles like: Solution Architect, Dev Ops, or Practise / Product Manager roles. Those roles will allow you to use the problem solving skills you've build as a software engineer, but generally have less coding day to day, as the focus more on big picture architecture and integrating systems.That being said this sounds way more like a problem with you being overworked than it is one of you hating coding.

Service tasks are deployed as part of a service and controlled by the Amazon ECS schedule. For more information, see Amazon ECS services. Standalone tasks are tasks started by the Amazon ECS RunTask API, either directly or by an external scheduler such as scheduled tasks (which are started by Amazon EventBridge), AWS Batch, or AWS Step Functions.”https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.htmlThat’s awesome, thank you!

This would run you maybe about 5k per year which is peanuts IMO with your current constraints. As mentioned, really worst case, start with cloud composer then a few months down the line, you guys can look into self hosting.Another thing to consider, if your pipeline aren't too complex, just do Cron jobs.

Besides that theres nothing I really need from the Enterprise version. That said i've been using Dagster since v0.14 or something around 4 years ago and watched it grow so by the time the enterprise version came around didnt feel like i was missing anything. Only thing I'd do differently is to pick whatever tool im using for the job then orchestrate it with dagster not the other way round. Dont pick Dagster first then find tools to work with it. An example find yourself a good EL tool then see if theres Dagster integrations not limiting to yourself only to tools with Dagster integrations and missing out on good tools because they dont. In my case i really wanted to try out SQL mesh but it doesnt work with Dagster and dbt does hence the dbt usage but SQL mesh had a lot of good benefits over dbt , same with SDF which has now been bought.",

About 30% of the way through the process we got onto datafold and started data diffing the datasets in both places and found a tonnnnnn of random stuff we missed in migration because sql server and snowflake just work differently, like with case sensitivity and extra spaces and date function quirky-ness. We even found issues with our previous load process in sql server that we had no idea about XD. The team is responsive and during the migration we reached out for them to fix or add a bunch of features and they consistently turned them around to keep us moving. Definitely recommend when migrating out of sql server.

Aggregating from raw data in each query sounds bad but I've done it on even very large projects; it saves a lot of ETL headaches and can be fast if the DB can store the data in a format that supports aggregation (eg sorted/partitioned on the grouping keys). Pre-aggregation only works in limited cases.One fun thing to try is to dump the dependencies into graphviz format (dot language iirc) and look at the graph there.",

The downside, hard to maintain for self hosting, and depend on how you design the framework for development, it can be really complex to test, develop, and deploy, or it can be one merge request away to run the pipeline to production.For Dagster, I really love the asset based orchestration that abstracting away the chaos of airflow dag dependencies. It is easier to develop and test in Dagster (I build a data platform for a SME by myself using dagster + dlt + dbt), and although it is harder to develop Dagster job/automation at first (and understand asset, definitions, sensors, job, op), it would be easier to scale after that. Also although this is not best practices, I can easily deploy Dagster on a single machine. The downside, the learning resources is fairly limited, and you can only rely on their slack channel for troubleshooting. Some features like out of the box alerting and RBAC is locked behind dagster plus CMIIW. Also, although easier to scale in terms of its python code, I still looking on how to scale it like peak airflow did with yaml based DAG factory.Personally, I am a big fan of Dagster but I think Airflow will still be the norm especially for larger company for a foreseeable future, unless Dagster can make a great leap forward by utilized in a bigger company worldwide. Not a bad thing though, as Airflow also keep improving its feature like the task api and data aware scheduling. Still excited to see how airflow 3 can keep up with its competitors.",

        "body": "The date+time that you set in your prefix/folder structure should be the 'business time' for the data, not when it was physically written. Storage systems will generally give you metadata for when it was actually written, if you really need it, and often you don't necessarily care about when initial ingestion was physically written anyway, you care more about when you integrated it to some other more managed table.It is important to get the 'business date/time' for the data, and be able to find it easily, because that's the traceable value that helps you understand the context of the data, it helps you deal with possible issues like late or out-of-order loads, and is the value you can tie back to upstream orchestration systems. It is usually a lot easier to ask for the data for a particular day's run, rather than try figure out when exactly it was actually written.Think of a scenario where some upstream system keeps CDC logs and dumps nightly copies to you during quiet downtime, and for some reason they aren't able to for a couple of days. Eventually they catch back up, and grab all the data that has accumulated over that time. By having the folders be the 'business time' they can go back and write the data segmented by the days that the data was *generated* rather than just when they transferred it to you. When the data was generated is usually more meaningful. This sort of thing can happen with DWs as well if they provide snapshots, but for some reason couldn't get them to you for a while.---Wherever your data is landing, that's generally not where you're going to want to query it from. The initial landing areas are just to make ingestion easy, simple, and reliable. The upstream systems just need to get the data to you, then they can be cut out of the process. You can do anything you need to do after that, including integrating the data into a more usefully queryable structure.The most useful categories I've found for these landing folders are... context/ source_org/ source_system/ source_dataset/ schema_version/ year/ month/ day/ {everything_prior}-hourminutesecond-partition.extension... you can squish year+month together if it makes more sense, or add prefixes for the time if you have lots of small files, or add some extra layers if for example a source system has multiple databases/schemas. The partition is only needed if the source data is explicitly partitioned, like with kafka streams or azure event hubs. I'd put all the same details into filename as well, just in case you find the filename without the rest of the prefix for context, so you can identify the file anyway. The schema_version is there because these things always change schema eventually, and you might need slightly different code to handle different schemas, so you build it into the path so you can identify which ingestion code to run.",

        "body": "Thanks for the long and descriptive comment.Just want to be sure I understand correctly and we are talking about the same “raw”. Currently :We currently have multiple ingestion tools and data sources that are implemented by different teams.We currently load everything into Snowflake and use it as our hammer to filter and dedup records.The simplier options for everyone in the past was to store the files in S3 by the timestamp/date time when they inserted the data into S3. It was simplier because no matter the type of data they had it would work the same way. So no modification per data type, just a single ingestion process that could be reusable across different data sources and APIs. It didn’t really matter because every new file created an s3 event and was processed and loaded into Snowflake. We requested that each payload add a timestamp metadata that represent when the data was capture from the API. This make it simplier to dedup same version of records in Snowflake. This also allowed everyone to backfill or reprocess old records without having to tell the data team. When new data come into Snowflake, we look at the max(timestamp) of the record we have in our snowflake table and we load every newest records. The downstream of there a newest file for an aggregate (like a day) we refresh that hole day.Now :What I’m trying to see if it’s that same timestamp base structure will cause some trouble in the future. Our Data Lake is more like a data dump as files are just there order by insert timestamp and not actual data. So we might have 30 different version of the same file, which should be dedup. And the only way to dedup it properly is to search for the entire history of files.From what I can think of the raw version that teams generate and the “raw” version on the data side will not be identical. Like I’ll create a process that takes the raw files, and restructure it so the files grouped by business date time.So multiple question, do you usually have 2 raw structure or you generally put more and logic in the ingestion module so it understand the data and group things by business concepts ?Another question would be in the case where I want to build a proper data lake using something like Iceberg and maybe spark, how would I be alerted of files changes or how could I simply load new files in order to clean them in my pipeline if they are not ordered by insert timestamp ? I think this is the part I’m not understanding the most with Data Lakes table format. Like yeah s3 events could technically give me the info, but I don’t want to update my tables each time there’s a new file, maybe I want to update things every hour or every day and wait for the file to accumulate. Without a structure by insert timestamp how would I be able to retrieve all news files simply ?Thank you again.",

        "body": "> do you usually have 2 raw structure or ...I do find the term 'raw' to be a bit overloaded, as it can mean different things to different people. If you're talking about data at a more base level, then 'raw' means exactly as the source provided it in a bit-for-bit binary fashion. If you're talking at more of a logical or modelling level then 'raw' just means the original data before business rules are applied. You can have, and with data lakes will get usefulness from, having both of those 'raw' layers.I tend to split up the layers a bit differently. I would talk about landing → structured → standardised → (modelled) → customised → export.Landing is a pure as-is area, exact file format and everything as it was provided. There can be all sorts of duplicates in there, but upstream should be applying business/snapshots dates so you can properly know what's what. You can have multiple schemas for the same data, even overlapping data drops for different schemas during a migration. That's why the folder hierarchy is important so that it doesn't just turn into a swamp. This is a flexible 'write once' area so that you can rerun and rebuild off it as needed, or accumulate data while you work on how to integrate it.The 'structured' layer is where you put that into a standard \"\"\"raw\"\"\" structure from a modelling perspective - you turn it into tables or bring it into your DW. You can do this as an 'append only' so it is easy to bring the data in and you don't have to worry about any integration logic. All you're doing here is making it easy to query. Once it is easy to query, it will be much easier to make sure your dedupe process afterwards is working as you expect.Then you can go about standardising it - flatten out nested structures, remove duplicate data, apply historical SCD2 tracking, etc.If you're doing broad modelling to being multiple related systems together into one data model, it will likely be easiest to do that over the standardised data.From either of those you make the custom datasets for consumers, and the export datasets if you're transferring data on to another system.---> how would I be alerted of files changes or how could I simply load new files in order to clean them in my pipeline if they are not ordered by insert timestampIf you don't want to run on *every* new file as it occurs, you just need something that will accumulate a list of 'changed files since X'. A lambda triggered by the S3 write and a little DynamoDB could do it -- write to a partition key by the dataset and a sort key by the 'actual write time' with some extra data around the file path and so on, and some code flag for the processing date. Then if you only want to run ingestions hourly, or daily, start up the process and have it pull the data from dynamo.If you're worried about properly tracking the state while having long-running processes, or the long term retention of this metadata, pull the new data out of dynamo and then immediately update some iceberg table for state tracking of your processes. You'll be able to keep a full audit log of every file that has been ingested, whether one is currently being worked on, etc.There's a bunch of alternatives that do a similar thing. S3 trigger into lambda that writes to SQS. Have a python lambda run on your hourly/daily that drains the SQS and writes to a duckdb or your iceberg. Or you could send it via kinesis data streams. Or you could send it to kinesis firehose, and it can automatically buffer the writes for 15 minutes and write to a parquet file for you and you just run your daily process querying that data.The main gist of it is that you're buffering event data into some lightweight temporary store, then moving it in bulk to lake storage.",

Communicate with relevant stakeholders - First talk to your boss and explain the situation to see what he thinks. He may be able to direct you to people with more knowledge regarding the entire situation. You say you have databases, so someone is probably managing them and they would be a good place to start the conversation in terms of determining the low hanging fruit. It helps when all the data people are working with each other. Find out who is relevant and talk to them so you can potentially collaborate.2. Prioritize what is most important - Look at all those tasks you have in your backlog, rank them by how much value they would add, while keeping effort in mind. Create a 3 by 3 grid with priority/frequency on one axis (low, medium, high) and effort on another axis (low, medium, high). Your domain knowledge should allow you to quickly assess this. I would have a meeting with your boss and the other relevant people from bullet point 1. if possible. Ideally target the high priority ones first with focus on those perceivied to be the least effort.After this, the steps that are taken depend on what is important to tackle first: data integrity (deal with inconsistencies), data consolidation (centralize where data is located), data automation (automate a way to ingest files), data standardization (ensure data is in a constant format), etc. Just make sure you document anything and everything, it will eventually be a life saver down the line.I think you can start with learning high level concepts related to data governance as it will provide a solid foundation as to how to approach everything else.Hope this helps, let me know if you got any questions.",

By making it their problem, you incentivise good behaviour- specially where you can present ‘bad records’ to leadership. You can even gamify it a bit- show a trend line with time on one axis, and number of bad records as another. People love it when line go down.

The order management team wanted to fix things, but we didn't give them enough time. DQ errors were only caught when our pipeline ran in the middle of the night. To fix that, we created a view that encapsulated the logic of the table where most DQ issues can be caught. Then, the table just did a select * on the view. We moved our DQ tests to the view and ran them each hour. Slack alerts notify the team if something is wrong and they fix it before our pipeline runs. It was a simple solution to a big problem. Most of the work was getting the right teams on board with the solution.",

You can't really force users to care about clean data, but you can set up enough guardrails that garbage never makes it through. What’s worked for my projects in the past:* Schema enforcement everywhere - Avro, JSON, Pydantic, whatever fits your stack. Fail fast if something’s off. Don’t try to fix it later, just reject bad input.* No raw access - Don’t let people dump whatever they want into S3 or a DB. Build upload APIs or controlled ingestion tools with validation and clear error feedback (like \"invoice\\_date must be ISO-8601, not 'soon'\").* Alerting + dashboards - If bad data shows up, make it visible. Send Slack alerts, track source systems with the most rejections, build a \"wall of shame\". * Data contracts - This is getting more popular. You define what good data should look like (like no nulls in key columns, specific enums only ...), and you break the pipeline or alert when things go off the rails.Honestly though, I think a big part of the problem is social. You have to make the business care about why it matters - bad data = bad reporting = bad decisions. Similar to what u/Vhiet suggested. Once they see that, they’re usually more willing to work with you.It’s not perfect, but this mix of tech + visibility + a little shame goes a long way.",

It still is not geo replication across datacenters which is what most big clouds can offer.Nowadays instead of 3 full replicas which costs 3x the capacity, erasure encoding is more often used in different schema’s.

Apache Spark is much more widely used now than Hadoop itself. In many ways it's just the next evolution of the same ideas. Apache Parquet is the de facto standard for column-oriented data, and it came out of the Hadoop ecosystem. The table metadata usually is Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, or Apache Hudi (in no particular order). These are the modern version of say, the Hive metastore from Hadoop days, but less coupled to one engine. These take advantage of the capabilities of modern cloud storage, such as conditional atomic writes of a file. A lot has changed in the past decade, but the fundamental principles from Hadoop remains highly relevant.",

You should make sure to learn the various programming paradigms. Object oriented, functional, etc. Another thing, don't think you need to know everything right away. Getting code to work is an awesome first step and definitely doesn't doom you to an eternity of writing spaghetti code. Software Engineering takes decades to master and you will always be learning.1. DRY (Don't repeat yourself). If you have to repeat the same code twice, it should be abstracted out into a reusable class or function2. KISS (Keep it simple stupid). Nobody wants to read and maintain a big-ass function. Write your code so that someone in the future (probably future you) can easily understand it. When you think this way you start breaking out each piece of functionality into a simple unit that does one thing. Otherwise known as SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).3. YAGNI (You ain't gonna need it). Don't implement functionality that isn't immediately needed. You can waste your entire life accounting for all future possibilities that most of the time don't come to pass. Write code such that you CAN add those things later if necessary without a major rewrite.",

        "body": "im gonna tell a little story. it isn't a story about yandev code, but it's a story about very similar code.i make code and asset contributions to a few open source game projects around github. one of these projects is a medieval fantasy game based around old ad&d stuff, both in terms of vibes and in terms of raw mechanics. one of these mechanics is the ability to dodge. it's a very simple one; when you get hit, it makes a quick calculation, and if you win then you negate the damage, spend a little stamina, and move to an adjacent tile, which is all pretty simple. complicating matters ever so slightly is that some classes are expert dodgers and get a better calculation on their dodge roll, but in return they have to be wearing light armor or no armor to do it; heavy or medium armor means they dodge like everyone else, which is poorly.so, a question for the reader: how would you go about determining if the player that got hit has the expert dodge feat and is wearing light armor, allowing them to dodge expertly?a novice solution would be to simply check on hit that the feat and proper armor class are present. after all, you already check on hit to do things like damage and dodge calculations in the first place, so adding a little check right in there isn't a ton of overhead at all. in fact, i think this solution probably works fine for most projects and something similar to it is probably lurking in a lot of video games, even high quality ones.a more advanced solution might be something like checking only when the player equips armor, since we can assume armor doesn't magically change weight classes, and because players will be equipping items far less frequently than they're attacking things, as a general rule. if the player has the feat and equips light armor, it can broadcast an event than then means the player is going to dodge well until their equipment changes again, when we can check once more for what they did. this is probably a little more performant because you're doing the check far less frequently, and during a less critical gameplay moment than when a weapon hits someone, when you can be a little freer with resources. this solution would be a good methodology if you need to wring performance out of the system, though like i said in the last paragraph, the novice solution is probably good enough for most projects.now let's go back to our example game and see how they did it. They chose to have the entity itself check if it was wearing the right kind of armor. In fact, they had every character entity check. A player character with the dodge feat and light armor checks. A player character without the dodge feat still checks anyway. A goblin that cannot have the feat checks. A chicken, which doesn't even really do combat, and doesn't have inventory slots? You better believe that chicken is checking to see what its armor class is.you might be holding your hands on your head and going, \"wow! that's pretty bad!\" But remember up above, how the better solution doesn't just ask how to check, but when to check? this game had every single mob check their armor's weight class-even if they don't wear armor-*every single fucking tick.* Hypothetically this means ten times a second every single player and non player character in the game stops to ask, \"am i wearing light armor?\" except for the part that the ticks weren't actually deciseconds in this game because of sloppy code like this.so, finally coming around to OP's question: \\- you probably aren't writing yandev tier code if you have the self awareness to worry about writing yandev tier code. \\- you definitely aren't writing yandev tier code if you have even a vague idea of a computer as having a limited amount of math-per-second to crunch your code with, even if you don't understand anything else about computers as objects. \\- read your documentation so you don't accidentally cook up a proc that fires every fucking tick, though.",

As the top comment says - Data structures and algorithms - you can certainly learn them without college, but you probably won't understand the space vs time complexity, which is going to make you really lacking if you need to work on performant systems. Moving past that, college gives folks a good foundation since there is just SO MUCH shit that you don't even know that you don't know. For instance, a lot of bootcamp grads don't really understand how to get their code running on ANY web platform -- because they have no idea about filesystems, networking, dns, hosting.... none of it. Then when you scale that up to the enterprise they have absolutely no idea about load balancers, replication, traffic shaping, etc. While college grads aren't going to have hands on experience with these things, I've found that they generally have some foundational knowledge to \"how the internet works\" that I can anchor to. And unfortunately, this doesn't just apply to networking, but it's EVERYTHING. Differences in file paths, text encoding, and general code portability that you see commonly aren't really taught in the \"build this project\" monorail of tutorials / bootcamps. The other thing that I see pretty commonly is a complete whiff on generics / abstractions / object polymorphism, for whatever reason a lot of folks don't understand that Type: Shape can contain be the parent to Triangle and Triangle extends shape.... Nor do they understand WHY someone would want to do that.",

C++ is unforgiving. DS&A is really tricky. Theory of Computation will mess with your mind. Learning those in an interactive environment where you can ask questions is far better than trying to self-teach.3. Finally, you'll be surrounded by other students who are learning at the same time. You can help each other. You can compare notes. You'll be exposed to multiple ways to solve the same problem.At some schools, the least useful courses are the ones designed to be practical: ones that teach software engineering principles, project planning, and so on. In my experience they're the most divorced from the real world. They teach things like UML diagrams that are rarely used, and they DON'T teach things like Git and Jira, which are used everywhere.",

These parts are covered everywhere on the web and if you really want to, nothing stops you from acquiring that knowledge at your own pace with lots of practical application.The programming lectures during my university were a total waste, as were the ones on software patterns. Data structures and algorithms was at least okay. And really, O(n) notation isn't really that hard, complexity theory only gets nasty outside of the stuff you need for a day job. On the other hand the big advantage of university lectures is the mathematicians mind-set of taking the entirety of a problem, reducing to its most fundamental equivalent form and then selecting from all possible solutions the ones with the desired properties. This is something that very few self-taught people can do, and real life project work also favours incrementally approaching a best-effort. But every once in a while you need to have a problem solved for every possible input, and then this is extremely valuable.Also a big plus is a structured introduction to concepts that aren't easily explained or need prerequisite knowledge or even specialised hardware. Stuff like:- Hamming codes only really make sense if you think of them as maximally distant points in high dimensions- Wavelet compression needs Hilbert spaces as prerequisite- Cryptography is tons of esoteric mathematics- chip design, robotics, classical machine learning, applied computer graphics like MRI are all not really doable on a standard notebook- databases are about a lot more than SQL or normalised tables.

I would encourage you to try and finish out your internship and make the best of the experience, but wouldn't stress over the position so much that it comes before your classes. Set boundaries and communicate any unrealistic expectations - don't let them take advantage of your student mindset by giving you homework, just put in your hours like any other job then don't give them any more of your mental energy. Don't sacrifice your schooling for a potential job at a company that you know isn't going to treat you well anyway.

        "body": "Sorry to hear you're going thru this. No, not all internships are like this. The \"this is an easy task\" and other passive aggressive responses in particular are major indicators of a fairly toxic culture in that team and very likely the company. That's not typical of most teams, but it's also not as rare as one might wish. (And it is more common in teams that are hiring, because those teams have a higher turnover.)Toxicity aside, the overall lack of guidance sounds like what happens when the hiring team is more swamped than they expected when they signed up to have interns. The pattern of having to drop lower priority balls in a crunch is pretty normal, and it's likely \"intern support\" is one of those lower priority balls.In that situation, an attitude of \"interns are both cheap and temporary, let's give them a non-essential nice-to-have and if they get it working, great, if not we'll sort it out later\" is the kind of strategy some people will run with if they have some interns they don't know what to do with. Another possibility is they're attempting a sort of extended interview, where what they wanted wasn't so much to train people as to identify people with the tenacity to get it figured out, with an intent to make a job offer to those already at the \"swim\" level of capabilities (in a complete failure to understand (or probably even comprehend the possibility) that this is a side gig for you while you're mainly trying to graduate, rather than your sole full-time work focus like their jobs are).Either way, your best outcome here is to get it running more or less ok, get a good letter of recommendation, and find a different place for your next paid position. (Tenacity, managing burnout, and finding alternative second-best outcomes under limited support and uncertainty of project success are all important skills in this field, but ideally you'd be sort of eased into them with some decent mentoring along the way, rather than left alone to maybe figure out your burnout damage or not. Also, burnout is a pretty well-studied phenomenon, and it will serve you well into the future if you read up on the literature, as another side project for an hour or 2/week.)For getting your actual task figured out, there's a few decent options under the guidance they've (implicitly) given that they don't want their engineers to be bothered. You're doing the right thing by posting in external forums, this approach can help with your technical questions too. (Plus of course the web searching you're presumably doing about the error messages and unexpected behaviors you're seeing.)You can also try finding a person or 2 in the company (edit: or outside the company) (but not your official team and not the point of contact telling you it should be easy) who you like their vibe, and just ask if they'd be available for an hour each week or so, and if they can, see if you can collect good questions they can help you get thru efficiently, or point you in their idea of the next step, for stuff you don't know what to do with.Also a useful trick is to keep a slide deck open and capture screenshots of useful things to ask about. Later you can trim it into a presentation or a walkthrough of issues you still have that you can show people easily.Anyway, good luck and remember that your most important goal in this arrangement is to impress someone enough they want to work with you and will write you a letter and/or be a good future contact in another job. Getting your \"easy\" project running is a decent means to that end, but you can also potentially achieve it by showing people the hurdles you did overcome on the way to not finishing.(Btw, most sane people doing actual backend work know that nothing in this space is as easy as it sounds, so the people telling you this are probably either lying to put pressure on you or not all that experienced themselves and mistaken about the difficulty of something they haven't attempted. Possibly they just forgot how they learned the things they know now and how hard it was, but probably they don't know how to do it either, and would take at least twice as long as their estimate.)",

Just my two cents:What is not ok * No onboarding structure: Being dropped into a codebase on day 4 with minimal context isn’t setting you up for success—it’s just irresponsible.* No dedicated mentor: Saying “this should be easy” to a new hire without offering guidance is lazy management. Interns and entry-level engineers usually need a few weeks to a few months to become productive contributors (reference: The Manager’s Path by Camille Fournier).* Poor leadership: The people supervising you either don’t know how to mentor—or they just don’t care to. That reflects poorly on them, not on you. * If I were mentoring a second-year college student, I’d fully expect them to get stuck and need hands-on guidance at first. That’s normal. Once they’ve merged a few pull requests and built some confidence, then I’d start stepping back and letting them operate more independently. That’s how real growth happens.What you can do * Document everything: Keep track of what you tried, what went wrong, error logs, who you asked for help, what they said, etc. It shows initiative and covers you if anyone questions your effort. Learn as much as you can but do not stress over it after working hours.* Ask for clarification in writing Something like: *“Just to confirm, we’re expected to deploy a live service to EC2 using Docker and environment variables—is that correct?”* This can prompt a reality check or at least put expectations on the record. This sounds like bad internship experience, and that’s OK. Internships are a two-way street: *they* are evaluating you, but *you* are also learning about them. If this is how this team treats interns, I wouldn’t want to work there full time. Don’t let their disorganization hurt your confidence. And like others said—prioritize school. That’ll outlast this internship.Many people have gone through rough starts and still gone on to build great careers. Doing your best in a poorly managed environment speaks volumes about your resilience. Try to take what you can from the experience, learn from it, and keep moving forward. One difficult internship or job won’t define your future—it’s just one chapter, not the whole story.",

She tried to explain what she was doing. She was like see here I change this 1 to a 0 and it does or means this. I was very interested but had no idea what she was talking about. She is so smart(phd in physics) that she didn’t understand I didn’t get it. I just had to eventually say I understood and we went and did something else.I’m not sure why exactly she was doing it in Binary, but it was a government system she was working on.",

Reading others code especially large open-source projects.How did you build consistency without burning out?- From my experience to build consistency you need a work ethic. To develop a work ethic you need to commit to doing the thing you want regardless of whatever happens in your day. Sun, rain, unexpected events etc. See it as a non-negotiable to do practice for self-improvement just like how you’d see working out. Commit to it for three months, then reevaluate taking some days off. 3) Sometimes you can’t balance everything. You’ll need to either sacrifice stuff like sleep, social life etc if you wanna do everything well. My suggestion is have an overview plan of your school work. Then every week/day prioritise 2 ~ 3 main tasks could be school work/leetcode etc. Also try win the morning and don’t waste time scrolling in bed (don’t do it at night either). Good luck my friend",

The other side of it is that some people struggle more with burning out, procrastination and time management compared to others, and there is no easy fix. Sometimes you just have to force yourself, and sometimes you will fail to do that.

I would suggest writing down your plans. Like, pick a small outline. At the very least, just work on an easy LeetCode problem. Also, check out YouTube videos on how to solve these problems. Maybe work with some friends in a group study session. Maybe reward yourself if you accomplish some tasks. Try not to put too much on your plate because it can discourage you from doing the work. Slowly ramp up what you do. Keep a journal of what you've accomplished. You can record how you're feeling as you try to motivate yourself. If you're frustrated, write down why you are. Periodically read what you've written to understand yourself better.For many, they wish they could understand programming better, but they don't enjoy the process. People often say procrastination is due to being a perfectionist, but it's really more about pain avoidance. Not physical pain, but pain from frustration at how difficult everything is. It feels like taking bad-tasting medicine. You know you're supposed to take it, but it's not pleasant.See if you can form a small group and hopefully you can motivate one another.",

And I kept working on it because I knew it had to be done.My main takeaway is that nothing compares to just building something beyond your comfort zone, and finding a strategy that allows you to keep at it consistently for a long period of time is essential. In my case it was building something for someone else, but it may be different for you. Try a few things and see what works for you.",

This doesn't directly answer your question, but it is good to remember in general that often you only need to track changes. Now when you fork things, yes you are copying *everything*, not just keeping a reference to the original repo. But I'm guessing GitHub has some optimizations behind the scenes that only duplicates the data as needed - if the data is exactly the same, why would you need to copy it when you could just reference it in two places?",

This is because a main GitHub project and its forks share the back-end infrastructure.Put another way, although a fork is very different on the front-end, from a data storage perspective, a GitHub fork is not much different from just creating a git branch. And in fact, the repository and all its forks share the same data storage.This is why in https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-permissions-and-visibility-of-forks, we see that:> Commits to any repository in a network can be accessed from any repository in the same network, including the upstream repository, even after a fork is deleted.There's been some controversy over this; notably, this means that I can fork your repository, make some malicious commits, and then generate a URL that might imply that you had written or endorsed my malicious commits. The repository owner may be able to see or access commits on your fork, even if you later delete those commits or delete your fork. (This is also why GitHub states that \"the owners of a repository that has been forked have read permission to all forks in the repository's network.\") e.g. see various articles such as https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/anyone-can-access-deleted-and-private-repo-data-github",

But for video streaming, latency only matters at the very beginning of playback. What matters for video streaming is consistent *bandwidth*, and this typically isn't a bottleneck because ISPs on different continents are connected by multiple high-bandwidth backbone connections.You will only notice \"buffering problems\" if the video data on the client side **runs out**, and that only happens if the bandwidth of the network connection is not sufficient to keep putting data into the buffer as fast as it's being played.As an example, I'm in the USA, and I just did a bandwidth test using a server in Perth, Australia, which is about as close as you can get to the opposite side of the world from me. I got a bandwidth of 60Mbps, which is way more than enough for an HD video stream, and a latency of about 230ms. That latency is not ideal -- it'll add a perceptible delay of a fraction of a second when first loading a page, or when seeking to a different point in the video -- but it doesn't affect smoothness of playback.",

The piracy websites do not host the content, they are link databases, they have a bunch of links to copies of the content that are uploaded to other providers.The websites that actually deliver the content are generic upload sites like youtube, except they are not as proactive at enforcing takedowns, and there are hundreds of generic versions of these upload sites. The upload sites attempt to comply with all regulations and DMCA requests, but there are two reasons why that they are always behind. For one thing a website like youtube has algorithms that proactively detect infringing content, which these generic sites lack, for another there are dozens or hundreds of these generic upload sites and each of them will get many different copies, or similar copies of the same media. Finally they make their money in many cases primarily or exclusively by hosting specifically for this gray area market.You really need to look into the details of the DMCA to understand how and why the sites are designed like they are. The EU has its own regulations other than the DMCA, which I am less familiar with, but it's the same idea. It's a shell game of who is responsible at the end of the day, which involves taking advantage of legitimate privacy protections.Given I am not a huge fan of copyright law in the first place(a royalty system is better IMO, rather than exclusive distribution rights, especially with the lack of physical media), I don't have a huge problem with this whole system, but it ends up being wasteful and leading to creators getting zero revenue, instead of a healthy revenue share that would happen in a royalty system, without exclusive distribution rights.If we had a royalty system similar to radio, then the website that offers the best service for the lowest cost would win, and content creators would earn a consistent amount on their media that platforms could not control. But as it is, platforms love the power that comes with exclusive distribution rights, so they lobby hard to maintain an antiquated and inefficient \"Intellectual Property\", ie publishing system, that literally goes back to the politics of british monarchy in 1710, a half a century before they even abolished the slave trade:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute\\_of\\_Anne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Anne)In programming a lot of the \"architecture\" ends up being designed around these legal issues.Edit: you are also probably right that these sites do not use AWS, at least not exclusively, but there are other services that they can use, which may not be as proactive in their enforcement.",

The machines that constitute that load would exist in clouds with the least security or monitoring. You'd want a few mirrors so when one inevitably gets whacked you could keep on chugging. With some VPN work you could potentially hide such servers in larger cloud services.Note, torrents exist in a gray area. The torrent file itself is not illegal, even if the referenced payload is illegal. Thus, hosting torrent files, rather than their contents, can be permissible, depending on local laws. At least, that's a loophole that's been used before.",

However, not all libraries out there are written well or using good standards or patterns so don’t just blindly mold yourself after to any library code arbitrarily. For example, I’ve read through tons of very **heavily** utilized and popular JavaScript libraries out there and nearly vomited at how absolutely awful the code is written despite the fact that, sure, it works and gets the job done. 3. My recommendation is to read through the “Clean Code” principles. HOWEVER - and this applies very generally to all things in software and in life more broadly - don’t make it some rigid religious dogma; moderation is the key to most things. There are purists who take the Clean Code initiative to the extreme and it’s gross, please don’t do that.4. Time-box your exploration. You want to dive in and learn and understand things which is great, but if it’s a complete rabbit hole that reduces your actual productivity then you’re doing yourself a disservice. Instead, aim to apply what you’re learning into your project and you can always commit and then iteratively refactor your own code to improve it. Try to set goals on what things you hope to achieve or learn each time you do your deep dives. Also, maybe you’re doing this already, use a debugger and step through the code as you call into library functions/methods as it will expose you to the inner workings but in perhaps a more directed and isolated path (with a beginning and end).",

Now, Python does a lot of things under the hood to help you out, which is why it's good to have knowledge of different data structures. For example, Python doesn't natively have arrays. Instead, it has lists, which handle lots of things for you that you would have to do in other languages. It's good to have a knowledge of how these things work so you can better understand how to program in other languages as well, since Python won't work for all applications. You shouldn't \"choose\" C++, you use the language that is best for your application, especially if you're doing personal projects. At my job, I've automated a ton of my daily work away, using exclusively Python, because it's so easy to do and simple to write, debug, and adapt to new situations. You're exactly right with your analogy of a hatchet vs an axe. There are a lot of people who will tell you that you need an axe, when in reality, you only need the hatchet. But to answer your question, yes, Python is absolutely a real programming language, and no, it doesn't matter that it's simple. It just helps to have a little knowledge of what's really going on. Once you have a good grasp on the language, you should try branching out into a different language to learn a little bit more about programming. I personally learned Java after Python, then C++, then C (since I primarily work on microcontrollers now), and that really helped me understand what's going on, since C++ and C do not hold your hand at all. Java is easier to learn than C++, which is why I recommend it after Python. But you'll have a million people telling you what they think is the best way to do something. In reality, if you aren't doing this for work, then the best advice I can give you is just to have fun. This is a super enjoyable hobby and a great skill to have, but don't let someone suck the life out of it for you by telling you that there's one deterministic way to enjoy your programming journey. There isn't. Have fun, enjoy what you're doing, and the knowledge and skills will come ten times faster than if you were to force yourself to do something you don't want because of some stupid arbitrary rule that someone put forth.",

        "body": "When you call a function, you are asking for something. Return is how the function gives you what you ask for.Take some code like:```function timesTwo(int i) int { return i * 2;}```This is a function, which means it can be called from other places. It has an `int` *argument*, `i`; this means that, whenever someone wants to call this function, they will have to supply some int to be used in place of `i`. The final `int` after the right parenthesis denotes the *return type*. In other words, whenever you call this function, you are *asking for an int*. So, in all, the function represents a sort of contract: I give you an int, and you give me an int back.Here's how you might use this function:```int x = 5;int y = timesTwo(x);```What's going on here? You have an `int`, `x`. Then you initialize another `int`, `y`, and assign it to *the result of the function call*. As we said, calling timesTwo means supplying an int, and then receiving one in return. Here we are supplying `x` - that is, `5`.`timesTwo` receives `5` and uses it in place of `i` in the function body, so we can read the return statement as `return 5 * 2` which evaluates to `return 10`.Now, timesTwo promised its caller that it would give it back an int, and that is exactly what `return` does - it gives `10` back as the result of the call and gives control back to the caller, which assigns the returned value to `y`.Essentially, the return type of a function allows you to use a call to that function *as* a value of the return type in most places in your code, because the return type is essentially a promise that the function will give you a value to use there. `Return` is how functions actually make good on that promise.",

Dead simple. And just that alone would be cute. You don’t have to learn more if this accomplishes your task, but actually understanding at a relatively surface level how you did it would be adorable. It shows you took the time to learn a thing they are interested in.Watching a quick intro video explaining generally what code is and how it works, then following a tutorial to write a “hello world!” program would be an excellent choice; when learning to program, or even for experienced folks just learning a new language, it is a time honored tradition to write a simple program that prints the text “Hello World!”. Every coder knows what this means and would instantly recognize it. You could do this, but alter the text. “Hello, [persons name]!”",

        "body": ">The specific example was including \\`using namespace std\\` which I know full well has issues, but it made me question what \"industry standards\" even entail.The real issue is using that directive in a header file, because then you force any client who wants to \"include\" your header file, to also be \"using namespace std\", which she may not want to do.As for \"industry standards\", though, the only \"real\" industry standard is \"to follow the rules of the team leader\", as it were. In a University course, your prof. is the \"team leader\" position so if he/she says \"thou shalt not use 'using namespace std'\" then that is The Rule and you must follow it.For my own C++ code I like to use 'using namespace std' because personally it makes my code easier to read for \"me\". But I can see the arguments against it for \"production code\" (e.g. what if the future C++35 adds a new word to the std:: namespace, a word which you're already using in your local code). A better in-between solution is to use \"individual using\" directives like \"using std::cout\", \"using std::cin\", etc. However, that's a bunch of stuff to type out -- so to use it in practice you should either put them all in a header file, or use some smart IDE that inserts them all for you at the top (some IDEs can automatically insert all of them for you as needed).Most C++ programmers I have seen online just tend to avoid using directives and just write a bunch of std::cout, std::cin blah blah everywhere, which personally I think contributes to the impression that C++ is very difficult to read. It's a subtle style issue balanced on an issue of future-proofing the code. Sometimes we cannot have it both ways, unfortunately. Try to find a style which is readable for you, but also respect the local standards if they are in place. That's the best we can do for this.A commonly cited example is that \"using namespace std\" imports names which you may want to use for your own variables, like \"max\". OK, you got me there. However, how you resolve this is up to you. You can name your local variable something else, for example, \"max\\_value\", or you can even resolve it by adding a trailing underscore, like \"max\\_\", since the likelihood of a name ending in an \\_ being declared in a Standard or in an external library is extremely slim. Personally I got used to that style from programming in Python. I know it looks kind of ugly at first, but it seems like Python has a lot of reserved words that I often want to use as local variable names, so I ended up seeing a programmer using that convention when porting code from C++ to Python (to append \\_ to a name which we would 'obviously' use in the C++ code but which was 'conflicting' in the Python code), and it stuck for me.However, I would hesitate to use this style in \"production team code\" unless I saw explicitly that it were already being employed there. Stick to the local conventions, is rule 1.Same goes for prefixing \"m\\_\" to member names in C++ class designs. Personally I think that's weird in C++, but \\*a bunch\\* of programmers do it for various reasons. So, if that convention is being used currently in the code you're working on, then by all means, continue to do so in that codebase when you add code to that class, for the sanity of your co-workers. It's kind of a weird style rule which seems to only apply for the unique situation to make naming the parameters of a constructor initiazer list less confusing. OTOH, once the convention is in place, something in your brain associates seeing the the \"m\\_\" before a name as a hint that it's a member name, and vice versa (that an absence of the m\\_ means it's \\*not\\*). So this makes it kind of hard to \"quit\" using this convention once you start using it.The other benefit of m\\_ is that it makes \"naive autocomplete\" more convenient. By \"naive autocomplete\" I mean autocomplete which is not actually understanding your code, and which is just memorizing the symbols that you typed previously in the document or in other documents. So that's another convenience of that. Personally nowadays though I always try to use \"C++-aware\" environments for this language. Their availability nowadays is widespread enough.",

Curly braces, if they are not aligned or on the same line, they are flat out wrong to me. I know there are big camps on this, but that one is where I sit. Good editors mark the matched brace when you mouse over or click it, so its not the problem it used to be. memory management is something you avoid unless you can't for some reason. Most of the time, you don't need to do anything special other than make sure you don't take big performance losses from doing it wrong like trigger a page fault every iteration of a loop (this sort of thing is almost always a localized code problem, not a program wide management problem). If you know how this stuff works, you just naturally avoid the problems after a while. industry does not code to the bleeding edge if the people involved are wise. You pick something and stick with it, for example one of the last projects I worked on used c++ 17 because 20 wasn't out yet when the project started. (You can flag the compiler to use the version you want in c++). A few years back we were using kafka for database work and the manager insisted we upgrade every time a new version came out and yea, we rewrote the code repeatedly for a while. It all pays the same...But at the end of the day what I said up front is what you will see: you do what the company you work for wants.",

        "body": "Have you ever completed a course by yourself? The reason I ask is because there's a reason people go to university and major in computer science. This content isn't easy. Keep in mind, in the US, it takes 4 years to graduate with a CS degree.To be fair, in the US, you have to take a bunch of other courses. Maybe 1/4 of your courses are CS courses, and the rest are some related courses (say, in math and sciences) plus more general education (humanities such as history and English).Even so, there's a linearity to the CS curriculum where certain courses are taken before others. Much of which courses you focus on will depend on your goals. In any case, if you want to master this, you could go back to school. Yes, unrealistic, but as pointed out earlier, it's tough for CS majors to complete this curriculum with decent grades. They have the added benefit of time, friends, teaching assistants, professors, and perhaps even free tutoring (or paid tutoring). CS majors are often under time pressure to learn this material so some feel, even after a semester, that they missed stuff along the way.OK, now to address your question, this is my opinion on what to take.1. Discrete Math * This is a precursor to data structures and algorithms. I would say it's not fully required. Discrete math, in my opinion, should be a course where you learn how to do mathematical proofs. Specifically, direct proofs, proof by contradiction, and the various induction proofs (weak, strong, structural). It should also cover formal logic, in particular, propositional and predicate calculus. The rest of discrete math is a bunch of topics where you can apply your knowledge of proofs. Many self-taught learners tend to skip this and head into DSA, and that can work too.1. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) * If you were to take a real courses in DSA, especially algorithms, then you'd do work on solving recurrence relations. This is the math behind big O notation. Otherwise, you could skip that, and just know certain algorithms O(n) or O(lg n) or whatever. It would help to work out book problems, but I think implementing the various data structures and algorithms is educational. For example, I don't use pointers for work (at least, not to build linked data structures).1. Computer Architecture * I taught this a number of times. My current belief is the goal of a computer architecture course is to show you can build a CPU that can run a simple assembly language out of a clock, a flip-flop (a one-bit register), and logic gates. I had envisioned the class building this in software, but never got around to doing that. Personally, I think CS majors learn that the computer isn't completely magic (yes, it does do a lot) and realize, yes, 0's and 1's can make a program do something.Beyond that, I think you can read about the rest (e.g., computer networking and operating systems). I've taken OS before, so building something (again, super simple) is interesting, but you realize that real OSes are extremely complex, but at its core, it's something you can understand if you strip it to its bare essentials.The question, should you choose to study this, is how much time you can devote to this, and how deeply do you want to study it given a lack of resources. If you can find some online courses offered through a reputable university (you wouldn't get credit, but you could follow the content), then that can help structure your learning.At this point, you need to pick an initial starting point, which is probably data structures and algorithms as that's the most pertinent and comes up in job interviews.",

Idk what languages you have learnt but the thing is doing courses only won't take you far. You need to make something yourself to be actually professional in this field. You need to have a proper goal in mind what you actually want to do. For example if you want to be a game dev, then you need to learn a language depending on the game engine you wish to use (ex- c++ for unreal and c# for unity). Even after learning them, when coding for your first game you will face several hindrances no matter what course u did, you will be required to debug it yourself, search online, maybe ask others for help online. This is how you learn programming by working on projects that interests you. If you like web development, then study JavaScript and make your first website (idk much bout web dev not my expertise). Don't be dependent on courses, learn only that what interests you and try to work on projects to improve your skills. Maybe you can share what made you be interested in programming and what your future career plan is?",

It became obvious after fixing bugs multiple times how different behaviors could be better separated into classes, helpers, and using properties, etc. Once I did this for a while then I could approach new code knowing that a certain pattern or architecture was a good (or bad) implementation. Re-implementing logging to add global log level, log file, and log rotation was a bad idea, but creating a helper class that did it for you was super trivial and made writing tests and adding features a lot easier. The code was the same, but the implementation was flat and didn’t change the behaviors of the logger. Essentially I had seen the different patterns and could recognize them. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-design-patterns/",

        "body": "IMO what separates a junior engineer from a senior engineer is the difference between solving a problem and architecting a solution. A lot of that just comes down to time and experience as others have already pointed out. I do think there are some things you can do to fast track your way to a more senior level though. * Pair program with other more senior engineers, especially early in a project so you can understand how they balance architecting a robust solution vs solving the immediate problem. If you can coax one into being your mentor, even better. Most employers encourage this sort of interaction to foster growth in their engineering departments, it's just a lot of devs can be solitary creatures and choose not to exercise this muscle.* Review PR's from other more senior engineers. Sounds like you're already doing this to an extent, but don't be afraid to leave non-blocking comments on the PR and ask questions about how or why they did something. If anything this will make them feel good for being so smart and getting to explain the cool thing they did to someone else. A lot of people are afraid to ask questions because they think it will make them look dumb, but the opposite is almost always true with software development - in fact you will find senior engineers are often the most inquisitive.* Check your assumptions always. Senior engineers ask lots of questions because they assume nothing. Senior engineers don't learn to do something one way then always do things that way just because that's the way they already know. They try to consider every angle in every circumstance before those circumstances are encountered, which may mean exploring a different solution instead.* RTFM more. Go through all the docs for everything in your organization's tech stack and familiarize yourself with the basics, focusing on a breadth of understanding rather than a depth of knowledge. You want to know what possibilities and capabilities exist in your environment, so you can consider all those options in your project planning. You can then return to the docs for a deep dive into the specific features that prove relevant to your current project.Hope this helps. At the end of the day the answer is still \"put in the time\", but I think these are some ways you can put in that time more efficiently.",

If you know well what you're doing without one, you may be better off continuing as you are. Keep in mind that a lot of larger stuff is done as a team, and frameworks (I think) tend facilitate that sort of work.A framework may be worth learning if it seems to support the sort of result you're after, if it's an industry standard in an industry you're looking to enter/work in, or even just if you're interested in exposure to more/varying design principles and ideas regarding certain topics.Edit: It can also be useful to *not* use a framework, then once you know the bits that a framework is taking over for you use a framework for future work rather than re-solving things that not only have been solved, by solved by *you*, again. 'Course, this is time and effort that could also be used on other matters. It comes down to what you want to know, and what you think you need to know.",

It’ll say okay so this function is used to do this thing. Here’s an example of what it looks like. Now here’s your goal “create a function using the above example and use these variables to satisfy the function”. On the right side there is a console where you type in the code.

You get bonus xp for doing multiple days in a row so if you miss a day your streak resets to 0. As far as how to lock him down to a certain area that’s just going to be parental control.

If people aren't giving you work, it's most likely because people don't know what you can do. Or worse, they know your abilities and don't trust it. Couple of things I'd do:1. be more pro-active in sharing your accomplishments2. be more pro-active in asking for work3. learn to \"manage up\".

Switching careers, putting in the work during your lunch breaks, quitting to study full-time, picking up a completely new tech stack—all of that shows drive and resilience. You’re not lazy, and you’re definitely not a fraud.What you’re feeling is totally normal. I think a lot of us in tech, even people who’ve been doing this for years, go through periods where we question if we really know what we’re doing. Especially when you’re self-taught or leaned on tools like AI, it’s easy to downplay all the work you actually *did* put in. But tools are there to help us—using them smartly doesn’t take away from what you’ve learned.It also sounds like part of what’s getting to you is the environment itself. Being stuck in a process-heavy, bureaucratic setup where you barely get to touch code would make *anyone* start doubting themselves. It’s not about you being incapable—it’s about the situation not giving you a chance to actually do the work you know how to do.It’s still early days at your new job, and sometimes it takes a while to settle in. But even if this place doesn’t turn out to be the right long-term fit, it doesn’t erase everything you’ve achieved up to this point.You belong in tech. You earned your spot through hard work, persistence, and pushing through a lot of self-doubt already. Give yourself some grace. You’ve come a long way, and honestly, you’re just getting started.Keep going—you’re doing way better than you think.",

(took me a while and im still confused, learned a lot tho)Think I will do some code crafter projects now.Point is, if you just wanna code, find some lower level stuff to do. Look up how to make packet listeners, and code a packet listener on a network to detect suspect activity. Make your own tcp server and learn how to parse http requests.Really take anything you like, go one level lower and ask, \"well how does that work?\" then learn and work on that. That is what I do now after much of what ur feeling.its also useful to build stuff that you will use, but for me I can never thing of stuff i want/use so yeah...",

Starting something new lets you forget the hiccups in your current scope. I get it. I’ve started way more projects than I’ve finished—they’ve fallen to the wayside. But the real answer is mindset, discipline, and focusing on progress over perfection.Just aim to complete it. Aesthetics can wait. Once the hard part is done, you can enjoy polishing it up or not. Who cares? It’s done. Finishing projects creates a positive feedback loop. Knowing you completed something and uploaded it to your portfolio is the best feeling. Plus, now you get to start something new without the guilt of quitting the last one.As for HTML and CSS, use UI components. For game dev, just grab free or cheap assets. I’m a programmer, too. I never make 3D models because I’m not an artist. I’ve got another post on goal setting I’d recommend checking out. And if you really just want to finish a project, I’d suggest freelancing it gives you a driving force and a reason to complete the work.Good luck :thumbs_up:",

I think it might be difficult to point out any programming context that doesn't intersect with mathematics - computer science is a mathematical field, after all. As for physics, it really depends on what exactly you're trying to do. A whole lot of different physical phenomena can be modeled on a computer using programming. Some programs aim broadly. A [physics engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_engine?wprov=sfla1) might implement rigid body dynamics, inverse kinematics, collision detection, fluid dynamics, and softbody dynamics. Maybe even all of them at the same time. A [CFD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFD-DEM?wprov=sfla1) solver, on the other hand, is more specialized.I think one term you should take a look at is [computational physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_physics?wprov=sfla1). See especially the part about applications. See also [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis?wprov=sfla1), a topic that physical simulation heavily relies on. You may also find [discrete mathematics ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics?wprov=sfla1) illuminating. As a final point, some physical phenomena are best modeled with [statistical mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_mechanics?wprov=sfla1)",

Its perfectly normal, and you'll get better at managing it with time/experience (and by being around others who experience it).2. The rest of this sounds like textbook depressive symptoms, and is best handled by a professional, not us chuds on reddit. Its nasty and will really get inside your head as you've described, but you seem to be just trying to white-knuckle it and out-intellectualize it, which is the worst thing you can do for it (besides completely ignore it, of course). A qualified mental health professional will be able to help you manage depressive symptoms in a way nobody here is going to remotely be able to come close to, and that's really  the important thing here.

Why do you study CS? What do you want to achieve exactly? Target something to shoot at. This is very important. * Estimate your capabilities. How much time do you have? How much effort can you give? Are there any financial barriers? Are there any responsibilities around you that force you to go in a specific path? Identify carefully what you can do and what you can't. * After you identify your needs, look for the roadmap that fits your capabilities. General roadmaps like those we see online, in my opinion, aren't for everyone. The best roadmap for you is what's uniquely made for your current situation. You may ask someone who's a software industry professional to help you with that. You may, for example, browse job offers of the track you want to study and see exactly what's frequently required by those companies. The outcome of this step is \"What skills/knowledge I should have to achieve my goal.\"* Now, your way is clear. According to that roadmap, you gotta look at what you have and what you haven't in terms of skills/knowledge and try to work on it. Starting from scratch isn't a bad thing, it helps to refresh your mind and fill the gaps in your knowledge. Remember, you aren't someone who has never dealt with programming in their life, you have some experience. * Finally, *\"كل علم ليس في القرطاس ضاع\" .. \"Knowledge that is not in the paper is indeed lost.\" ..* Note down EVERYTHING you learn. Our minds work like RAM; you will forget about something new you learnt just a few days later. Programs like Obsidian are great for that purpose, and you can sync your notes folder (called a \"vault\") freely using Google Drive Desktop so you will never lose your progress. Good luck, Okhti!",

I told him I wouldn’t do that and would help him pull the changes. He basically said no, I don’t want to do that and send them via email or he’d just reimplement the feature himself. What I learned from that experience is that PhDs very often don’t learn how to work in teams or the importance of source control and processes.

His code doesn't mesh with ours at all (designed something else) and I had to rewrite almost all of his code. I left him in the credits mostly as pity. His design wasn't bad, just not what we asked. Then the next one... ARGH... she has ambitious goals, then spent the entire assignment period on... \"drag and drop\", and she never did accomplish it! I told her to cut down the UI, just use sliders or simple UI, but no, she won't do it. She FAKED her portion of the assignment presentation, and asked us to go along. No idea she passed or not, but f- me. And guess what when I asked the professor for advice? He told me that I am the common factor, so I must be the problem!F- me. Good thing the bootcamp is \"pass-fail\" and I did pass. But it was NOT a pleasant experience.My advice to you: do what's fair, give pity where it's deserved, but no mercy when none's given. If he merged no code into the group depo, he gets NO MENTION in the repo write-up. If the guy wants to do his own thing on a group assignment, that's up to the professor.

This is very difficult to do, especially for people with no group project experience.What works a lot better is to code together at first, taking turns \"driving.\" This sort of forces you to do the integration first. You figure out the overall structure together, making sure everyone's concerns are addressed. Suddenly you realize you have started working on some code that can clearly be split off to work independently, because the disagreements have waned. Only then do you split it off. At this point everyone understands all sides of the interface better, so you know when you need to communicate again.In fact, I'd give good odds that the part of your team that is meshing well did something similar, where your problematic team mate went to independent mode ASAP.",

Coupling services through a database is a recipe for a lot of pain. It is possible to avoid, but that is also a pain.> What benefits does that actually bring? It allows separate teams to evolve their own database design without fear that they might unknowingly break some other service somewhere else. It also prevents database locks across services. Let's say we had a \"user\" table that two services use. Now, let's say that the first service does a huge update that locks the entire table... well... now you've blown up the second service, and the team responsible for that service has no clue what is going on.> From my perspective, it justs adds more complexity, and for what? organization? Complexity in terms of infrastructure, maybe. Complexity in terms of distributing data? Sure. However, it allows each service to scale and exist independently, which is why you want microservices.",

Absolutely.The purpose is load-handling. If you've got 150,000 active users on your site, doing all the things users do from creating new accounts, posting, retrieving things, etc. then your poor RDB is getting hammered.If you have a microservice that just handles user stuff, it's handling maybe 1,000 of those users. Your posting service is handling maybe 5,000 users, you're search feature is handling...80,000 users. And each of those services is pretty much working on one table of a database, then the queries are super fast and not being blocked, versus some nightmare RDB queries or inserts that lock tables, and so on.Do you *need* to do microservices? Not necessarily for everything. We had a site where we had about 40 tables, and only two of them had a load that was worrying. We also had plenty of tricks up our sleeves to make that load manageable (Redis, caching, partitioning, etc).

I'd say there are three ways you could go from here depending on what you want to do and learn.Becoming very familiar with the OOP paradigm would be a good next step if you're interested in enterprise software development. Java's not as prevalent as it used to be, but it's a good learning tool and plenty of people are still using it. There are several other modern languages that use the JVM, so you might take a look at those too.My biased recommendation would be to pick up C. Becoming familiar with how software /actually/ works without layers of abstraction will make you a better developer no matter what you end up doing in the end. There are competitors in the low-level sphere these days, but C is still dominant. It's old, but K&R's \"The C Programming Language\" is still a good introduction.Lastly, if you want to do any web stuff, learning HTML/CSS/JavaScript is a must. IIRC Mozilla's dev site has some good resources for learning the basics.",

I cringe at the thought of even attempting to articulate my issues to these people who seem like they’re so advanced that it makes no sense that they had to spend any significant time making stupid mistakes at the start.I recommend joining https://discord.gg/pythonWe've made an effort to create a culture where even the newest of beginners feel welcome and like they can join in any discussions. You won't have to feel stupid or out-of-place here. There are incredibly experienced and talented people here, and you can talk to them and see that they're happy to talk to you. They'll tell you that they did make mistakes, at the start and even now, and that it's nothing to be ashamed of.> Now I have a lot of motivation and am able to pick what seems like a reasonable project and start. Unfortunately i haven’t had anyone in my life that even cares about technology, much less knows about it, to talk to. This has led to me making what is likely huge time wasting mistakes but i cant pick out which of my decisions are those mistakes.Personally... I would say don't worry so much about making mistakes. It's good to make them, it's how you learn. Don't let this fear hold you back from experimenting. One of the great things about programming is that mistakes aren't costly.",

We’re all imposters. :smiling_face_with_halo: seriously, we all experience this kind of confusion and self-doubt as we learn and come up to speed. One of the benefits of experience in this trade is that we know what to expect from this phase of learning. Think of yourself as a first-time runner in the Boston Marathon. You’ve heard The Wall, the steep Heartbreak Hill after mile 20, is there. Now you’re hitting that wall for the first time, and you’re like, WTF? I have to be crazy. Look at it this way. You made it to the Wall after only a few days on the job. You got this. And next time you’ll be better equipped to power through it.Again, welcome.",

You can certainly render 3D graphics with Python if you want.Python is popular for indie games because it's generally considered to be an easy language to learn, and it generally takes less effort to write something in Python than it does in C++. You don't see Python used a lot outside of the indie scene because, for one, it's much slower than C++, and also because it's an interpreted language, and commercial game developers generally do not want people to be able to easily open up and read through their source code.If you want to write a visual novel, I'd consider looking into [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/), an incredibly popular and well-developed Python engine for visual novels. But otherwise? Honestly, consider looking into C# instead. There's a huge community of indie devs that use it, it's faster than Python, and it doesn't have the memory management issues that cause a lot of problems for people using C++.",

Godot is very simple and user friendly with good support for 2d,3d,and even can handle VR. Great licensing rules as well.Unity is a bit tricky to learn I didn't just intuitively know how to use it like Godot. It can handle VR better due to C# but with a much higher skill celling and not as good licensing rules. Hop over to YouTube and check out \"Brackeys\" channel if you'd like to see both engines to gage what you like more. I currently work in Unreal(C++) since nether above system can keep up with the IR/Imu/ Lazer loads gracefully. However Godot was used to make the earlier prototypes for demos so I'm very partial to it.If you're really caught up in languages that makes the choice easier.",

Then make something a bit more complex, like Tetris. Since you seem to be interested in a 3d game then make some basic 3d shooter.Do iteratively more complex projects so that in a few months you can answer a couple of the questions you just raised. At that point consider doing a more ambitious project where implementation details like language are more relevant but, I suspect, at that point you'll already have all your answers.",

Fez is always the example given, which when it was originally made, would not have worked in Unity or Unreal given the 2D/3D hybrid and rotation.

In this case you would only care about the processing part, as that is the main functionality of this function. Problen is now that this function calls the db to get the user data, and wr of course dont want to include that in the unit test as we ONLY want to test the function.This is were you use testing doubles as you mentioned, mocks, fakes and stubs. Mocks tell you if an interaction happened, for example you can check if the database function getUserData was actually called by calcUserData.Fakes are working implementations but simplified. Lets say that instead of mocking away the database, you want to use an in memory db, or you could even store values into a list if all you want is something to put in and retrieve data from.Stubs are when you want to pre-define a response. Imagine you have a function called isAdmin, which simply checks the db if the user is an admin or not, instead of actually calling the db we can simply stub it to return True or False. This is useful when you want to force an interaction. Imagine you want to test if you correctly throw an error to the user if they are not an admin, you can do that with stubbing.The mindset you need for unit testing is using these 3 tools to force yourself to ONLY test what a small piece of code does. The mistake people make is including dependencies into unit tests which makes them closer to integration tests.Hope this helped a bit, in a rush need to go to work now but if you have any more questions just comment Ill get back to you.",

        "body": "This may or may not be relevant. I was fairly convinced in my sophomore year of undergrad (studying CS) that I wasn't going to be a professional coder (I decided I'd go to law school after graduation, with the intent of going into patent law, which is what I do now). I did it for a number of reasons, some of which included that I didn't love programming all that much and I wasn't naturally good at it. Being around people who were absolutely brilliant at programming and building things really made me feel pretty bad about where I was at. I could do my courses just fine and ended up graduating with honors, but I never built my own projects or anything, I just did my course work. Anyway, I have no idea if the additional two years for you would look anything like my last two years, but I did them just fine. I learned a lot, and a lot of it was both interesting and relevant to my ultimate career. I also build things now as hobby projects occasionally, even though I don't do it professionally. Anyway, all this to say, I was able to do my junior and senior years in CS just fine, even knowing that I wasn't going to be programming professionally and also believing I was just bad at it compared to some of my brilliant peers. I guess I'd encourage the BS instead of the associate's, because it will probably open more doors to you. As far as discipline and motivation, could you maybe talk to a few of your friends at school and say, hey I'd really like to build something but I'm having trouble on my own. Could we form a small group and build something together? That would keep you accountable not just to yourself, but your friends as well.On the, \"I want to learn but I suck at this,\" piece, I think you need to break your problem down into smaller, more manageable chunks. If one task is just too overwhelming, break it up into smaller, easier to understand pieces, and solve them one by one. Ask for help from a friend, a professor, a TA, Reddit, Discord, or even AI for things you just really cannot solve. Also, sucking at something you haven't learned yet is, in fact, the normal, natural state. That's how you get better: you start with sucking at it, you work on it, you get better, you work some more, you get better, and so on. I don't know what projects you've done for your classes, but start with those. Which ones did you do well on? Take what you did and do it again, but a little different, a little better. Add a feature. Maybe you did a sorting algorithm, like Quicksort, on integers. Do it again, but on floats or doubles. Do it again with individual characters, then character strings. Do it so that the sort is by length of the string rather than its actual value. Do it with templates so you can generically sort any type. Try building a visualization for it. Then whatever language you originally learned it in, try it in a different language. Try it in seven different languages, then pick the one you end up liking the most and try something new in that language.Do the same thing but for a project you didn't do well on. Make it better. Force yourself to take those two projects, and build something that uses both of them to do a third thing. Challenge your creativity. Just a bunch of thoughts on things you could do. Another thing you can try, get on ChatGPT or Gemini or something, tell it what concepts you know, and ask it to give you an idea for a project you can build with those concepts. Then go build it. Give yourself a deadline and stick to it. Tell your friends and family, \"I'm building this thing, I'm going to have it done by this date, I would love to show it to you that day so you can see what I'm working on.\" Now you're accountable to them to get the thing done.",

This is a far more general problem than just programming, and you probably need to examine the rest of your life to look for how to fix it - maybe you need to be getting up earlier and going to the gym, maybe you need to eat better, maybe you need to detox from social media or tiktok or video games. You know your life, I don't.There are definitely some things you can do to make it more fun. Absolutely find a passion project like a Minecraft mod to work on.

When you get stuck and you feel like you cant continue take a break and come back there have been so many times where I struggled on something then randomly during my day I figure it out.>Would you still recommend finishing the last 2 years of a CS bachelor if programming doesn't come naturally to you?Absolutely.

Or was it because social media or modern tv/movies told you it was cool to program? It's definitely not for everyone. Start with something small. Even a ToDo list app can be complicated. Make it. See if you can publish it somewhere. If/when you do get a job, the programming position is more than just programming so this experience will be helpful. If you can even use your app, even better. I created a Todo app 6 years ago to test a concept and ended up publishing it online and use it for my grocery list. You can add, edit, and delete todo items. If you click an item it colors the background to blue. You click it again and it toggles it again. [http://e-applist.azurewebsites.net/](http://e-applist.azurewebsites.net/)It saves the data locally using localStorage. No API calls. Nothing special, but I've found it very useful. Create your own. The more you use it. The more you use it, the more that anyone uses it, the more likely you will come back to do bug fixes and updates. If you are interested in addons/extensions for games, this is fun as well. Create something simple, even if it already exists and publish it so others can use it. I did this for World of Warcraft. When you see 1,000 downloads it's really exciting to get back in there to do bug fixes or add more. When a new expansion comes out, I have more updates to do. When you have a valid reason to program, it becomes easier to stick with it. Nothing so deflating as a developer as a throw away program that you learn nothing from or no one has any desire to use.",

The ones that do it out of passion for free will be in high demand and thus can't really do that many 1:1 clients without cutting into their work/personal life too much. In regards to actually paying for a 1:1 mentor, I am open to the idea but this is coming from someone who is already employed and making pretty good money. Beginners that want to break into the industry likely don't have the funds to hire mentors and mentors that offer free services might not be that good or are more selective (i.e. higher demand).Just some random thoughts on the subject",

        "body": "I've seen people offer to mentor/tutor for free, but what those people are willing to do and what the person wants from a tutor can be completely different.For example, a mentor might say \"Watch this video, and work on this exercise, and get back to me in a few days and show me your progress\". The student might want a custom lecture, want it recorded or transcribed, then be hand-held through solving the problems, and, one more thing, they have to be available when the student is available. I'm exaggerating, of course.When you see posters looking for help, they want someone to motivate them, figure out stuff when they get stuck, keep it interesting. Some students are given assignments, but then come back and said \"things got busy\" and they didn't have time to do what was being asked, so the mentor decides the student wants too much, but isn't serious about doing stuff on their own.One key is to level-set between mentor and student. The mentor should ask the student what they expect, i.e., how much time per week, what they expect the interaction to look like, etc. A potential mentor would express their expectations. Hopefully, they could find an agreement.From the student perspective, I'm sure they'd prefer free over paying, and they would be concerned, if they did pay, that the mentor was any good (presumably, they could quit if it wasn't working well).It's also a challenge to mentor well. A mentor needs to be aware of what the student needs and what they can provide. Some people over-explain going on and on with a concept not realizing the student has tuned out. They don't get the student to do some tasks during their meetings to keep things active.Intermediate programmers might fare better because they already know some programming. The student has to know what they want from a mentor and the mentor has to know what they want to offer.Look at the topics in this subreddit. Many are looking for a first language to learn, or they're worried about AI, or they need motivation to do something. I doubt the creators of this subreddit expected those kinds of posts to dominate the subreddit.",

In my experience the mentor finds you not the other way around which sucks cuz it can take time As a mentorEVERYONE wants a mentor. There just isn't enough time and enough mentors. Most ppl are unwilling to actually do the work or things suggested. I'm not saying this is you or everyone but a lot of ppl don't truly understand what a mentor does and just expects us to hold their hand and give them a job from out connections. This is also why I think the mentor finds you not the other way around because we wait until we see someone showing the signs of someone that can actually benefit from a mentor \\- Would you pay for a 1:1 mentorThis is really up to you and I \"personally\" don't like charging but I could completely see why someone would and have charged in the past for ppl that aren't local to me. I tried doing a discord server/meetup online and ppl just weren't as serious in my experience like they are when we do it locally and I think it's cuz of the low cost of entry to just click \"join server/meeting\". You are paying for this whether you have a mentor or not. You are either paying financial to move forward in time with their help OR you are paying in time having to figure it all out yourself. I know their are sites out there (I have not used them so I can't say if they are good or bad just know they exist) [mentorcruise.com](http://mentorcruise.com) and [codingcouch.io](http://codingcouch.io)",

Usually this is just for very low level networking code, but you'll want to at least consider it for save files if you transfer those between machines.As for unions... They're kind of an outdated way to solve a problem you shouldn't have very often in a weird way, if you're using strictly C you'll probably still need them here and there but for modern C++ you should consider `std::variant` in most cases you'd reach for a union, maybe `std::any` for some niche cases. One big problem with unions is that they occupy as much memory as their largest member - so over-using them for primitives will definitely mess up your memory usage and alignment. Another issue is that they're riddled with undefined behavior - writing to one union member and then reading from another is not technically allowed, but your program will compile anyways. UB is something to be rightfully scared of.TL;DR - you'd be better served by keeping a consistent internal float representation and only caring about endian-ness at communication boundaries than relying on a feature that comes with footguns.",

Its like drawing rectangles under a curve for the first 2 weeks of calc 1 ... if you got the concept 30 min into it, the next 2 weeks are blah blah.Take data structures: almost all modern languages have either these built into the language or libraries where they are done for you. It serves you no purpose to build a linked list out of pointers in C; first, its inefficient (page faults), second its error prone (pointers and inexperience don't mix), and thirdly as I said, its already there to be used in a library or language innate. What you need to know is when to use what data structures, and that isn't even well explained in the courses (they focus on reinventing them, not how to use them!). So go review a web site (not AI generated, find a human written one) on when to use what data structures.Big-O is just a jargon notation. Its like the math class on convergence of sequences (if you had that one?) where you examine the dominating term to see if it converges on infinity... except here we look for it to converge on an exponent. So bubble sort, where you go over the whole list of say numbers, find the smallest one, move it one location at a time until it gets to the top, repeat for the list except ignore the top item, then next time ignore the top 2 items... converges on N\\*N amount of work being done to sort the data, which you can review online how to get there but its 2 nested loops effectively over N each, so its not too hard to see (this one). Proving an algorithm takes however many operations is helpful to know if its good at its job. The good news is that studying algorithms will include an explanation of how to do big-O & use it.Which leads me to algorithms. While a LOT of algorithms are included in languages and libraries, you still need to study them and to be able to solve your own problems using either the known common ones strung together or a totally new thing. I advise you to then do a quick overview of datastructures as I said above, and after that, do a pretty solid study of intro to algorithms and keep on digging into it as deep as you think is useful. I recommend not getting trapped/bogged down in graphs or graph theory unless you think you will be using that stuff (its pretty rare in most fields).after those, study object oriented programming if you have not gone deep into it. The last thing to do is design patterns, which require an in depth understanding of OOP & other basics or much of what these are doing will not make sense.avoid leet code. Its like tricky word problems in a math class more than practical programming. It can be fun, but in real life, no one will actively try to confuse you with the requirements and if they do, you can ask questions. Hit it up SOME, but don't \"grind\" it. The most useful thing it will teach you is how unexpected inputs and edge cases can really mess up something you thought you had working. THAT is useful and practical!",

They justify it by saying they'll learn new things, but have no contingency if they run out of time.My suggestion is to find out who has more experience, your friend with React or you with Angular or if one of you can pick stuff up quickly. Or do both. Plan out a rough idea of what needs to get done, and how it would be done with Angular and React.In the meanwhile, give yourself about a week or two to learn Django (or use Flask, which is allegedly lighter weight and might be easier to learn). Build out a super simple web app (to-do) just to see the steps needed. If you're still mired in Django and Flask after two weeks and realize it's too much to learn, then go back to the technology you already know.If you can start learning Django and Flash right now, you can see how fast you can learn it. I would suggest regular meetings (every day) and perhaps in person if you can manage it during this process. Essentially, you are waiting for a go or no go scenario (go meaning yes, do it in Django/Flask, and no go meaning go back to something familiar).",

Also this place is for asking programming questions and your question isn't really about programming. It sounds like you are being put in a situation where you are made responsible for much more than you should be responsible for. But that's nothing new. as is pointed out, the same traffic split over multiple applications would act very similar (if not better) than the same traffic in one application. However you mentioned asp / old technology. Most modern webpages run mostly in the frontend (webbrowser) with only occasional calls being made to the backend to fetch data. this makes it much easier on the webserver since it only needs to put out data rather than generate html.old style applications would do a new request for each click (next page, sort, submit) and that request would generate the entire html page that the end-user sees. if this is the case for you then there definitely is going to be load on the server when there is sufficient traffic. Additionally it is possible that if you maintain session state at the server side there are inefficiencies there (too much state is kept, using up all the memory)from the documentation about web forms: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-forms/what-is-web-forms> When users request a page, it is compiled and executed on the server by the framework, and then the framework generates the HTML markup that the browser can render. An ASP.NET Web Forms page presents information to the user in any browser or client device.so yes, web forms likely does serverside rendering of the page. which means it can be slow because the server has to do (relatively speaking) a lot of work for each request and it can be slow because all the html the client wants to display has to be loaded for each page request. Modern frameworks tend to load a website as a single page application (well not all but plenty) which then needs minimal callbacks to the server.so yes I suspect in your case it is possible that switching to another framework can speed things uphowever it's not as simple as saying: you use x, that is why it is slow. it may be a resource problem, a bottleneck in the database or other resources, it could be any number of things. It's important to start measuring. look at the server cpu usage when your websites are under load. look at the memory usage. if possible, see if you can attach a profiler to you server and see where the cpu cycles and such go. However if you're a junior (this is learn programming after all) you shouldn't be doing any of these things.",

He was tasked with providing some type information when linking two C object files (one of C's capabilities is to compile a program like `foo.c` into an object file called `foo.o`. There's also a `foo.h` which is a header file that other C programs can reference if they want to call functions defined in `foo.c`. However, the standard C linker which combines .o files doesn't really check the types in the header file to see if they matched).The idea was to produce a better checker prior to linking object files. Instead, the guy got fascinated with parsing challenging C structures. He didn't know how to do that. Despite that, it was a solved problem. The goal of the project was to do some kind of research project on something new.The prof. said he needed \"taste\", that is, to pick problems that need to be solved and not to spend time on problems that have been solved, even if you didn't know how to solve it.Of course, *someone* has to learn it. Some people, like you, have a need to know, even if that rabbit hole is tremendous. It probably feels like a more well-defined problem than the one you're working on?

Usually it’s something like C# or Java for backend, React or Angular for frontend, and a form of SQL for databases.Once you’ve picked a stack, start building a project. The idea itself doesn’t matter that much, just pick something you’d actually enjoy working on. Start small with just the basic functionalities, focus on clean code and good practices, and build on top of it over time.Good features to include:* CRUD operations* Authentication* Form handling & validation* Database integration (querying, filtering, sorting)* Responsive frontendOnce it’s done, deploy it with something like Vercel, and host the code on GitHub so you can link it directly in your resume. That way, when interviews come, you’ll have something real to talk about and that always stands out.If you really don't know what to build, just pick a random idea, maybe something you can actually use at the same time, like a job tracker app, or a blog platform.",

Spending hours just to think about a problem is a major red flag. Here’s a suggestion: tell your brain you have 30 mins to figure out this problem and 15 mins to code the solution…this is typically the time I give my prospective candidates. That should be PLENTY of time to get things done. If you can’t get it done in this time find the solution look at it then redo the problem with the solution you’ve already seen",

So my deployment is just like deploying to a Linux machine.I have a static website, a couple of apps, and I am learning Jenkins, so I have a few subdomains. Each subdomain has it's own docker container and I use nginx as a reverse proxy. I use a docker-compose file to manage my containers. My static site doesn't use a docker image, just a location on my server, but my web apps have docker images that are hosted on ghcr.io (GitHub container registry). The docker-compose file pulls the image for those apps and starts the container with the configs I need.I think a lot of this is separate from programming, but I think they are useful skills to have (and it has worked out for me as learning this info has helped me transition to a swe role from a non-swe position).",

We need to give it a value, but we can't just do: Color c = r:254 g:50 b:10; we need to first construct a color object using its constructor: Color c = new Color(); lets assume that we have the following constructor for color: Color(){ this.r = 0; this.g = 0; this.b = 0; } Now we can initialize a color to black. But what if we wanted to set the color in the constructor? We could just make a new constructor with the call signature of: Color(int r, int g, int b) Where it sets the members in one line instead of setting them to black in the default constructor and then changing them with getters and setters. Constructors are kind of basic in java, in other languages like c or c++ a constructor can be paired with a destructor and then you can employ a programming technique called RAII which stands for resource acquisition is initialization. But you can also do this with java using the try with resources paradigm.",

Usually you're using it to initialize variables or for calling methods which are required.```javapublic MyClass(String mystring){this.mystring = mystring;requiredMethod();}```This code assumes that a private variable called \"mystring\" exists.Creating an object of this class would look like this```javaString mystring = \"my string\";MyClass myObject = new MyClass(mystring);```And like any other method constructors can also be overloaded. That means you can add multiple constructors and when creating the object the one with the matching datatypes is used.You can also put whatever code you want into a constructor, but you should stick to initializations and method calls.",

Like, when you write `Point point = new Point()` the `Point()` is the constructor call.You can only call constructors that actually exist for that class. If you don't write any constructors for a class, it will have a default empty constructor equivalent to public Point() { }However, if you do explicitly define any constructors, the default one won't exist.For example, if I write a constructor like this public Point(double x, double y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; }and it's the only constructor I write for the class, then this will be the only way to create instances of Point. You won't be able to call `new Point()`, only `new Point(0, 0)`. You can use this, for example, to guarantee that you can't create instances of Point without providing values. There are also more niche implications of this. For example, if you make make the only constructor private, it will mean that code outside of this class can't create instances because it can't access the constructor. Basically constructors serve two main purposes, specifying how new instances of a class can be created, and more commonly, simply running some logic when a new object is created.",

Does he/she use terms like \"not no\"?? I've never heard of that.For your \"is\\_yes\" and \"is\\_no\" situation, I think you want you are actually describing is a yes/no dialog box, but that the default is \"yes\" or \"no\" respectively. As for the return value, that is up to you (the domain expert would not care in that case). But the idea of a default button being selected (as either 'yes' or 'no') is definitely in the domain of the UI/UX.For example, when you click \"close\" and the document is not yet saved, you may get a box like \"do you want to save your changes - yes/no\" and the default should definitely be \"yes\" for that.On the other hand, if you are about to perform an action which is hard/impossible to undo (like \"empty recycle bin\"), then for that the default should be \"no\". I.e. it should be hard to accidentally do it.>`is_si` – amazing, short, clever, my preferred option – but as an English speaker, would you understand the `si`>Most people in the U.S. know what \"si\" means from Spanish, but the confusing part here, is why you would use this instead of \"yes\" (or in addition). Like, do you have all of \"yes\", \"no\", and \"si\" in your API? If so, why? That would be the confusing part for me as a programmer using your API. If you have a good reason for that, then OK. If you are doing it just because \"si\" is 2 characters (1 character shorter than \"yes\"), then that's not a good reason.OTOH if you are using it for localization purposes (e.g. in standard French, \"si\" is used only for responding \"no/yes\" to negative questions, and perhaps in other languages too, like in Dutch/German how toch/doch is used to contradict), then that might be interesting or important. So if you have a compelling reason to put this in the API (e.g. to help localization), then that would be OK but you should make it intuitive for the programmer and explain it in the docs or in the header or wherever the programmer normally reads up on how to use your code.",

(a lot less back pain here and even a skinny teenager can lift the small box).Maybe makes sense use different server to store the data, something like we rarely use data after 10 years so we should move it to another storage(this is usually called data cooling and is another thing) or maybe instead of using a single giant storage, the matrix hq thinks its better to split the data by country and send the box to each country for faster and simplier operations sinse rarely countries need data from storages in another country.Also don't confuse db server with data lake.cloud archtecture like databricks take lots of db servers and shows them in a single data lake, so maybe what you think as partitioned data is actually distincts db servers from different sectors(it, marketing, accounts) from the same company",

Try to get unstuck by Googling in general.3. Try to get unstuck by posting a question on Reddit.4. Try to get unstuck by asking AI.So, this list is not bad on its face, but I think you're missing a \"step 0\" that should come first (or \"zeroth\" in programmer-speak) -- that is, to try to get unstuck by using your own brain \"first of all\" and using what you already know in your brain and with your 'hands' (e.g. by launching your own debugger or using your own preferred debugging techniques like adding assert's, printf-debugging, etc.). That is, try to first \"do it yourself\" for at least a good 5-10 minutes, or some amount that you determine. If things get frustrating, then you'll feel when it's time to throw in the towel. But if you develop the habit of \"throwing in the towel\" immediately when you encounter a gotcha, and if you're always rushing off somewhere else all the time, then to me this sounds like it's going to weaken your mental muscles of problem solving.By the way, solving the problem yourself (during the imaginary \"step 0\" of the above), this is the part that feels pretty good to our brains. It's the part that makes programming 'addictive' in a positive way. Sure, maybe your solution won't be as nice or pretty as what you found on the Top Result of Google/StackOverflow/Reddit/whatever; it won't have all the nice textbook-style comments that AI-generated code tends to have (personally I hate those, and usually ask AI-generators to exclude them) but 99% of the time in real programming, you don't \\*need\\* the \"prettiest\" solution, you just need a solution that works.So, let's assume for a moment that you can most likely find a solution yourself (a skill which you'll get better at if you practice), and let's assume that your solution doesn't need to be \"top-StackOverflow-post-worthy\" in terms of beauty and super-correctness (99% of the time, real solutions in the real world don't need to be that). Then it seems to me that it behooves us as programmers to spend most of our initial effort in the \"step 0\" part of the above problem-solving/issue-resolution 'algorithm'.

I have studied computer science in college and nearing the end of my undergraduate so I’ve seen quite a few different things in college. My best advice is I guess is to try different things and see what you prefer, you can’t know what you like until you do it. However attending college and studying something that turns out to be the wrong course for you is a horrible feeling. Do online classes like codecamp, bro code, try out different things. If ur into game dev or want to try it out, look up classes or online tutorials for blender, unreal, unity,… If u want to learn any type of coding, the basics are the same for all programming languages just a different syntax (way of typing code depending on the programming language). You can’t really start learning any of the more advanced topics without basic programming knowledge. Every type of application always has different ways to be build, not every company works with the same software. Mobile development for example isn’t done with html and css like a web application, web apps usually use frameworks to speed up the development process so even if you know html and css it’s not enough, depending on the job you want you’ll still have to learn managing and implementing a database for example making a mvc application with .net in c# and framework.core to make a full stack web application. There are a lot of different jobs and topics, start with doing what you think interests you the most. Learns some front end coding and some backend and you’ll quickly find out what you prefer by actually doing stuff. All that said, do some research about programming languages, what they are usually used for, decide what you want to start first and if you found something you really like than maybe you can find a school about the topics or computer science to get a degree. Or find another way to get experience and land a job, even if u decide to study in college you will already have seen some topics.",

I mean html is the 'code' that generates web pages... python is a programming language (tell a computer what to do), lua is a scripting language (all I know about it is that some games use it so the players can make changes to the game's content or behavior), cybersecurity is a large topic about keeping bad people from doing bad things with computers, IT depends on context, it can mean all computer science fields or it may mean only data-heavy fields (databases and related topics) and sometimes it means technical support or other things. C# is microsoft's favorite language, and has little to do with C or C++; it came from java and ended up in left field (its a good language, just its own thing now). As IT isn't a well defined term, its hard to say, but the answer is probably yes, you need to know some of the things that IT could mean to do security. Yes, businesses still want web sites. And its always a game of oneupmanship with competing sites/businesses!How can I know which area I can pursue professionally? Well, you do what you enjoy, but to choose that and find it, you need to research a bit what all the different areas are about and what the jobs entail. The info is out there but you have to look for it. Yes, some day AI will likely replace some things. It will also create jobs for people who babysit the AI, train them, write them, etc. AI is as dumb as a brick, and will remain so for decades to come unless there is some radical breakthrough. Its a toy, and its not even able to replace the idiots that call you to sell you stuff yet; it can just barely connect you to a human once it realizes it can't do anything itself. Given what I have seen and what I just said, the most likely people to be replaced by it are middle management, not coders or technical people. You have started, you are asking questions. Now go find out what the things you asked about mean, and that will spawn more questions, so you look up what those are/mean... and after a bit the big picture will emerge. I can't help with youtube. The average video presents information roughly 10 times slower than the average text answer. Unless its a video where you need a visual component (eg, how to take apart your lawnmower's engine), I avoid it.",

Some are behind on the National Curriculum expectations at this age, so the clubs help them catch up.We also have some kids that are way ahead and need challenges, and we usually move into physical computing and robotics (some work with microcontrollers using micropython or circuit python and I've had a few that have gone ahead and taught themselves C).PS.

Essentially the idea behind it is to expose API as a set of arbitrary *functions* and let the API clients call those functions.The idea behind **REST** is to not expose functions per se, but to expose *resources* to let client directly manipulate them (read, make changes, make new ones, etc.). You can think of RPC functions as *verbs*. Meanwhile resources are *nouns*, and there's a limited set of verbs representing actions on those nouns. Specifically, the verbs are different HTTP request methods: GET, POST, DELETE, etc.**With REST APIs** you often can get the idea what you can or cannot do with it by looking at the available resources. Like, for an imaginary Reddit API you would see the resource `comment` and would assume that:`GET /api/comments?post_id=xyz`would give you all comments for a specific Reddit post.**With RPC** this can be something like `getCommentsForPost(xyz)`, and gRPC would convert it to a protobuf on the way to and from the server.Both approaches have **pros and cons**. REST became popular when many people started building APIs for web apps and mobile apps and used many different languages to make them. At the time the primary RPC technology was SOAP and XML-WebServices (essentially the same thing as gRPC except with XML and not protobuf), and not many languages had libraries for SOAP. With REST if your language could speak HTTP you were ready to use it.Even today, like you said gRPC is faster and theoretically should replace REST for everything, except that outside of about top 5 / top 10 most popular languages support for it is almost non-existent. Last time I worked with gRPC was about 5-6 years ago, and at the time there was no convenient way to make RPC calls from a web page, so the largest proportion of potential clients couldn't use it at all. I haven't looked at it since, to be honest.In practice, REST can be fast enough for many / most situations, so people keep using it because it's convenient.",

So if you're building an API that's going to be called out of a browser you have to use gRPC-web which is nowhere near as performant as gRPC over HTTP 2.0 (and in some cases potentially less performant than \"standard\" HTTP 1.1 calls). In my experience it's also more fiddly to get working correctly and more difficult to test.If you're talking about gRPC for service-to-service communication, that's definitely on the rise because if it's set up properly it can be significantly more performant and secure.",

        "body": "**TL;DR - gRPC takes a bit of extra work and solves problems that REST users may not have.**gRPC's performance advantages over REST come primarily in two flavors:1. Protocol buffers are more space + time efficient for message passing than JSON.2. gRPC is set up over HTTP 2, which means you can send many messages with less TCP/HTTP connection overhead (in a nutshell, many requests can share connections)Advantage #1 doesn't require gRPC, you *could* protocol buffer encode your messages and send around binary payloads if you wanted to. This advantage doesn't actually apply very much to strings or small integers, so jumping through the hoops of defining and distributing protocol buffer definition files isn't really worth the effort usually.As for advantage #2, this is actually something REST *can* have as well with HTTP 3, and depending on your network topology you can get the main benefits here without having to re-write any of your application code.gRPC is a godsend if you have internal services that are quite chatty with each other and are paying all the network/CPU bills for all of them, since the serialization cost and wire size is strictly better and sometimes better by a noticeable (double-digit percentage) margin. Protocol buffers are also quite nice because they allow you to generate message passing logic for multiple languages, meaning you don't have to write a lot of overhead to translate to/from JSON when your C++ data chugging service is talking to your NodeJS client-facing websocket server - but that only saves you effort if distributing/consuming that generated code is easy.",

        "body": "IMO gRPC + protobuf is pretty nice, but it does require some up-front effort to set up and make seamless. For example:- To use protobuf you need a code generation step where you transform your proto files into the actual interfaces you implement + objects you use. It may not always be easy to integrate this into your build system in a seamless way, depending on your setup.- You'll also probably want to write some sort of wrapper to smooth out some of the tedium of launching your server and creating your clients.- Sharing protobuf definitions between different repos is a bit of a PITA, last I checked.These factors mean that:1. For smaller companies or projects, you'll probably see negligible overhead from using plain-old HTTP + JSON. So, it's often not worth the effort of setting up gRPC + protobuf: the speed boost isn't big enough to justify switching for many.2. Using gRPC + protobuf _can_ be worth it for larger companies. However, you'll most likely use it purely internally and continue using HTTP + JSON for your externally-facing API -- the browser support for gRPC is not quite there. If your API is something designed for others to use, you'll also have to take into account that most users of your public API will (statistically speaking) be smaller companies or hobbyists that cannot or do not want to use gRPC + protobuf. So if you want to maximize adoption, you'll have to stick with the least common denominator, which is HTTP + JSON.",

        "body": "I was lucky to use it at a later stage (late 2000s), and by that time most glaring problems with SOAP were generally \"solved\".All these WS-* standards were not pedantically defined, and in practice Java tools were doing whatever .NET tools were doing and vice versa. Both Microsoft, and Sun-Oracle and IBM were working really hard to make sure that the two sides of the ecosystem had seamless experience. But if you were \"outside\" of those two stacks you were in for subtle bugs.However, I worked on projects that were Java and .NET, and for us it was pretty awesome. When you needed to connect two services the two teams would sit down, design a WSDL file, and then our tools would generate both client and server code *and test stubs* so we could test (or run) the rest of the application without having the other service running. Both languages had top tier IDEs, so if, say you wanted to load patient appointments you'd fire up the autocomplete, and it would find types for requests and response messages, data validators, etc.If you find something missing you'd ring up the other team, you would agree to changes to WSDL, and then both teams would regenerate code and the IDE would instantly highlight all places where the code was broken. I worked on a medical project like this at some point, and the teams of dozens of developers (both Java and .NET) worked on individual services for months without actually running the full system ever (That was the time before CI was widespread). We finally had a demo scheduled, we connected the real endpoints, and you would think it all would brow up spectacularly. But no! The stuff actually worked! Our WSDLs had thousands of lines in them, and we had, like, 5 functions where things didn't work as expected (people passing wrong IDs or assuming different time zones, you know the drill.).So, all things considered, it was a pretty cool set of tech. The devil was in a details. Despite everything, XML was annoying to work with, the generated types may have fields with stupid names (`field1`, `field2`, or `meaningfulName0` or something). If you wanted to debug this code you'd have to send XMLs with a tool called SOAP UI (it's like Postman, but much worse and in Java). Messages had a lot of wrapper tags with XML namespaces in them and tons of unnecessary meta-info. Both Sun and Microsoft insisted that the best way to make some classes in your favorite language, and then let *them* generate WSDL, all the tutorials showed that, and not how to work with WSDL-first approach. So people who were excited about how simple it looked in the examples were in for a very rude awakening. All in all, it was a very strong tech on a \"strategic\" level, but day-to-day as a single engineer on one of those projects you didn't really enjoyed it, and I can easily see how people would say it was PITA! Especially, those who worked with it in its earlier years when half of things it promised didn't really work. I remember at the time I was not a fan of WS and SOAP at all, but over the years and looking back I started to appreciate it more.With gRPC Google took the main idea: have a protocol defined in a spec file (new WSDL), and use code gen for every language. They improved a lot of stuff: the new spec file format - proto - is much nicer, it works with a lot more languages, there's a lot less ceremony and special tools involved. But they also made a few decisions to make the whole thing annoying in its own way. Like, making it binary only which is bad for observability, require an exotic transport, having web browser support as an afterthought, etc. So, while objectively I liked my time with SOAP *somewhat* I'm not really rushing to try gRPC.Funny thing: SOAP was not the first either, before that we had CORBA and DCOM in the 90s and some proprietary stuff from Unix vendors in the 80s. And like every other thing in our profession RPC, too, was invented at Xerox. [The guy who coined the term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Jay_Nelson) even came up with the general design: have a file for interface definition, use it to generate stubs, all messages and RPC calls are type-checked to prevent bugs.",

There were 3 people ahead of me. Fortunately all 3 took offers from other companies. If they hadn’t I would’ve not gotten that job. It was purely based on when they had completed their interviews. There was no mention of “this person is a better fit” or anything. They extended offers in order of final on-site date. But even so, if they hadn’t, still a lot of luck involved.

They'll be hiring a replacement as soon as they can.Being *laid off* means the company is eliminating your position, probably alongside a ton of others, because either they literally can't afford you, or they're making some big, strategic decision about where they want to invest. And there's a better chance you get some kind of severance package.It's not as clean a difference as I'm painting -- sometimes companies use layoffs to get rid of people they wanted to fire anyway, and not everyone gets a good severance. But it's a difference that can matter to companies hiring, or to lawyers if it comes to it. Very few people ever got *fired* from Google. Thousands have been *laid off.*",

I can quite easily get away with 10-20 hour work weeks, and on the rare occasion I do work 40 hours, it's not the same kind of 40 hours I've seen my friends do at FAANG.There's also a big part of actually ***getting in*** to the company. My company does mostly behavioural-type interviews with a few basic technical questions. I've been prepping for FAANG and the process is brutal. LeetCode + System Design + OOD + Behavioural is a lot of different topics, it takes a lot of time and perseverance to do it all, especially when you already have a job. It's really taught me to not give up on things so easily and continue pushing no matter how many times I fail. I didn't have that kind of skill set before I started the prep to be honest, at least not to the same level.",

An L3 will be expected to write designs and go toe-to-toe with L7s. Product requirements are sketchy, cross-team dependencies are not well defined. It's up to you to figure out what you need to succeed.Coding isn't just about writing code. Google's engineers aren't that much better at writing code. They excel at system design, systems thinking, self promotion, project organization, etc. If I want someone to do what they're told, I would never hire a Google engineer.

It's kind of like how people always say, what's the point of learning advanced physics and chemistry and math when you aren't ever going to use it at work. Well in this case it does help and it makes it easier to understand other complex and abstract concepts.At big tech it's a pretty normal expectation for you to immediately be able to pick up and use new languages, tools, and frameworks. Even if you've never written C++ before it's expected that you can still make contributions in that language with the help of documentation.

But it was all so understandable and predictable and you could absolutely leave work at work at the end of a normal-length day. If you want a great WLB, avoid sexy things like start-ups and FAANG. Find the most boring outfit you can and become indispensable there.",

Is it being treated as a sign of poor performance and not as an opportunity for your growth as an engineer? Do you understand the reasoning behind their comments? Do your seniors explain it if you ask? Is it presented professionally? What happens when you deliver questions or feedback on the senior's output? I get that CR comments can be curt and can be nitpicky. That can be part of making the code better. Ours is a world that requires a fair degree of technical precision in our language and in our execution. In of itself, I'd try to be less bothered by CR comments, even the most nitpicky things *so long as they are making the code better*. But ours is also a world of automation. There are technical solutions to make things faster and more objective. I'd suggest If it's simple things that a linter could catch, then perhaps suggest modifying your team's linters to catch that issue. This will make everything more accurate, tighten up CR schedules and whatnot. If these are not things a linter could catch, are they things that can be defined in a coding standard? Is that coding standard documented? If not, you could be the person who writes it down. Are these issues that can be caught in a dryrun? If so, look into your packages' build targets and CRUX rules so that the necessary dryruns run the necessary checks.The other question is to make sure we have a meeting of the minds on the question of design and what each task is actually implementing. Insist on better tickets as input and ask for clarification on requirements early if you're confused. *This is a perfectly valid way to push back earlier in the dev cycle*. Now, if these things are being seen as a sign of poor performance and not an opportunity for you to develop as an engineer, than yeah... This might just be an issue with your team. Or perhaps even your org as a whole. On my team, I'm being measured on the number of revisions each CR takes, and yeah, I'm being driven a bit nuts by that because it destroys a big chunk of the utility of the CR tool to solicit feedback.This is both on you and on your team/org. You have to accept that receiving feedback, even critical feedback, is part of the job. They have to provide that feedback professionally and keep it focused on delivering a better final result rather than stoking someone's ego or gaming CR metrics. Sadly, you can't do all that much about someone in the org thinking that the number of code review revisions says how productive an engineer is and there's only so much you can do about someone who treats the review process as an excuse to go on an ego trip. But you can control how you act. You can ask questions to deepen your understanding of the technical issues at play, you can be the change you want to see on the team when you're the one writing technical comments about other's code or designs, you can seek process improvement about how your deliver code changes.",

Like are they spotting real things to improve? Or are they just being contrary for the sake of being contrary? In either case it doesn't need to bother you. You either accept that you have things to learn and do it, and/or you accept that they suck and ignore them.I'm pretty thorough, and even still, pretty much every PR gets at least a couple nits; that's kind of the whole point. Same with design meetings and such, I expect ideas I present to get challenged, even if just to play devils advocate and think it through. None of that bothers me though, I think my team is great. Confidence has to be internal, or it's very brittle. If you rely on outside markers for confidence, it doesn't matter where you go, you'll feel at least partially the same way because feedback is part of the career.So yeah, Amazon is known for culture issues, and I'm sure there are some problems, there's no harm in applying around to see what happens. But I would also consider therapy for help working on self-confidence and not worrying so much about what people think. You can't outrun self-doubt.",

I care about variable names and the like for readability, searchability, and needing _others_ to understand what your code is for -- not because I think it's meaningful for your changes to improve the product.If you have a linter you can modify, consider updating it for the Category 1 comments -- link the comment and @ the author to show you're taking them seriously and expanding their influence! They'll love not needing to make that comment again and that you're buying what they're selling.Separate the last 4 groups into \"Meaningful, required follow-up\" and \"More arbitrary/opinionated/resolved-with-discussion\" categories.The second category can usually be pre-worked by writing better PR descriptions, structuring your PRs for readability, writing more/better comments and READMEs, and smaller PRs.Mechanical and Architectural considerations are knowledge gaps. It's an opportunity to learn, don't sweat them -- but do learn from them.Logical and User Functional considerations that required follow-up are the ones worth sweating a little. If you have logical issues, did you have corresponding tests? Did you add test cases after? If you have User Functional issues, were the requirements poorly articulated? Learn from these so you can resolve requirements issues before coding, when you can. Learn from the rest in what's required to enhance your product with a maintainable pattern.For your next PR, take a walk and then pre-review it before publishing. Look for anything worth commenting on in that's familiar from other comments you've received, and fix-up before pushing. Sometimes when a change is a slog we get stuck in \"just trying to finish\" and it ends up taking more iterations than if we step back and give the code a good massage before pushing it.Bonus option: Tally using reviewer initials and take stock in who's leaving you the best comments -- hit them up and thank them! Being taken seriously when I'm reviewing code for others makes me more willing to jump in on other comment threads for them.",

Sure, things used to be more fast and loose, like testing in production loose, but now, it seems like there is so much bureaucratic overhead that nothing gets done without an endless string of meetings.

Write some design docs and work independently on a few projects that last for more than a quarter that meaningfully land and you've basically hit all the requirements. You could get delayed by six months because of budget stuff but in general it's not bad. Promotions to L5 and especially L6+ have become *way* messier in the past two years. Strict budgets and a requirement for \"business need\" means that a lot of qualified people are being rejected for these promos, creating a glut in the next cycle and ultimately stalling a lot of careers. One piece of good news is that you can stay at L4 forever at Google without a problem, so getting over this hurdle isn't mandatory.A lot of managers at Google were originally engineers first. Usually the path is getting promoted to L5 or L6 first, demonstrating effective leadership and communication skills, and then having a nearby opening for a manager position that you can fill. In the past this used to be easier because headcount growth meant that \"we need a new manager to deal with the five new people we are hiring\" was pretty common. Now the most likely path is that a nearby manager quits and you are available to replace them.This could conceivably change in the future, but from the inside the cultural change at Google feels permanent (at least while Sundar is CEO). 10 years of experience and getting a L3 offer seems odd. I'd expect 10YOE to get interviewed for L5 and potentially downleveled to L4, but it sounds like maybe you were interviewed at L4 and did so-so on the interviews so you got downleveled to L3.",

Generally I’m almost always against mode leveling (especially senior to non-senior or staff to senior) because it’s so hard to make it up.However, I think in this case if you can make up the money difference, your current company isn’t high prestige, job stability isn’t great there etc, It might be worth at least considering though it sounds like they’re trying to drop you two levels rather than one. Sounds a bit crazy to me but then again Google is barely interviewing or hiring so if you get an offer these days it’s so rare it may be difficult to pass up.Specifically to your question:The L3 level is really entry level or a couple years at a small company. Again, I’m really surprised that’s what they’re offering but I guess it’s due to low hiring. As a result, the expectation to make it to L4 is there and it can be done fairly fast. Essentially L3 separated the new employees who are really struggling and need supervision from folks that can get a task that could take a couple months within a larger project, plan and document, launch it. Etc. it’s about independence. Doubt you’d have a problem thereL4 to L5 (senior) is much more tricky due to needing the right project, having leadership, quotas, etc, but I’ve seen it done in as low as 2-3 years from L3. As long as you show you can lead a project managers will give you a chance as soon as they can. These promotions are in org so if leadership perceives you as a lead that got downleveled you’d get more opportunitiesFeel free to PM if you have questions",

A downlevel is staying within the same role.The reason downleveling isn't normally a big deal is because all companies treat titles differently. So going from a Senior SWE at Company A to a SWE 2 at Company B isn't some sort of demotion, it's just Company B saying according to their internal titles you fall under a SWE 2. You're still a SWE at the end of the day, doing the same SWE stuff, just with a different arbitrary title next to your name. Sure there's traditionally some difference between a Senior SWE and a non-Senior SWE, but what Company B is communicating is you don't meet that difference at *their* company, so still no change.But what you're describing is a full on role change. You are going from being a manager, to being a SWE. The roles are inherently different.I don't know anything about Google's internal processes so can't comment on that, but if your career goal is to be a manager, changing from a manager role down to a SWE role is not going to be beneficial, and if anything it'll look bad on your resume. Sure Google has massive hiring prestige, but they hired you as a SWE, not a manager. Who knows how long it'll take before Google puts you into a management role. Who knows if they'll *ever* put you into a management role.If being a manager is your goal, I would continue looking until I found a manager role.Just like if being a SWE was my goal, and a company offered me an IT position, I would keep looking until I found a SWE role.",

Of course it's not as easy as saying \"I want to join FAANG\", tons of preparation and luck involved too.. but I'm gonna keep trying until I hopefully get it.I think at the end of the day, there is no right or wrong.

My main role was that I built the installation for a really complex app. You know, the Next >, Next >, Next > app you use when you install something on Windows? That was me. In 2011 a FAANG company reached out to me and said they were going to be my town and asked if I wanted to interview. We were starting to hire at my company and I had no idea how to run a tech interview, so I said yes assuming I could steal their ideas. To my surprise, they offered me a job. It was a mid level SDE position. In my role at my company I was a team lead, but the pay was so much more that I decided to take it and try to stay for 2 years. It involved a relocation I wasn't interested in, but again. Way more money. Well, I'm still here 13 years later. I've moved through the ranks well and now lead an organization. I've now interviewed for other companies and almost always get turned down or get offered a role way below my abilities or comp that isn't anywhere close.The difference? I think largely luck. There's so many things that can go right or wrong in this silly process that we use. And unfortunately, right this instant, luck is not on your side. There are fewer jobs than there are new grads who want them. It'll likely turn around, but right now your best bet is to study hard, leet code, and get as many at bats as you can manage. Take interviews, big and small. Get better at it. Remember: You don't necessarily need to be a great engineer, you need to be a good interview. The venn diagram of those two things often overlap, but its certainly not 1 to 1.Dive into your current job. You'll get good examples that you can use for the behavioral assessments. Also: If you didn't get a return offer, what was the reason? Focus on that area as much as you can.",

Life's different for someone-  in 20s from 3rd world country who's after citizenship of EU or USA-  in 30s who has to look after parents or take care of them because of illness etc-  who pays mortgage with a wife and children-  who wants to take care of their children and spend their time with them-  who values WLB and likes to spend time on hobbies-  who does a side hustle like a mobile game etc.Essentially, it all boils down to your savings and what kind of risks you re willing to take. There is no nobility in making Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos richer than they already are. The people you see are probably valuing security over risks and challenges. Staying somewhere for 10 years is another risk, but they are probably not worried about that when they see those old timers with 25+ years.When you experience a bad job, or a layoff, or some health or family issues, you value a stable but boring place like a bank unless you have other income.Staying somewhere for 10 years will probably not be that good if you worked with the same stack and did same things every day. Spending 3-5 years on a first job is fine. The market is good for seniors but not so much for juniors. you gotta pay your dues first no matter where and make a move when you no longer take the bullshit in your current place, be it you getting underpaid, bad management, workload, or soulless teammates",

I might roll my eyes (likely at the disorganized recruiter) because I would have been more prepared if I had seen the request (i.e. typed out the prompt more, maybe follow up questions, etc to copy paste in to have it go smoothly) … but I would never say no!! Hugely inappropriate… some people just don’t appreciate veterans the same way. If you have any recent experience or projects, I’d recommend also trying to find things to talk about in those, just to handle those types of questions / people. The interviewer was probably just trying to drill down into technical experience, and that’s why they were asking about non service related experiences?

It's very misleading, as I joined during the beta, asked some popular/stupid questions, and got in early doors on some of the easier answers for popular stacks.This had been called out from the start. Many suggested that to follow Jeff Atwood's initial vision for SO the site would need to reduce duplication not through closing, but through merging content, and producing canonical content across multiple questions. These problems had dragged on for over a decade, and ultimately SO never learned from them. They focused more on power users over the overall vision.Alongside this, internal changes mean that Jeff left, eventually Joel left (IIRC?), the dev days died, and the reputation the site had kept dying out.I don't think it'll die, but it needs very strong leadership to become relevant again.",

Almost every meaningful question has already been asked, so any new questions just get referred to a previous question and closed as duplicate. The only questions that don't get closed are typically about niche technologies that not a lot of people engage withPeople still have questions and even if it wasn't allowed they could often get some kind of answer from StackOverflow. However, this has changed too. With LLMs, people have a better alternative to get answers to their programming questions, so they will use that instead",

I was even able to ask it, \"why is it bad to use dependency injection in this scenario\" and ChatGPT gave me an explanation of why it's frowned upon in my current situation.If I were to ask those questions on StackOverflow, I'd either have someone say \"read this long document\", have a mod close my question and point to another question that kinda answers my question but doesn't really, or, in the best case scenario, have to wait for someone to answer.

Gave great answers etc, but the candidate gave a terrible impression. One question was to ask about a scenario where how they wanted to handle flagging a certain feature and instead of a typical \"brought it to my manager, gathered some metrics to validate my point, etc\" the candidate said \"I would push it without flagging it to anyone and when it worked I would say I did it\"...which got the candidate disqualified even when they had great system design and coding rounds.Please review how your interview went!

I can’t really help you be more confident but I can tell you that rarely is anyone ever that much smarter than you.

At the end of the day we’re all people with real world problems, families, etc. The smartest people are rarely arrogant about it. Again, I can’t help you be more confident but I’ll give you one piece of advice. Ask yourself what you’re lacking in and become an expert or as close to that as you can. If you find yourself constantly asking domain specific questions, go become the domain expert. Become your own senior dev so you don’t have to go to anyone else and if you absolutely need help on something and they don’t give you clear information don’t be so prideful that you won’t ask for clarification. Nobody knows everything and no one expects you to so swallow the pride and say hey none of that shit made sense to me. In the great words of Micheal Scott, “Explain it to me like I’m 5”.",

If not, if your boss or EM is the kind of person you feel would care, I’d ask them if they’d be willing to pair you with a specific relevant senior person to be your mentor. Or better yet, propose starting a mentorship program yourself!

How do you do that when you don't have a good equation and the people you'd delegate to, don't understand what is being asked of them? Nervous people are not very productive and if you're the cause for people being nervous, you're contributing negatively to the team. Anyways, you can still learn something by just listening to them, going through docs and seeing the code they're writing and trying to understand. It's an uphill battle that way. Or you could simply ignore your nervousness and their nonverbal cues, which isn't gonna be easy either. You could also maybe see if any one of them is a bit more helpful than others and try to block a few minutes every week with them to ask clarifying questions. If you can, I'll say switch company or team. This doesn't sound like a good environment for your growth.",

Send me an IM before coming over asking if i have time to help.

Don’t set the meeting up for 3 minutes in the future… have it be an hour or more in the future and not during lunch hours.Always try to figure out your problem before coming to me. It’s much more enjoyable to hear “I tried these 5 things that didn’t quite work” than having someone try nothing and expect someone else to do everything for them.

So, burnout *is* normally defined as what happens when you're overworked. However, what can happen is that you develop *depression* from not being engaged. Now, this might not be depression in the sense of needing to take meds or seeing a therapist, but it might be \"you're in a situation that is making you depressed and you should change it\", i.e., get a new job.But it might not just be related to the job - it might be that you're depressed which is making it difficult for your job to be engaging.So I would advice you to see a psychiatrist and at least rule that out before you start making major life changes like quitting your job.",

        "body": "Somewhat similar situation here. I graduated in 2023 with an internship that would have transitioned to a full time job making $64,200. I ended up quitting before I went full time because there was no outlook and I was not doing anything that would have improved my chances of moving up the ladder in terms of knowing more advanced software skills. In reality I was more of a Database Administrator working with Content Manager On Demand (CMOD) and using Mainframe. It was demoralizing and NOT what I had envisioned working as a Software Engineer. In fact this company was handing the software projects to Chinese interns who would end up leaving and just go back to China. Huge shame. At the turn of Spring that year I worked at Miller Knoll on the line which was exhausting and difficult. I quit that and then picked up a Gas Station job at Speedway and worked there for 6 months. Remind you this is all while having a Computer Science degree with 4 internships under my belt. I applied to just above 450 or so jobs and would get from those around 12 call backs and only 1 offer. It was demoralizing. By some miracle a company only 5 minutes away from my home called me for an interview through a recruiter and I ended up acquiring the job! I couldn’t be blessed enough. I am learning so much about the ASP.NET ecosystem . The major downside of this job whoever is the pay. I make around $57,000 in Michigan which is considered on the super low side of things. But I feel you in terms of wanting that pay raise and moving up : ( the ladder. I want to gain some more experience after a year or two and try to negotiate a pay raise but if my employer won’t budge then I will probably look around for another position that will pay me more. Don’t give up!",

An interesting product will attract interesting colleagues. Product that is successful makes everything easier, from getting promoted, to having better work life balance, to management supporting what you're doing.I think a big mistake many engineers make is to work on products that are going nowhere, still becoming passionate about them after putting in a lot of effort, and then to be surprised they're getting reassigned with unfinished work still on the table.",

You roll in around 10 am and do standup. Work for an hour then lunch for an hour. You'll stand in line for 30 minutes at a food truck if you don't go before 12. At 1 you'll work for a few hours then go home. Maybe ping pong or something once a week if you have coworkers who are into that and you want to play. That's your day. Somewhere in there you'll go get your free coffee and a banana and think about working at a company that isn't so cheap.As you get promoted, there are more and more meetings with every promotion and you get involved in all kinds of random email/slack threads but you're also expected to get as much coding done as the L4s.Most everything depends on your team and manager. Your manager has a very large role in your happiness and how horrible your deadlines are and your team will make it fun + help you... or they won't and you'll cry yourself to sleep because you can't figure anything out. Difficult to tell you if it will be good or not.You should pick waymo tbh. Amazon's mandatory firing bucket and current layoff outlook has had a corrosive effect on the culture and if you have a good option, you should go there.",

If you reallllyyyy want to start…Read “C How To Program” if your classes are going to be in C/C++, which is pretty standard. Adjust accordingly based on the language you all start in. When you’re done with a base level book in whatever language your courses are in, get a good book on object oriented programming. Having a good knowledge foundation will make projects and your classes ten times easier. If you want that CS internship then you need to be ready to stand out for your school’s career fair. Try doing a project that actually interests you. Maybe try your hand at doing some free work for some family and friends. Above all else it needs to be a tangible thing recruiters can use (Website, App, Twitter Bot, Game, or a physical arduino/raspberry pi project) Most of all, find something you find interesting outside of programming this summer that you can do at school to meet people. Not only will this help you get balance, but you’ll also meet people which can turn into a job. Rock climbing tends to be pretty popular among us CS nerds because it’s basically the same as programming. Suffering through lots of small painful moves to achieve a big thing. :p",

If anyone IS upset, that's a reflection of their toxic viewpoint and not something inherent in the process of switching jobs.Any of these stories where the boss is pissed that you're leaving them high and dry are 100% indications of a toxic work environment, especially if you've raised your career concerns with your boss already (which you should do).",

If pressed for a reason you can generally be truthful though it’s helpful to put a positive spin on things. “I’ve really enjoyed working at X but feel I’ve reached a ceiling. I believe Y will give me room to grow”. If it’s about pay you can be honest about that -> “company y is offering $$$ and I felt I couldn’t pass up that opportunity”.Common reasons you might give that don’t suggest something negative about your experience are: growth opportunities, chance to learn a new domain/technology, compensation. Beyond that don’t worry about it. It’s just business and you can stress how much you enjoyed working at your current place and how you want to keep in touch with your manager.",

I admit, I was resentful about one person who was leaving, but it's because he was a terrible coworker through most of out time working together. But it's his right to try to make the best life possible for himself. Give your employer a proper two weeks notice. If there is some type of crunch or deadline, you can be open-minded about maybe giving them more time. I gave my last employer three weeks notice to help finish off what I was working on. It was a contract position. I don't think the client really cared at the end of the day. The contracting company claims they wanted to stay on good terms, but it might be just because I was staffable, and some of the people at the client liked me. You don't have to tell a company where you are going to, but don't lie and say you're going to stop working. Also, try not to check out during your notice period. Genuinely do knowledge transfer and make things easier for those who will take over your work. There are people who just coast and make things harder for people. It's up to you if you want to be open to them reaching out. I've helped previous employers, but it probably didn't do me much good in the long-term. Some people actually do consulting work for previous employers. Relationships and work relationships are really unpredictable. It can be hard to tell if something will be genuine or not, but maybe that's just me. Don't overthink leaving a job. Yeah, there are times you leaving will put a company in a tough spot, but most companies can work around that. And if they can't, it might be their fault for not planning/staffing to cover those types of situations.",

Tech is a universe of terms and tools so complex and diverse that a person with experience can find one obscure term that they know you won’t easily know and ask you about it. Maybe they didn’t like something about you, or are biased, or looking for something else, and they may be pricks using this technique to pass on to the next. I often use this with candidates that lie over and over, because this allows me to see how far can they lie about something, thus having a non-opinionated reason to fail them; when people are honest and say “I don’t know” it puts them way higher in my approval.",

I was getting feedback pretty regularly that I did well and they decided to go with another candidate whose experience was a better fit. Being a senior engineer, there isn’t a ton of roles available, but I finally passed an interview with a company that has team match, so I was able to wait to find a team for a couple of months. Turns out the wait was worth it because the offer was a bit north of $500k. Good luck u guys !",

Some found renewal by changing environments rather than paths—same role but at a company with better culture fit2. Others discovered they'd outgrown their current role and needed to pivot toward management, architecture, or specialized consulting 3. Many realized they'd been running on external validation rather than intrinsic motivation, and needed to redefine success on their own termsThe fact you're sending out CVs for roles that excite you is a great sign.

But slap \"Systems Engineer,\" \"Infrastructure Engineer,\" or \"Network Engineer\" on the same role, and magically you’re in a higher-paying, more strategic band, even if the work is 80% identical.It’s the corporate equivalent of ordering \"artisanal toast\" at brunch instead of just \"toast.\" Same bread, higher markup.Also, Software Engineering gets the \"entry level\" treatment because the career ladder is longer and often starts right at graduation, while SysAdmin roles usually assume you’ve put in your time climbing out of helpdesk or tech support.TL;DR: Job title inflation is real, and it’s sneakily baked into compensation structures too.

When there are events outside of it, it's not some company wide curated event in disguise to make you work longer hours. I feel the barrier between office life and personal life is much more respected.The other thing I like is the lax dress code. The previous company was very strict about dress code even on casual Fridays which just means you can wear jeans. I can wear anything as long as it's fine in public.Work isn't stressful and as mentally exhausting. Tech may not be the most cutting edge. As I get older, I prefer to work things that won't make me mentally exhausted when I get home. Things did heat up a bit during and after the pandemic, but still comparatively less stressful.Work in many different domains that can be transferable to even non tech jobs.Job security, S tier health benefits, and pension.

Anyone can pick that stuff up, junior or senior, and it doesn't increase your value as an engineer on its own.Your value as an engineer comes from your ability to solve hard, impactful problems of increasing scope, complexity, and ambiguity. Scope has to do with how large a task is and how long it takes. Junior engineers work on small tasks that only take a few days or weeks. Senior engineers work on large multi-month deliverables.Complexity has to do with how tricky the actual task is. I work in video streaming. A junior engineer might work on something like \"fix this tiny bug in the encoding module.\" A senior engineer might work on something like \"design and implement a scalable transcoding pipeline for use case.\"Ambiguity has to do with how well-defined the task is. A junior engineer would work on something that's really obvious, clear, and requires very little clarification. A senior engineer might be given a vague problem statement like \"our video transcode pipeline is too slow. Go fix it.\" or \"We need feature, figure it out.\", and the onus is on them to dissect that request into actionable, concrete technical tasks for the team to work on.The more you focus on these three things, the better an engineer you become.Read [DropBox's technical career guide.](https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/ic1_software_engineer.html) It goes into even more detail than this, at all levels from junior to director.Note that *nothing* in the guide mentions *any* of the things in your post.

I was forced to use Python on the job when our team inherited a codebase in it. What's more important is you used these things on the job.

Definitely the interface definitions, input descriptions, output descriptions, rate limits, error codes, warnings, etc. But the above things I mentioned can help give you peace of mind in case some library doesn’t document an important consideration clearly.

This passion and drive will make you a great engineer IF you can learn where to apply it. You can’t apply it everywhere, especially in a job, because your delivery speed will be slow.2. Accept the fact that software is iterative. As long as it meets the requirements, who says you can’t go back to it later and make it more robust once you have more information?3. It’s possible you’re ready to start specializing in a particular language/stack/domain to limit the scope of what you really need to know. Once you start seeing the same problems/structures over and over again in different contexts, you can get by with educated guesses about internals unless you really need to know how something works to solve a problem. This seems works across languages/stacks as well once you see enough.4. If you start to feel burnt out, take a break if you can and reset. Not worth going over the edge for “perfect” code.5. Remember that if you can learn one thing deeply, you can do it again whenever you need to. Research skills don’t disappear quickly.At the end of the day, you will not have all the requirements up front, so all you can really do is just do it to the best of your ability while trying to account for immediately visible edge cases, see if it solves the problem, and optimize/fix bugs if needed and repeat.",

You have to learn to manage it because it definitely hurt me early in my career even though in the long run it's helped immensely. Sometimes quick, dirty, and not understanding how the sausage is made is ok and you have to accept that. You can't run down every rabbit hole and still make your deadlines. Example: I had dabbled in web frontend for a bit. Understanding JS and react wasn't bad, but we used create-react-app and I decided when I was going to start a new project fresh I was going to do it by hand. A week later after being neck deep in babel and webpack and transpiling I just gave up and realized I bit off more than I could chew and just downloaded create-react-app and got moving. It hurt early in my career because everything was so brand new and I wanted to master it all, but I had projects to do first. Nowadays even when I first saw something like k8s or react, for the most part I understand the context of what came before it and what it's trying to solve so I feel I already kind of understand it before even diving in. The exception here might be AI- I felt like I had a pretty good handle on it up to around 2018, then things seemed to move at light speed- reading some of the latest papers to come out of Anthropic is like reading a foreign language. The key is to know when to dig a little deeper and when to let go. You can't read the full 1000 page manual before starting every time. BUT, if you eventually do read that manual or those docs from end to end you will leap ahead of your peers in time.",

They often were the back end devs with the most issues in their PRs.The bugs that come up in front-end are often unintuitive and caused by multiple small problems adding up. Take the obvious path to matching the design and write it. Then test it out, compare it to the design, find where it doesn’t match, open the dev tools panel, play around with the css inspector to figure out what’s going wrong, make more changes and repeat until it works as expected. Sometimes your design was the problem, sometimes the person before you cut corners so when you implement your changes correctly they break other things. Sometimes there’s some weird inheritance issue or a library you’re using is causing issues.People treat front end like it’s this easy thing and only back end is real work. But front end can be unforgiving, performance is far more of an issue than people think, and the amount of detail you need to pay attention to isn’t small.So seriously just be persistent. If you aren’t good at CSS, it’s not a big topic, spend a week or two working through a course to understand it. After that it’s persistence. I have a terrible memory, I forget CSS properties and what they do all the time, but I’m still the one that gets assigned the weirdest bugs because I don’t let the weirdness get to me, I keep at it until I find the root cause and then look up whatever I need to know.",

You need to go through HR like everybody else. If HR doesn't think you're worth showing to the hiring manager, *then that's the process working as intended.* That's why we pay them.Some people claim they've had success cold messaging, and I'm sure anecdotally it may have worked out for them a handful of times. But it's mostly frowned upon. Why would the fact you cold-emailed me make you a better candidate than someone that followed the very clear instructions we posted about applying online so you go through the system?All that said, it's not like there's much to lose besides your time if you really want to send out cold-email blasts.

Most resumes will never even be looked at by a human, and that’s why people will contact recruiters or hiring managers! They want the human contact and attention in an incredibly competitive market, and it is quite literally their job to interact with candidates. It’s clear though most of them can’t even do their job properly when they constantly ghost candidates and people they even reach out to anywayYou know what’s actually annoying? People who contact random strangers for referrals. At least recruiters and hiring managers are meant to contact these candidates. If said candidate actually writes an interesting email to these people instead of something generic, there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with that. Just solely applying on the career website without any action might not cut it anymore>But it's mostly frowned uponClearly it isn’t if it’s being encouraged by people here and the “Cracking the coding interview” guys.

I'm strictly speaking from the other side of the aisle, about how an already very busy hiring manager usually perceives getting unsolicited emails.You know who's encouraging it here? It's like you said. Applicants (read: desperate new grads). Of course *they're* saying to give it a shot.Try asking an actual hiring manager if they enjoy getting hundreds / thousands of unsolicited emails.The only possible time a HM is going to say it's not a problem is when the scale is low enough it's not taking up any meaningful amount of their time. Like 1 or 2 emails.But if people start taking your advice, that number would sky rocket to literally thousands. They simply don't have the time to sift through a bunch of desperate emails. I get that you don't like that fact, and that you're saying hiring is broken, but it is what it is.But like I said, don't let what I'm saying deter you from trying it yourself. You asked how hiring managers perceive cold emails, I'm letting you know that *in general*, it's not appreciated from the hiring manager side. There's of course exceptions, and if you want to spray & pray go for it. It doesn't matter if you annoy 1000 hiring managers if 1 of them liked the email and gives you a job, right? You do you.",

        "body": "Could this just be you getting bored of your current job?If you've been doing similar stuff for 3 years straight, it's totally normal to start getting bored. And being bored at work could easily make you feel kinda burned out, or lethargic, or like the spark is gone.I resonate with this a lot, because 3 years is about the point where I start getting bored on a team. The easiest way to cure this is to have a candid conversation with your manager, and see if they can either find you some different work, or transfer you onto a different team.Doing that usually reignites the spark for me. The longest I've lasted at one company is a little over 5 years, and the main reason I lasted that long was I switched teams after 3 years. Switching teams gave me a ton of new stuff to learn, it was in an entirely different tech stack, I had to learn all the business knowledge from scratch. It's fun, everything's new again. It's shoving you back into the \"honeymoon stage\".My new grad company was actually great with this. They *encouraged* internal moves at the 2 year mark for all employees. For me specifically it just sorta happened naturally, I worked on 3 different teams across 3.5 years. The only reason I left them was because I wanted to live on the east coast, otherwise I could've stayed there for life. And some of my friends have, I think there's 5 or so people from my new grad cohort that are still at that company, 12 years later.So that's what I'd recommend. See if you can transfer internally, or get a completely new type of work. If you can't, start looking for a new job .See if that fixes things for you. If it doesn't, then maybe you're right, this industry just isn't a good fit for you... but the fact you found your job rewarding *at first* makes me think you're just bored rather than being burnt out of the entire industry.",

You can go on Fiverr and get paid but not enough to live on unless you're lucky or famous. You live in India where 1000 euros or dollars a month is middle class, you can do it.Still probably a bad idea. My hail corporate resume of companies you've heard of looks a whole lot better than a freelancer's taking risks for variable pay, with level of clients and scale of work are beneath my own. Being your own boss is overrated. If you scale up, most businesses fail.>Should I start looking for big companies to work for, to build up reputation? Yes and don't leave. Or learn how to run a business, save up money and make industry contacts and try to start your own consulting firm. In the US, I'd recommend an MBA. You're not the freelancer doing the grunt work, you're the owner or account manager delegating to the grunts and freelancers. Be on the other side of the hustle.>Is it enough to continue building a portfolio with private freelance projectsDon't do that. Every job offer I sign the contract for has a clause that forbids outside work without approval. It's not enough money compared my salary broken down per hour anyway. Stick to work experience. Ask for more work if you want. Just me but I find after a fulltime software job, the last thing I want to do is go home and code more for a hobby or for pay.

This is tough because a lot of the time it will be the staff or principal level people who seem rude on the surface.

You’ll definitely learn more than this as you move along your career but from my personal mistakes I’d say:- You will eventually run into some legacy code that looks horrendous at first. Don’t trash it loudly around the team thinking they will agree and think you’re smart for identifying bad code. You may be missing context on the implementation and possibly be shit talking your colleagues ideas on solving a problem you don’t fully know about. - give yourself an hour or two on trying to figure something out yourself before you ask more senior devs on your team for help- KWYDK (Know What You Don’t Know) when something you don’t know about comes up in a meeting or discussion, note it down to figure out later or ask colleagues. Tackling complex problems becomes easier when you list out specifics that have you confused.- Don’t get too comfortable, everyone is replaceable. Keep your resume up to date and refresh skills when you have down time. - Most people only value in-depth details/explanations in a one on one setting. Discussions with multiple people should be kept as simple as possible. People don’t remember the dev who bored them with endless details on the code constraints that are causing so and so overhead, they remember the dev who broke down the problem into short bullets and had an idea on the next steps in minutes instead of hours.- take a look at some recent PRs or commits your colleagues have made. Observing the changes will help you understand the codebase and what the coding standards might be (ex; some teams are do or die about code readability versus some teams are all about performance)- Keep tabs on how you perform versus the rest of the team. If you notice on average devs on the team are getting multiple features knocked out in the time it takes you to do one, you’ll know you gotta improve. Better to notice the performance gaps yourself before your manager can.- Maintain a good rep with your colleagues and try to be likable. At every job so far, I’ve seen okay devs that are easy to be around go much further in their careers, than the knowledgable 10x dev who is a pain to talk to.",

If you think helping someone else will pay off, go for it.

One things I recommend, is getting a credit card, or two, and calling them every couple of months to ask for a raise in your limit. If push comes to shove and you need money, that gives you access to cash well you sell investments to cover.The biggest hit so far with the economy is that I'm paid a lot less (-20% so far), so it's not that I'm saving more, it's just I earn considerably less because I get paid in stock.

As always with the US, the social services are lacking compared to Europe, though if you get a high paying job with great benefits, that difference is mostly mitigated2. Education in the Boston area is excellent, rivaling the Nordic countries3. Public transit is acceptable but easily the worst out of the 3 cities you’re considering, bike infrastructure kind of sucks, but the city itself is supremely walkable4. Boston is not a late night city, restaurants and bars often close quite early compared to other similar cities5. Most of the neighborhoods in Boston feel meaningfully distinct from one another, it’s something I love about the city but you should definitely shop around for a neighborhood you like before deciding where to live6. Food is good, not great for a city of its size - beer scene is arguably the best in the country though7. Quick access to New York via Amtrak is awesome8. As you noted, Boston is probably the safest major American city and rivals many European cities9. No shade, and I’m obviously biased, but I really prefer New Englanders to other Americans and Northern Europeans. I feel New Englanders are the perfect mix of being pretty friendly and kind without being obnoxious or fake about it10. Speaking of which, New England itself is awesome. Great vacation or long weekend opportunities all over the place for all seasons11. Boston is easily the coldest and hottest/most humid of the cities you’re considering, but it also gets the most sunlight. I prefer Boston winters to Berlin winters even though Berlin doesn’t get as cold12. The rental and buying market in Boston sucks, but I’m not sure it’s better in the other cities you’re considering13. Boston is absolutely the most “European-feeling” of the major American cities, but it’s still definitely an American city at its core.",

Remember that companies have no loyalty to you. Many of them will fire you on a whim regardless. My firm did this in January and people with 10-20 YOE who worked long hours still got laid off. They were loyal but got rewarded with nothing.Keep your head up. Good luck with your new job!",

You're at a new company which you are much more passionate about, your work output will noticeably improve because you won't be checking out, they're bigger and more stable than a startup by the way you've phrased things.Businesses exist to make a profit. We work for them to further our own life goals. Better hours, better pay, more involvement and personal satisfaction? That's a fat W (and now you're not staring down the barrel of being let go for under performance).",

I learned SO MUCH when building a fullstack app using flutter and I would recommend to anyone, I used flutter because I wanted to build fast and get a functioning mvp out, but I also knew react was a big thing so I was like okay I will challenge myself and rewrite my html/css website in react. My point is, use the framework that makes sense for what you’re doing, not for what you think is going to get you hired. At the end of the day, this side project is something you’ll be talking about in a interview; and it would be really impressive if you could explain why you choose one framework over another and what you learned.",
