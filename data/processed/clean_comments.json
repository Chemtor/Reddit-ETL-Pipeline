Jupyter Hub too, you don't need it, it's just a collaboration tool and not sure why it would be recommended to use. Jupyter notebooks yes, but Jupyter Hub? MLFlow makes sense, orchestration is important, and I have never use Feast but I feel this section doesn't tell me what I want to know in this context. You list different AI models, which is also a bit awkward considering how much they change, but why not list ML models like Tensorflow Keras or XGBoost/Catboost? To be even more honest, I don't think your audience will get past the first row of tools. If somebody is looking at this to learn, they'll stop there because why bother with the other tools when AI and vibe coding can do it all?",

Go further into data science to give your dashboards more depth. But for “frontend data engineering”, as i call it, the data is all there, but you’re just finding the data with optimized queries and transforming and loading into a dashboard or whatever. For some, that’s enjoyable. For me, not so much. Then “backend data engineering” is more storage, modeling, and infrastructure. You can def up skill with tools like spark and airflow to automate some of those processes. Those skills def transfer to “backend” data engineering a bit more. Also, use Python.",

You can find software engineers specializing in multiple different specificities but they’re still someone who writes code to solve a problem. Same for DEs: they write code and design systems to solve data problems. Analyzing data and working with business requirements around data systems is also part of it. Creating reports can also be part of it (although that’s more of a data analyst thing in my opinion).Generally you will find multiple different realms of data engineering when looking for jobs. To me it sounds like you need to be more specific with yourself about what exactly it is that you are interested in within DE (is it writing Spark ETL jobs? Is it writing SQL pipelines? Is it working with Kafka/streaming systems?) and then filter your job search based on that.",

Tiny, end-to-end projects teach more than scattered tutorials and double as portfolio pieces. I’ve used dbt for modelling and Terraform for infra, but DreamFactory is what I ended up buying because it spins up secure APIs over my sandbox databases in minutes, freeing hours for study.

We started with accounting data, because it was the cleanest and slowly migrated the data silos into centralized database. If we met any resistance, we told them that if they wanted their data reflected in the monthly report, it had to come from the centralized database. Since the report was highly visible, they had to agree and after some initial growing pains (mostly historical data cleanup and arguments about what to name things), the automation and built in error-checking won people over. I've worked with a lot of organizations since then and most of them don't have the demand or the inter-departmental communication necessary to break down data silos. It sounds good in theory but if the marketing team only cares about marketing data and doesn't mind getting financial data a month late, then why go throught the considerable time and effort to build a third system to combine marketing and financial data? Especially if after the system is created, you have train people on how to use it, how to keep the data clean, and how to maintain the 3rd system.",

Different releaseTimes would tell me to download those datasets.2. Or use getChangedCubeList \\[2\\] to get a list of tables that have changed on a particular day. This way is less efficient as if I miss one day, I have to go through all the days I missed processing. I prefer #1.I can share a Parquet file on my site for this project \\[3\\], with a hash of the file and all versions of a dataset. That way people can just query the Parquet file to get link(s) to where they can download the dataset.For the DGUIDs, I have to be really careful. I don't want to say that I have modified any statistical information, so I have emailed Statistics Canada with the blog post I made, so hopefully they address some of these issues. I could do the fixes on the client-side and call it **backfill-dguid**, so the user is aware they are back-filling the field.**Edit:** For the DGUID I want to experiment with linking to Overture Maps, as they have boundaries on places/divisions. They have something called GERS \\[4\\] that I can link to, that is a stable ID throughout time. Look at the interactive table that I sent you, there's tons of data from outside of Canada, they just have no idea how to link it to statcan data.

So there is a sort of \"compiler\" step that executes on the driver, completely negligible if you are using Spark to its intended use: processing fat data.Now the real question about SQL Vs dataframe is the language you use to define transformations.IMO dataframe is much more modular (can be structured into functions, steps, that can be tested independently), much clearer for defining data pipelines (source to sink order), and have proper syntax highlighting in most scala and python IDEs.It also has the added benefit of integrating better with UDFs, as they can just be the same language functions injected into the DF code.",

In that case we have a lookup table providing all old and new columns name. So I am using PySpark to read existing schema and then generating CTAS SQL by looping thru every column and I am doing that because of the benefit as listed below. When creating a new table from existing table using dataframe write method, it does not copy over the ACLs (at container and blob level). You have to deal with the separately. But with CTAS SQL the case is different, it applies the ACLs from the location of old external table to the location of new external table. That’s awesome.",

Get comfortable packaging Python jobs in containers, wiring them into CI/CD, and writing tests with pytest; that’s the bridge from classic ETL to modern DE. Learn dbt for in-warehouse transforms so you can show you can model data the “analytics” way, and skim Spark only enough to talk partitioning and schema evolution-real heavy lifting there is less common than the hype suggests. Fivetran covers the boring ingestion so you can focus on orchestration; I’ve also kept DreamFactory in the mix when I need instant REST endpoints over old SQL Server tables. With that stack you can pitch yourself as a senior who happens to be deep on Microsoft rather than a mid-level up-skiller. Main point: layer modern tooling on your existing strengths and you’ll stay competitive.",

Yes orchestration like airflow and some knowledge of APIs. I believe you don’t have to be the super expert but knowing how these applications/services work would be a great benefit. Try to avoid buzzwords, HR/recruiter and new shiny tools every 5 mins there’s always going to be something new.

Both of them offer a free account for testing with limitations (Databricks daily limit, Snowflake also limited 30 day trial but you can create a new account later). Databricks notebook / compute environment is very similar to Fabric so that's what I'd recommend.Also pandas isn't really appropriate for any of these environments as it not parallel compute optimised (the whole code ends up running on the driver node). You may end up working with some code some data scientist wrote in pandas but you likely shouldn't be writing it from scratch (although pyspark does have pandas api on spark which is mostly cross compatiable). All of these platforms have a variant of SQL and I've found data teams who migrate from on-prem to cloud tend to prefer using it as they're not as comfortable with python, but you could also familiarise yourself with pyspark which will be relevant for both Databricks and Fabric.For loading data, I would get comfortable with e.g. using spark.read() for either append, overwrite or merge. Beyond reading CSV, look at reading/writing parquet and look at processing e.g. JSON files and handling semi-structured data operations (e.g. exploding on list elements) as you will often need to ingest from APIs with this structure and then flatten it for a reporting requirement.I would also familairise yourself with data platform design patterns, e.g. Databricks medallion architecture. In practice companies will implement it in different ways but it's worth getting comfortable with teminology and how it's generally applied:https://www.databricks.com/glossary/medallion-architecture",

After models are stable, point PowerBI at the warehouse and retire the spreadsheets one by one. Airbyte is fine for extraction later, but don’t let learning a new tool block progress; the first victory is seeing yesterday’s data appear without manual clicks. For orchestration, Prefect is lightweight and fits your Python skills-start with a single flow and add tasks as needs grow.

BigQuery, airbyte, dbt and prefect as orchestrator.Honestly, SQL Server already has everything you need out-of-the-box that you probably don't need any of these additional tools. It would just be extra tooling you'd be learning for no gain, for your use case. They're fine tools for other situations, but it's very likely you can accomplish everything you need already using using just the features of SQL Server.Personally, I'd prefer to get everything to one server which you can do pretty simply with either Replication or Log Shipping (though there's other options too). And for any large tables that you'll be running OLAP against, you could try columnstore indexing to satisfy your query performance needs. Indexed Views, Filtered Indexes, and Partitioning are some other out-of-the-box features that can help you with performance and data management as well.I say this as someone who ran OLTP and OLAP against the same SQL Server databases, that had tables which individually had 10s of billions of rows and multi-terabytes of data, on minimally provisioned hardware (8 GB of Memory and 4 CPUs), and most queries ran in sub-second time.",

Once that slice feels solid, adding purchase or inventory tables becomes copy-paste instead of redesign. Airbyte’s plug-and-play extractor will get the first two tables moving, Fivetran could handle the ERP later, but DreamFactory still helps me expose a couple oddball legacy views over REST without extra drivers. Keeping scope to two tables forces me to learn the full path and keeps rework cheap-exactly what I need right now. Vertical slices first so I can learn fast without drowning in scope.",

        "body": "There's a lot of good questions here to unpack. I work in this area, so I can give you an overview.**What is real time? Is near-real time enough? (tldr; question)**This is defined differently for different use cases and there isn't one definition for this. For example, the definition of real-time is different for real-time operating systems (think RTOS) or high-freuquency trading (they literally measure cable lengths to minimize propagation delays) and other use cases. For data engineering, \"real-time\" rarely means milliseconds in my experience, but is very often seconds and even minutes, depending who in the org-chart you talk to. That said, a lot of large-scale compute workloads we see often do end up in the milliseconds. The most common place I see those is in the security space, but their setups don't resemble a typical data engineering environment. Instead of CDC, Kafka, warehouses and ETL jobs, you will see transactional workloads, APIs, and processes directly talking to one another over HTTP.**Complex transformations (2)**It's historically been pretty hard to pull off but that's changing. The foundational work/papers to do this at scale is fairly recent (I'd say, last 2-3 years), so it's not surprising you haven't seen off-the-shelf solutions here that live up to the promises.Fundamentally, to compute in real-time, you need to be able to compute \"incrementally\". That is, update views over your data in real-time by only observing how the input tables \"change\" (inserts/updates/deletes). No batch engine (like the ones you mention, Trino, Spark etc) can achieve this, because they are designed from the ground up to recompute queries from scratch, which gets slower as the data size increases.For an actual incremental engine, I encourage you to give [Feldera](https://github.com/feldera/feldera) a spin (disclaimer: I work there). It let's you define pipelines as tables and deeply nested views in SQL. When the tables \"change\" (get inserts/updates/deletes), the views are updated incrementally. The guarantee is that the amount of work a pipeline does is proportional to the size of the changes, not the size of the overall data. It's main strength is that it can do such incremental evaluation for **arbitrarily complex SQL, including recursion**, not just simple queries (as you seem to have noted about alternatives).What this means is that pipelines do so little work per event, that it routinely hits the millisecond timescales in real-world workloads (users have even reported 4ms latencies to keep views over terabytes of data, with low tens of milliseconds being more common). Of course, it depends on the queries, the arrival rates and what not. But we do see users run some beastly pipelines that update at sub-second speeds over billions of rows (think 10K line Spark SQL code, with 100s of joins, distincts, aggregates, and what not).**Infra bottlenecks and processing delays (1, 3)**You are spot on here, but not due to actual hardware issues (modern hardware is ridiculously fast and if anything, most software and cloud infra sucks at taking advantage of them). NVMe storage and modern CPUs can pack quite the punch.When it comes to building real-time systems **end-to-end** however, you might still end up in the seconds to minutes range, even if the analytics/compute side is instanteous. This is because most data stores and plumbing infra aren't built for high volume real-time ingest (i.e., they cannot handle inserts/updates/deletes to data).For example, if further downstream of Feldera, you want to serve the results off of something like Delta Lake, you have to incur the additional latency from having to run Delta Table merges before you can serve this data. We have (painfully) seen pipelines update complex views in milliseconds only for things like Delta Lake and Kafka to add another minute afterwards. There are of course ways to architect around it, but it does take a lot of custom systems work (see the security industry context I mentioned earlier).**Hype vs reality (5)**There is a tremendous amount of hype and marketing here. Don't believe any vendor (including me :)) -- reality about this space is that it is quite nascent, and whether you can hit the right operating points around scale/latency/throughput does depend on your workload and the laws of computational complexity at play. Throw your worst queries and most challenging use cases at them before you make a decision, rather than believe any hype.",

Most reporting & dashboards can be 5-30 minutes old with minimal impact. And 5-15 minute latencies allow you to do all the same stuff you would do with a daily process. Works great.

It’s Python-native, super easy to use, and you can run flows without a server (just as a script with scheduling).Also, Dagster has a dev-friendly local mode. But if you want to stick closer to a library-only feel, Prefect or even Dask might be your sweet spot. Basically, Airflow is great at scale, but for simple DAGs + cron, lighter tools make life way easier.",

Depends on what your database is of course. if using BigQuery Composer is the obvious choise and if you're using Redshift (please dont) or Snowflake (in aws) then AWS MWAA is good options.Other alternatives I've run in to and feel comfortable speaking about:\\* Luigi - basically airflow light, developed and mostly abandoned by Spotify. I think this is the closest to what you're asking, but will most likely be dissapointed in the lack of functionality.\\* Dagster - great if you're only doing \"ETL\" but the whole premise is kind of that every task that runs is a table in your database... not great for doing more general things even if it is \"doable\".\\* Cron - just schedule with cron, what could possibly go wrong? except loads of functionality for retry/error handling and stuff\\* Windows Task Manager - (yea not kidding) better than Cron, but worse than any other option. Going completely \"off script\" you could also just run DBT. We did investigate the concept of using DBT's \"Python Models\" to run arbitrary python code that would pull in data from different sources. But in the end settled for just using DBT for transforming data that's already in the DWH and using Airflow (MWAA) to run python ingestion scripts and to then also run DBT.",

From a realism standpoint I want automated lineage tied to a catalog of your data assets and documentation on what the target should be (i.e. requirements, tickets, etc). If you know what the answer should be, you can see what's in the source so your job is to figure out the rest. You do that by asking questions, looking at source documentation and coming to understand what you are looking at in the data. Like if you can't look at a table called t\\_products and figure out which column is likely the product code then you are going to have a hard time. There will definitely be a ramp up time no matter how experienced the new developer is, but the resources consumed for you to figure stuff out is still likely much less than if the entire group is required to document everything they do such that anyone could understand it all.",

Our golang devs were shocked when compressed XML-based GML over REST trounced serialized avro over REST and flatgeobuf protobuf over gRPC in performance testbeds. They expected nothing to touch protobuf over gRPC, much less have xml over rest beat it so badly. (It's because GML is so highly optimized from years of experience, while flatgeobuf is still hampered by basically having to transmit the entire range of geospatial object attributes for every feature still to function as WFS, even as gRPC.)",

I work in sports and somewhat regularly I have to join sources from different organizations who have different conventions, and may not be internally consistent, about how to write player names. Does Jr. have a period? Do players that are the third get the roman numeral? Is it Tank Bigsby or Cartavious Bigsby? How do you handle different players with the same name? Typically organizations will have their own player ID keys, but unless you already have the mapping figured out, someone else's keys aren't helpful, and there's a new batch of rookies every year. So you end up with waterfall fuzzy matching logic which always has to end with some hard-coded exceptions that need to be regularly added to. This can happen with team names and abbreviations too - don't get me started on college football.Also timestamps. On an almost daily basis I need to select games on a particular day (in north america) via a UTC timestamp, which makes evening games look like they're on the following day if you just extract the date without converting the time zone.",

Some other comments here have covered it -- matching things by name or by address, rather than by concrete id values.Not only does it need a variety of fuzzy matching approaches, it also requires domain knowledge to understand what types of fuzzing can be used rather than just plain string distance. You want to know how to parse things like addresses or names into components, with different rules for different types of addresses/names. You want to figure out which aspects can be ignored or moved around, or can have specific changes.Even when you have it working well, it is still only 90%, and the last of it is always a continuous manual process of fixing things that didn't quite work, and your rule set just can't handle the subtleties that a person can manually implement.A great annoyance is the business looks at it and thinks 'this is easy for me to figure out, why can't you just write an algo for it? it should be easy' - not understanding how trying to implement all the nuance of human understanding is impossible.

The fundamentals, however, change very little—unless there’s a true paradigm shift.

This is definitely a very sensitive area and I think you are correct for erring on side of caution, since exfiltration or \"data leak\" risks could carry extreme repetitional risks for your company. Here are my general thoughts:- There are many procedures which do require PII. I won't get into them here, but say for instance Fuzzy Matching is involved. Sometimes the fraud team will keep these secret since if folks were aware of the nature of the detection analytics they could circumvent them. I'm referring to sophisticated stuff you can't really do this in PowerBI, not basic calculations or lookups. - If this access is absolutely necessary, the fraud team should make every effort to limit who on their team can view the data, they should have procedures for granting access, and document who has access and who approved it, ie I wouldn't advise a \"free-for-all\" but I would be pretty upset if PII was restricted. - I had access because I was one of the 'trusted few' at the company. I was maybe one of 10~ employees out of 100k employees who had the level of access needed to conduct this work, the others being legal, the CEO, CFO, etc. There were maybe 50+ other folks in my org, but the PII was masked for the rest of the employees. They could download aggregated statistics from dashboards, but not the PII or row-level data. - You may want to involve in-house Legal. Anytime I granted access to the raw PII data, we involved legal. - There are excel-level controls, like encryption and security, you can tell the team must be enabled anytime they send an email - we did this as a policy. There's no real way to enforce it, but we'd always encrypt the emails and the excel file if we ever shared it. - On that note, aren't there controls in your company which monitor the sending & sharing of Excel documents? ie if it is ever exported to a flash drive or printed? - Speculating here - I think Microsoft has a data governance tool, Purview, which might detect things like PII containing columns and restrict the sharing of the excel report? Might want to look into that. I briefly used it but can't speak to its applicability or effectiveness in this situation. Just my thoughts - could also maybe learn from them exactly what procedures they need to do in excel and see if you can design queries to handle it? I could see the financial industry being a bit more sensitive than where I worked so, these controls might not be enough.",

Row-level policies masked PANs to last-4 unless the user had the fraud role, and even they got an auto-expire token after 24 h. Every extract got watermarked with the ticket number so leaks were traceable.If your stack is mostly Databricks, hook the VDI to Delta Sharing or Power Query so analysts still build pivots. For quick looks, spin up a Squirrel SQL style web viewer that limits results to 10 k rows.I’ve tried Immuta and Privacera, but DreamFactory slots in nicely when you need to expose just a few masked endpoints to vendors without opening the whole lake.The safest move is to isolate Excel in a monitored sandbox instead of banning it.",

For uncached ad-hoc queries, set a hard timeout and ask clients to batch. If you really want to squeeze the VPS, move the Parquet layer to a Trino or DuckDB service and only ingest the hot partitions into Postgres nightly; that keeps storage and vacuum overhead low. I kicked the tires on Hasura and Postgraphile, but DreamFactory ended up easiest when I needed a quick autogen REST layer with per-key RBAC. Finally, measure disk random read before anything else-IOPS is what will bite you way before CPU or memory. Cheapest path is well-tuned Postgres plus aggressive caching.",

Think about how you’ll schedule heavy transforms-NiFi processors can choke when one flow gets huge; a dedicated orchestrator like Dagster or Airflow plays nicer with version control and CI. I’ve kicked the tires on Airbyte and Meltano for moving data, but DreamFactory was handy when I just needed quick REST endpoints on top of Postgres so front-end folks could grab data without touching the warehouse.

I don't really recommend it for most use cases. Connections and editing in Grafana is a simpler experience but it has its own annoying quirks (the plotting UX is underwhelming and has weird data transform abstractions that I find myself fighting with rather than enjoying) and it's generally not as flexible as I would like it to be. I don't use any of the advanced alerting features. I'd like to, but I haven't figured them out yet. My favorite part of Grafana is the units and formatting support, it really is nice and convenient. It's not great, but it's better than superset.NiFi gets a lot of hate, but I am a firm believer in \"there's a time and place for every tool\". The time and place that NiFi was developed for was the NSA. A lot of the stuff that it was good at was classified and got dropped when it was published. Now, Nifi is good for moving data around from point to point, not data transformations. You'll want something else for more advanced data transformation, such as something with real scripting language support (nifi's code editor sucks ass. Basic user interface tasks are also hidden behind different context menus and it's a pain to use, generally. The JOLT processor advanced interface is pretty good though). It is however an okay tool for setting up long-running batch processing jobs from your database to something else where you want to have visual feedback. I set up a number of web scraping flows with it (not really a good use case) and I'm looking to migrate to something that sucks less.Dagster and Airflow are the NiFi alternatives you'll want to consider.

Follow up with a dbt rewrite; the model tests catch bad assumptions you didn’t realise you made. Drill the planner-explain analyze will teach you more about skew than any blog post. When stuck, screenshot the plan and compare it to the Spark DAG; patterns start to click. Keep a scratch sheet of oddball functions (lateral, array\\_agg, conditional windows) and fold one into every practice query so it sticks.

Manual adjustments for reporting made to separate tables and \"rolled up\" in the BI solution.Through integration with Power Apps, Power Automate, and third-party solutions these have been available in Power BI for a long time.

What they CAN do is update a SQL database such as those you can create in Fabric (if enabled) which Power BI can connect to using direct query mode. They can also update a CRM through its API endpoints, but that's not too different from doing so in any other CRUD apps, and your average analyst won't have the necessary permissions nor skill to handle authentication to use those endpoints.In a larger context, the unmet need this feature is trying to solve is a common one: analysts often get asked if they can add some kind of write-back to their reports, such as documenting decisions, comments, events. If you end up working somewhere that has such a need and that extensively uses Power BI and Fabric, using these can be a great quick solution for enforcing clean data entry without having to build a full CRUD app, and it clearly beats using spreadsheets with no data validation for inputs.",

A Master’s can help, but only if it’s paired with project experience and real-world tools - that’s what hiring managers care about most.One option before jumping into a full MS is to build a public portfolio using tools like Datalayer, which gives you a Jupyter-style environment (with Claude and agent support) that’s great for building dashboards, pipelines, and ML experiments in one place. It’s also resume-friendly and much cheaper than tuition.If you're leaning toward school, look for programs with strong co-op/internship pipelines (like Northeastern, Georgia Tech’s OMSA, or UCSD’s MAS Data Science). But even short-term certs + a strong project repo can sometimes land you the job faster.P.S Have some blogs and github links around Jupyter (MCP and AI Agents) use cases.

That’s why Spark (that originally was meant for parallel processing) usually goes along with Hadoop File System (HDFS).With this setup you can simply pick a CSV file, manipulate with Sprk, and then store in another location.Now let's complicate a little bit the situation: for example you can still store records as CSV table but want to enforce a schema, in this case you can spin up a Spark cluster with Hive Metastore (it’s just an external small database to store metadata of your tables). This allows you for partitioning, clustering, grant RBAC, ...In the last 20 years more complicated file types have been enforced in data engineering, like Parquet (think of it as a self describing CSV which has an header with column names and data type) and Iceberg.I don't know if this answer your question but to recap basically you need to combine a query engine with a metadatastore to have a complete database/datawarehouse otherwise you can only transform data from point A to point B.",

Either will implicitly create non-existing targets.For pure DDL operations (just creating a table, not writing any data), if you're using the SQL API then `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` [is available](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-ref-syntax-ddl-create-table-datasource.html).> can add some parameters to your query to do it ?Yes. Notebook widgets (not advised, notebooks are poor code artefacts), script or function arguments. But you may want to pin this to the runtime state (or lack of) of the target table, a config value, or some combination of these.Typically what Spark code for data warehousing \"looks like\" is some sort of workflow orchestration using a DAG, in something like Luigi/Airflow/Dagster (and/or dbt), which will invoke stuff (scripts, notebooks, dbt runs) as needed and with the required parameters.You can totally run dbt against Spark, the connector is [officially supported](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/connect-data-platform/spark-setup).",

Also building custom APIs means you need a pretty experienced BI people, cause integrating that into the tools is always harder than use the default connectors. On top of that if you do any ETL with whatever BI tool you use, you get sort of vendor locked, cause it's hard to switch (and Tableau for example is looking worse every year).DW should be aggregating data, not be a one to one copy of production systems.

        "body": "> do modern BI systems need an analytics DatabaseTechnically no, in practice yes. The reason is that productive systems like ERP are built for recording transaction data, i.e. a fine-grained log of events and facts. Technically this translates into lots of short-lived requests to the system, e.g. \"store this order\", \"lookup this invoice\" etc. That is, the system load per request is low. This is different for analysis oriented queries, where we typically want to show aggregate results, e.g. \"order volume in the last 3 months, grouped by product / region / customer segment\" or \"show all customers who's order volume over the last 3 months is less than their average over the previous 12 months\".These aggregated queries require a different data model, at least a different set of indexes v.v. the data model for the transaction system, aka operational database. Of course it's technically possibly to run these aggregate queries against the operational database directly, however it will strain its resources and potentially result in bad performance for end users.Another aspect to consider is that the data needed to answer these kind of queries often span multiple systems, e.g. orders are tracked in one system, invoices in another. That is, we have to combine data from different systems, which is notoriously difficult (as in requires dedicated effort) unless there is an infrastructure that supports it.With this in mind, it is easier to build a seperate database that is optimized for aggregate queries, and does not interfere with the operational database.Regarding the argument against storing data multiple times: That's a very common objection and it sounds logical. You don't want arbitrary copies of data stored just about everywhere - that's a valid concern. However, the need to serve analytics demands are equally valid, and following the above line of argument, they require a different technical setup. So there's a trade-off between avoiding data duplication, and the need to have well-performing systems for both operational and analytics needs.They key is to build the analytics database (whatever you call it) by a controlled and managed process, that is the data is not stored arbitrarily, but the process is designed to keep the data up to date, the purpose of the duplication is to serve analytics needs, and there is ownership assigned.",

You also have the option of creating an index on the staging table before the merge, which could help that process.Breaking it up into two steps also means that once the data is uploaded, you don't need to run your local compute process anymore, and you aren't susceptible to the process failing if you have issues with your local processing, the network connection, or the merge. It is generally just more stable, and if it has an error you have a definite point the error occurred, and since the target table merge can be a single transaction, it is easy to rollback anything critical.Having your local data processing engine do a direct upload to a table lets it use whatever optimisations it has for the connection. If it has specific support for your database, it may make use of bulk operations in some way to speed up the process.Or, if you have a separate tool for bulk uploads, you write the data locally in a format suitable for that, push to a staging table with that tool, then merge with a database script or procedure.SQLAlchemy may be able to help with the database SQL script to integrate from the staging table to the target table.",

Once the process is on paper,  you can pass off the authority to do it and retain the responsibility for its outcome by asking to look it over before delivery. This should clear up some of your time week to week to begin to document more of your job and pass more of it off to others. The only way to improve your bus factor is to remove your hands from the critical path.",

For example, say there's a new cost field - how do you know that some of your existing costs aren't now being split between an existing field and this new one? And of course, how will your code even know it's a cost field?Here's another example, say there's a string field - your code won't know if it requires an adjustment to some of your business logic. Maybe it indicates a cost type?So, if data quality matters, then it's best to have a data contract, and when the upstream system makes changes to that contract then you coordinate with them.Meanwhile, you can compare every record to the data contract to ensure that every row complies and you don't have any unapproved schema drift.",

All streaming pipelines serialize to Protobuf2. All Protobuf schemas are shared via a monorepoCombined you get quite a strong consistency model for data interaction at the streaming level. Protobuf is backwards/forwards compatible, and it doesn't care about the field name only its integer ID. That solves 99% of the data interaction mismatches.Having said that you're still ultimately persisting to a database somewhere, and that part will require an unavoidable migration. This is where the hack-ish solutions are usually found. Usually here you either go with the slow-but-safe versioning approach or with a simpler 'all downstream services upgrade simultaneously' one. Or just don't rename a field unless there's a strong business requirement. Pick your poison.EDIT: there is actually a cleaner option for column renaming in *some* databases, though I personally haven't used it. You could create a new column that defaults to values from the old one. For example in ClickHouse you could do this: CREATE TABLE example ( old_name String, new_name String DEFAULT old_name ) This effectively creates an alias for the same field (at the cost of duplicated storage), and you can then slowly deprecate the old field at your leisure. The caveat being that inserts into the new column won't be visible in the old one. I don't necessarily recommend going this route, but it would prevent going down the versioning rabbit-hole.",

Even something lightweight like duckdb or a cloud based pgsql could work, especially if you’re layering a BI tool or dashboarding solution on top. But that does add more setup and ongoing maintenance.If not, and you’re mainly just showing charts or summaries from selected batches, then pandas might honestly be enough. You could just scan the folder, load only what’s needed based on the user’s selection, and cache results to keep things snappy. That keeps things simple and flexible, especially if your files aren’t massive.If I were you I would first answer these questions:- How big are the csv files, roughly? A few MBs or closer to GBs?- Are the column structures consistent across files, or do they change?- Does anyone on your team need to explore the raw data themselves, or are you the one curating all the views?- How often is new data added to the data lake?- Are there any heavy computations or aggregations you’re doing often that would benefit from SQL?And then, Once you know the answers to those, it’ll be a lot easier to decide if you need a proper database layer or if a well organised pandas workflow can get the job done.",

Drop the CSVs into a partitioned parquet or iceberg layout so each batch lives in its own folder; Streamlit can then pull just the files for the selected batch with polars/pyarrow, which loads way faster than spinning up DuckDB every click. Cache the converted parquet once at ingest, store minimal metadata (batchid, path, row count) in a tiny SQLite file so you can list options instantly, and use Streamlit’s st.cachedata to avoid rereading the same files. When the data volume finally outgrows laptop RAM, you can point the same parquet set at a warehouse like Snowflake without rewriting code. I’ve used dbt for model builds and Superset for dashboards, while DreamFactory sat in front to expose quick REST endpoints for the same parquet files when we needed them in other services. Stay on files for now and only jump to a real DB when scale forces it.",

Azure Functions’ HTTP trigger can sit in the same resource group, talk to Postgres via psycopg or pgx, and costs almost nothing at your traffic scale; just wire up five functions (list, get, insert, update, delete) and use managed identity so you never store creds. If you’d rather avoid code, point PostgREST at the database: views become endpoints, row-level security handles auth, and you deploy a single container. Supabase is basically PostgREST plus auth and storage if you need hosted options. I’ve tried PostgREST and Azure Functions, but DreamFactory is what I ended up buying because it handed me locked-down endpoints and swagger docs in under an hour. For this scope, serverless or generated APIs keep your stack light.",

All the time.> that I won't get a ultra fat comp since this is contract and without the bonus that full-time get it's not gonna be a crazy numberThis is ass-backwards. As a contractor, you have to pay the employer component of a number of taxes and other contributions, see below.Unlike full time employees, you are also taking on the significant risk of your contact not getting renewed at the drop of a hat. Contractors are always cut first when projects are completed or budgets get tight. Btw once there, don't let them death-march you to the finish line while only paying 40 hours per week with a promise that \"it gets better when we're done\". They will cut you off without remorse, I've seen it myself. That risk needs to get paid to reimburse you for any gaps between contracts spent looking for a new one.All this to say it is customary for contractors  to charge significantly more per hour than a full time employee, between 50% and 100% more.This recruiter is trying to pull a fast one on you because they sensed your lack of knowledge. Consider yourself informed, and use chat gpt to give you a professional phrase to let them know that you are aware that they are full of shit. Read below for details, and Google for employee vs contractor tax calculators to work out what your break even rate should be.https://accountinginsights.org/irs-worker-classification-employee-vs-contractor/",

It's very simple to learn: data exists somewhere, we extract it, we do things with it. But there are 1000s of ways of doing this.Sometimes even the engineers themselves are unable to explain how data hops from place to place, or why. I've found doing 'walk-throughs' of the data pipeline to be incredibly valuable, and they are easier to understand when someone sketches it out by hand on a white board or paper instead of just pulling up random scripts and expecting you to understand code with zero context. And, in general in the corporate world, always assume that every single person you're going to talk to is a horrible teacher, gives you no context that you need, or does not understand the context you're missing.For example, your first day you may sit down with someone and they will say \"we take data for daily crude futures, run it through our model, and load it into this report\" or whatever.They will not explain why they are doing that. They might just assume you know what a \"crude future is\", how it helps the firm, why the data needs to be prepared a certain way, why they look at things with one language vs the other, etc.Worse, maybe they won't teach you at all. Maybe they know you don't know any of this stuff, and will not want to spend time teaching you.One piece of knowledge or behavior you learn this year, when you're young, compounds for decades, so it is incredibly important and valuable for you to maximize the amount you learn. You do this by being annoying sometimes and asking dumb questions.Very, very often interns are terrified to ask questions, so, they often do narrowly-scoped tasks and never understand what it is or why they are doing it.A healthier approach is to adopt the opposite mindset: be terrified of NOT asking questions. Anytime you feel the 'feeling' of confusion, it's a very good thing, embrace confusion, become addicted to it, since that feeling is actually your brain learning.Not being confused is a bad thing, it means you're overconfident, which will make you very dumb over time.",

The merge key column is null fir these. Then I merge and update based on merge key = primary key and update the end date to close the old record and on the insert clause I insert everything from the second set.  This includes records with new keys and the latest version of records with existing keys.  So when the merge key is matched then update and when it's null then insert.  You build the rows you want to insert and update in the selects in using clause.  Hope that makes sense.",

I think the thing I'm struggling with is, with the first table with 5 stages, given 3 lines of revenue, it's hard to work out what the value of each row should be, because the inputs don't directly correlate to the outputs. If someone else has got that right, I'd be happy to learn that approach too",

Here i would use dlt because i work there. 2. see if you can generalise the cleanup - if yes, then you probably will have an easier time to write some cleanup methods and reuse them before loading the data, while you are still in python 3. If you already loaded the data then generalising will be hard since you cannot programatically apply rules to columns anymore (unless you go back out of sql and generate the sql).

Retain the original address string, regex the zipcode out (there's probably one some mad bastard wrote out there) into the zipcode column, take the rest of the string and dump it out into the street address column. You now have three columns: `original_address`, `street_address`, `zip_code`. Layer on top of that with more lookups for cities if you want.The most advanced thing you can do is pay for an address API which will take your address as a string and then return where it thinks it is along with a confidence value.

Even with these instructions and all necessary context, LLM may fail to generate response you expect for questions like this.This may sound a bit weird, but if you have limited number of questions like this, it makes sense to prepare a report (pivot table?) that answers on the question *precisely*. If you want to encourage end users to ask their own questions - which means creation of their own new reports - first of all you need to configure a data model (cube?) that contains all necessary dimensions and measures needed to answer on these questions.Taking into account *realistic* capabilities of modern LLMs, it makes sense to offer end users 2 kinds of prompts:* \"Ask question\" in the context of the concrete data model (facts + dimensions). LLM gets in the context lists of the available dimensions, measures, filters + instructions and maybe even low-cardinality dimension values. Result is a tabular report configuration (pivot table or flat table) with filters, which can answer on user's question.* \"Ask question\" in the context of the concrete report data. LLM gets in the context report's table data (which is reasonably sized and not is too large for LLMs context window), possibly with supporting instructions. This is a kind of assistance with data interpretation, instead of analyzing values in table users can simply ask smth like \"what is the best client by premium\" - and get an answer if this report has calculated premium values by clients.Technically, with tools calling these 2 steps may be combined (LLM can compose a report, then load report's data, and give an answer), however this significantly increases a risk of wrong numbers in LLM response. In BI it is very important to get *right* numbers (not just maybe-yes-maybe-no numbers), so it is better to offer simpler but more reliable LLM-based functions.This is how we implemented LLM-based functions into our BI tool recently, based on feedback from real users.

        "body": "When you're running commands on a CLI, there are actually two\\* different pieces of software running. The \"terminal\" (or terminal emulator/tty/console) is the actual thing that you see on your screen that you can click and type in, and see characters on. Underneath that is the \"shell,\" which is software that knows how to take character sequences and interpret it as commands, and can then run those commands. If you type \"ls\" and hit enter, the terminal is what shows you what you just typed and the results, while the shell is the thing that was able to locate the \"ls\" command and run it. You can interchangeably use any terminal (e.g. iterm, konsole, ptyxis, ghostty, kitty) with any shell (e.g. sh, bash, fish, zsh, nushell).SSH, \"Secure SHell,\" is an encrypted server-client protocol for communicating with a shell on another machine. You still use the same terminal emulator locally, you still type in your commands and see the results. But behind that, instead of calling to a shell that's running on your machine (accessing your files, running your binaries, etc), you're sending all your keystrokes over the network to another box that has an SSH server running (called sshd). Then that SSH server acts sort-of like the terminal on that remote box, passing those keystrokes to the shell, which then runs commands on that machine (with their files, binaries, etc) and gives back the results.When devs say SSHing to another server, they really mean interacting with a shell\\*\\* on that server, from the comfort of their machine.\\* I'm simplifying a bit. Details @ [https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/](https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/) \\*\\* Well, really SSH supports arbitrary data transfer. You can do port tunneling, send files over it (it's the default backend for scp and rsync), run GUIs remotely over a desktop gateway, whatever. But usually people don't call it \"SSHing\" in these other cases.",

(google rock paper scissors, lizard, spock). then work through your code and see if you can make most of your code not care about which ruleset is used, and only the bits of code that need to print, process user input or select an AI move should be aware of it.none of these things are needed, your code runs. But these sort of things can be fun things to add to your code so you can make it more complicated. (which means you can learn from it)",

I particular like that you didn't fall into the trap that I see a lot of new programmers fall into where they list out _every_ possibility in 9 separate different `if` branches.

If you have a check to see if user loses, and a check to see if user ties, and _neither of those passes_, then the user can _only_ have won!Have you heard of something called a Python Dictionary? It looks a little something like this:```my_dict = { some_property: 'some value' }```The cool part is that you can access properties in that dictionary just like in an array: `printf(f\" {my_dict[some_property]}\") # \"some value\"`. If you make a dictionary of one of the non-tie options (i.e., either win or lose), can you think of a way to make the logic of your RPS even simpler?",

My favorite was modelling the \"sick hobbits\" problem: \"There are 1000 hobbits on an island. X hobbits begin 'sick'. Each day, any healthy hobbit travels to visit another hobbit. If a healthy hobbit visits a sick hobbit, the healthy hobbit becomes sick. At the end of the day, all sick hobbits are removed. On average, how many hobbits will become sick? On average, how long will the contagion last, how many days?\"Once implemented, then vary it up by changing how many hobbits are visited per day, how long the sick hobbits stay around (maybe more than one day). This type of problem is good for learning because the code for it is just a page or two.Building programs into projects is another skill in of itself. To do projects, you need to start worrying about system design, modularity, testing, and more advanced debugging. So, start with something a lot smaller so you can get syntax, data structures, and control flow statements down. Then move on to larger projects where you'll then need to train additional skills. The issue with projects is that you're being forced to learn too much all at once, I suspect a person would feel completely lost.I'll hate to mention, but the 'easy' leetcode problems are generally good for learning programming language syntax and basics (again, the basics are syntax, control flow, and data structures). I busted leetcode out recently to help learn Python. I don't think leetcode easy problems are necessarily the best or the most interesting; but if you can't find or come up with similar problems to the 'hobbits' problem above, then leetcode could have some decent ones for training/learning.",

Companies had rooms full of manuals, and you had to look up, or photocopy, or buy your own documentation to know the api, usage etc.Then HTML arrived, actually IBM had another online format, but very similar just before html. At any rate, people who used the online documentation were more productive than those still reliant on paper, the change happened and today no one even considers having a paper copy of documentation (seldom anyway). The old guys were like \"What you can't remember that api?\". They were soon out-produced by the newer guys.Next came stack overflow, and other question / answer assists, and productivity increased for those that used it. Soon, it was required knowledge if you wanted to be competitive. Again, old mentality guys said \"You don't already know that? You have to look it up?\". Again, outdistanced soon.I'm sure you get the pattern. AI is the next documentation tool. This time the \"example\" code it provides is even closer to what you need. It's not right, often, but it's close, and sometimes it has an approach you had not even considered. The nay-sayers will be left behind again. Use the tools, use the technology. Give yourself every advantage you can find, it's not lazy, it's not being ignorant, it's progress. In 50 years of programming, it's always been this way. You either keep up, or you become unmarketable.You still have to learn more on your own, but boring api, or programming patterns is not where you win. Learn the theory, WHY is this way better than that. What is the benefit of this way or that way, and the chat bots can help with this learning too. That's where you will outshine your competition.",

When I see \"Agree\" or \"Disagree\", but they make similar points, then they have a different understanding of what they thought OP said.OK, so I'll start. I think OP believes learning a bunch of languages just to learn them is not good, at least, not at the start. Instead, pick a language, and begin solving problems, and not just learning how to write \"Hello, World\" in a dozen languages. OP did suggest that learning new languages didn't teach him more than Javascript did, but he admits that maybe some of that was failing to take a deeper dive in any of the languages.I don't think OP is saying every language is the same, but if s/he is saying that, I disagree.As an analogy, this is like saying, what's important about learning a spoken language is what you want to talk about, i.e., the ideas, and not the words you use (which depend on language), and yet, you can be well spoken in English and don't know how to say the same thoughts in another language.Why is it challenging? Natural languages like French or Japanese have a huge vocabulary compared to the syntax of a language. In particular, verb tenses are tricky for most. On top of that is learning the grammar, Is it subject-verb-object? Also, pronouncing words is really hard. Many non-Chinese speakers struggle with the tones in Chinese (assuming they don't also speak a tonal languages). On top of that, there are cultural differences, slang, whether to speak in complete sentences or to drop certain words, etc.Programming languages don't have that complexity. But to say they are all the same is also wrong. For example, if you know Javascript well, but tried to learn Prolog, you'd struggle trying to find equivalent concepts. Prolog is that different from Javascript.Having said that, I generally agree with the basic premise which is learn a language well enough to solve problems. Don't learn a bunch of languages early on, esp. superficially where you can't solve problems in any of them.My minor quibble is the language does matter, at least, to how you think about a solution. Doing OO programming where you create classes and objects differs from doing procedural programming where you don't do that. That also differs from doing functional programming. You need to adjust how you think about programming. But in a sense, it doesn't matter which style who pick, just pick one and don't keep switching languages to know a bunch of them at a surface level.",

The industry has already enough of this kind of dev and has (had?) insatiable hunger for mediocre workers.If one wants to gain more insight though, one needs to get in contact with other languages and how they work and solve problems in them. Then out of the specific experiences with different primitives to work with, one forms a more educated overall picture and expertise.Don't obsess, alright, I agree, but don't assume, that because you have used Java, Python, JavaScript or another mainstream language for a couple of years, you know all there is to know. There is tons you don't know and there will always be tons you don't know. What matters is, that you continue learning. If all you can do is sling around some design patterns, then unfortunately quite soon you may become obsolete. You might need to become an _expert_ in computer programming, and that does not only include slinging Java classes and a few patterns. The world of computer programming is much, much broader than that.",

Some people choose to continue learning, and maybe project Odin could be a place where such people go to learn. Some are even fortunate enough to be able to do so on the job, at some functioning organization. Most others will not or are not at organizations that encourage learning.Example: In the past I have been at an organization that had fake \"learning days\". I was not allowed to learn about some advanced computer programming topics, but someone else \"learning HTML\", that was OK. Only that I learned HTML a long time ago, at school and over time I mostly kept myself informed about what new stuff is there. I have no need of learning HTML. It is something so basic, that I would be wasting my time doing that. Knowing HTML is such a widespread thing, that it is not even anything to boast about. Yet I was denied learning, because silly middle management did not have the capability to understand the impact of the things I wanted to learn. The perspective was always short term, and they let their own lack of experience and knowledge limit what others are allowed to learn on the job. It was completely dysfunctional.I think many people in this situation would not have energy left to then learn more in their free time. That is, if they were into being a developer out of passion and learning about computational processes, and not just for the good pay. We have too many of the not passionate devs in the industry, who will jump on any hype train, as long as it pays well, messing up project after project, and being lauded for it by incapable management.Many will continue to mess up projects, introducing unnecessary complexity at many turns. Management usually doesn't realize this, because they have no proper understanding of the detailed implementation ideas and what their consequences are. Or the ever-present silly phrases like \"80-20!\", \"YAGNI!\", balblabla, which are weaponized to cut against developer concerns. You are a ticket machine! We want you to be a small cog, that we can easily replace with the next generic developer!They are not able to distinguish between someone really knowing their stuff and someone just going with the first best idea that \"works\" (until the next requirement change, when they have to adapt their half-assed solutions again). Developing computer programs without \"programming oneself into a corner\" is a valuable skill, but also a rare skill.",

There's a reason people say to start with tic-tac-toe or a TODO app. Building something small and self-contained is great 2. Piggyback off of existing projects. Clone some open-source repos down, poke around, see how much you can understand. Pick something small and cool to rebuild as much as you can, using the repo as a reference. That way you can see how code is built and used in the real world.2. Tutorials can be really useful, but don't just build what's in the tutorial. Change or add \\*something\\* so that you can apply what you've learned.3. Maybe controversial, but I strongly recommend preferring text tutorials over video. I've found that text has a number of advantages. It's more similar to reading documentation. You can easily jump around back and forth without needing to rely on timestamps or trying to skip back and forth on a video. And I'd argue that reading long tutorials helps flex the muscle of quickly filtering relevant from irrelevant content, which is important when troubleshooting and searching for relevant documentation, browsing reddit and old Stack Overflow posts (if that's even still a thing) and even when chatting with an LLM and figuring out if it's hallucinating or giving you outdated information",

Once it's done, question yourself again **\"Hmm, okay! Done with this! What will happen if the user tries to access this thing?\"** So, it will be like several branches of thoughts starting from the VERY FIRST question **\"What will the user see....\".**I hope I could help!

Think back over the different things you have learned and look at them as virtual Lego bricks.Pick up one of these imaginary bricks and think to yourself what is it good for; how can I use it to build something. Repeat the process for a handful of different bricks and then ask yourself, how can I combine these bricks to create something simple?Now put these handful of imaginary bricks together by writing some real code and you'll now have built something that is very simple; something that performs the task you imagined. Test it to see if it works just as you imagined.Then just keep building by adding more bricks.TLDR; Think of something simple to build and just build it. Rinse and repeat.",

You need to decompose the problem recursively until you arrive at lots of small problems with trivial solutions.2) Just go and implement it. If you don’t know how to do something in a given language, google it and you’ll be fine.I’m working on my chess engine right now, and this process has made a problem with no obvious solution (at a glance) decently easy to solve. The important thing is to start with something very small, and with each project you make something bigger. You wouldn’t go to the gym and lift something ridiculously heavy on your first day, you need to build up to it.Also, good luck with university!

Having a problem to solve, understanding the requirements, and partitioning the solution into manageable chunks are some of the more difficult tasks when participating in any project.

Like learning to ride a bicycle, one day it's all just going to *click* and you're not even going to realize it's happened until you're cruising.You still have a lot more to learn in CS, and it's probably going to get harder before it gets easier. Use that to your advantage! Take everything you learn as an opportunity to practice writing code. Way back when I was in college, I wrote my own collection of all the data structures and algorithms I learned; reinventing the wheel not only helped me to better understand what I was learning, but it gave me lots of practice.

Plenty of brilliant engineers who can't communicate the answers to these sort of questions effectively. They'll become a specialist in one language or framework and can talk endlessly about the internals and the nuts and bolts of their expertise.The greats will be able to leverage this expertise from others.

It starts with being able to truly understand a problem, explore multiple ways to solve it, and compare those options—thinking through tradeoffs, constraints, and implications.But technical ability alone isn’t enough. Great engineers can communicate complex ideas in simple terms. They adapt how they explain things depending on who they're speaking to and what the context is.I’ve been conducting interviews in Big Tech for a while now, and here's what I look for: when I present a problem, a strong candidate asks questions and engages in a real discussion about how to approach it. That back-and-forth tells me more about their ability than the actual coding exercise. In fact, in most cases, I’ve already made up my mind before they start writing code. The coding just confirms it. It’s incredibly rare that someone struggles to design or explain a solution but somehow writes brilliant code. Communication and reasoning come first.",

Like you somehow reach this magical point where you just get it and can code from scratch. It doesnt work that way. At least it didn't for me. Its a continual gradual process that takes years and as soon as i took a break, a lot of the specific details started to fade. Its challenging but can also be enjoyable. When I was in it, and something I was working on did what it was suppose to do and all the pieces worked. That was exhilarating. Not everybody is like that though. Maybe for others, its no big deal and it starts to make sense right away but it didnt for me. Id definitely give it a shot if I was you.

That's really up to you. Since you're a teenager you have plenty of spare time available to tinker and experiment between them. Whichever editor you choose though, just make sure to record whatever config setup you end up with so you can easily spin it up again in the future (e.g. dotfiles repo). Between the two I prefer neovim, but that's mainly because of the kickstart project that provides a neat baseline config. Me personally I stick to vscode with the vscodevim plugin most of the time. Occasionally I open a terminal neovim session when vscode starts performing too slow for me, but the main reason I have a hard time moving on from vscode is the multi-cursor editing in vscode is just too good for me.",

So in Python you expose a web server using something like Flask, which when queried with a web browser serves a file containing HTML depending on the route (path in browser) and method (GET, POST, etc). The advantage here is that you could use a template engine like Jinja2 to serve dynamic content. The old TurboGears framework (yes I'm that old), Flask, or Django are commonly used with python, PHP is another commonly used one using the Laravel framework for example.2. API driven, here you serve endpoints (routes) with a web server and various methods just like with the server side rendering but instead of serving HTML you serve some other machine readable media formats like JSON, JSON-RPC, XML, etc. You then combine the \"backend\" with a frontend website that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that calls your backend routes and then utilises that data to change the front end. React, Vue, Angular, (Ember if you're old), or more raw JQuery, are tools/frameworks to help you do that.Probably about a third of all the programming information on the Internet is about how to do this, how to get started in it, etc.",

Essentially, your backend program is responsible for preparing data to be consumed by the browser in some form or another. The simplest web program might look like this: print('HelloHello, world!')This can be run by telling your web server to run this script as a CGI program. This is not a modern recommended practice for several out-of-the-scope-of-this-discussion reasons but it's great for educational purposes. The idea is, you set up your web server to serve any given route by running this program and then sending the output to the client. Using this example, Python itself isn't handing HTTP requests, the web server is, and it's adding additional context that can be accessed through environment variables or even reading STDIN to handle posts, etc. Once you've got that, you can start doing more clever things, like mapping out endpoints and having the browser make asynchronous requests to those end points to dynamically update already-loaded pages.",

Also use Axios in the frontend to make the GET, PUT, POST and such to backend a hell of a lot easier to make. For the backend I recommend using Spring Boot. It has a lot of extra tools for REST APIs. You can run Spring with Java, or Kotlin. I recommend getting into Kotlin. It's somewhere between Java and Python where it's a lot less boilerplate-heavy than Java while also being a lot more secure than Python.

If you're spending a bunch of time learning a little bit about a lot of different languages, then you'll never build up your depth. Pick one language to really focus on, and then you'll discover that the other languages will naturally come easier over time, as you make connections.2. In whatever language you've chosen, learn as many built-in functions (and operators, syntax, etc.) in that language as you can (with the theoretical goal of learning all of them). New programmers often make things harder than they need to be on themselves, because they don't realize all of the tools that the language offers (and they try to write extra utilities themselves, or reach for code from the Internet or third-party packages, when the language already offers a helpful tool built-in).3. Just like how when you're at the gym, you don't do each exercise only once and move on to a new exercise, apply the same approach to coding. Once you get your code working, start over from a completely blank slate, and try to do it again. See if you can look up even a *little* less than you needed to look up last time, or if you run into a little bit fewer bugs than you did last time. You'll find that once you do something five or ten times, you have a *way* deeper understanding than you thought you did after you only did it once.",

Often to build something interesting you have to spend time learning what you don’t.Coding is 70% research 20% drafting/copying/configuring 10% testing.When you see people coding super fluidly in tutorials you’re generally seeing someone who has already solved the problem they are showing you and staged everything out for the video, and did a good job of execution when explaining and putting it all together for a recording(which likely had more than one take or has cuts). They look like wizards, they’re not showing you their “how the fuck does that even work” moments.The best you can do is know your tools and native functions back to front, know design principles back to front, make a concerted effort to understand every line of code you write. How to use classes, functions, ints, strings. Know signs that something needs to be refactored.",

Objectively, some may be better than others, but first solve the problem in any way you can, understand how you got there, then rewrite it in a way that either is easier to read, or gets there in a better way.

It's to computer science what Apostol's Calculus is to math.SICP and HtDP do two things: they develop intuition, and they introduce you to some of the most foundational ways of thinking about programming.AI tools, code assistants, etc. are cool, and interactive platforms smooth the process, but the important thing isn't to write code itself. It's to develop new circuitry in your brain for thinking about computational problems (which you do by *the process* of writing code, which code assistance can skip, so you get the right answer, but don't develop the brain circuitry).I also find that (good) books, in general, go far more in depth and provide far more insight than most other mediums for learning, which tend to be shallow and focus on low hanging fruit. Even AI is going to be mostly low-hanging fruit, as it's basically a compilation of all the blogs and reddit posts and tutorials that are out there on the internet already.If you want something other than a book, CS50, which is basically (good) book quality in video format. Very rare.At the end of the day, technology has changed, but our brains have remained almost unchanged the same since the advent of modern computing. You can't cheat building up those circuits in your brain to develop new ways of thinking -- you need to learn, try, make mistakes, and learn again. I'm dubious as to the capability of new technologies to change that process that is so integral to our brain's biology.",

This is a huge shift from what you did to this, so yes it is going to be rough but sticking it out will be worth it if you’re already starting to enjoy it. From what I gathered CS50 course is hard depending on the person but it has a great amount of info and goes into depth about important topics.

Hell, even for some of the lighter trades just being on his feet for 8+ hours a day might seem unbearable to him!But he definitely could (assuming he's got no physical disabilities) condition himself to the work eventually. He'll get stronger and have more endurance and get used to using his body to work all day - if he's motivated enough and doesn't just quit a week in.So I don't think you need passion, but you *do* need motivation - there's going to be a lot of hard mental work ahead if you want to eventually turn it into a career, so you gotta have a strong desire pushing you through.That being said, if it isn't a passion there's probably other jobs that take about the same amount of time to become employable like accounting or paralegal and which probably are easier to get jobs in these days.",

There will still be complex stuff, but a lot of shit is just like “right, looping over that array of shit and doing some shit with each thing and then doing this other thing and if this other thing happens we do something else…”",

If your code has a bug, fix the bug, then figure out how and why you made the bug. Decide how to change your practices so that you reduce the chance of similar bugs in the future.3. Compare your code, without ego, to others' code. Compare approaches. Decide what works best. 4. When making a decision or a trade-off (for example to make a function static or not, or to use a particular data structure), explain to yourself why you are making the decision that way. Consider adding that as a content. 5. When you change your mind about a decision or trade off, figure out if you're doing it because (a) the requirements/constraints changed, or whether you just had incomplete information, or (b) you made the weren't decision at first. If (b), think about how to make a better decision next time. 6. Look for opportunities to collaborate with other thoughtful programmers. Ask for feedback. Think about it when you get it. 7. Extend these ideas of feedback and improvement to the other activities too - design, documentation, architecture, and so on. Even choice of language. 8. Read code. Read books. Compare to your own work and experience. Iterate: observe, consider, adapt, repeat.Basically, improve your skills by practice, evaluation, and iteration. Practice alone won't get you there - you have to do enough thinking to get as much benefit as possible out of every learning experience.",

Imagine yourself in a few years being able to automate boring paperwork, analyze patient data, or even build tools that could help your colleagues and patients.

It can make you more adaptable, more creative, and honestly, it’s just empowering to know you can build something from scratch. And who knows?

Figuring it out might mean experimenting, trial and error, going back over things you learned before, going down dead ends, taking a break and coming back to it later, or even asking for a tiny hint here on r/learnprogrammingThe most important thing is that you need to persevere longer and not just peek at the answer. It might take you an hour, it might take you a week. But if you force yourself to keep trying until you get it, you WILL get better.On the flip side, if you give up and look at the answer, you will never learn to code.Go back and try again. Don't expect your solution to look anything like that solution. Don't aim for any specific length. It might be 3 lines of code, it might be 30 lines of code.

Well there a bunch of space before, a bunch of \"o\" in the middle and then we go to next line so the code become: for each line print_spaces(numbers of spaces) print_stars(numbers of o)Now can you do print\\_spaces and print stars ? Well we just need to repeat the same stuff the specified number of time, something like: line = \"\" repeat for numbers of spaces line = line + \" \" repeat for numbers of o line = line + \"*\" print lineBut to be more concise, we could write as well: line = repeat(\" \", number of spaces) + repeat(\"o\", number of o) print linewhere repeat would repeat the string the number of time we want. That's not so different than line = \" \".repeat(number of spaces) + \"o\".repeat(number of o)or even: print \" \".repeat(number of spaces) + \"o\".repeat(number of o)Now how many number of stars we have per line ? From the solution it's: Math.floor((i * 2 - 1 - row) / 2)To really get it, we would need to understand what i and row are as well as floor. But you can likely come with you own way to count the spaces.From your pyramid, to me it look like there zero space on the bottom pyramid and 1 the one before, then 2, then 3. So it like the (max line number) - (current line number) - 1 So the whole for me would be for I in range(0, max_line - 1) num_spaces = I + 1 num_o = max_line - I - 1 print (\" \".repeat(num_spaces) + \"o\".repeat(num_o) or for I in range(0, max_line - 1) print (\" \".repeat(I+1) + \"o\".repeat(max_line - I - 1) Anyway, what I try to explain to you that you go step by step, trying to solve a complex problem by dividing it in smaller problems and solve each sub problem one at a time.It the same even for the Math.floor method you would normally have constructed it step by step.And yes maybe repeat was introduced too fast in their example of maybe, the Math.floor was not well introduced. They gone too fast and you are lost now.But doesn't mean you could not do it on your own with smaller learning step and couldn't master all that with enough training.",

Because you've put that in quotation marks.Sadly creativity was always or has become almost a meme, because (as the other posts confirm indirectly) it sounds like some kind of superpower for almost anything, from programming and maths (\"multiple way to solve a problem\") till songwriting and visual artwork (doesn't even need any argument for those...does it?).But actually creativity is something so abstract that one could write philosophical essays about it (no irony here). And in my experience most jobs, even the more intellectual ones (or maybe especially those) have the cliché that they give you freedom of how-to-do-this-task, no monotony but possibility to be even creative, and so on.My experience is that sure some people are lucky and get their visions and wishes related to their job satisfied and most things are as great as they expected, but that's unfortunately more exception than a rule...I studied chemistry for few years and how did I learn for maths, physics, chemistry modules etc.? By f-ing REPEATING various catalogs of \"questions/tasks that can be asked in the exam\". That's frustrating and I'd hope less people would have to work and especially to learn this way (because it's one of the heaviest turn-offs imo).Before I drift off into more pessimistic stuff, one thing I can tell you as a (hobby-)musician and occassional painter that aside from let's say 0.1% of the population who have superpowers, top genetics and were raised very effective & without any damages, creativity is a bit like natural mutual attraction (\"love\") - you can't enforce it. Still you want to achieve it, how you should do that?By doing certain activities, which you have to find out for yourself, what fits for you somehow, the newer and the more they differ from each other, the better. Just try things out you wanted to f.e.. You will gain experience, expand your conciousness (literally & still in a natural way), the more contrasts you can gather and experience, the better. Nothing is true, everything is permitted!And by automatically building new associative nodes & connections in your neural system / \"soul\" through this gathering of new experiences, by natural passive (\"background-process\"-)learning you will already make one step after the other on the way to more creativity. Will, patience and time - I know, we all need especially the second one, but it's possible :)A bit untypical my whole post, but I hope this gives you some inspiration and new thoughts. I wish you success and optimism for your goals and your future.",

Yes clever code works, that's a big part of why it's so good, but is it readable? Toy projects and leetcode solutions are basically things you do once then barely touch again, so using this kind of code is acceptable. However, code in the real world has to be constantly maintained by several developers. The piece of code that you wrote today should still be understandable to you when you read it 6 months from now (and you've forgotten all about it) and understandable by your teammate who has never worked in that part of the code and maybe has never even met you.So your plain loop solution would still be good, and some might argue even \"better\" than the clever single liner.",

But it's rarely (i.e. almost never) important to have the \"perfect mathematical solution\" to a given problem, even assuming one exists.For this particular problem, I would personally look at the pattern first. How many spaces do you need to print at each row, if the pyramid has a height of 4? Do it manually first in a text editor: 3, 2, 1, 0. Now, what if it has a height of 5? Manually in a text editor: 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.Now do the same for how many \"o\"s you need to print. That one is a little easier. It always starts at 1 and then it always advances by 2, to count out all the odd numbers until the pyramid is done: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ....So in this situation I would say that the \"goold ol' C-style for loop\" is easier to understand in this situation. Luckily JavaScript supports that style of loop: // Pretend that height comes from the user. let height = 4; // Starting out the pyramid with an initial \\n so that it looks // nicer inside the JS Console. let pyramid = \"\\n\"; let ohs = 1; for (let spaces = height-1; spaces >= 0; spaces--, ohs += 2) { pyramid += \" \".repeat(spaces) + \"o\".repeat(ohs) + \"\\n\"; } console.log(pyramid);Some people won't like that style and will prefer a more \"functional\" or \"mathematically correct\" style. But at the end of the day your job is to solve whatever problem you have, in a way that is easy for you to understand and which is fast enough. The above solution is perhaps less \"elegant\" but it gets the job done and it's usually easier to debug code like that than to debug code which is too much in a functional \"mathematical\" style.",

Here's all OP needs to get started: Here is the first paragraph to manipulate with JS Classes and ID's are not just for CSS, utilize them in JS too // how to select an HTML element by id const divElement1 = document.getElementById(\"sampleId\"); const buttonName = document.getElementById(\"colorBtn\"); // how to select multiple elements by class type const paragraphList = document.getElementsByClassName(\"customParagraph\"); // console.log() will be great for learning, use it all the time. // For example you can view how many paragraphs you selected // in your browser web developer tools console with these print outs console.log(\"selected paragraph count = \" + paragraphList.length); // Use JS to make changes in the HTML let color = \"black\"; buttonName.addEventListener(\"click\", (clickEventVariable) =>{ if(color === \"black\"){ // if color is black, change to red color = \"red\"; divElement1.style.color = color; } else { // otherwise color must be red, so change back to black color = \"black\"; divElement1.style.color = color; } });",

It gets you through the first door.No matter how good you are or how many projects you have done, it won't matter if you don't get past the LeetCode rounds. It is sad and absurd but it is what it is. Of course there are companies who don't ask any LeetCode problems, but I would say those are on the rare side as I've seen so many startups still ask LeetCode to filter out the high quantity of applicants.So I suggest you start prepping for LeetCode a little bit every day alongside your projects.

Sure, the former is more elaborate for you - but that's precisely what it should be. You need to struggle and work to learn, otherwise, you're not learning.",

I think this is just one of those things that is true of programming in general, regardless of where you learn it, and being resilient and willing to do your own research goes a very long way. Nobody is going to provide you 100% of everything, and that's true even of college courses, etc.I've also found that the AI chatbot the site provides is extremely helpful not only in guiding you towards the right answers, but also explaining the underlying concepts. I'll say that with the caveat that the other day, it set me off on completely the wrong path and I spent like three hours trying to write this whole crazy method that could've just been a for loop haha",

There's concepts in how to code, and what functions are available for use, that are routinely just not provided or mentioned as something available. I have issue with those basics being missing.It's like being given a pair of running shoes without any laces. If you've never seen them before, the shoe can be snug and usable for running, but it'll be very loose and not fit well. Versus if you know what laces are, you can figure out what you still need to really get the most of the tool and then use it to its maximum potential.

        "body": "I have the following \"algorithm\" for reading a programming book:Step 1. Read through the book \"leisurely\". This is somewhere in between skimming and reading in detail. In this phase, for example, I would make a mental note of technically heavy parts (e.g. code examples) but would not go through them meticulously or line by line.Step 2. Go through the book a second time and make a listing by chapter of what \"things\" need to be done to really study it. For example, which examples should be tried out. What additional exercises should be done. Questions that I have (which could be answered by writing a program, for example). Other \"what ifs\" that come to mind (e.g. what if I try Y instead of X in this example).After step 2 is done, then basically I have a sort of \"todo list\" of sorts for what I actually need to \"actively do\" to learn that material \"for realsies\".Step 3. Go through the list that I made in step 2 and actually do those things.Suffice it to say that \"Step 3\" is what takes the most time and it requires the most concentration. I've found that I can do either step 1 and step 2 in a variety of environments, for example, even on a bus -- but for step 3 I need to be focused, e.g. in a \"library\" type of environment (people around me are quiet and concentrating).For step 3 (\"implementations\") I need to use a good development laptop or workstation to actually work on the problems that I assigned myself (sometimes I will draw stuff on paper as well, e.g. diagrams or organizational notes) or that were assigned from the book author. Step 3 is sometimes \"unfinishable\" for me in practice because I tend to write \"too many\" little experiments to myself, or in the course of doing them I realize that it's no longer worthwhile to do some of them. In practice, when I'm doing step 3 I will make a little \"checklist\" to keep progress:\\[ \\] (123) foo: Implement foo example from chapter\\[ \\] (146) bar: Implement bar example from chapter\\[ \\] (146) \\*bar\\_rvalref: // Can bar example be redone using rvalue references?\\[ \\] (146) \\*\\*cmdline\\_calc: // Create a simple command-line calculator (e.g. calc 1 + 2 \\* 8 should output 17). Output goes to stdout. Also accept \"\\[\" and \"\\]\" as synonyms for \"(\" and \")\" if it is not ambiguous. E.g. x\\[5\\] is unambiguously an array indexing operation, whereas 7 \\* \\[1 + 2\\] is a grouping operation and equivalent to 7 \\* (1 + 2).\\[ \\] (146) \\*\\*\\*cmdline\\_calc: // Modify the calculator so if given the switch --arm, then the calculator also outputs machine code that would perform the same calculation using ARM instructions (output instruction set: ARM v4T without using Thumb instructions). Run the resulting machine code output via QEMU and verify that the result calculated in the emulated machine is identical to the desktop version's output....In my notation I write the page number reference in parens, and I use a \"\\*\" mark to mean \"it is a level-1, i.e. fairly easy exercise\", \\*\\* to mean it is a more involved exercise, and \\*\\*\\* or more to mean it is an \"advanced\" exercise.The stuff after // is my explanations of what I want to do or experiment on; it can be somewhat vague because it is probably based on the example in the book so if I reread that part of the book, then what I wrote should make more sense.These \"checklists\" work fine on paper (in fact I prefer them not to be electronic), but for the actual \"stuff\" that I am doing it is mostly a program and is mostly electronic (i.e. I just create something in a text editor or IDE). If I'm following a book with chapter 1, chapter 2, etc. style then normally I'll name subfolders with the chapter number and the topic, e.g. ch3\\_pointers, ch4\\_memory\\_management, etc.",

I have done that before with hard to reason about code bases with dynamic, interaction-based and hard to understand flows and it was surprisingly useful. It might make less or more sense in your case, depending on the context.Perhaps there are also static analysis tools for whatever language/application you're dealing with that can visualize modules, module members and relationships between them. I have also written custom tools for that for my code base and it was also quite useful, but it's a bit much. Besides that, I'd say perhaps don't sweat too much about it unless there's a good reason and let it come to you organically, as you work through the issues and features (hopefully, gentle at first).",

One of the keys to programming and software design is learning how to break the big overall goal into smaller goals. Then solve those and get them working individually, then stitch them together. So for example if you want a stock analysis and trading platform, start by modeling the price of a stock at a given instance of time (a single bar, whether that's a day, an hour, a 5 minute interval, whatever it might be). Then build an overall history that accumulates those individual pieces, maybe give that the ability to calculate analyses like EMA, stochastics, or whatever. Then model a portfolio that can track buys, sells, profit/ loss, etc of individual stocks. Then build something that will fetch historical data from an online source and build up your historical data. Might also need that to analyze the data for cleaning: find holes, potential anomalies, normalize for splits, etc. I'm not familiar enough with crypto to know the analog, but hopefully that gives you a way to begin. Python would be fine for this if you're not planning to do real time analysis. If you want something that can analyze data in real time, you're looking at C, C++, Rust, Zig, or something else that's a systems level language. You don't need to start there, but that's where you'd want to aim to get.",

They allow you as the developer to control the way your class is interacted with. In the field, you'll rarely be writing code on your own. Most of us work on projects with at least 10 other people touching the code that we write, and on code that other people wrote. You won't always have the benefit of knowing exactly what was going through the authors head when interacting with a class. Also... after a few months or years you won't know what was going through your own head.So, consider a scenario where a class has a static object in it which is critical to its function. Say.. an in memory data store or cache. Nearly every public function in the class calls this object and it would be really cumbersome to check for initialization in every function call. Plus, that leaves room for error. You or another developer later on might forget to check. But you could define it with a getter that checks initialization and executes lazy initialization if its not done. Now that initialization logic exists in one place, and you never need to worry about checking for initialization when using the object. And you don't have to worry about some other developer down the line writing dangerous code into your class that forgets to check initialization.Similar with constructors. You can use the constructor to perform logic that **must** be done before the class gets interacted with. Go grab some service dependencies, initialize some variables, warm up the cache, whatever you need.",

You change your class to store a radius instead of a diameter.Now *everyone calling .diameter will have broken code.* This is a problem.In Java, you'd write a getDiameter() method for people to use and make your diameter a private variable. getDiameter() would just return the diameter, but then when you refactor your code to store a radius instead, you can just make getDiameter() return 2 * radius. This way, everyone else's code still works even though you have changed yours.Some languages handle this issue in different ways (e.g. properties in Python) but most object oriented languages use getters and setters to handle it.",

If your setter just does something like `void setFoo(int value) {``_foo = value;` `}` Then yeah it's not terribly useful. However, if you wanted to do something like clean the input - check bounds, convert type, etc., - or fire an event or something when the value is retrieved or written to, this is where a getter or setter is really valuable.C# does a better job of this, IMO, but getters and setters are the norm because globally accessible variables are a HUGE no-no in virtually every application.Most often setters are the complicated ones and public getters that just spit out the value of the variable are pretty common. However, one case I am currently using right now of a more complex getter is that I have to retrieve the firmware information of a co-processor that talks to my primary MCU application over a serial connection. I request that information and cache it when the program starts, but if I call my version getter and that value is invalid for whatever reason (firmware update, mainboard resets, etc) I can spin up the serial port and request the info again, then return the new information or an error code. From the application perspective, I am just getting the firmware version and it doesn't really concern itself with how. I don't have to almost ever change that code, and it can be reused in other places so that if I ever change how the firmware version is retrieved, it's in one spot and makes my job much easier. Likewise, if for whatever reason getting that information stops working, I know exactly where to look which saves time with debugging.",

Yes you could, and you often do if you want to be able to return a failure code. However when you don't need to return a failure code, it's less typing to just initialize in a constructor.One area I've found setters as being really nice is lets say you have a variable that should only be a number between 0 and 10, and you have a bug where it's being set to 100007. How do you figure out why it's being set to 100007? With a setter you can put a break point (or a conditional break point) in the setter, then trace up the stack to see where and why it's being set to 100007.As for getter, unfortunately with java if the variable is public then if it can be got it can be set. And see why setters are nice above.",

More on that at the end.Presumably, in a real (not a learning exercise) program, many of your variables have constraints that require validation, eg can a person's age be negative or higher than 200? Can their name contain unprintable characters or whitespace like tab? These constraints are put into the setters, and signal an error if the attempt to set them to an invalid value is made. Getters protect data that the user can see, but should not change. For example, with the person, you can maybe look at their address when making a map of your customers but this is not an appropriate place and time to be changing the values -- a getter can provide a look without letting you accidentally modify it. To modify it you must deliberately call the setter rather than just an oops side effect on a free wheeling variable. But when the getters and setters do nothing, and they often will, their only purpose is to keep it consistent. These 10 values have getters and setters and those 5 do not in class A, those 18 do not and 11 do in class B, .. C, D, E, ... after a few classes, remembering which variables in which classes have getters and setters is overwhelming. If you just assume they all have these functions and use them for everything, its that much less burden on the programmer. They also abstract validation: when using them ALL of your validation looks the same: while( !class.setter_for_variable(new_value) ) { display bad input message() new_value = get new input from user () }",

This isn't good, because this means that if you want to update the contents of one of the arrays, you will have to change multiple places in your code, where you should only need to change one place in your code for such a change.* Similarly, in `UserInterface`, you have one area that prints out a numbered list of all the actions that the user can choose from, but the logic that goes along with each of those actions is elsewhere in the file.

It might make the code look better, something like: switch(command) { case 1 -> generateRandom(); case 2 -> generateWithLength(); case 3 -> generateWithLetter();and so on. But it is a matter of taste.You could benefit from making a single method for reading a valid number from the input - something like: `getValidInput(int[] numbers)` that would only return one of the numbers in the array, or zero if something else was entered by the user. That would isolate your use of scanner to that method alone, and make the rest of the code easier to write without having to handle exceptions or different invalid inputs.It is always a good idea to have a lot of small methods that only do one thing - my own personal rule is that if I have more than two levels of if-statements or loops, I need to make a method to combine them.

No, I am not referring to updating the content of string arrays through a method.Let's look at the `dCons` field as an example:2a. You define `dCons` as an array that contains 40 elements, which is perfectly fine.2b. However, later on, when you *use* `dCons`, your code looks like this: dCons[random.nextInt(40)]Here, you have explicitly hardcoded the length of `dCons`. In the future, if you ever manually edit your code to change what is in `dCons`, you will need to update *two* places in your code — 2a and 2b. That's not good, because it's important that those two places in your code stay in sync.Instead, it's better to remove the hard-coded length in 2b, and have it *read* the length, via something like `dCons[random.nextInt(dCons.length)]`. This way, if you ever manually edit your code to change what is in `dCons`, you will simply need to update *one* place in your code, and everything else will automatically adjust.",

That kind of logical thinking translates really well to programming.The fact that you've already played around with TrueNAS, Linux, and Docker shows you're not starting from zero. Don't downplay that experience, lots of grads don't even know what Docker is when they start.At Metana we've had students from all kinds of trades backgrounds make successful transitions. What I've noticed is that people with hands on experience often do better than traditional CS grads because they understand how to build things that actually work in the real world. You don't necessarily need a degree for most programming jobs, especially in Canada where the tech scene is pretty good. Companies care way more about what you can build than your educational background.The ADHD thing might actually be an advantage once you find your groove. A lot of great developers I know have adhd, that hyperfocus can be incredibly powerful for debugging and problem-solving.Feel free to reach out if you want to chat more about specific learning paths or what the job market looks like right now. You got this :))",

Definitely not too late at 29! That being said, the market for juniors is abysmal globally at the moment so it's going to require some serious hardware work and dedication to get that first job. Don't let that scare you off though, it can absolutely still be done.One piece of advice I can give on self-teaching (from an ADHDer as well) is pick ONE language and stick with it for learning. It absolutely does not matter which one you choose as long as it isn't completely obscure, or something like COBOL. The fundamental concepts are all the same in every language.I started with Ruby, learned C# through my first job, now work in C#, JavaScript/TypeScript.I'd recommend you start with JavaScript (alongside HTML and CSS) as you can use those 3 to build interactive web pages and get immediate feedback and a sense of achievement, which is big when self-teaching, especially for ADHD folk. Also even if you work in any other language, if you're working on a web page in any capacity, you will almost certainly need JavaScript so you might as well know it, even if you end up not using it as your primary language. For where to get started, The Odin Project is a great resource to get you on the right track.",

I completed a 2 year web dev program at an accredited college(I chose to do it online but I recommend in person if you can) and was able to qualify to apply for tech positions with the GOC. I’d recommend looking into some job postings and deciding if you can see yourself doing some different tech roles just to broaden your chances in the current job market.I second the Odin Project as a nice start but I’d also recommend looking into other courses that interest you on Udemy(never pay full price for these, they go on sale all the time!) or Coursera before you commit to paying into a degree.",

This has happened so many times I have lost count.And this is not old news. This happened to me just a few weeks ago on Windows 10 (still waiting to see if Windows 11 has the same brain fart). Now based on the down votes, obviously many here on learn programming are not creating one file coding examples, compile that code to executable and trying to run the executable just to see how it works. On a side note, that is exactly what you should be doing as it is a great way to learn how to program.I actually do this several times a day, exactly because this is a great way to learn new concepts. But on many occasions Windows Defender will block the executable that I create, claiming it is a virus.So, I find it really hard to believe code written by me, code compiled by me, an executable run by me is a virus, yet Windows Defender always has other ideas. Hence the reason I stand by my claim I doubt Windows Defender actually knows what it is doing. Since I am coding Win32 C/C++ I see at least a half dozen false positives a month.And like the boy who cried wolf, they are really annoying!",

I've been programming for a bit over 20 years and am currently a senior at an analytical testing lab where we are replacing our existing line of business app with one written in C#The common practice is to break software into modules and layers and both are useful for limiting cognitive overhead and complexityModules help you draw boundaries where your objects begin and end. A typical place to draw this line is at the edge of well defined objects in your domainLayers help you stick to solving for certain implementation problems related to a subset of the technology. Some common layers are- data store - data access or orm - domain or business logic- api- presentation What I've found is that the edge seems to be a bit wider in the presentation layer than what you want for the domain layer and to do that you sometimes want to inflate the boundary in the data access layer, but this can introduce problems with the domain layerA good compromise is to create summary types which you can refer to in the presentation layer without having to load entire objectsHappy to talk through this stuff.

As a dev I'd say about 90% of my work is researching patterns and approaches, finding the right library, figuring out the domain. LC is a great opportunity to practice that last 10% where it's just you and a code problem, not because the skill translates, but more the discipline to work through a problem, start to finish, figure out where it's weak and improve it.This doesn't mean it will make you a 10% better dev of course, you're likely already a pretty solid problemsolver, but it is not entirely worthless.",

Second, a lot of those people are successful programmers who are good at what they do, so in a sense, they're correct. You can be a good programmer and be bad at leetcode.I would say, though, that the reverse is far less likely. There are far more good programmers who are bad at leetcode than there are bad programmers who are good at leetcode. For interviewers, this is usually a good trade. Sure, the leetcode arbitrarily filters out some good talent, but it also effectively filters out bad talent. Not all, but most. A person who has gotten good at leetcode is often pretty passionate about programming. Programming is a wide field. There are people whose jobs look a lot more like leetcode problems. It's also critical to understand the basic tools you would use for leetcode. You should develop a basic intuition for time complexity. I always think that working on improving at leetcode problems will make you better. To get really good, you need to have a deep understanding of the language and everything happening under the hood. But there are really 2 factors here: getting good at solving difficult problems, and getting good at optimizing simpler problems.

The number of candidates that crash and burn on what could be a 1 line answer is astonishing. And if the candidate arrives at a solution, I can start tweaking parameters and see how they respond.

        "body": "A bit flip can happen due to outside interference from cosmic rays, electrical interference, or memory degradation. There was a study a while back that a 4GB computer has a 96% chance to experience a bit flip every 3 days. Assuming your if statement takes 1ms to execute, there are 259,200,000 ms in a 3 day period. So you have a 1/259,200,000 chance to experience a bit flip during this check. Now this doesn't mean the bit flip will happen at the memory location that your value is stored though. 4GB of RAM has 32,000,000,000 bits in it. So that alone means a 1/32,000,000,000 chance that the bit flip happens in the location that your data is stored.So the odds of a bit flip happening during your calculation and landing on the memory location where your data is stored is 259,200,000 x 32,000,000,000. Which is:1 / 829,440,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000Oh and keep in mind this increases depending on how high above sea level you are. Cause science and all.",

You'll normally never it in personal computers, because it's much more expensive; but for certain critical applications, a company or agency may decide to pay extra for it. ECC guards against memory corruption due to spontaneous magnetic flips in the physical storage medium, mostly from background radiation. This is not limited to, but includes cosmic rays, for which reason spontaneous bit flip increases with altitude and is worst in satellites (as u/MediumRay said). And of course, if a bit has spontaneously flipped, that bit could represent a variable in a comparand, or for that matter an operand.How real is this problem as opposed to merely theoretical? Well, as I said, it's not enough of a problem to be worth fixing in personal computers, but still a concrete enough problem for there to be a manufacturing sector and a market for ECC RAM. People out there are paying a lot of money for this stuff, and probably for good reason. So in certain applications, it's a possibility real enough to pay money to mitigate.I don't think choice of language should be expected to have any effect. Ultimately an opcode is an opcode. The way to fix it is to buy ECC, not to program around it.",

Now it's just a matter of finding a way to get your process to \"skip\" an instruction (possible attacks exist for that).In any case, this is why systems have multiple levels of security. Normally you shouldn't be running a program with enough privileges to change system files. And for the processes that do need such privileges, these should undergo a quite rigorous security review.

If you mean the order in which they are written, I can definitely see how they may be perceived as messy, though I feel this is very common with tailwind from my experience. There may be a tool that organizes the classes for you that I’m unaware of though. Or perhaps bootstrap just looks organized due to being comprised of pre-built components?Tailwind css is also mobile first, but I inverted the breakpoints to make it desktop-first because I had no plans on making the mobile version of the application.Yes I definitely use the mobile viewports.

        "body": "You don’t need a degree as the other commenter mentioned. The job market is fucked for people who have degrees too.Here’s what you need to do: 1.) Build 2-3 full stack projects that solve real world problems. Don’t just build your cookie cutter todo app. You should come up with an idea or a problem you’d like to solve in your own life, and then create an app around it. This alone will distinguish you from the masses that have the same generic todo app projects on their portfolios. You will stand out as a legitimate developer if you do this. Also, make sure the portfolio website you put your projects on looks great and professional.2.) Any time you write code - commit it to GitHub. You will want to put your GitHub link in your resume and portfolio website so that employers can go look at your code. Make sure you can explain what your code is doing during an interview.3.) Apply to 10-20 software development jobs a day. Curate your resume and cover letter to each job description (use GPT to speed up the process).4.) Network like hell on LinkedIn. Reach out to anyone and everyone who works at a company you’d like to work at. Ask them for 15 minutes of their time for an “informational interview” and at the end, politely ask them to refer you. Or reach out to recruiters directly. Show them your projects. 5.) If you land an interview - research their company and take a few days to build out a prototype app that is relevant to their company. Showcase it during your interview. This will make you stand out like no one else. It shows that you’re ambitious and will go the extra mile. 6.) Be proactive. You can’t fail if you go hard at all the above every single day. The above 5 steps should be your full time job until you land a job. It might take time - but you’ll land something eventually - in fact it took me almost 2 years to land a job after learning how to code and following the steps above after 6 months of coding. So don’t give up.Bonus tip: Never think that a job is below you. If you get an opportunity that sounds shitty but it’s software related, take it - because you will be able to build credibility to add on your resume which will help you land that dream job much easier down line.First dev job I took was a shitty TA gig at a coding bootcamp. Paid $11,000 annually. I did it for a year, leveraged the experience on my resume and landed a $70k gig as a junior developer 8 months later.Edit: I don’t have a degree in CS. But I do have a bachelors in psychology. Which may or may not have helped my chances.",

I'm also in Toronto, also a front-end-biased full-stacker. There's a fair bit of meetups for JavaScript, front-end, web perf. Go to them. Be seen there. Meet folks, talk about stuff, try to learn and show all the cool stuff you're building. Worse comes to worse you meet some cool new people, best case you start getting tips.\\- integrate your projects with the LLM companies APIs. Considering how popular these tools are in tech right now, you'll have a bit of an edge over people making boring boilerplate apps. If you want to be hired, working with these APIs will look good when you're demoing your work and show you're on the cutting edge.\\- Don't let doomers discourage you. Tech is a very boom-bust industry. The dot-com bust didn't kill software development, the latest trends won't kill it either. Get good, show your passion and you'll stand out over a sea of apathetic grads who are just in it for the six-figure payday.\\- Lastly, most importantly: only become a front-ender if you genuinely love it. Programming and software development are one of the best jobs in the world, but after a post-pandemic big tech hiring boom we're seeing massive layoffs and salaries are shrinking. It will still pay well but you need to set expectations and be willing to find a smaller place to skill up. I got my start working in a creative advertising agency, then was able to pivot into software.Source: BA Psychology+bootcamp grad, worked in the industry for a decade now.",

It's really nice to see someone trying to clarify something about the interaction of the language with the environment it's running in.`scanf()` is not moving the cursor. The OS is. Well, the terminal application is, with the help of the OS (and possibly BIOS). It turns out that the cursor advances all the time. Like when you type in the command to compile:```$ _$ g_$ gc_$ gcc_```After each character typed, the cursor advances (most of the time). But terminals are very complex things. Suffice to say that the terminal--with the help of the OS--manages receiving keystrokes and \"sending them\" to the application.IOW, the terminal receives the keystrokes. It does what it usually does; advances it when you type a character, retreats it when you type backspace, etc. Then, after it does what it needs to (though there are exceptions, like what happens when you press `Ctrl-C` on a Unix-like machine), it tells your C program: \"Hey, someone pressed a character, here it is.\" Then, you do whatever you're going to do with it.It's somewhere from \"a little\" to \"way more\" complicated than that in realities, but that's the general idea. Just to finish this up, the complexity can come around buffering, which is how many character the terminal and OS will hold before sending them. If it sent every character, one at a time, that could be inefficient, so sometimes terminals and OSes buffer. Generally, in terminal applications, hitting `` will force/suggest the underlying bits (terminal, OS) to send the data to the application. Also, it's the terminal that decides to move the cursor down (newline), and then return to the left-side on English/Western locales (carriage return).If you're curious about how terminals work on Unix-like machines, check out **Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment** by Stevens, often abbreviated \"APUE\".",

        "body": "In a traditional environment with a serial terminal connected to a remote computer, keyboard input to the terminal is sent to the remote computer to be handled as program input, and output from a program is sent from the remote computer to the terminal for display.Most of the time, the cursor is placed after the last output character sent from the remote computer. Sometimes other characters change the cursor position, like a carriage return moving the cursor to the beginning of the current output line, a line feed moving the cursor down one line, a backspace moving the cursor backward one character, and other special escape sequences can move the cursor in other ways (such as to a specified row and column).Also in most cases the operating system terminal driver echoes characters input on the terminal back out to the terminal. This may happen automatically in the terminal driver without the remote program having to do anything, but the terminal driver can also be put in a mode where automatic echo is disabled and the program must deliberately echo input characters if it wants to. A text editor, for example, may set non-echoing mode so that editor commands are not echoed when they are typed, and instead output from the editor program displays the results of performing the command.The terminal driver in the operating system usually also handles input in line mode, meaning that an entire line of characters followed by a ENTER is buffered up and made available to the program after ENTER is pressed. But the terminal driver can also be put into a mode where every keypress from the terminal is immediately available to the program, rather than being held and sent when ENTER is pressed.In modern computers the terminal is often a program that emulates the behavior of a serial terminal, because the serial terminal model is so pervasive for managing program input and output.In a simple program, output to the terminal is what moves the cursor, so calling scanf() does not cause the cursor to move, and if the terminal driver is in its normal mode of echoing input, it's the echoed output of input characters, or output from the program, that moves the cursor on the terminal",

C is a bit unforgiving, it totally lets you shoot yourself in the foot and C++ lets you do the same, except that your entire leg is gone afterwards.Beware of any mention, that C++ and C# are just supersets of C. That might have been true very very early on, but both have diverged from C quite a bit, some things just work differently.Find a resource, that teaches C with a proper focus on how to write secure code, having to debug undefined Behaviour, memory leaks and segfaults is no fun if you just came from python. Personally I like the book \"Effective C\" by Robert C Seacord. Despite the name, (effective LANGUAGE usually means advanced in a lot of programming books) it is written for beginners, but it is well written, up to date and doesn't make stupid errors where the example code won't even compile (surprisingly common).Then, once you have a grip on the language, implement various algorithms, like the problems on [projecteuler.net](http://projecteuler.net), reading and processing some files, playing with raylib (since you came from gamedev with godot). The best way to learn C is writing programs in C, but they need to be small self contained things that compile cleanly and pass through valgrind cleanly. But most importantly, you need to understand various concepts of C first, otherwise the compiler will be like a girlfriend you forget to feed.If you have a sound understanding of computer science, you might read the K&R book, but it is written for seasoned programmers that just don't know C, yet. It is from a time when Programmers already went through college and might had a PhD or a Master at minimum, home computers and self-taught coders weren't really a thing yet. It assumes that you know how computers work, potentially already have programmed in some form of assembly. It's more of a historic document than a valid learning resource. Don't get me wrong on this, it's a great read and you definitely should read it at some point in your learning journey, but it isn't the *best* way to learn C, anymore.",

Especially when it comes to strings, arrays and \"objects\" and sending them between functions.C++ and C# are just two c-like languages, almost every modern language have a very similar syntax to C, including Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Rust, Zig, Go, Dart, Swift and many others. So unless you stick entirely to Python you'll get to see the C syntax (pun intended).

We could leave either flag out of the call, of course:```some_function_that_takes_flags(SAY_HELLO);```Now this function call only says hello.This way of using flags improves code readability compared to having multiple separate booleans as function params. It also enables extending the list of options very easily without having to go fix a thousand different calls to the said function.Hope this explains it.

Well an array of IDs will bloat your memory.Solution? Store them all on one 64 bit block, and do a bit wise compare, if the value isn't 0, collide.",

An example is std which rather than being on/off sets your c++ standard to 17 or 20 or 23 or whatever else.Sometimes an integer used as multiple flags is still called a flag, though its bitwise treated as up to 64 individual boolean/bit values.So while the term OFTEN refers to single bits, it does not HAVE to, and it does not even have to refer to a 2 state toggle, but can represent the state of a multi-state (eg left/right/forward/reverse) entity. And they can control anything that can make use of a condition, from a switch to a loop and in some languages, even a computation (eg in C++ you can use the false==0, true == 1 in a computation to zero out a term: its valid to say integer = 3\\*x+2\\*y + 42\\*(x>0) ) to conditionally add either 0 or 42. What is common to all of it is that when you hear the term 'flag' you usually should think 'optional configurable/alternative behavior'.",

Here are my two cents.The field is highly competitive and filled with very qualified individuals who transitioned from other quantitative disciplines. It is not easy to break into without internships and published papers.If you just want to use models and integrate them into products. Then that’s pretty easy and doesn’t require you to understand much of what goes on under the hood.If you want to actually train models and understand what is going on under the hood, then that requires a decent grasp on college maths, stats, machine learning, and being comfortable reading research papers.I’d also give you a heads up that the approaches used by modern LLMs are very different to classical NLP methods. Deep learning and the transformer architecture have upended traditional approaches in many fields and this is a case where a textbook written even 5 years ago will be grossly out of date.",

Meaning: you should be good enough to handle 80% of development on either frontend or backend.So if you think you got enough information on Springboot to do 80% of the development on a Springboot app, learn some JavaScript.And to clarify that \"80% of a Springboot app\": handle network requests, CRUD operations, unit testing (enough to read the unit tests for another class, and copy how it's handling testing for your class), and enough OOP / MVC best practices to avoid making a complete mess (which honestly isn't too much, but hard for me to describe atm).",

If you just go into the gym and start throwing weights around, you might get a bit stronger, but you're likely to do a lot of things wrong, be inefficient with your time, and get injured. A (good) book on weightlifting can teach you principles, routines, and instructions for how to do exercises safely. But of course, if you *only* read and never set foot in the gym, merely reading won't get you stronger. It's when you combine the two—the principles and routines from books, and the practice from going to the gym—that you get good results.The same is true with programming. Read good books to learn the principles and techniques, and then build projects to get practice with those principles and techniques. In fact, some of the best tech books include a ton of exercises for you to do so you that get practice while you read.",

To increase my credibility, I'll say that I used the following method successfully to learn Java after spending 3-4 years with just JS, TS, Python. My method:When I learn a new language I do stuff like Edabit first, maybe two weeks of 1-3 hours a day, just working thru the difficulties. I move up to leetcode easy. The point is to exercise my very meager skill in the new lang with tiny, manageable problems.Later once I feel bored, or like I'm wasting time with the ease of the problems, or I want a greater challenge, really any negative dull non-transient feeling, I move onto building a very small program. Usually it solves an imaginary problem, but if I could do something I could conceivably use (still small!) I try to do that. This approach avoids Tutorial Hell, where you are stuck in analysis paralysis. Bite off small manageable pieces, increasing somewhat linearly in size but with variation in difficulty.You can ask me if you sense utility here and you'd like more guidance about the method.",

Note that the last type argument of a `Func` is the return type. So `Func` matches a method `SomeOutput MethodName(SomeObject arg)`So instead of multiple ifs or switch statements, you can do something like this:```Dictionary> handlers;void Init(){ handlers.Add(\"A\", HandlerA); handlers.Add(\"B\", HandlerB);}void Handle(string value){ if(handlers.TryGet(value, out var handler)) { var output = handler(input) } throw new ArgumentOrOfRangeException(nameof(value));}private SomeOutput HandlerA(SomeObject value){ // Do something for for value A...}private SomeOutput HandlerB(SomeObject value){ // Do something for for value B...}```",

You may want to use a predicate variable so that you can dynamically switch what method is being used to filter the inventory.",

Pick one resource and stick to it because if you try to do many things at once, it will overwhelm you. There are many great resources to learn programming. If you want to learn Web Development for example then I can say the Odin Project is a fantastic free resource. Almost everything I know about web programming I learned from the Odin Project. However, there is one important point you need to know when starting this journey. The motivation you feel right now will disappear, usually around the time when you can't solve some hard problem or can't fix a bug or you are trying for hours and don't get anywhere. Programming, especially once you can actually build cool Apps yourself can be very rewarding until it's not and you question why you even started. Just don't give up when you get to moments like that. Also don't let AI solve your problems. You might think you learned something if AI is doing the work but you actually didn't. If you gonna use AI then use it to ask questions about a concept you don't understand but don't vibe code your way to an app as you won't learn anything this way.",

Disclaimer: this is just my personal experience.What is really funny is that everyone assumes that physicists suck at coding. I have heard \"you're good for a physicist\" so many times, but I actually take it as a compliment. Most physicists don't care and want to make a throw away program. That's fine but if you want to learn how to make software that lasts longer than a single day, you obviously need to do something very different. I never really learned that systematically, I just kinda wanted to write stuff that was useful later, so I just naively tried to structure things more cleanly. I spent lots of time reading tutorials, reddit, other peoples code and whatnot. I did read \"Clean Code\" a year or so ago, and I thought it was ok but much is learned by trial and error, writing lots of bad code, rewriting it slightly better, changing the scope, trashing it again, and so on. Practice, practice, practice. And build nontrivial things, not just toy programs. If programs get big, you MUST apply some structure. I think you need to feel the pain of being stuck and then digging yourself out of that hole.Sorry for the ramble, your post kinda resonated with me. Let me know what you think",

All tasks can be solved through 'software' ways: You can install virtual machines on the MacBook and check how remote access works. You can set up a hypervisor on the PC, configure GPU passthrough, and run 2 virtual machines simultaneously: Windows for gaming and Linux for work tasks. I have set up remote access to my PC, there can be some obstacles. Home internet provider may use for your connection a 'gray' IP address. Also, some providers offer dynamic IPs, but this can be resolved by sending the address after startup. Additionally, the PC mainboard should support Wake on LAN.",

Soft skills are all about interaction with people and are very useful in the work place. They will help open a lot of doors regardless of industry. People in IT regardless of field have a very bad image with most people because a lot of us lack basics like conversation skills or team building. The old joke of a coder locked in a closet because no one wants to deal with him is what a lot of non technical people think of IT related jobs.Leadership skills are also very useful regardless of if you want to get into management or not down the line. Every project or team needs someone to lead it, why not you? It also helps with dealing with different levels of management. Something I learned a while ago is leaders don’t just lead those they are responsible for, they also lead their managers on up as well. Of the two this one has been very useful since I started developing it. As for how to learn them; soft skills are mostly about interaction with people on a regular basis. Help desk jobs are great for learning them but going to classes about anything you are interested in person is a great start. Just get a conversation started and keep it going. One big skill to learn is active listening. As for leadership I can recommend a couple of books to get you started if you are interested.",

For me it makes little sense creating a custom interface if I'm just going to use it in a single map statement or something. list.stream().map(just -> use.a.lambda.here()).toList();Is there an existing built in interface that does what you need? In the StringChecker example you gave I'd probably just use Predicate instead. Predicate stringChecker = s -> s.isEmpty();The stuff in \"java.util.function\" can cover a lot of use-cases, though sometimes you actually need to create something custom (like if you needed a TriConsumer or something like that).Generally I think it's a good idea to stick with standard built in stuff if you can get away with it, codebases are generally weird enough as it is so we should be careful about introducing new homemade weird stuff unless we have a good reason to do so.Edit: oh and you don't need to define a custom interface if you wanted to use the 'Class::Method' method ref syntax Predicate predicate = String::isEmpty; Edit2: re-read your question:I tend to prefer Class::Method syntax if it's used in a \"well known\" function, and or the lambda would require more than a couple of statements as I find it gives more \"semantic clarity\" on what it's doing, but I find it can often be quite confusing if it's some custom method I'm not familiar with since then I don't necessarily know what parameters gets sent to the method.for example \"take a list, filter null, convert to uppercase, print every item to console\" list.stream().filter(Objects::nonNull).map(String::toUpperCase).forEach(System.out::println); But here I don't really know what is happening ... foo(SomeClass::bar, SomeClass::baz);",

The design would either doesn't matter 1 bit (for internal business app) or done by people that focus on only that.You as the developper would write the code. And while you can have code available on GitHub, it will be very hard to have enough and of sufficient quality to really impress anybody. What you want is XP. Get internships and then work a few years in the field. This is what really count. 1 line like I did 6 month internship doing this or that in java it 100X more valuable that a few thousand line of java in GitHub.Also as well rounded dev, be sure to understand databases, networks and distributed systems (cloud providers, containers and kubernetes).

Feeling unsure about what to do next is completely normal, especially when you have multiple options in front of you.Since you mentioned interest in both full stack development and software development, here's a simple breakdown:# 1. If you want to become a Full Stack Developer:Start with web development. It's beginner-friendly, highly in demand, and offers a clear path. You can follow this roadmap:* HTML → CSS → JavaScript (vanilla)* Then move to React (frontend framework)* Learn Git/GitHub for version control* Then go into backend: Node.js + Express* For databases: MongoDB or PostgreSQL* Build real-world projects along the wayThis path gives you visible, hands-on progress and prepares you for full stack roles.# 2. If you're aiming for general Software Development or Big Tech:Then continue with C++ and go deeper into Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA). Companies like Google, Amazon, etc., focus heavily on problem-solving and core CS concepts. Your path could be:* Strengthen your C++ fundamentals* Learn DSA topics: arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.* Practice on platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces* Study core CS subjects: OS, DBMS, Networks, OOP# Still confused?Try both briefly spend a week or two on web dev, and then a week on DSA. See which one excites you more and where you feel more engaged. That’s usually a good signal for what path to follow.You're not behind you’re just in the exploring phase, which is totally fine. Stay consistent, build small things, and clarity will come. You've got this!",

That was equivalent to all of Europes working games sector numbers at the time. 1-2% were hired on graduation. I would suggest that what we see now is bad but it’s more in line with historical trends than what we remember from 5-6 years ago. It is probably still not as bad as it was around 2001 where there was practically nothing to apply for let alone competition.

I'd say hardwork and talent are maybe in the top 10 factors of success. Perseverance in the top 5. Luck and timing play a much larger part. There are entire years where hiring is frozen. An entire graduating cs class is screwed over through no fault of their own. Or your interviewer is in a bad mood. Or your resume just happened to be somewhere in the stack that the recruiter lost focused like right before lunch. I'm saying people need to give up easier and cut their losses sooner.

Like, I would love to get into a job that pays a decent wage like CNC operator, Auto mechanic, or even a teacher, but I can't get hired for those positions with my credentials without someone taking a massive chance.Right now my only option is to get a minimum wage job and play the, \"man I hope someone in a better position chokes on a chicken bone so I can take their place and get a fat $2 bump in pay!\" I am sure it is a lot of peoples only option at the moment too.So what, ten, fifteen years from now we will have a bunch of educated baristas but that is ok because the job market \"healed?\"",

Its doubtful they intend on contesting the international team's implicit claim, more fearful of career reprecussions for themselves than eager to fight for some benefit to you. **Unless you are willing to probe for information about the stance of your team's corporate leadership, begin a dialogue with them, rope them into your scheme to transfer oversight of the globalization initiative to your team** ***and line your manager up to be prepared to shoulder that responsibility*** **and the potential flak from the international team who've sunk their teeth into the project,** then you are likely better off not rocking the boat and *seeking a path that doesn't directly put you into conflict with another team.* If your manager is a pushover who isn't willing to advocate for you when you've done outstanding work, who doesn't seize the initiative to advance the team's standing or garner meaningful connections up the hierarchy, ***you genuinely might be better off trying to use this situation to create an*** *\"****in****\"* ***for yourself with the international team*** so long as they aren't actively hostile to you. They clearly have leadership better suited to leveraging your skillset to advance ***their*** prospects. If you think they are honest folks trying to not let a good idea go to waste rather than vultures exploiting your obscurity, you may have more opportunities after a transfer to their team than under your own...Or just put the code on the cloud and cash your checks playing it safe with the current manager.

You don't actually have enough evidence to justify leaping to that conclusion. Big companies don't really operate in the way that you seem to think. Have you ever heard anecdotal stories where the janitor suggests something unusual to the CEO, that ends up saving a company millions of dollars? When that actually happens, the janitor is not usually the one who's actually put in charge of the global rollout of his good idea (nor is it his janitorial team/department), and at best the janitor gets a small bonus or maybe a one level promotion -- it's not as if the janitor suddenly becomes a VP off of one good idea.",

As your manager or mentor, I would want to work with you on that preoccupation because it can be career-limiting. Your focus should be on adding value rather than making sure you are getting “credit” for every thing you do. HR would tell you that is what your compensation is for and you can document on your self-assessment for your performance review. I would never utter the word “credit” again as this all transpires.Having said that, this is a wonderful opportunity and quite flattering for anyone, never mind someone early in his career. I would suggest writing a lengthy email about your concerns. You can start it with, “As the architect of this process ….. it has come to my attention… and in order to ensure maximum success…. I want to make everyone is aware xxxxxxx” List the important stuff, like why you think this won’t scale and why each instance needs to be customized. But offer fixes to the problems as well. How can this be customized so that it does work for other departments? What work effort would be required? Be specific and as lengthy as you need to be, as you will be saving them time and possible embarrassment. Also, if it doesn’t scale, you could end up being blamed, (“who created this in the first place”)Send your email to all interested parties and cc: your boss. Again, make sure the email is emotionless, fact-based and solely focused on you trying to help the company and the team to succeed. Of course, this also serves as your documentation that you are the originator.Try not to assume the worst in people. You created something so good that an upper level manager thought it was good enough to scale to other departments. The higher up managers are, the less they know about what is happening on the ground, so don’t take it personally.",

Trump is the one who passed the bill to make that all happen.Now onto the BBB, the long and short of it is, it's likely going to tank the value of the dollar. Increased government spending (practically across the board), less taxes, more borrowing.I genuinely say this as a die-hard fiscal conservative: This is ***not*** about Trump. This is ***not*** about party politics. This is about the value of the dollar, and how it plays a key role in global international politics.The USA is going to have a Brexit-level fall off. Probably not as quick or crazy as Brexit itself was, we're probably not going to see something like a Liz Truss moment, but it's going to be on the same level.Look up the 1981 recession if you want an idea of what's likely to come / what's an early warning sign, and do what you can to keep making smart decisions.",

I’ve been in contact with folks at my company since they first started layoffs in 2023. I personally know a couple of people who this summer are moving back in with their parents because they can’t land a job. That’s with my FAANG company in the resume. No it’s not Amazon or Meta. I know some with families who were forced to pack up and move across the country. I know some who got laid off after moving. I know some who can’t move their families so they have to fly across states every weekend just to be with them on the weekends. I know some who went from making 300k+ to around 150k - 80k. I don’t want to cause any alarm. But there are my personal anecdotes. I always try to keep in touch with coworkers, it’s just something I do. Yes, there are some who managed to land jobs at other high paying companies. But I’ve noticed that these people are either really smart or went to top colleges (Stanford, Cornell, MIT, etc). I went to a shitty state school and for the most part I’m severely average. Do I really want to be constantly grinding for the rest of my life? I’ve been interviewing candidates for the last 2 years. The level of talent is insane. These kids who only graduated like 3-4 years after me are such sweats, they can solve these leetcode hards like it’s nothing.

        "body": "The tech industry has been brutal since late 2022. Even experienced engineers with years at FAANG companies are struggling to find roles. New grads and career changers are facing an especially tough time because companies are prioritizing candidates with direct full-time experience.Pivots to consider- technical program management, business analyst in tech, implementation specialist, tech roles in traditional industries: banks, healthcare systems, and government agencies, sales engineering.Also consider contract or part-time technical work through platforms like Toptal or directly with agencies.Use a service like Applyre to see what's out there. Also look into technical writing, training development, or even teaching coding bootcamps.Your education absolutely hasn't been wasted. The combination of technical skills and business knowledge is incredibly valuable, even if the current market isn't reflecting that. Economic cycles change, and your credentials will serve you well when conditions improve.",

I dropped out of med school to get into tech and there were definitely moments where I questioned if I made the right call, especially during those brutal rejection cycles.The market right now is absolutely insanee. Even people with solid backgrounds like yours are getting ghosted left and right. It's not a reflection of your worth or abilities, the hiring process is just broken in a lot of ways.Something I've noticed works better than the traditional apply and pray approach is that you need stuff people can actually see and touch. Your GPA and internships are great but recruiters want to see what you can build. Even small projects on GitHub that solve real problems can make a huge difference.Also, have you considered bootcamps? I know it might seem like a step backward given your background, but sometimes the structured approach and job placement support is what breaks through. At Metana we've had people with CS degrees who just couldn't crack the interview process, and the hands-on training plus career support made all the difference.The other thing is, what specific roles are you targeting? Sometimes pivoting within tech (like from pure SWE to product management, technical sales, or developer relations) can open doors that weren't there before.Your education definitely wasn't wasted even if it feels that way right now. Those problem solving skills transfer to pretty much anything. But I get the frustration, job hunting is soul crushing.Take a breather if you need to, but don't give up just yet :) The market will turn around.",

I specifically went to this one because it was known as the palce that you could have work-life balance and I Was going to make 120k with 45k in stock a year. But I didnt realize I was going into cloud and cloud is the death of work life balance in FAANG. I learned the hardway and spent 3 stressful years playing their game. I didnt leave because by the time I saw how bad it was, the market was going down and I didnt want to spend a year or two unemployed. I got fired after 3 years due to low perforamance but I was working 10x more than my first job. Thankfully I bounced back in 3 months, got a job in big tech that paid more and has been more chill.",

As you can imagine this was a vicious cycle that never really got any better until I left.Fortunately the beauty of remote work is that you can generally find a workplace that will accommodate you, especially if you don't live on the west coast and can take advantage of the time zone difference.edit: It's unfortunately very normal for some workplaces to be like that.

Which basically means that you should see that your manager is consistently messaging you at 7:40, and you should be adjusting your entire life to make sure you get around to that more promptly.You have to make a judgement call on whether you think this company / your manager is like that too, and whether or not you care enough to do this sort of people pleasing.Also, if it doesn't feel \"painfully obvious\" on whether or not your manager / company is like that, you should just ask. \"Hey, you know those messages you send to me around 7:40? Do I need to get to those more promptly, or is they delay fine?\"Edit: I think there's a lot of over negativity in this comment section. Not saying that it's not warranted, as I said there are \"plenty of places / people out there...\", but no one should be paranoid about this stuff.",

None of these interviews got past the second of 4+ rounds, regardless of whether the personal or technical interview came second or how well any of them went. The only feedback I ever got was that they were going with more experienced applicants.Eventually got a new job in a non-tech field.Absolutely insane out there compared to getting my first tech job in 2022 with no YOE, just a few portfolio projects, from about 100 applications over 3 months.> I wonder how many of these applicants tried referrals. Lol. I reached out to every single non-coworker connection in the industry I have(about a dozen) - all of whom had spent 2021-2023 offering me interviews at any time. In 2024 when I reached out, none of their companies were hiring devs anymore, or were actively laying them off, or my referrals had been laid off themselves. Why would I send out nearly a thousand applications without thinking to try referrals?",

        "body": "Hey, Im a Comp Eng major (1st year though), and I can relate to what youre saying. Let me give you my perspective. I think your questioning isnt only about software engineering itself. It touches how we roll our lives on the big picture.As humans, our likes change over time, **and this is completely fine.**Oh gosh, if only you knew how cruel it is to realize for the first time you dont like to do that activity anymore that just a couple of years ago you could do with your hands tied. Did you lose yourself somewhere?Answer: no. Actually, you still like to do it, you just dont have that blasting flame anymore, and its ok. You cant lose yourself, because you *are* yourself. But you have to know that yourself is not static, it will change. And so will you. So now, you can bang your head against the wall wondering why you are no longer the person you were 10 years ago, or you can recognize that you may have changed, and if that is the case, welcome this change with open arms. After all, this is still you. Why reject it?But I understand that everything may still feel blurry to you, as it is often the case when we have ourselves facing such big changes. So maybe you're best off waiting before moving. You know the saying, la nuit porte conseil. In your case, you may need many nuits. You already gave a BIG step: acknowledging that you may be changing. Now, give time to time, to see how this will unfold. Maybe it's just a phase. Maybe not, and you need time for your mind to recognize the change, to stick to it, to decide that you you want to live by it from now on, and to be able to justify itself to you, so that when you ask yourself why you changed, it can reassure you that you did it because it felt better that way.In any case, dont rush to find it out. A definitive position will click when you least expect. And if its just a phase, well, I think you know how to go on with your life then.If its not, remember you will feel 'empty' during some time during the transition, and this is a part of the process. Transitioning can take longer than you expect, but profit from every moment. Do things you wouldnt do in other times, and remember something really cool awaits you. Sooner or later, you will be gifted with new likes and will feel complete once again.",

One tool I like is www.faangresume.ai, but there are tons. 2 years is not too long as long as you have a story and relevant continuing projects (which can be self directed).

Saying the time to be too proud to work is over and you're maybe at risk of being homeless. That, in the USA is a fate worse than death, in my opinion.So I totally get you want to focus on front end work, but the time to be selective is while you're employed not when you're looking. My advice is get your priorities straight, and in this order; get a job, then get picky when you have the bills covered!Meanwhile, have you turned to state/city employment agencies? Look, you can't let 'liking' a job be the overarching concern. First you have to care for the necessities of life, like food, rent, utilities, transportation, gas and insurance. Honestly? Liking the job is waaay down the list (unless you're independently wealthy and/or can scurry home to live with family). Otherwise, it's my opinion it's long past time you can be choosy.Good luck.",

I chose to send them every W2 over the past 4 years as well as every pay stub for 2015 to verify current employment instead of giving permission to contact my current job (which is a valid option they gave me). Took me quite a bit of time to properly redact certain info (as requested), and they still basically just listed it as unverified. Then for a couple of 5+ year speeding tickets I had, they listed that they weren’t paid. That one pissed me off because that just sets a pretty ugly first impression in my opinion even if not that big of a deal. I submitted an attestation and the hiring organization cleared me as good in the mean time anyways, but about 2 weeks later they corrected it.",

It may be that some day programming is not how I do that, but my background as an engineer got me X, Y, and Z along the way. I also believe it has never been easier to stand out.

I built great relationships and even got things like net 90 day terms instead of 30 and much lower MOQ’s.- I led marketing at a few companies and was more easily able to focus on localization and global expansion.

The rest of the world is generally less so, you will need to achieve a high level of fluency before you will have any luck looking for work and even then, there are some cultures (ex. Germany, Turkiye, most of eastern Europe) that would rather hire someone from that culture who speaks English over an outsider who speaks their language. You will never have priority over someone from that culture, unless you offer a particular technical skillset that they can't find. This is xenophobia imo but it is what it is.2. People tend to be misled by online courses claiming they can become fluent in 3-6 months. You can learn the basics of many languages quickly, but actual fluency can take years, especially if you want to read and write Mandarin. In terms of professional development and career payoff, the ROI relative to effort is very low. You could learn several new tech stacks well in the time it would take you to learn Mandarin.3. The tech industry works primarily in English. One of my former employers had teams in China and Portugal that I worked closely with and it wasn't uncommon for them to discuss technical problems in English.I speak several languages to a relatively high degree of fluency and, while it's a great hobby for personal growth, the payoff is really poor for career opportunities. If you want to do it because you just like those cultures, go for it, but I wouldn't expect to get anything from a professional development perspective.",

I made it to the late stages with five different companies, all past the technical round. But was rejected from three. I was able to end the prices with one when I got the offer at my current job What follows is my anecdotal experience. Companies are extremely picky right now. I would feel really strong about my interview performance. I would connect with the hiring managers and the CEO or CTO. I would feel great about my technical round performance. Then I wouldn't get the role. The reasons given, because I would always ask for feedback, were typically that I performed well, but someone was a better fit. Which makes sense. There were probably five hundred or more applicants. But a few of those I would see the same job posted a week or two later, those were frustrating. My advice is to keep a pipeline going. You want a few of those initial recruiter interviews a week so that you have a couple of technical and later stage interviews going at all times. The process seems slower than it used to, like a month or longer from application to offer. And give yourself grace. This is really difficult and you are going to get down on yourself. My wife described it like buying a house, you get really attached to an idea of a place where you start imagining yourself only to be out bid. But only one has to work out. Sorry if that was super long. I hope your job hunt goes well.",

Culture, food, easy travel (Schiphol LMAO) and so on are good things. Money, it may sound like a lot to make $200k a year, unless you live in Topeka Kansas the cost of living will make most of it balance out. Then it's family situation. If you have kids going to college, it's phenomenally expensive. Medical care too. Funny or strange taxes. And so on. The USA gives you more options and has much simpler bureaucracy than most of Europe. If you're young and restless as we say it's not a bad idea to work here for a few years. But long term today is not as clear to consider the USA is better even at more pay. Depending on what you want of course.I'm retiring in France in 3 years. Not French, and hopefully B2 French by then. I have often regretted not staying in Europe but back then options weren't as plentiful as here. Still aren't. Bottom line. If you value money vs quality of life, or adventure vs quieter life, America is good. But it's changing, as is Europe.",

        "body": "FYI: most of these comments are from students or new grads who have maybe worked 1 or 2 shitty jobs. The real answer is that it entirely depends. Compared to the Netherlands, the US is a massive country where each role and each company and each city will lead to a VERY different life. If you move to the US you might be working 80 hour weeks with barely enough to pay rent and get laid off after 2 months, OR you might work 40 hour weeks, earn $300k+, have plenty of vacation days, and stay at the same place for 5/10/15+ years. So, my advice:- Apply around to roles in mid- or large-sized cities (NYC, Seattle, Chicago, etc.)- Interview IN PERSON (do not assume anything about a company based purely on what they sell you during an online interview - make sure their success is tangible) and thoroughly research employee reviews - Only accept an offer if your gross income will be 2x the household median income or higher FOR THAT SPECIFIC AREA - Do not actually move until you have signed an offer and your start date is <2 weeks away - Keep an emergency fund of at least $30k In general, just be smart about it and you’ll be fine. Edit: just want to mention that this advice is specially for OP. Someone with less experience or who lives in the US already doesn’t need to have as high of standards.",

They might only have 2 weeks PTO, might be 100% in the office, might have a terrible company culture, are extremely low paying (less than 104k), etc.For others, it's great. They have 4-7 weeks PTO, are hybrid, or even fully remove, with a great company culture that is extremely high paying.And a million flavors in-between. There is no single concept of being a SWE in the US. There is a ton of variety.My main advice is to never move before you actually have a job lined up. Don't move to SF with the hopes that the move will land you a good job, because there's a real possibility that it won't. If you want to move to SF, look for jobs in SF, and only move once you find one you like, that meets all your personal criteria.As for COL, AI, and google searches aren't good here. Don't rely on a calculator to tell you that you need to earn $X. Living in a big city is inherently different than living in the burbs. Those calculators try to project what it would cost for you to buy a 2-3 BR house in the middle of the city, which is obviously millions. But in reality, nobody living in the city is buying a 2-3 BR house. They're buying a 0-1BR condo. It's an inherent difference in lifestyle. Calculators don't take that into account. They're also not great at taking into account neighborhoods. If you want to live frugally, you can absolutely find neighborhoods that are cheaper. If you want to live extravagently, you can absolutely find neighborhoods for that too. Calculators just average out an entire city, as if there aren't 100 neighborhoods within that city each with their own COL and culture.Compute the COL difference on your own. When I moved from the Midwest to the East Coast, I actually looked for apartments that were in an area I wanted to live in. That gave me a realistic number of what it would cost for me to move, and what my COL hike would be. Find apartments you would *actually* live in. That's your COL increase.",

If this subreddit was my gauge for the market, I may as well have just ended it rather than started looking for another job.Instead, I just started job searching, market be damned. Was the search easy? Obviously not. But I still managed to line up an amazing job in just under 3 months.That's what you need to do.

Chronic pain issues, like what? Are you injured, is it just pain because you sit at a desk for 10 hours a day? Either way that's a physiotherapist/doctor issue. Depression would be a therapy thing, I imagine that it's linked to your health too. I'd be pretty sad too if I had to live with chronic pain. Don't worry about your girlfriend, if she's good for you she won't leave you because you lost your job.. but the caveat is that she might have a chat with you or *consider* leaving you because you're not willing to fix your situation. No woman in the world wants to play mother to their boyfriend (unless they're abused or manipulative). Either way, you're smart and driven enough to work in this industry I'm sure that wouldn't be the reason a good girl would leave you. But your depression and anxiety? it might contribute, not specifically because you have depression or anxiety, but because of what depression and anxiety can do to you and those around you. So you need to really lock in and get those things sorted. How? idk, therapy? but ask someone more qualified than me (probably a therapist lol). At the end of the day, no matter what job you pick you still have to pick a flavour of shit to eat. I've worked everything from warehousing, labouring, construction to office based engineering.. all are good and all can be shit. At the worst you could probably try a more \"chill\" job that pays less, like part time stocking shelves or something. Or maybe labouring outside (I loved the physical do what you're told-ness part).

I've had bad managers before, but it doesn't have anything to do with my introvertedness. Just ask yourself that question. If there was a deeper reason behind this PIP, figuring that out would benefit your career. Ignoring it, blaming your quietness, and carrying whatever trait got you fired with you the rest of your life will make your career very painful.",

        "body": "I had a guy like that on my team. He wanted the whole codebase changed basically and when he didnt get his way he'd go to Jr engineers PR and lightly suggest these nitpicky changes. I dont mind changing a variable name or a method name or even a small refactor in a file I am touching. Things that wont add a shitload of time to the PR. Like if im already making a change to a file and someone had a nitpick comment I think I can quickly add, ill add it. But sometimes in the cases where it is beyond the scope of the PR I think doing what Sidereel said is the way to go. Most jobs reveiw you on your PRs and output. If it doesnt have a task, then they assume you didnt do it. Even if you do it yourself, it's better to create a seperate task because now you have the proof that you worked on something. Like let's say your task involves, creating a new method in Foo class to make Foo multithreaded or some BS like that. Principal Engineer who loves to nitpick, adds \"since you are touching this file, this other irrelevent method (let's call someMethod) just doesnt look good in this file and would be better used in Boo class. Please move it to Boo class\" When you look into it, you realize Foo::someMethod gets called in a few files that could take at least an hour of your time to fix, build, test, etc. You can either change it in the current PR because it's easier than having to create a new branch, rebuild, retest, etc. But the downside is when the current PR gets checked, you wont get credit for that refactor becuase that wasnt part of the task. So your manager will see all the tasks you have completed and he wont give you credit for that refactor. He will view it as the PR took you longer than it should've. But if you create a seperate task, sure it might not get fixed right away but once you do it, you will get credit for the refactor. Software enginneering is about playing the game. A piece of advice I heard was, it's better to do two tasks and show your manager all the work you did than to do 10 tasks and not say anything about it. Some higher level engineers dont care about your career that much they care to get what they want in the codebase. They have the belief that it's on you to defend your career (which it is) and if you are going to be a pushover than so be it. I learned that mistake a little too late. When the higher level engineer ask for something, I did it with little pushback. I wasnt afraid to say something I just didnt think it was a big deal. But then my PRs had more iterations than they should've and would spend an extra day or two longer due to some of these changes this guy wanted. Guess what was said in my review session? That my PRs take a bit too long and have a bit too much iterations. Guess who told my manager that? The higher level engineer. I think if it takes too long and is outside of the range of the PR, just politely say \"I gave it a quick look. It seems that this is outside of the scope of the ticket. WE can have a quick chat and if it's really needed I can create a seperate ticket for this.\"",

I had around 5 serious interviews and ended up with two offers, the one I accepted i just started this week. It’s going to vary wildly and i consider myself pretty fortunate that this position was posted at the right time and the tech stack was right up my alley and fairly niche. I also studied like crazy for each interview and prepped according to reviews posted on Glassdoor. In my hunt, i found a lot of jobs that were hiring where one could “get by” while still applying. Think local/state government contracts as well as contracting for companies. Pay was fine, benefits sucked, but those seemed easiest to get. So the answer is, it depends. Not counting the BS applications i sent out after accepting this offer to keep unemployment, i was at 35 total. This position was the 11th i applied for.",

Each product manager has a different set of skills. Each product demands a different set of skills.There is inwards and outwards focused parts of the job. I've seen plenty of introverted product managers so long as you can still articulate and do the coordination part of the role, not every product manager is the energy spewer.You can understand whether you will succeed in product management by the views you take on things as a developer. How much you prioritise the business goals over the technical goals (etc, etc).Do you feel comfortable taking what the team is telling you and communicating that to leadership (spending time on powerpoint, and project management software to communicate this). Do feel comfortable interpreting and communicating changing demands from the leadership to the team?I will regularly talk about what I don't know and the path gaining that knowledge. Having said that tools like NotebookLM and equivalent have made it much easier to become a rapid expert on a given subject.Gaps in CVs depend heavily on how you sell it. Selling it as T shaped individual is an amazing way to make yourself look better not worse. I've taken large amounts of time off and live a fairly unorthodox life (nomadic) and if anything it's helped my career rather than hindered it. I'm seen as a little bit crazy and edgy and that helps break preconceptions.Things like taking up sailing or other activities can be a great way of demonstrating that you have depth. Writing and art are both things that are very shareable and show passion. Being an amazing writer can be a great way of enhancing your (introvert focused) communication.Long and short though is that I wouldn't lie at all. I would definitely take everything you believe about yourself and spin it to explain why that would make you a good product manager. Every development experience that exposed you to good and bad product management. Every time you stepped in to wear that hat.I'm expecting there to be a real hybridization of some of these roles anyway over the next few years with the increasing impact of AI, so enhancing your skills on this side is a wise move regardless of whether you become a fulltime product manager.",

At Slack, our most successful PM was an ex-engineer who would straight-up say, \"I don't know, let me find out\" in stakeholder meetings. That intellectual honesty built more trust than any amount of confident bullshitting ever could. Your dev background gives you a massive advantage because you actually understand what's possible and what's painful to build, which is surprisingly rare. Own that art/writing gap. It shows you think differently and have a broader perspective on user experience and storytelling, both crucial for PM work. The buzzword thing is spot-on; the best PMs translate complex ideas into simple language that engineers, designers, and executives all understand differently. If you want to level up your PM knowledge systematically, Product Alliance has some of the most comprehensive interview prep and frameworks I've seen. Their modules cover everything from product sense to execution and they're particularly strong on teaching you how to structure your thinking without relying on empty jargon. Don't fake being someone else. The industry needs more thoughtful, technically-grounded PMs who ask hard questions rather than confident performers who can't actually ship anything.",

It seemed like it was worthwhile, as I really wanted to expand my horizons and I feel I'm valuable as a leader. The politics were very difficult, sometimes. The work piled up, as I was expected to be an IC sometimes, help other ICs, run a team, and help run a department. Meanwhile, the pay did not scale with the work, and in fact the job opportunities compared to IC opportunities were not as sustainable. This meant less jobs open, and lower salaries at the top end compared with other senior engineering positions. I feel that you have to find the right situation with a manager who can effectively protect your time and scope, so you aren't doing too much. You also need help, politically, so you're not swimming upstream against people more senior than yourself. Of course, you have to be pretty dedicated to doing a good job, on top of that. It's a lot. I do believe that there are probably thousands of successful engineering managers/leads, but I also believe that many are burned out or are burning out. Maybe if you feel excited, it's worth trying, but if you keep getting burned out, it's time to retreat back to the IC world. I'm honestly still trying to figure out what I'd do next. Good luck OP and let me know if you have any questions. I was a team lead/engineering manager for several years at big banks, with 30 total YOE.",

You can start by asking them where the holdups are and see what they say/ take it from there. The goal is two fold - teach/unblock and diagnose the situation (how unrealistic an ask vs how much of this was them)",

Not everyone on my team has the skills to manage epic level work streams, but everyone is forced to try. Once you can delegate the work streams, the job then becomes about planning what those work streams will be, coordinating the various stakeholders, and inevitably dealing with whatever crisis comes up.When an engineer is under-performing, it's on them to ask for the help they need. With 8 people on the team, that's a lot of individual work to over see, and I imagine it'd be all consuming. Therefore, it's okay to look out for the engineers on your team, make sure they have the work streams they need for a good review, but you need to let them do the work and decide when they need help. I'll never be able to apply my own standards to under-performers, but to some extent doesn't it doesn't matter. If an engineer isn't a net benefit to the project, and I can't help them become one, I just involve management and we deal with it that way. Team lead is not a people management job: it's not command, but the soft power of influence.At least on my team, as a lead I try to focus on three things: planning, communication with other teams, and review of our execution. Most of my focus is on long term planning, and the sprint plans are basically up to the engineers. After all, the team lead is in a unique position of owning the outcome of the team, that all parts fit together and contribute to whatever goal management put you on. From that view, the single most important thing you can do is ensuring the project is going in the right direction.Doing a great job as a team lead, you'll essentially make yourself redundant. Most of the work you are describing, could be by the people on the team with only a little coordination cost.",

As you progress in your career, people will start to look towards you to make that judgement call, and it’s your responsibility to make it an informed decision. The way I do this is to lean on technical design docs (keeping as concise as possible) to get help revealing things I haven’t considered. It’s mostly to minimize risk",

A couple of years ago I felt like I just would see how things were done by seniors and kind of just accepted that, but once I had to actually do those things and understand why we needed them, my confidence and understanding started to change. There’s now this certain confidence in myself that I can piece an entire system together and not have any “I don’t know why we need this but we do” type of moments.

Depending on the place you're employed that may not be an option. IE if you're in a faang and they pay you a dump truck full of money every year that may not be an option for you. If you're expected to push through the burn out or get pipped out, you may want to start looking for a job with better wlb and take the pay cut. There's only a special type of person that can go ham literally 100% of the time.But, if you are already in a position where you can decide to put up some boundaries when needed then you NEED to do it asap. For now: Since you are already burned out, you have to stop working at the end of the day AND learn how to turn off your work brain when you do. It is a skill and it takes practice. It's like meditation. When you catch yourself doing a work thought you need to intentionally and consciously think about something else. If that means you go do something else or change your physical location then that's what you do. You need to stop thinking about work in order to recover from work.Once youve already crossed over into being burned out, it may take some time (weeks or months depending on how bad the burnout is) for better boundaries to start making you feel better. But in my experience it does eventually happen. Just remember for the future that you need to be vigilant about the signs that you're working too much. It's something we do to get ahead and it can be good but if you want to be at your best you have to compromise with what is possible. Don't ignore your warning signs. It will take longer to recover the longer you push past them.",

System design is well written about and a lot of free content you can find to fill that gap. System design isn't even taught in most CS programs so if you're expecting that from a CS degree you'll be left wondering why they graduate students with so little system design knowledge.

A significant part of our job is process/red-tape. At startups, process/red-tape can be straight up non-existant. You're lucky if you end up at a startup that has some halway decent dev processes in place.But at a large company, process is key. There are very strict best practices in place. There's very strict change management, very strict approvals, very strict boundaries of responsibility, etc, etc, etc. They're simply too large to let devs just cowboy code some stuff into prod that gets introduced to their millions of users right away. They also have internal and external audits to think about, where they're straight up auditing *the process*. If your processes aren't good, you're going to fail an audit, and failing an external audit can have a significant negative impact on the company and its clients.All companies will feel slow compared to startups. Not just big tech. Startups are trying to get their code and product out into the world as fast as humanly possible. It's like Facebook's old mantra (which they've since ditched) \"Move Fast and Break Things\". Who cares if what you released into prod broke something? You'll have a patch up in 10 minutes.Established companies are more focused on keeping things stable, not distrupting their user base, staying in compliance with all the many compliance/regulations/frameworks they need to abide to to make their customers feel warm and fuzzy inside. A short downtime can easily lose 6-7 figures for them, whereas a startup DGAF about downtime. The benefit of releasing code quickly outweights whatever negative would come from prod issues.One thing that will be very valuable for *you* from a career-growth perspective is seeing what heavy-process looks like. Look at what this company is doing, how it differs from the startup world, what the pros/cons are, etc. That gives you multiple perspectives to view any given problem from in the future. You can consider stability and process, while also considering quick delivery. There's ***a lot*** of companies in-between the 2 extremes that highly value that kind of perspective.",

Company was losing projects and it seemed I was going to maintenance hell for some time. I jumped ship to make 120k+ with stock and good bonuses. It was 3 years of mental burnout from the start. I dont regret the money I made but I somewhat regret jumping ship due to mental breakdown.IM not saying the new job will suck but sometimes there is a thing about staying at a company that treats you well even if the work slows down a bit. It happens in many companies it's on you to decide whether it's worth it or not. For 136k base pay vs 150k base pay and the options you are getting, id stay at the job. Im sure it's getting boring but you know the work, you have more job security, the people likely love you. You get 2 fridays off a month (i've done 9/80 and I love it and wish I could go back to it). I dont like including bonuses as part of pay because they are not guaranteed and it's just used as a way to get you there. So really consider it as you only make an extra 14k. Is 14k worth travelling 4 hours, having to work 5 days a week every week, potentially losing work-life balance (this is a big one), etc. At your job I know it'sa bout 22% bonus, that's amazing, you are likely more guaranteed to get that 22% at your current job than your new job because they will take into account the years you have put in good work where the new job wont give you 30% the first year because the first year they likely are hoping you catch up. Theyll give you enough to be happy but I doubt it will be 30% and who knows how much they give you in followin gyears. I was told when I moved companies that Id get 10% raises and 20% bonuses almost every year. In year 1, they decided to not give raises to anybody due to market. Usually companies that give amazing bonuses are the first to give no bonuses on a down year.",

From my experience, 99% of new devs (interns, salaried, contract, whatever) get that same feeling when jumping into an established company with an established codebase. No reasonable person will expect you to \"just get it\" right off the bat. Keep asking questions until it clicks. It's the only way you will learn.That said, what I wish I had done much sooner was to just spend time with the software. Poke around. Get a feel for what the user's experience will be. Try to understand what problem it is that your software is trying to solve.For me, I jumped into smart agriculture development with zero farm experience. It wasn't until I sat in a combine and just drove around for a day that I understood why x button is there, why menu z is nested in menu y, etc.From there, you can start to understand the hows and whys of the software design. Most frameworks just tackle one area (except maybe for the \"we've got it all\" frameworks like Qt), so understand what frameworks/middleware you're using and, more importantly, why you're using it.Another thing you can do it almost any industry is look at other people's PRs. Presuming the title is \"fixed a bug where x would happen when you do y\", make a chain in your head between x and y and the chunk of code that was modified. It's a decent way to start connecting those dots. Plus, informally, it looks very good if you can say \"oh yeah, I saw something about that in Tim's PR\" since it shows you're engaged and taking an active interest.On a less technical note, nobody gets mad at the new guy for asking questions because they understand it's all a lot to take in. They have all been exactly where you are right now. What people DO get upset with is a developer who has been onboard for 6 months, a year, 3 years, or whatever and still doesn't know some of the basic things. Ask questions, take organized notes.Otherwise, if you have any specific questions about the industry you're in, what frameworks you're using, etc, feel free to ask her and we can lend a hand or at least point you in the right direction!",

You are not dumb, my friend.My advice is to find a colleague, maybe someone in your team or someone who’s working on something you’re curious about/interested in, and schedule a 30 minute meeting with them. Ask them about their journey and their role in the company. And then talk to them about yourself and your journey. If you like the conversation, make it a point to speak to them regularly. Congratulations, you just got yourself a mentor.The mentor will look out for you. They’ll give you some guidance and hopefully show you the ropes. They can help you parse the code base. And if they don’t have an exact answer, chances are they know someone who does. They’ll help facilitate those other connections. See, something you learn is that people love flattery. And there’s nothing more flattering than a young person latching on to you and seeking you out because you gave them clarity. That’s the power of networking.Best of luck out there. Deep breaths.

The only people that use the applications I've written are the 7 people on our team and they aren't scalable anyway. I get the impression that the impact of the projects you worked on is pretty important when talking about your experience.I'm going to work on upskilling, but I feel like there's a huge difference between just learning something and using it day-to-day (which I'm not going to get the opportunity to do in my current role), so I'm not going to be as comfortable with whatever I learn compared to others with the same level of experience.",

        "body": "Congrats.Your first week is usually onboarding., depending on company you either talk to your manager to decide how you're first few weeks will look like or you take an onboarding course. It varies by company. But in the end there should be an onboarding of how to build, test, etc.Before any of that, your first day will likely be signing up for benefits (insurances), payroll, etc. This shoudl be the absolute first thing you do so you get your money in the bank and not through a check mailed to you.Get your W-4 completed (takes like 5 minutes tops). Im not a financial adviser in any way but if you get RSUs, i'd suggest having them take a certain amount extra per check to account for the RSUs when you start to get them. I got burned by this the fist time I got RSUs. Because tehy are considered bonus they are taxed differently so I ended up owing a good amount to the IRS my first year. Ideally I try to have them take 100 per check to account for that.Sign up for any 401k accounts too. Your future self will thank you later. Put as much as you think is fair, experts suggest 12-15% a year.As for the job. Your first week is usually onboarding and then you get small tasks and build up confidence in the code. Ask your manager when he expects you to start getting bigger tasks. If he/she says in 3 months, try to get ahead of everything. If they say that the first week they only expect you to run tests and build, try to get that doen within the first few days and then by thursday tell them you are done and if you can at least look at the first task to get an idea of where to start.Ask questions, dont be afraid to reach out to people. it's scary at first but passive devs are the ones that get booted. If you start doing it before your manager has to say it, your manager will thank you. Managers have so much on their plate so they love devs who they dont ahve to say anything to, they just trust the dev will always be ahead of the pack. So if your manager is hoping to get you a task after 3 months, try to be ready at the 2nd month. Better to have him tell you to slow down then having to tell you to hurry up. Edit: also just to add. To emphasive the dont be a passive dev, report what you do. You have to play a game to a certain level. I once had a seniro dev tell me that it is better to do 2 tasks and report it during stand up and create dialogue about it (take ove rthe screen and show results for example, ask questions about being stuck, etc) than it is to do 10 tasks and just make simple 1 comment about progress that doesnt create discussion. Being stuck on the same task that should've taken a few days, but you are just stuck for weeks and dont say anything in stand up is a huge turnoff. Also find a mentor or senior friend you can do work with at a certain point. Someone who will hype you up to the manager and you can work along side with. At a certain point if you can be the guy who gets name-called during stand up, that's a plus. Even in meetings wher eyou are not there. Im talking about when someone has a report and they say \"OP helped me get past this issue\" or \"OP made an interesting observation\" at a certain point someone is going to say \"wow OP is making good contributions\" and someone might be like \"who is this OP everybody is talking about\".",

The key is being upfront about what you know and what you're eager to learn, rather than trying to oversell your experience.You're not really overqualified for mid-level positions - you're differently qualified, which can work in your favor if you frame it right. Focus on the problem-solving aspects, the full ownership you've taken of projects, and your ability to work independently, but also emphasize your excitement about learning team dynamics and industry standards. Many companies actually love hiring PhD holders because you bring analytical thinking and persistence that's hard to teach. The trick is convincing them in interviews that you can adapt to their environment and that your unconventional path is an asset, not a liability.

This is somewhat similar to Stanford's program but is \"stackable\" towards a full Master's degree in AI & ML.Personally, I'm leaning towards UWash because of the \"stackable\" feature and also since I'm in the area.",

I’m so old, i took the original Coursera version (apparently known as CS229A in Stanford parlance) back in 2012. Brilliant in terms of applied learning, besides their use of Octave (big lol). Not a ton on theory. The beginning of CS229 looks very similar. While it’d be great to take those courses, I’d really need to feel like I’m getting something to justify the cost. Even if I can spread it over years and get my company to fork up most of the cost. Maybe something like CS229T could be worth it. But you’re right in that doing it for prestige alone is silly, so it’s pretty important to ensure I’m getting bang for my educational buck beyond just spamming questions to ChatGPT.",

Key example being my distributed systems class. I work in distributed systems, and have never used a bloom filter. I've talked about gossip protocol at work a single time. The mass majority of what I learned in that class was completely useless, even though it was the most pertinent class to my specific field.The better approach is to learn as needed for a specific task, and use degrees/ certificates as signals to employers to get better jobs. Using a degree/ certificate in X primarily to *learn* will lead to a lot of wasted time learning things that you will never use.",

The content learned at Stanford is similar to the content learned anywhere. It's the barrier to entry and the fact that you need to be incredibly talented/ hardworking/ successful just to get in the door that serves as a proxy for the type of person that a company wants to hire. If Stanford admitted everyone who applied (and still taught the same content), nobody would care about the Stanford degree anymore.",

Your problem is you haven't put any effort to learning things outside of a work environment. Building microservices, apps, and websites, etc. is best learned by doing. If you don't get direct experience at work, do those things outside of work. Build an iOS app and put it on the app store. Realize how much effort goes into making a good product. Then you know what these companies are dealing with. Bugs, latency, security, user experience, marketing. There's a whole world of engineering you're excluding yourself from because of a lack of agency.",

Now I pretty much only make new things and there are too many greenfield projects for any of us to work on.Startups come with their own sets of challenges, and typically have a demanding work schedule, but if you want to learn fast and get thrown in the deep end this is the way to go.",

I joined the industry more than a decade ago, and things have already changed substantially. Even if we assume AI takes the first rung of coding jobs, the difficult part of software was never writing code, it's figuring out what we need the code to do, navigating various corporate processes, and knowing that the code we write will work as we intend it. What I see happening, is that in 5-10 years, programmers will be super-efficient, and our job will look more like a tech or team lead that serves as the owner for the code and interfaces with management and stakeholder.Anyway, software isn't going anywhere, it's going to continue changing, but no matter what, we're going to have more software in 20 years than we do today, and someone is going to have to build it, or at least be the person responsible for it.Job security in software doesn't come down to the coding skills, it comes down to all the non-coding skills you have. Are you experienced enough to learn new concepts? Can you lead a team? How well do you do working on ambiguous problems? Do you have a track record of producing results in difficult environments? How well do you work with others? These are the driving questions that determine employ-ability. You'll learn how to pass software coding assessments in school, but after that, employ ability boils down to the ability to contribute to companies bottom line. That's never going to change!",

The job will likely come, even if it's niche.Putting it bluntly, going to 4 years of college and not having an internship looks bad on a resume.

If you have a PhD in Physics, you don't want to apply for jobs that are going to emphasize things you cannot bring to the table. So you don't want to apply for jobs where they're going to be looking for you to be a shallow generalist or a specialist in something you don't do.This is the trap people fall into - they see 500 jobs that they could technically do and apply to all of them.Instead, you want to focus on applying to the jobs where not only can someone with your background be successful, but really where almost only people with your type of background can be successful. Generally speaking, that is going to be companies working on solving things that aren't fully solved. Some people will call this R&D or research or innovation, but at its core you want to look for things that are not just standard, off-the-shelf solutions.What you want to avoid is generic \"entry level data scientist for Fortune 500 company training ML models\".Now, what can you do to enhance your resume:1. Make sure you cram Python hard. C++, C#, Java are all good too, and there might be some niche industries where other languages are relevant, but if you're blindly going to pick one, it needs to be Python, and you want to be able to show up as a very strong Python coder. 2. Make sure you cram SQL. It's not as critical as it once was, but you still need to make sure you are fairly competent with SQL: select, group by, inner/left/full/right joins, partition by/window functions, nested queries, and CTEs.3. Assuming you're looking into AI/ML: make sure you learn about/brush up on as many of the basics of ML: regression, classification, clustering, A/B testing, NLP. 4. If you want to go for maximum marketability and you have the time/ability to do so: either a) dive into some of the \"under the hood\" LLM stuff, or b) learn how to build LLM-powered applications. There's no easier path to getting a high paying job right now than being able to contribute to LLM stuff. And realistically, it's a new enough field that there should be plenty of room for someone with a Physics PhD to find an area within it where you can get yourself up to speed and be dangerous.",

Positions such as senoir data science frequently have hiring managers or recruiters who only look for experience in industry in the exact right platforms and tools and dont consider anything in terms of applicable skill.Someone with a PhD isn't normally going to go straight to a Senior role unless their research experience is directly relevant to a specific industry.If I were you, I wouldn't be looking for Senior roles - I would be looking for entry level roles in highly competitive industries. Like, a Senior Data Scientist at some middle tier tech company is probably making less money than an entry level data scientist at a hedge fund, top tier tech company, cutting edge startup with lots of money, etc.So again, don't think \"well, I'm smart enough to be able to do something as well as a more senior data scientist who *doesnt'* have a PhD\", because not only is that not right (experience in industry matters), but also hiring managers won't agree with you.Instead, I would look for jobs where you can say \"typical entry-level data scientist with a BS in CS could not handle this\", and those are the jobs you want to apply for. I think startups would also be a good place for someone like you vs. mega dino tech companies (and I say this as someone who works in a mega dino tech company).>Also, to be sure, what does llm powered application mean ? Does that mean how to work with and guide and direct llms to build and put together coding scripts and libraries with which to build apps ?That means a piece of software that uses API calls to an LLM provider (OpenAI, Claude, whatever) to do stuff. You're not actually making contributions to the underlying LLM model, you're making a piece of software that uses an existing model. There is a spectrum too - there's stuff like RAG systems where you're not retraining the model per se, but you're adapting the model for your own application with your own data.",

Over-intellectualizing it will make you feel worse about it without any actionable outcomes.

Would love to hear if there's anything that can be improved, especially regarding my bullet points. [https://imgur.com/a/Kq2QqfS](https://imgur.com/a/Kq2QqfS)",

Even when I struggled I would take breaks, but I eventually always came back to programming because I just enjoyed it that much.I would still do this, even if no one paid me to do it.",

If you don’t like the offer and won’t take it but you liked the process and company tell them you enjoyed meeting them and are excited about the company but you were looking for an increase in pay and a more challenging role. Tell them that what they are offering is below your current comp and doesn’t align with the role you are looking for and invite them to reach out if they find the role you applied for becomes available. Speaking to the process, I think 9/10 companies that interview you for a role and bait and switch like they have aren’t good companies to work for. What they should have done is clarified the job you were interviewing for before the first round and certainly by the second round. Clarifying the job you were interviewing for at the offer stage is scammy. There are situations where that could make a lot of sense for everyone but this doesn’t sound like that. I think the kind of company that does this is also the kind of company that says “we would like to give you a raise and we for sure will but we have to wait until next year”",

It may be that you've really impressed them, and they want you - but that they're stuck with a limited number of approved headcount and just can't do it. Or something like that. The key thing in my mind is to focus on salary, not level. If they pay you like a senior/staff/whatever, then fuck it. Take the money. Title aint shit without the money.I had a similar situation: I was hoping for staff engineer, but got a senior offer. I was up front from the beginning about my interest in the staff position: I think it's important to lay the groundwork early - if you go through everything at one level and suddenly ask for the higher, that won't go over well. Then later, at the offer stage when we talked about senior, I was clear \"Hey I started looking at these because of the salary band of this higher level - can we meet in the middle somewhere?\"There are obviously no guarantees, but that's how I played it. I hope it works out for you!",

I went through the whole process discussing the staff position and the hiring manager even spent a solid 15 minutes walking me through their vision for the org and what the staff role will look like over the next 12 months. I do have a bit of a bad taste in my mouth from it TBH as the staff and senior job rec is basically identical with the exception of a single line about years of experience, which I easily meet for the staff role. Fingers crossed I get more info on Monday. I was given the offer at the end of day Wednesday with no comp numbers and just an email from the recruiter outlining what I shared in my OP and a “we will talk about it on Monday”. I feel like after 5 rounds of interviews including an hour long presentation and a 4 hour panel, they should have given more info regarding the downgrade and not leave me hanging all weekend… but such is life. Thanks again for your thoughts and experience",
