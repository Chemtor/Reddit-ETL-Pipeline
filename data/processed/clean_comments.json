It seems to me that Spark features in \"big\" (for a varying definition of \"big\") projects and platforms a lot. Polars seems to feature in smaller projects and platforms a lot. Postgres seems to feature in older, more RDBMS-driven architectures a lot too. But this isn't a stack, just \"some things I've seen\".I am not experienced enough to *really* say, but I can propose a \"hot-take\" theory of why this is. I am not myself very confident in this, again. But the argument goes like this:A standard stack in our industry will not be possible without a standard stack in web/backend. Fundamentally, data is a byproduct of a company's main business at first. A company may become \"data mature\" or \"data driven\" by converting this byproduct into a core loop of the business, in fact even its moat, but no one starts a company with \"data driven\". When you're starting a company, you can build software that will become your moat, but you can't \"build data\". In effect, I think by the time a company starts even thinking about data engineers, it is already stuck with some existing and effectively immutable architectural components, and our systems must use tooling that plays nice with those. So until these upstream components become standardized (e.g. the SQL/noSQL war in OLTP land finishes definitively, REST is fully replaced by gRPC, etc) - our systems won't.",

We compare partitions generated from prod and staging, get sign off, and deploy.

It’s possible that the offshore resources will be entirely replaced with AI coding. It’s also possible that companies will demand generalized data professionals (kimball, analytical engineering, master data management, etc) and then those generalized people will just instruct AI to build solutions in the technology of the year. If this starts to become the trend, then you’ll no longer need to keep up with mastering what language or platform is the yearly favorite and focus more on implementing value - how to ensure AI assisted code generation is working successfully at your company. This would be a very interesting and disruptive time to be a data professional! (If it happens)——————————-One of the things I’m keeping my eye on is whether companies start switching develops each time management attends a conference and decides to change their stack. To be clear - I’m not seeing it now - but here’s the scenario I’m looking out for. 1) outsource DE to India. 2) hire X dev’s with current stack3) management changes mind on stack4) replace current India team with new India team who know new stack5) repeat yearly, each time manager attends conferenceThis catches my attention because of 1) the current trend of tools changing quickly, 2) the enormous availability of cheap labor offshore. Keep in mind, if managers want to do this, they will have no issue finding offshore bodies to fill roles.So - as an onshore senior/lead Im happy I’m deep into a business domain (subject matter expert) and would be needed for more then my coding skills. If you are worried about this scenario you might start by asking how you can fit into this paradigm. If a company won’t hire you because you are not a 10 year expert on an acronym that was invented 2 months ago - then can you fit into a leadership/guidance position to enable “hot swappable” developers? I point back to the other comment in this thread - do you know Kimball? Do you know business processes, business data, and how to mature raw data into actionable insights which can reduce cost and increase revenue? If the answer is yes, you will likely be ok. If the answer is if no - I just know SSIS and I really can’t do anything unless my team lead holds my hand - then I would set some goals for career development.",

Textbooks make it look like data flows neatly in three layers, but in reality companies are mixing warehouses, lakes, lakehouses, streaming pipelines, and SaaS connectors all at once. No wonder it feels messy.What helped me was shifting from thinking in “tiers” to thinking in **functions**:* Ingest (how data arrives, batch vs stream)* Store (raw, curated, analytics-ready)* Transform (cleaning, joins, enrichment)* Serve (BI dashboards, ML models, APIs)Once you see that every modern tool just fits into one of those buckets, the picture gets clearer. A lakehouse is just storage plus some transform and serve. A streaming platform is just ingest plus a bit of transform. The tools evolve, but the functional flow is the same.That Exasol guide you shared is good for grounding, and pairing it with hands-on projects (like building a mini pipeline with Fivetran → Snowflake → dbt → Looker) really locks it in.",

I would say that if you explicitly say that the data is \\*copied\\* from source systems to staging area to the warehouse then some things may become clear.For example, the fact that you can copy the same data to multiple staging areas and multiple warehouses, from the same source system. It's harder to think about that using the word \"move\".",

The command line is just an interface, and just like the Graphical user interface (GUI) you're used too, it allows you to interact with a host of tools and applications, all with different capabilities, and requiring different skillsets. As an analogy, if you didn't know what Excel was, and I asked you to do something with Excel that you couldn't do, I wouldn't think \"oh this person doesn't know how to use a GUI\".ie. In your case, you need to learn ssh, and probably whatever cli tool you need to access your database.",

I managed a team doing the platform work in this case, and we did build some great stuff: a linter that would block PRs if the SQL was messy, really useful costing analysis comparing actuals to planned budget, etc, etc. But it was a brutal fight to attempt to prevent the entire solution from collapsing under the weight of tech debt. It would have been far easier to have actual engineers build the data pipelines. * In most of the data engineering teams I'm on we also build the platform anyway: all the reusable code, libraries, extra tooling for deploying models, quality-control checks on the data, etc, etc.",

A slow internet connection, poorly designed API and rate limiters can turn what you'd think would be an hours work into at least a couple of days.Its great when things work but IAC is like stepping into the dark ages when it comes to meaningful error messages.

You can definitely learn to code in those but reviewing, refactoring, and optimizing takes a lot of on the job experience to do well. I suggest really diving into understanding the broader concepts behind modern data engineering and working on some projects in Python at the very least. Example: build an ETL pipeline to pull data from a public API, shape it, and write it to a database. Then build a simple dashboard for it",

You need to guide them effectively so the team isn’t overly dependent on you. otherwise you become a liability, not an asset.2. **Drive Technical Improvements** – Being “senior” isn’t just about doing tasks. Anyone can “just do the work,” even outsourced labor. What sets you apart is exploring new technologies and processes, then implementing those that bring value. This continuous improvement is what justifies senior/lead pay over time.You might reach a lower-tier senior role without these skills, but it’s rare and you won’t progress further (lead/principal) without them.The one real exception: niche legacy tech experts. If you master something like AS400 or FORTRAN, you can stay purely technical and still command high pay maintaining old systems.",

Though there are more options these days, and I haven't taken a close look at Soda Core or a few others.What mine typically involve are: * Engine that runs queries organized in database/schema/model folders * Each folder has a manifest file that identifies all queries to be run, including references to shared queries that aren't in the folder, so I don't have to keep writing queries for uniqueness, foreign keys, etc. * Queries are templated to support database, schema, partition and other row filtering arguments, sometimes more if they're shared queries * Sometimes also enable the engine to run python programs * Engine's CLI arguments allows filtering which checks to run: by priority, by type (ex: check, reconciliation, etc), allows filtering which data to run against by giving it partitioning values, etc. * Sometimes this ends up wired into our infrastructure, so it can run automatically, and log to our log consolidation service, send alerts via pagerduty, etc.It takes a while to get everything just right, but it's not terrible. And a lot of the investment in time goes into writing the checks - which would have to be done using any opensource or commercial product I'd go with anyway.",

But now I have a solid piece to create a ton of VMs. Be it Ambari's new release and a full fledged Hadoop cluster, or playing around and learning Kubernetes or whatever I need. Sure I can shoot up a machine in Azure, but my employer does not appreciate me running a machine with 1 TB memory for testing random stuff the entire weekend and longer, when I forget to shut it down.It gets expensive. My server is not really. Now I found it cheap and built it up slow. If you want a server similar tomorrow, you have to pay a significant premium, and it will be more expensive. But I can spin up what I need, and not really ever care about resources. Feels great, despite not being the newest hardware.But the Pi's are also a great alternative. I do think that the newest is kind of expensive, so if you need several 8 GB memory, it *kind* of gets expensive enough to buy some actual stuff.",

For me, Databricks is the poster child for this sort of nonsense.If you want a really good acid test, see how any given tool solves an age-old problem that is still around today.: Import a fixed width format file. They are still incredibly common. Lots of vendors want to talk about JSON, Parquet, or XML; files with built in structure. See how they handled files with no or limited structure like fixed width or CSV. These are old formats so one would expect there to be a solution, but there isn't a good one yet. I always thought AI would be a good way to tease out the structure of a fixed width file, but it struggles to figure out where the columns begin and end.Right now, the majority of \"what's next\" is certified 100% rehashing of old ideas with a fresh coat of paint.",

        "body": "Good points already here re: small files and storage I/O. A couple more angles from the Python side:* If your XML parsing logic is already in Python, you don’t *have* to switch over to Spark right away. Libraries like `lxml` or `xmltodict` scale pretty well if you can fan them out in parallel.* Dask is a nice middle ground since it lets you run the exact same parsing code across many cores/machines, then write out to Parquet in parallel. That way you can keep things Pythonic while still scaling to millions of files.* For cloud vs local: prototype on your laptop with Dask, then move the same workflow to the cloud when you hit limits. Tools like coiled make that spin-up pretty painless if you don’t want to manage the infra yourself. Worth noting coiled has other non-Dask APIs that might work well for scaling out arbitrary Python code (like their batch jobs api)So I’d say: if your pipeline is mostly parsing Python → Parquet, Dask can be lighter-weight than Spark. If you expect heavy SQL-style processing downstream, Spark/Databricks might make more sense.",

While catalogs can bring in documentation from different sources, they often still need supplemental information to bring things together in a cohesive manner. Because of that, if your people won't maintain it, it doesn't matter. So make sure you have some of those user types in your discovery meetings, because too often I've seen them skipped and not able to provide feedback and the catalog turns into shelfware that does nothing but extract metadata from your systems.Like everyone else in the thread has said, open metadata is rather popular and can be self hosted. Alation can get really expensive as you tend to pay per connector IIRC. Atlan has a lot of integrations, but I don't recall if you can host it. I've also seen Collibra and Data.World come up, but I'm not really familiar with them. Good luck on the discovery!",

To meet the requirement of RocksDB, I need to sort the unsorted active block for RockDB's iterator, which is very expensive in my design. As a result, this memtable currently does not work for RocksDB. To work for RocksDB, I need to make the active block also sorted, then I need a skiplist for that, and then the memtable design is actually a RocksDB in memory, which is worth a try, and I will try it later.",

So rather than talking about how you just prefer Python over SSIS (which, again, no one will care about), instead you should argue that you’ve identified a critical issue in the lack of version control and then propose your new stack as the solution to it.",

So if you do something outside of security guard rails, they can get in trouble for it.A lot of those guardrails haven’t caught up with data engineering pipelines, so data engineers can get more flexibility, depending on the company, of course.What kind of data is this? Does it have PII data in it? Finance? That would be good to know because that can define how flexible the data streams can be. It may not be the DBA personal decision, they could just be enforcing company policy.What about this?

I have asked my dba about version control and git. He said that he never needed it before and that if I want something on git then that’s my job. In all fairness the few times I have used ssis at work, I have it a shot initially when he asked me to, I put the packages in my own GitHub repo. Not it’s good that I have a version but I brought up that that’s just my copy from dev. I can’t see what’s on production. I’m not saying that I want or need production level access but I’d a real pipeline where there is some tangible proof that my dev package went to production aside from him saying he copied it to production. It would also be great for him in case something goes wrong with a new update then he can roll a package back to the previous working version.Overall I get your point and it’s valid and I know I get sucked up in the python vs ssis argument because that’s what started everything and I’ve felt that my dba outright didn’t listen to some of my concerns because I wasn’t doing things his way. But yes you are right, the process and practices are more important than the tool",

        "body": "Better observability and pipeline monitoring. Often pipelines fail and there isn’t any notifications on the ssis end to let me know. Recently I was told that he does allow me to use an smtp server to notify myself of failures. This is true and I only have one counter to it right now and that he doesn’t use the emails for the the packages he has built in the past that my team relies on so often I am stuck trouble with stakeholders emailing me because he doesn’t let me know that something went wrong on his end. This brings my next point.Better data practices. You could say that I could do this with SSIS and I could if I had the opportunity to but it’s not my environment and the dba will not let me try anything different in his environment. I want to standardize things like ci/cd and proper data pipeline monitoring as well as documentation. From my point of view it seems easier to do so with a tool that aligns better with my skill set and the skill set of my team if I cannot change anything in SSIS environment. I mentioned in another comment that the dba didn’t go for implementing ci/cd in his environment.Shorter product delivery times. This isn’t really because of ssis vs python. I could make an arguement like that but I know that that is subjective. This is more about man power and ease of deployment. There are more coders in my agency than gui developers and the business units are required to build their own data pipelines (dba words because he said that he doesn’t have enough staff who know ssis to support the business units. He only got two new people in the last few months and they aren’t trained.) from my point of view leaning into a coding based orchestration tool or a coding solution in general will alllow the business units to really build their own data pipelines efficiently and then IT and the dba can just manage production which is what he seems to want anyway. I guess I’m saying this will play to changing skillset of employees and allow the organization to develop faster as a whole instead of business units feeling frustrated by a slow IT.Technical debt. This one is tricky because I can see both the IT setup as technical debt and mine. My team is technically acting like a shadow IT in some ways and that always resulting in technical debt. However the dba is on an outdated SSIS. By that I mean he still uses msdb and hasn’t upgraded to ssisdb which would at least allow for basic version control. Additionally as I said, he doesn’t really have anyone who knows ssis well on his team and therefore if he leaves one day my organization is in a pickle. He can say similar for what I want to do but I am documenting everything I’m doing so there is at least that. Also I am training and have already trained people on my entire environment in case I leave. I do know that this point is probably the most debate point that I am making however. Overall I’m saying that if we move to a more modern setup that fits better with the skillset of those in and outside of the agency (outside matters since they are required to build their own data pipeline) then I think we can eventually get off ssis completely and overall have a more manageable system that more people are familiar with.I typed this up very quickly so it may not be the most clear response.",

I see plenty of code based ETL orchastration (Dagster, Airflow etc) but less GUI options unless I'm missing something key. The issue I have there is that for bigger places, code based works fine, they can have dedicated DE teams but smaller businesses and onw man band operations definitely get a benefit from simpler to use GUI based tools. I know at one point this is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for.One thing I'd suggest is trying to avoid a fixed requirement on docker containers or having a sprawl of dozens of individual components needing to run in tandem again for the smaller places/one man bands. They might not have capabilities to run Docker (IT blocking etc) and if the alternative is 15+ individual components all needing to be run at once then it'll be overwhelming.Your package avoids this currently so definitely worth sticking to that in my view. Outside of that some way to choose the destination DB engine would be good, Postgres is great and all but again smaller teams/OMBs might not get a choice and might be required to use MSSQL server or Oracle, or even just have a section within a larger warehouse like Teradata/Snowflake/Databricks that they get to use for operations. Don't think I saw anything for changing the write destination engine type so if I missed that then ignore me. Good work on it though!",

Efficiency and scaling aren't that important when the data you work with is <500k rows per source per month but its worth having something to remove the manual task of loading 10+ datasets. Less worth it when things like Dagster take the process and complicate it to hell with lots of new concepts that mean nothing to a business user. And yeah a python script with pandas and sqlalchemy could do it but that's assuming that the team have a python dev. Lot of data teams are basically SQL and their BI tool of choice only. This is where a simple GUI tool shines. They know the data, they know how they need to get it and where to get it but the how might as well be magic currently but a GUI tool to pick, load to staging and then do a series of basic cleaning steps to get it ready and save that as a flow they can schedule allows them a lot more capability and lets them get a lot more value from their data.",

The cloud databases are good because they are scalable so you pay less with smaller data volumes. The big ones are Snowflake and Databricks that are full featured, but more costly and generally want you to commit to some amount of spend with them. Google also offers GCP and AWS has Redshift (not recommended). One other you might want to look at is Motherduck, which is quite a bit cheaper than some of the others. You could also go the postgres route as those are fairly cheap on a number of clouds, but aren't optimized for analytics workloads though they are usable for smaller scale warehouses.The database is the core, but then you need to figure out how to ingest the data from your source platforms to the warehouse and transform the data into table structures that support your reporting needs. Again, there are a multitude of patterns and tools available. A lot of companies with basic installs are using Fivetran or Airbyte to ingest the data and dbt to transform it. Personally I wouldn't pay for those, but it simplifies the setup where teams are small or inexperienced. The real hit though is going to be contracting someone to build it. It's absolutely not something you want to figure out on your own as someone that just writes some SQL and python. Mistakes can cause issues with usability, create rework and even higher costs depending on your stack. And to add to the fun, there are a lot of bad consulting firms out there that don't know WTF they are doing, so taking the lowest bid isn't necessarily going to get you to where you want to be.Good luck!",

Those datasets are usually pre-aggregated, so they fit well in the browser.In these cases, instead of making multiple round trips to a backend database to render a view, a web app can just load the data once and run queries directly in the browser with DuckDB-WASM. That shifts more compute to the client and reduces cloud workload.BI tools, however, have standardized around connectors to external databases and often bundle their own caching or lightweight compute engines.

This way, we can still maintain efficiency and speed even for complex analyses, working on contiguous memory and transferring data from server to client in binary format instead of JSON.

Under the hood, NumPy typically uses C-level memory management (`malloc`/`free` or aligned variants) from the system runtime, though it also supports custom allocators.In contrast, I expect stampdb to have lower overhead since it uses a straightforward C++ `std::vector` for memory management. By default, `std::vector` relies on the C++ allocator API, which eventually ends up at `malloc`/`free` as well. Our current plan is to provide only the thinnest wrapper around the C++ core. That said, we’re not claiming to be better than pandas in any way.",

But, it's a massive investment, and 3 years in we're still working on adding components that our manager estimated we'd have done in the first 6 months.If you don't need that, its good, but get documentation of your code, your sql tables, try and centralise into a single semantic model if you can (short of data warehousing). But the one thing that we keep running into with people creating their own dashboards is that they change the queries, they're no longer performant, take forever, use more resources, and they're reloading and recalculating the same details x 10 different queries in a power bi dashboard x 10 dashboards.So, consolidation - if you can at least run the data out to a table, and then have any dashboards read from that table, then you'll be saving yourself.Try to source control your dashboards.If you're using PBI online, if you can use things like datasets, that centralise the data, go for it.Stored Procedures may give you more centralised control, semantic models are more or less exactly what you're creating in PowerBI anyway (source -> dim/fact tables + relationships + measures).Creating a centralised semantic model/warehouse that has all of your tables and data in one place, that you write your code and measures and everything once will definitely allow you to reuse it multiple times and is a big win.",

I’m coming from a DBA/SSIS/sql-heavy background though, and those approaching from a more software engineering background will likely recommend different approaches based on their favorite tech stack and their CI/CD and version control preferences.I’m not a big fan of text-to-sql or promptql-style approaches mainly because I feel like that’s something that should be more for data exploration and presented to the end user rather than a way to streamline your reporting pipeline - all my opinion though, I just don’t like that added layer of abstraction from data when I’m thinking about robust data processes.",

But when you want them, they're very useful indeed. To begin with, without multi-table transactions, to try to emulate them, you end up implementing compensating transactions:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/compensating-transactionWhich are difficult to get right, are eventually consistent (meaning, in the interim the inconsistent state is visible, and no guarantee on how fast your comlensating transaction will succeed, and generally just are a pain. They don't add value or spark joy. There are also other features that are a lot easier to add to an engine once you have full ACID support. For example, zero copy cloning a table - the copies can be modified independently, without data duplication for the shared parts:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/tutorial-clone-table-portalOr having a transactionally consistent snapshot across tables, instead of trying to use Delta time travel to achieve it:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/warehouse-snapshotIsolation wise, we get true snapshot isolation within the engine - queries via the Warehouse either see changes in no tables or all. The individual logs aren't written perfectly simultaneously though, so Delta log consumers benefit from that less, but still some - can see some parts of a multi-table committed transactions sooner maybe, but is guaranteed it's part of a committed transaction, not potentially part of an emulated multi table transaction that failed and will have a compensating transaction trying to cover it up sometime later.Performance, we can potentially batch up multiple transactions into a Delta log entry. We have a nice fast transaction log, instead of relatively slow block blob storage operations being required on every individual commit.Locking, iirc, mostly the same - could maybe support pessimistic locking though, which iirc Delta can't. But paper probably says for sure.",

But it's difficult to capture which parts of the Polaris engine we kept in a soundbite, and we've talked more about the result than the lineage I think. Let me start putting that to rights :) Here's the original Polaris paper for OP's benefit:https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.14778/3415478.3415545We kept the Polaris distributed query processing - it's a key part of Fabric Warehouse. But in Synapse SQL Serverless, it also had responsibility for the distributed aspects of query optimization (somewhat similar to the \"Chrysalis\" split query optimization Synapse SQL Dedicated had before that). That's completely overhauled in Fabric Warehouse in favor of Unified Query Optimization:https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3626246.3653369We also took Batchmode query execution as seen in Synapse SQL Dedicated, SQL Server, etc. But it's even faster. On top of that we have several significant additional big improvements coming down the pipeline. I'm pretty sure several of them will get papers eventually, but don't know anything concrete on that front off the top of my head. At least one of the improvements heavily involves the Polaris engine ;)",

The programming fundamentals you've built over 4 years transfer well to data engineering - you understand APIs, software architecture, and debugging which are core skills. Many data engineering tools have .NET support or similar paradigms to what you're used to. The main gaps you'll need to fill are around data pipeline orchestration (Airflow, Prefect), cloud platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP), and getting comfortable with SQL + maybe Python or Scala. Your API integration experience is actually really relevant since data engineers spend a lot of time building ETL pipelines that pull from various sources. Companies definitely value programming experience over pure data background - it's often easier to teach someone with solid dev skills about data concepts than to teach a data person how to write maintainable, scalable code. I'd suggest building a few portfolio projects that show end-to-end data pipelines and you should be competitive for junior/mid-level data engineering roles pretty quickly.",

They have a lot of short-term (6 months to 1 year) missions with TJMs between 500 and 750€ (in top tier companies). I know for sure that they work with TotalEnergies and, despite the fact that they look, most of the times, for experience with geosismic data, during the interview this is often seen as secondary. What comes out is that the experience with moving data from one sink to another is much more important (and also a little bit of PM). If I were you, I would also add Streaming to the portfolio and that will be it. Experience with near-real time analytics is quite rare and very in demand in big companies (mainly for IoT applications). Once you have done your first mission, you will be aware of the \"rouages\" and more capable of correcting the \"cap\".A+",

Backend: tables only on the share. Each user gets a local front end with linked tables. Turn on record-level locking, no datasheet edits, and keep persistent connections. Disable Offline Files on the share and use wired only. Nightly copy + compact/repair on a backup, not the live file.\\- Python GUI: wrap inserts/updates in explicit transactions, commit, and log the inserted PKs. Add a CreatedAt and a soft-delete flag to avoid hard deletes. Check for cascade deletes and filters that might hide “missing” rows.\\- Better: move the backend to SQL Server Express or Postgres on a small VM, link via ODBC so Access keeps working. Add a rowversion/updated\\_at for optimistic concurrency. Point the GUI to an API and keep the search hitting a read-only replica (SQLite/Parquet export hourly).I’ve used Supabase and Hasura for quick APIs; DreamFactory helped when we needed REST over legacy DBs with RBAC so clients never touched the database directly.Bottom line: put writes behind a server DB/API and keep Access as just a front end.",

You can register iceberg sources in this catalog, in addition to different compute sources like redshift and Athena. You can write queries and notebooks in sagemaker unified studio, you can do more advanced data science things in sagemaker, and you can visualize data in quick sight. Two other pieces that you'll have to contend with in this is Lakeformation and identity center -- this is how you'll get/achieve access control. Is making all this work cheaper than databricks?

Probably no one can have that sensitivity of knowing where the line is more than those who are immersed inside the company.",

If you are choosing a graph data structure, it means you probably wanted that complexity, so you will require a complex query language.

You can sit PuppyGraph on top of your existing relational databases (even MongoDB too), and query your existing data as a graph (using Gremlin or Cypher), without ETL into a separate graphdb. So same copy of data, you can query it in both SQL and graph. Our main product is the graph compute engine, but we did also created a visualization layer requested by our users. We open sourced it.

SevenDB is state/storage-oriented, i.e. we keep a durable dataset and design around logs, recovery, and replication.**Optimization focus:** Aurora obsesses over real-time scheduling, load shedding, QoS (quality-of-service graphs).

They're probably not going to read books and do 40 hours of assignments per week for four years.I'm tired of the \"it's just a piece of paper\" crowd. It \"looks weak\" without it because it is weak. Without a degree you have none of the business background, no math, no probability, no stats, no physics, no engineering, no logic, no years of proofs, no architecture, no operating systems, no systems programming, no threading, nothing.It's my job to tutor all kinds of people. I've been watching people self-study vs university students, and the holes in their learning is immense. All they do is WebDev and LeetCode. They think they know Big O but they don't. They don't know that it's worst case and why worst case is the one that matters because they don't know what p and np are. They're failing interviews because they can't explain what a log is from high school math or a limit from Calculus. They think it's not important. They don't know binary or anything about how data is stored. They're grinding \"DSA\" but they don't know that cache misses make a program 100x slower, because they never took \"useless\" courses like architecture or operating systems. They don't really get what references are because they never managed memory. They don't know how to comment or write documentation. They've never seen an actor diagram. There are entire courses on all these topics. This is just off the top of my head.Meanwhile, cheating has ramped up big time over the past ten years. People were paying Indians thousands of dollars on Chegg and Upwork to do their entire coursework for them. I know this firsthand. That was before AI too. Now it's totally fucked. Teachers literally can't give homework and it's a learning crisis. I don't know why people pay so much for education just to cheat and get the paper but it's not long before employers catch on.Everyone has it backwards. The degree is what's invaluable, not the paper. If someone actually pays attention in school, they will learn things that others will never know. The reason why so many think education is useless is because so many cheated their asses off. It's ridiculous that people actually think there's nothing to be learned from four years of education, but here we are, defending it again from Reddit.Here's a link for anyone who wants to self-learn: [https://github.com/ossu/computer-science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)",

It's not about your actual skill; it's about how you look on paper amidst a sea of competitors. That's the reality. Not only that, there is also a chain of responsability behind hiring, because hiring is expensive. If the hired person turns out to be someone incapable of doing productive things, some people will start to look at who hired him. Which hiring manager do you think has the chance of defending himself : - \"But look, the person had a diploma for X, Y years of experience, and done projects with Z, how could have I guessed that it was all bogus\" - \"Okay, the person had no diploma and no experience, but they all learnt this by themselve, did all these projects, and had a good vibe\" The first one, you can't really blame. The second one, it's obvious the decision to hire was risky and subjective so you can really blame him for that. A recruiter doesn't want to get bitten back if their hiree doesn't perform well in the future, so they play it safe. They don't owe you anything, they don't have any reason to take a risk with their career to help you.",

        "body": "Do you want to be a computer scientist, a software engineer, or a web developer?When you get a degree in CS, you are studiying it at the level of a scientist, meaning conducting original research is the goal. That means publishing scientific papers. You don't need a degree for this, but if you want to study it at this level, you will also be reading a lot of scientific papers as well.If you want to be an engineer, like an actual engineer that requires certifications and to be able to code well enough that you're applying engineering principles to every project. If you want to be a REAL engineer, then that usually means gaining certifications from accredited organizations and/or governments. Think about it this way: A software engineer is, ideally, the type of person that creates software systems for things like nuclear power plants, utilitiy companies, hospitals etc.I look at it as you're working on aserious infrastructure projects and your code cannot break under any circumstances because the consequences could be catastrophic, costing people lives and stuff It always needs a failsafe if bad things happen. Like it still has to work somehow even if AWS or Azure servers go down. Multiple redudancies and all that.If you simply want to code, you're a developer that mainly works n consumer grade apps. You don't need a degree or even necessarily certifications. You just need a somewhat robust portfolio, personal and volunteer projects, getting your apps into app stores, etc. IF things break down, people are merely inconvenienced. Don't listen to all these others about a CS degree being meaningless. Even if you never work in industry, the benefits of being able to understand parts of society at a funademental level is valuable in and of itself....kind of like how a philosophy degree is a great investment in that it teaches you critical thinking skills",

Then just start building things (this works for us cuz we meet every week so they have us and the other ppl in the group who are super driven)NOW this does get a little harder if it's just you or you don't have a group like that but the key take away is you need to start actually building things as soon as possible, because you ARE going to suck and that's fine we all did, but that's when you learn.I have seen ppl with comp sci college degrees that can't build anything cuz they haven't yet. Check this post out regarding the build thing [https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j9lo95/comment/mhe6xfw/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1j9lo95/comment/mhe6xfw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",

Even a project that is poorly executed *but executed at all,* does wonders for both for your learning *and* for the resume.One I have not tried yet but I bet would be a fabulous standout: a *debugging AI slop code* project. So here would be the steps:- Tell the AI of your choice to write some small application. You want it small to ensure you can fight it all by yourself, but make sure the AI doesn’t actually just knock it out of the park in one shot; if so, try again until you get something sufficiently buggy.- Debug the code. You might think that this needs to be fancy, but I cannot stress enough how basic this is. It can literally be just notes to yourself with a date explaining your thoughts. I wager it could say things like: “So, the AI said it wrote X using Y method. Whaaaaaat is happening - I better check the documentation for Y. That is *not* how it looks, the documentation from Y imports completely different methods….” Etc- Document the whole process, by which I mean the prompt used, the AIs response, the code it gave, and your debugging notes.",

I mean, languages are cool and all, but learning a new programming language really is not that hard, once you already know how to program. You can learn any language similar to the ones you already know in a week. The more important question is: What kind of project structure, architecture and patterns do you learn. If you are going for \"applications and tools\", that can also mean many things. GUI or no, Desktop or mobile, which target audience does it have, what should it do? If you want to be the most versatile, able to learn \"anything(TM)\" that might come up in a few weeks time, I would suggest having experience in at least one project / language out of all of the following categories (and each project must have a minimum complexity to \"count\"): \\- 1 web based frontend. Can be pure html/css/minimal JS, or be fully based on a JS framework. maybe a homepage for a simple business, without a shop, like a bakery or a hair salon. \\- 1 non-web based frontend. A C# GUI in windows, a Java App on Android, a Swift UI on iOS or a QT-App in any language you want, it doesn't matter much. Probably a complexity between a calculator and a calendar would be good. Games work, but are normally structured differently, do I would advise against using a game engine unless you want to stick with gaming. \\- 1 complex application, written in a low level language, optimized for speed. A raytracer is the classical option, because it has good visual feedback, but a compiler, OS parts or a real time embedded component can all work. Suitable languages are C, C++ and rust. A compiler has the additional benefit of teaching you more about programming languages in general.\\- 1-2 APIs. It is great if you have both written a REST (or similar) API, accessible through the web (in theory, you don't need to deploy) as well as a library, that exposes a C-standard API for use from other programs. They are pretty similar in conception, but quite a bit different in practice, and understanding how both of these actually work, can be hugely helpful, even if you are only using them, and never have to build them again! You should 100% have experience in one Object Oriented language. The best options are Java and C#. OOP (or some half hearted attempt at OOP) is still the standard in most industries. Additionally, you should be comfortable in a language, suitable for scripting. Python and JavaScript, but also Bash are all options with different advantages. You need to know at least one. I think everyone can learn something from trying something completely different, so you should have done one project in a completely functional language. Haskell is my favourite, but F# and Clojure are also options. You will have to re-learn to think about programming, which is exactly the point of the exercise, not to use this exact language again in production. (Which you absolutely can, just mot people prefer not to)",

Nobody would be making web pages, and there would only be a handful of web developers out there making widgets for WordPress. The reality was that it took away the low-level work, and people moved elsewhere. All of software development is changing, but nobody knows how much. I'll leave you with three considerations: - The people spruiking how profound AI often have equity tied up in its success. - Programming is so involved in all parts of the business that even if you take large parts of the code out of the equation, there is still a lot of **engineering** going on. - If AI can replace programming, then society has much bigger problems than just losing programmers.

        "body": "I finished a BS in computer science in Dec 2020, in a very similar situation - barely got through capstone, no internship experience beyond the capstone itself, no personal projects and no clue where to start with one - and it took me a hot sec, but ultimately I actually ended up in a Java web dev job, even though I'd spent 4y focusing on low level programming in C/C++ and thought I'd go on to do something wildly different.I know the panic, the uncertainty and despondancy, but it's normal. CS education isn't technical school -- it taught you how to figure out how to develop solutions, how to learn new skills as a project demands, it almost certainly did NOT teach every single skill you'd ever use on the job. You will learn as you go, that is just the nature of the field. The knowledge snowballs, yes, but getting a new project, having no idea how to complete it, and having the skill to research and teach yourself is THE most important skill you can take away from formal CS education.AI is a research accerator and a peer programmer in your pocket. My employer recently started expecting us to start using AI like we've been using IDEs -- a core tool to speed and supercharge our development. So start/continue using AI as your coding partner and a research aid. Don't vibe code - hell no - but anything you'd search the internet to know, ask AI first, then dig a little deeper, fact check it - its the faster version of digging through stack overflow and stack exchange and reddit to cross reference the collective knowledge, right? And have AI write code, do a peer review, build on what it writes, feed it back in - go back and forth with it, like you would peer programming. Use it to bounce ideas around and fill the gaps in your knowledge. If you rock up to an interview with the skill of knowing how to utilize AI effectively in your development, then you WILL be the most attractive candidate, because, honestly, a lot of experienced devs are behind the curve figuring it out and we're feeling the heat from our employers with all their crazy high hopes for AI.If you like web dev, there are still plenty of jobs out there, even if the job landscape has thinned out and changed in the last 5-10 years. But also be open to try anything - I NEVER thought I'd end up a web dev, I didn't do well in those courses in school so I thought it was the LAST thing I'd ever do, but I'm SO GLAD I gave it a chance and I ended up liking it so much more than I'd ever thought I would.Also, I got lucky: I was a year and a half out of school and struggling to get an interview for junior roles and was kicking myself for not trying to get an internship the minute I graduated. Some internships will accept you shortly after graduation, but most won't accept you more than a year out. But when I reached out to a connection about a junior role at their company, their company countered by offering me an internship which turned into a full-time offer and I've been there nearly 3 years now. So 1) If you want workplace experience after graduation, definitely don't give up on internships (plural, even if you finish one, don't assume its gotta be one and done); post-grad internships are out there and experience is experience and employers love demanding 2-3y of experience from new grads and junior devs for some crazy reason. 2) Build your connections, reach out to your connections, never stop making them even after you land a job; they don't stress that enough in school, hell it probably should be it's own course its that important.",

If the job requires knowledge of the food industry as well, then you'll be competing against a very small pool.This is basically what I did. I was a 3D artist before. Now I'm a 3D artist who writes a bit of code, and that can be very useful to some organizations.Also, my thoughts on AI: investors want everyone to believe that AI is about to get so good that it wipes all of us out, but I'm just not seeing it in my sector. In fact, I just got hired at a new job, and I barely even use it. Mostly just as a Google replacement. So I think there are pockets where AI is having less of an impact, and my theory is that it's jobs that require interwoven domain knowledge.",

And best advice I got that made the biggest impact, find a recruiter. Legit it makes a difference. You’ll tell them what you want and will take and they’ll come back with job after job. They get a percentage of any position they land you (typically you’ll be a contractor and can then decide to apply directly after getting foot in the door but a lot of ppl prefer the freedom of not being tied to a company). They are highly motivated to find you something. I highly recommend doing remote or hybrid. The savings in travel, in food and the additional time you get can go towards literally ANYTHING else in life that we already get too little of. Friends, starting a business, gym. It’s crazy what we have become accustomed to, 8 hour workdays minimum, 1-2 hours travel depending on where you live, traffic. Not including the OT we all love for the pay.

        "body": "By your own admission, you have only spent \"maybe 40-60 hours\" total in 6 six years at attempting to learn programming. Assuming you're a reliable and steady guy, that's roughly 7 to 10 hours in an entire year, which has 8,760 hours. That is, every thousand hours you've put in a single hour, or less. No matter how you look at that math, the answer is clear: you've barely put any time at all into programming, so it's natural that none of it is sticking with you. Would you get on an airplane with a pilot who said he's been a passenger for the last 6 years but has maybe 40 hours in a flight simulator? No, most professional pilots fly for hundreds of hours each year, and some long-distance pilots fly for thousands. If you want to learn C# then go learn C#. If it takes 2 to 4 years of sitting at a computer every night for 2 to 3 hours, then that's what it takes. It's not about being hard or easy, it's about putting the actual time in. Go here and don't come back until October:[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/get-started-c-sharp-part-1](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/get-started-c-sharp-part-1)In October, after putting in 100 or so hours, then tell us if it's gotten easier or harder once you've actually sat down and taken it seriously.",

Learning math and computer science is not as hard as the art and it's many times as rewarding.

A job I could learn on my own, without attending expensive degree, but with lots of practice and independent study, that would pay well and be in high demand by companies.I feel like this subreddit is doing a massive disservice by preaching that /r/learnprogramming is ONLY for getting a career in software development.And not *programming as a skill*. As in developing the skills of a programmer while still remaining in the same profession or tangential profession. *Learning basic to advanced programming skills is still worthwhile even if you cannot get into a software development career.*The reason why I'm harping on this is that OPs like this are encouraged to leave their entire career and career's worth of experience, and go to 0 and then train all the way back up. > I live in Milan. After years of precarious work in art,I don't know about you, but I see massive potential in this. Regardless of using programming to help with art (e.g. building a research tool, building pricing calculators, building appraisals, using APIs etc. in your direct line of work), you got the entire field of computer graphics where your previous art experience can be relevant, alongside [computer art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_art), or even go into web development and use your art skills to help in designing the website.This also helps build your motivation because you are focused on programming as a skill, and not setting yourself up with a lofty goal of \"MUST be good enough for career otherwise doomed\", AND lets you leverage your previous career experiences AND help in the immediate term AND gives you ample fuel to find projects to *directly help you now* AND you can leverage all of these skills in finding clients you can work with or friends that you can help. People love discounting their previous experiences. Someone that has worked point of sales systems as a cashier for a few years is going to know far more about point of sales systems, and leverage said experience into coding it. And employers recognize this too.",

Tools & scripts to help with a workflow? Maybe Python. A website? PHP. An app?

Learn all the concepts, and keep coding in it, if you want to switch to different language like python its way easier for you then other way around. You drop OOP, brackets, and you just need a little syntax intro and you are basically good to go.Personally I focused on Java and i had obviously no problems with JVM langs like kotlin but even further i had no problems to jump into C#, python or learn go in relatively short time. Effectivelly any higher abstraction language, which usually have garbage collector, will be easy to pickup for you. Lower level languages like C not so much but you can effectivelly delve deep into lower level Java and most of popular algorithms are the same.In this stage of study you should already know about pointers/references and how low level memory works and why GCollector languages are beneficial for you etc.",

I'd try to use the language the course requires and not mix in others.And, fortunately for you and the other students, these languages are generally in the same family. SQL is meaningfully different, and it is good to learn a bit about databases, and the problems you get there should generally be exercises in thinking about data structures and constraints.But C#, Java, PHP, and Python you can all approach from an OOP POV, and they all generally are relatives of ALGOL, which means that you can to a degree guess at both syntax and semantics for languages you're not all that familiar with.As you get more experienced you should start feeling like keywords are mostly trivial, and that most libraries are something you look up the docs for when you need to but don't remember long-time, unless you actually use it often.",

Python Java etc. this is API development experience) 2. Make a front end using your Java framework or using Javascript/React to be the user interface to interact with that database using the API you built (don’t focus too much on looks, focus on making requests to your API and retrieving data and adding data to the database)3. Learn a little about docker to stand all your services up This is a great project for people trying to get practical experience before an internship, the idea itself doesn’t matter too much. Could be a twitter clone, simple picture display app, anything. But the core learning is about using a language and making an API, a MySQL database and a little bit of frontend interacting with that database.

Let's take a look at SQLAlchemy (https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/) as an example, because I like how their docs are layed out: If I were to start using this now for the first time, this is what I personally would look at in which order: 1. Installation guides, both for beginners and for \"Python veterans\". They are short enough, so I can skim them both quickly. 2. both tutorials. I will probably follow along with the \"Quick Start\", because it's short and will let me see some concepts hands on to start with, and I will skim the longer tutorial, as I personally already know how SQL works, and how an ORM works. If I were new to either of those concepts, I would work through it completely. 3. I skip the migration notes, because... duh. 4. Now we come to the complexity: In the section \"Reference and How to\" I would stop reading \"everything\", instead I would skim the chapter titles and try to remember, which information is available. Later, when I go ahead and actually map my first classes, I will open \"Mapping Python Classes\" and \"Relationship Configuration\", and then, when I go to test it, I would probably read more configuration stuff, so that I can be sure I didn't miss any important config options. 5. I will skim the relevant Dialect Documentation, PostgresQL in my case. The most important things to note will probably be highlighted, and if I skimeed it, I will be able to go back later when there's an issue and be able to know, where to find the relevant information. Everything else I would just search in the docs, as it comes up. Such as error messages, or how to do a specific kind of relationship. Just reading and skimming what I outlined above will probably take 1-2 hours. Reading the entire documentation would take days, and I would forget nearly everything. The important part is not to know what to do outright, but where to find the information you need! You also need to understand the core concepts, of what a library is trying to do, and how it's doing it!

No one here has done any of these fire-and-forget cloud apps, and I haven't had a single interviewee with such a portfolio. The problem nowadays is more that nearly everything that one person can do in a reasonable amount of time is already out there as a neatly packaged tutorial, so it's not easy to distinguish whether the person has actually done that themselves or not. It helps, but it's not as indicative as it used to be.> On the job market, you are not a “programmer” anymore. You are someone who is familiar with a very narrow set of tools, and need to market yourself accordingly.Sadly true, but it's a bit more nuanced. There are tons of coders out there, so if you have an open position, there is no reason to not take someone already familiar with the needed stack - and in turn people who don't market themselves as that won't register.

Yes, this will take time, effort, determination, discipline, and patience, but that's the way to go. Not the easy road to use AI and tutorials for everything.Programming is lifelong learning.

Set a time limit for your project, then once done or time has run out reflect on what you wanted to achieve, what you did achieve, what problems you encountered, how you solved them and what you would do different next time, afterwards, move on to the next project. Repeat until you feel confident to tackle bigger projects.A note on AI, having someone or something constantly tell you solutions to problems, diminished learning results. Your brain just gets lazy and used to it. This isn't even unique to AI, this is just how learning works, reddit can do the same if people wouldn't be so openly hostile towards people asking for help with minor issues. Instead tell your preferred AI that it should never just give you the solution and just analyze your code and point out where an issue might be. Then attempt to solve it by yourself.

It is in part because children aren't self-conscious about trying to talk - they'll just say shit and if they say it wrong, whatever, an adult will correct them. Whereas adults will be hesitant to even try to speak until they're sure they'll say the right thing, which slows learning right now.You really do need to work from the bottom up mastering the basics first. You would not believe the number of students who have convinced themselves they can write production level code, but if you put them in front of a whiteboard and ask them to code a method to remove an item from an array and return a reference to the new, smaller array or something simple like that - they just *cannot do it*.

It's a useless metric for actually working on code.Imagine programming as a gigantic space of possibilities. You're searching for positions (programs) in that space that fulfil certain functional (the thing the program should do) and usually some non-functional requirements (memory/time constraints, being readable and maintainable). There's not one solution but many, but they are far out (as far as lines you need to write to get there). Each line you write gets you closer to some solutions and farther from others.Unless you have decades of experience and the program is quite small, it's usually not possible to just \"see\" a good solution and write it down in one go. You need to iterate on it, write parts of it you know will likely be part of a good solution. And even identifying those is lots of experience. Often you'll have to rewrite parts to make it work.The first running prototype is usually garbage because it shows the meandering path you took to get there. Restructuring and cleaning up your solution is still expected when you work on large programs, so that the overall commit history doesn't look like a rabbit on acid typed it. This is something that is discussed in professional settings as well. If coders think refactorings are necessary, who will pay for them? Some teams just silently do them as part of other tasks, others try to communicate the need to higher ups.> I've tried the Algorithmic thinking tip from the FAQ to help me plan the processes, but I don't notice classes and objects immediatelyThat part of the FAQ is not for planning programs.

        "body": "There's a concept called the Entity Component System model, or ECS which solves this issue in a way that also makes writing high performance code much easier. The idea is that instead of having discrete classes for different kinds of creatures, items, or other game entities with all sorts of complex logic attached to them, you create simple data structure called an entity. An entity is usually nothing more than some kind of ID value, like an integer, UUID, or even a string. You then \"attach\" additional small components to that entity which give it additional properties. It's these components that hold the data that would have been held in the class. So the `hasHealth` component would hold maybe 2 numbers, max health and current health. All of the logic for the various components is handled by a set of \"system\" classes. Their job is to handle the logic associated with the various components. For example, the health system would handle adding or removing health on entities with a health component.Typically the way ECS are written let you query the world for entities with specific components (or the components of an entity and such), or sometimes more complex conditions like \"has components x y and z, but not a\". This query then will find the components that match and produce a list of entries which can then be processed by the system.This is probably complete overkill for what you're doing, but it's becoming a very popular way to write games. It gets rid of the awkward problems that come from a more object oriented approach, and completely strips all dependencies between components and entities. This allows you to build up unique entities simply by combining different discrete components. Of course, for unique interactions you would occasionally still need to make 1-off components, but a *lot* can be done with only a small collection of basic components when you can freely mix and match everything, and implementing new kind of entities is often just a matter of figuring out what components they need.This roguelike tutorial in Rust does a great job of explaining/teaching how you might use an ECS in a roguelike game: https://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/chapter_2.htmlRoguebasin has a very basic Python implementation of an ECS: https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Entity_Component_SystemThere's a ton more information on ECS out there, this was just meant to give you a very very rough idea of the overall concept. There are quite a few ECS libraries out there in a whole ton of languages, but it's not that difficult to write your own either (at least as long as your not trying to squeeze every bit of performance out of it).Here are a couple blog posts that explain ECS and implement one:C++ - https://www.codingwiththomas.com/blog/an-entity-component-system-from-scratchC++ - https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/C# - https://matthall.codes/blog/ecs/Here's an ECS FAQ: https://github.com/SanderMertens/ecs-faq?tab=readme-ov-file",

I think for example compilers older than 1990-something would not allow using even a “const int” as a constant value for deciding the size of an array. But I suspect almost all modern compilers do, it may even be the case that the people who are disagreeing on this simply have a 20 year age gap.I don’t even think you have to increase the optimization level in clang or gcc to make both of these examples dissolve into nothing. (Meaning purely in-place source substitutions, before even generating target assembly.)You could test it by looking at the compiled output of a really tiny program either locally on your machine, or on something like Godbolt’s compiler explorer.",

It's going to replace - at a text level - whatever it finds, *before* that gets sent to the compiler. So if you do that define, any time it sees \"foo\" it will replace that with the number \"1\". It will be like your source file literally says \"1\" wherever it encounters \"foo\", regardless of where that is.If you are worried about the difference in memory usage between a `const int` and a `#define`, you are almost certainly doing unnecessary optimizations.",

This is discussed in The Art of Programming Style by Pike. However for other types like double, it is safer to use 'const'. Now, in terms of efficiency, there is virtually no difference because the compiler will just inline it for both. But with #define it will just put in whatever you typed, say 1.1 but with const it will put '1.1d0', this is just a short hand for 1.1000000000....This kind of thing matters for precision calculations. If you use only 1.1, the compiler will automatically choose the lowest precision for you, so it is 1.100000. Now, you may be wondering how about > \\#define N (1.1d0)The problem can be shown with this:> printf(\"%f\", N)This will work if N is 1.1 but it will fail when N is 1.1d0. The reason is because when it is 1.1, the C standard automatically casts it as float by detecting it as a decimal number. But it doesn't know how to handle 1.1d0 in this context. In fact most functions don't even do casting for you. However with a 'const' the standard knows exactly what to do and printf's templating macro code knows how to pick the right printf to be linked into your program.",

The key to this is to look at the center line 4321234Each number is listed twice except 1, so you can use the formula `2n - 1` to indicate the width. In this case, `n` refers to the largest number (or the initial number picked).The pattern is basically in two parts. There's the stuff reaching the middle line 4444444 4333334 4322234 4321234Then, there's the rest of it. 4322234 4333334 4444444### What's the pattern?You'll notice the numbers are basically seven 4's on the first line, five 3's on the next line, three 2's, and finally one 1 at the end. So the pattern is: 7, 5, 3, 1.The idea is you print the numbers doing down, like 43Then when you reach 2, you print 2 three times, 43222Then, you do 3 4 at the end (going back up). 4322234### Coding logicSo, let's see how we can do that one line. Let's put it in a function void printLine(int size, int patternLength, int currNumber) // Step 1. Count down for (int i = size; i > currNumber; i--) { printf(\"%d\", i); } // Step 2. Print repeated numbers for (int i = 0; i < patternLength; i++) { printf(\"%d\", currNumber); } // Step 3. Count up (you do this) // Final newline printf(\"\\n\"); }So, then you have the main function int main() { // Assume the user enters in a size and it's stored in size int size = readSizeFromUser(); int patternLength = 2 * size - 1; int currNumber = size; // Print the pattern up to the midpoint for (int i = size; i >= 1; i--) { printLine(size, patternLength, currNumber); patternLength -= 2; // Next number is printed this many times currNumber--; // The next number is decreased from the current } // Another loop to go from 2 to size to do 2nd half }I've left a lot of code out for you to think about, but hopefully, you get the idea.",

Programming books also occasionally contain such problems in the exercises sections but are normally paired with whatever you were supposed to learn in that chapter.For this problem I would try to figure out the \"general rule\" (someone already said that it is the distance from the center). Usually this will result in the easiest-to-test and most-likely-to-be-correct solution.If you can't figure out the general rule, take a piece of the problem which is solvable and then work backwards from there. For example, for n = 3, the middle line is this: 32123First write a loop that outputs just this line, for any n. That's part of the problem. Then work backwards to make it work similarly for the other lines (so that the line before middle is 32223, and so on). Doing it this way is fine too, but there are more opportunities to mess things up or to get edge cases wrong.For the given problem this is not really a problem, though, since \"exhaustive testing\" is pretty straightforward. You can run your entire solution on all values of n = 1 through n = 9 inclusive and make sure that the output is according to the specification. For most real problems, exhaustive testing is impossible or impractical.",

Can you entirely avoid branching aside from the necessary loops by writing a value every time? How can you generalize your condition to give you a number to write instead of a boolean? This will prevent a large void in the middle.Something that might make it more efficient: how can you restructure the loops such that the number to be written at each position can be directly inferred from only the iterator values at that position, so aside from the code configuring the loops, nothing else needs to be aware of how large the square is? If you try to make n only exist in the loop headers, I think you will find a more elegant solution without a big mess of addition and subtraction of i, j, n, and 1 going on inside every iteration. Hint: loops don't have to start or end at zero.",

We can convert ranges by subtracting n from all members. From there, it's just whichever coordinate that's farther from the center what takes precedence. From that, we can derive a function like this: printBullseye(int n){ for(int i = 0; i < 2*n-1; i++){ for(int j = 0; j < 2*n-1; j++){ int iDif = abs(n-1-i); int jDif = abs(n-1-j); int distance = iDif > jDif ? iDif : jDif; printf(\"%d\", distance+1); } printf(\"\\n\"); } }EDIT: I realized while driving to work that I should've converted the range by changing the for-loop start positions instead of cluttering the function with more math. Revised function here: printBullseye(int n){ for(int i = 1-n; i < n; i++){ for(int j = 1-n; j < n; j++){ int iDif = abs(i); int jDif = abs(j); int distance = iDif > jDif ? iDif : jDif; printf(\"%d\", distance+1); } printf(\"\\n\"); } }",

If I like graphic programming or embedded in the era of mvp’s and ai and reloop to what’s the point. Sinking 100’s of hours pulling my teeth with bugs programming something that is already out there or is pretty close to it, or a terminal program that doesn’t generate me money just because doesn’t get my dick hard. I think embedded is the way to go but I think the excitement will come from working with cutting edge hardware. I’m not in those spaces to play around with actuators and motors creating tony stark kind of gadgets or building robots to win robot fights for the chance to win cash prices. I think software has hit its ceiling or almost has, it’s pretty much writing itself now. I think the new era is in hardware and the hardware boom will come.TLDR;I came across a guy who has spent 4 years of his life and 100’s of hours reinventing the wheel in rust, 100’s of hours coding kernels.. phd level math. I just thought wow. He found his passion, he’s doing this for free and still going strong ( well he has over 50 sponsors now on GitHub) and the project is fully open source. I need to find something that I could invest 1000’s of hours, years of my life into for the complete love and excitement of it. The money will come as a byproduct. Not the other way round. I’m still on that quest. F the money. Money will come.I still love the idea of embedded though just the barrier to entry past blinking leds doesn’t get me aroused.

But IMO, the most important thing you can do, is try and understand every line of code you write. Don't just copy and paste a solution and move onto the next problem. Don't try and remember how something works. Rather, learn why it works the way it does. Understand the functions, the syntax, common patterns that are used and why.

Particularly [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/). It’s how I myself started coding, with python same as you. It has a bunch of problems arranged by difficulty going from 8-kyu (easiest) to 1-kyu(hardest) iirc. You can start doing some of the 8 kyu ones and progress as you see fit. You have as long as you want to solve them, and once you do you can see other’s solutions.DO NOT USE AI, or be very careful in its use. Always always always understand the code you’re using. And especially for these types of projects, I’d say don’t use ANY code generated by ai, it kinda defeats the purpose. You can use it as a googling aid “how do I get the length of an array, but not as an actual coding assistant “give me a loop that finds the highest value”.Also, when you see code by others, don’t think you learned whatever you saw because you understood it. That don’t mean shit if you can’t recall it when you need to. Seeing the solution to the problem is obvious, and easy to understand. But if the next time you find that problem you can’t remember or recreate the solution, you’re still fucked. Until you can generate the code/algorithm yourself from scratch, you don’t know it.Good luck out there.",

Nowadays this topic is often called \"serialization\" i.e. turning some abstract data representation into a serial stream of data, and back again.Just as one example, look at how the [\"Protocol Buffers\"](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/) binary encoding format works. It defines a general-purpose way to describe \"messages\" in terms of their fields, and each field's type determines how it is encoded, in such a way that you can always tell where one field ends and another begins.It uses the same \"length prefix\" approach that you'll see in a lot of other formats, but it also uses a variable-length encoding trick for integers, which means that small integers take up less space than large ones. This applies to the data itself, but also to the type/length metadata.Reusing an off-the-shelf encoding format like Protobuf will save you a lot of tedious manual work.Or if your goal is just to obscure the data from casual viewing with a text editor, you can just do something even simpler and compress your JSON representation using something like gzip. Maybe add an extra custom header so various tools don't automatically recognize it as compressed data.",

There is nothing special about a txt file that makes it different. In fact *all files* are merely a sequence of bytes. Opening a file with a particular header marking it as txt tells whatever is opening it “hey, this data is in such and such format like UTF-8. Read bytes of this length and display this data as characters.  A dat or bin file just *doesnt* say “hey, read me as text”, but is still just an array of binary. You actually usually can simply open these in text editors to view broken gibberish if you’d like.Anyhow; if you’d like to store data in txt, there are countless tutorials; it’s often taught as an intro method when first learning file handling anyhow. Decide on a schema, the easiest probably being each piece of data on its own line, since reading txt files line by line is simple.",

As you are trying to create your own format you'll have to make something up yourself. There are catalogues of already taken magic numbers online.Then goes header. On offsets from the beginning of the file specified by the format specification there are several numbers telling information about the file: time of creation, modification, size, etc. For example, if you specified that bytes from 16th to 24th will mean time of last modification, you take amount of milliseconds since UNIX timestamp (start of 1970), transform it into a 64-bit integer and write into these bytes.One way to add arbitrary data to your file is to add the list of offsets. Say on predefined position of 32th to 40th byte you write the offset to the first bit of an array of entries in your binary file. Computer follows this offset, where you write, in sequence, offset to next array if it exists (or 0 if it doesn't), amount of offsets to various elements in this array, and then list offsets, each is a 64-bit number. Now the reader can read and save them. By following these offsets, it may find your data. Data entry may look like an integer specifying length of a string or array and then bytes of this data.",

HTML defines the structure, as a sequence of \"elements\", each containing content like text or images. And CSS defines how those elements are arranged on the page.Look up some HTML and CSS tutorials. For instance, Mozilla's [\"Getting started modules\"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started) require very little previous experience.

Modern x64 is a fully fledged high level language at this point, with types and error detection, complex bit manipulation algorithms that execute in one clock cycle, double the gflops per core than last decade GPUs, cycle counters and cache orchestration, all of them are available in userland and 90% of these instructions are never used, no matter the language, flags or compilerCoding in assembly is only worth the hassle when you use the ISA extensions, since compilers are 10 years behind what intel has been pushing.Macros and self standardization is the key to work with 2000+ lines of assembly code without losing your mind. I don't recommend using intrinsics, they produce a lot of garbage code and obscure certain useful details of the instructions. I find MASM + MSVC 2022 + win32 to be the easiest way to make visual applications for windows. Once you get the gist of it, you'll find out that everything inside a computer is assembly. If you like something cool inside a program, you can just disassemble it and copy the code to MSVC to see how it's done. Everything suddenly becomes open source.Searching the web for help is futile when it comes to new extensions in ASM, the best source of information is the intel SDM and some agner guides.

Do not do that. Your teacher is not qualified to be teaching you. Unfortunately, you are where you are. What you \\*should\\* be asking is, what did you spend all that time on instead? I am going to give you the bottom line, I have worked in software for over 25 years, almost \\*invariably\\* the people in the field who a) get very good and b) enjoy their lives at work are those people who would not have done what you have done, because the project would have excited them from the start and they would be desperate to get hacking on it. That's not you and you need to accept that. The question is, is this now your best option? If you tell me you have spent the last 3 years sitting on your ass and playing video games, maybe any kind of switch is going to take time, if however you told me you have been busy with other hobbies and interests, I would honestly and seriously tell you to choose one of those to turn into a profession if you can.

There are cases where an AI backend is a wonderful and effective thing, but it is not always the case. For many tasks, thats just a crazy bloat, which slows down the app, makes it like 10x more expensive to run, and consumes much more electricity, all that to achieve the same exact result. So, just go and make projects you enjoy. And as for the AI, do not use it as a default solution to everything. Might be a fun addition sometimes, but not always. Instead, if you want, use it as your stack overflow summarizer, or debug assist. Say youve got some code and just cant figure out where youve made a mistake, ask it, and it might just find that missing semicolon much faster than you would ever have.",

Since u are already halfway through this bootcamp program, I personally think u should finish it.Put AI out of your mind for now. Some people may not be able to afford using AI for many years. Since there are conflicting views of how advanced AI is now and how quickly it can learn and develop much further, I wouldn't stop learning just in case the idea that AI will take over everything in 5 years is wrong.Besides, there is not enough fresh water in most countries for the water needs of AI facilities in addition to supporting humanity. That may slow things down. Since the facilities need more land area but also cool temperatures, why can't they be built at least partially underground to conserve both land and water?Perhaps u could focus on building things that would help build up city services or get things modernized for underdeveloped areas.I understand that everyone wants to make lots of money, but since u have found a full-time job already, u have set yourself on a good path to make a life u want. Maybe your idea for using IT could help u work with non-profits and places that can't pay hundreds of thousands up front, but that u can help because u want to serve the public. Try to think of longer-term projects for your skills. I wish you the best and am happy that u have already accomplished so much. Hopefully u will at least keep me posted on whether or not u decide to continue the bootcamp program.",

Case in point, my entire cycle has been spent refactoring something that was written in January (I'm guessing with AI tools) that is beginning to break in subtle ways.Though the job has undoubtably changed with these new tools at our disposal, I think there will continue to be software engineers for the foreseeable future. So from that perspective, there's still a value to learning your craft.As for the market, there's nothing I can say but I feel for you- I hope openings for juniors open up again. I think the decision to stop hiring juniors is incredibly short sighted, but it is what it is. Do your best to network and turn non-leads into leads. Listen to whatever career progression framework your bootcamp offers.As for burnout, take a break if you can- try and think about this from a long-term perspective and try and enjoy learning and making things for their own sake. That's what this career is about at the end of the day and there's nothing wrong with giving yourself space to reconnect with that. Good luck.",

Hell, when I’ve tried to make a script to teach a topic, I’ve found the code suggestions to be exactly what I was going to write for my tutorial/guide. Amazing! For really basic, cursory stuff. Stuff that you’d find on a blog or YouTube video where you have to assume the viewer knows next to nothing and will stay for 5 minutes.Anything more complicated than that, and AI breaks down. Writes way more code than you need to solve a problem, solves the wrong problem, solves the right problem in the wrong way. It’s important to be concerned about it in the “I should know about this” sense. It’s currently not important to be concerned about it in the “this is going to change my whole career trajectory” sense.At present, AI is really just a better version of intellisense, the automatic code completion. Serves the same function, and that tech has been around for a decade.You can never hurt yourself by having more skills. Stick with it, but I think it’s important to have a source of intrinsic motivation: some project you want to do for you. Maybe that means making a website for one of your hobbies/interests, but being able to be proud to say you built the whole site from scratch. That not only feels good, but it is something you can put on your resume too.It’s probably too soon to think of switching career paths altogether.

Plus W3 schools pretty much had every creative thing covered - so much so that our tutors if they got stuck copied and pasted W3 school code.I kinda burnt out and now restarted with a passion with Python. At the end of the day, AI can walk the walk but you as a professional should know what AI has written and then use your creativity to tweak the code to better suit your needs. An inexperienced coder would not be able to keep re-iterating to an AI how to work a code into a website without breaking it but you with the knowledge will know how to.Whenever AI gets brought into conversation re: industry/ jobs, I always bring up the fact that once Microsoft brought in Word and WordArt - suddenly small businesses didn't need to hire/train to be graphic designers as their basic logos, menus, business cards, etc could just be done via Word. Did it do the job - yes! Would a graphic designer do an infinitely better job than a generic WordArt - Of Course! Just because you gave a tool to layperson, doesn't mean it'll cut out a specialist",

You should always build your own project - sometimes I build it alongside with following the tutorial, adding steps as I go along, sometimes I begin the project when the tutorial is over. Very often I have to go back and review some parts of the tutorial to understand a specific step better.I don't think you can retain any knowledge if you just watch a tutorial, and very little if you only follow it - the only thing I've found working is when you need to solve a problem in your own project, and have to think about how it could be done, perhaps remembering the tutorial, perhaps having to review it again.

For web or backend development, focus on [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core (if you stick with C#), APIs, databases, and service communication; unless you have a very specific need, you can mostly ignore advanced algorithms. For games, Unity will teach you a lot, though some types of games rely heavily on algorithms (pathfinding, procedural generation, optimization). If you aim to design new or improved algorithms for AI, security, compression, or simulation, deeper math plays a bigger role than coding. If you’re just using existing libraries, you don’t need advanced math—basic knowledge is enough.Those are just 3 examples. So your next step is deciding the direction you want to follow. Once that’s clear, your study plan will be much more focused and effective.",

        "body": "Repositories are self-contained dependency trees of commits. Every repository has an index or staging area which is where you add the changes that you intend to commit eventually. The staging area acts as a temporary safe space that is not a full commit and to which you can restore your tracked files if for some reason you aren't happy with the latest changes, and the changes saved to the staging area can also be restored. When you make a commit, only the changes tracked in the staging area are used.Commits in a repository are uniquely identified by hashes, which look like long strings of random characters that are in fact generated from all the information that they save. Commits contain the hashes of their immediate ancestors, the differences in the code between them and their immediate ancestors, the names and E-mail addresses of their authors, a timestamp, a message explaining what they change and why so that other people in the future can gain a deeper understanding of why specific changes were made, and optionally a digital signature to reinforce their authenticity. Commits represent snapshots of branch states at specific times.Since commit hashes aren't easy to remember, git provides the ability to tag them with more remarkable names. Tags are often used to record milestones, like the official version of a project at that point, but they can be used for anything you want, and can always have descriptions independent of their respective commit messages.Branches represent distinct and possibly concurrent development paths, and every git repository has at least one conventionally named main these days or master in the past, however branches can have arbitrary names. Branches are simply alternative HEAD pointers, you can create a branch from any commit in the repository, which will result in its HEAD pointing at that commit, and after that every commit you make to that branch will have the original commit of the branch as an ancestor in its history. Branches are typically used to avoid cluttering the main history of the project with irrelevant versioning information related to refactoring, bug fixing, feature development, or even to continue developing old versions of the same project concurrently to the main branch.Remotes provide the ability to name external repositories, and are intended to synchronize with the work done by other developers. Each branch can also track a single branch on a remote repository, which is typically used to synchronize with an upstream source of truth, and doesn't really need to have the same name as the local branch. Pushing to a remote branch attempts to append your changes in a local branch to the remote branch, whereas pulling attempts to append the remote changes of the remote branch to your local branch. If this succeeds then the resulting trivial merge is called a fast forward, otherwise you will be required to resolve the conflicts before the local and remote repositories can be synchronized. The HEAD of a tracked remote branch is pointed at by REMOTE_HEADMerging is a process in which two divergent branches, both local or one local and one remote, are synchronized by a commit that addresses all the conflicts. Since only local branches can be written to, the merge commit is always created locally. After a merge all the concurrent commits are added to the history of the local branch, which can make the commit history rather confusing to understand. A different option to merging is rebasing, where all the divergent changes in one of the branches are added on top of the other branch, but this too can mess up the commit history, because if both branches have been getting concurrent commits, the timestamps in the resulting history where all the commits to one branch are logically applied after all the commits to the other branch will result in a history of commits that are not progressive over time, so git also provides the ability to squash commits, which can be used to coalesce a range of commits.Reverting is the process in which the changes made by one or more commits are applied in reverse to a branch, effectively resulting in those changes being removed from the code. Reverting commits does not alter the commit history of a branch, instead a new revert commit is created specifically to remove the changes, at which point the author of the reverse is given a chance to address any conflicts that might prevent the operation. Switching is a process in which git is instructed to go back to any commit in the repository. If the switch is made to a branch then the local files will be updated to the HEAD commit of the branch, otherwise the switch is considered headless and no commits can be made until a branch is created to track them. Resetting moves the HEAD of a branch to any commit on the repository, which can result in some commits becoming unreachable and eventually garbage collected.Stashing is the concept of committing your changes to a local commit tracker and restoring everything to how it was in the previous commit. Stashes are global and as such are completely independent of branches.Other concepts like pull requests, forks, and releases are specific to GitHub. Pull requests are just regular posts to a repository linking to a branch on your own repository whose changes you would like to get merged with the remote repository. Forks are just other developers cloning your repository under a new repository on their own account. Releases are essentially tags on steroids that you can use to provide ready-to-use builds of your project.Git is also quite versatile when it comes to rewriting history, however this is a fairly advanced subject that I'm not going to touch on here since it requires a good understanding of its fundamental concepts. Rewriting history can sometimes make commits unreachable from any branch, and These commits are kept around for a while but eventually git's garbage collector gets rid of them, however this grace period makes it possible to recover them, so even if you completely mess up a repository it's almost always possible to manually recover everything back during this period.Hopefully this comment covers all the basics with enough detail but without being overwhelming.",

I think that’s because yeah…, repeating exercises is boring af. BUT repetition is also what makes things stick. Think of music, which in fact is also a language in its own context. You hear a song enough and you can recognize it. We communicate with symbols and logic. You gotta learn what the symbols mean in the specific context and then how to use them to express what you want. So a breakdown of an example you gave in another comment. -Program in C (language/format)-Seconds to minutes (formula)Even if you don’t know that 60s = 1 min by memory, you can find the formula and write it down. The C language will have a way to write the function, the variables and handle any printing or user interaction. That’s the part you gotta know or find out about the language beforehand (like rules or properties). The coding skill comes from being able to write down that broken logic into the computer code. So you gotta be familiar with the language and how it works. But in general terms you can do things for everything. Problems will sometimes have a full sentence to just say something is equal (the same) to another thing. You can usually simplify it into formulas or terms like: 3 bananas + 3 apples = 6 fruit. Instead of thinking “how pretty we can say something” in the language we’re thinking “how fast can we make a computer understand it”. I can say “I would like 6 of that delicious fruit, please good sir.” or I can say “6 fruit”. In logical terms they mean the same. “I would like” implies addition for me, which would different to “Here you go, some fruit…” which would mean a loss for me. I hope that gives some perspective of the fundamentals of logic and operational thinking.",

Yes, you need to practice and repetition is key for memorization, but to start looking for solutions to a problem you need mostly to understand it first. ;) And breaking it down or rewriting in a way that you understand for yourself could help you get a better grasp of it. For CS problem solving resources LeetCode is one of the many platforms with such styles problem. You can Google equivalents. You can also look for training resources for programming competitions, they have a similar types of exercises if that’s what you’re looking for.",

That perspective being that while the number of jobs did halve in 2022 and then not bounce back up, leading to a job crisis. It actually has little to no impact about the long term existence of the field of computer science and IT.You can look at stats like [https://www.trueup.io/job-trend](https://www.trueup.io/job-trend) if you are interested, but as a kid, I honestly wouldn't worry about that. The only take-away you should be learning from this is just maybe be prepared for a more chaotic job market with ups and downs.What matters more for software being worth or not to invest in as a child is just if the field is large enough. Which it certainly is. Out of all fields you can study at university, after nursing and engineering, computer science literally has THE largest job market of all other degrees, even after being halved in a single year.

When I finally did take the class, I did really well on it because I knew most of the material already. I also knew, based on my experience with the textbook, that the subject matter interested me.Also, I always tell people to check out the FAQ here on r/LearnProgramming, it has got good learning resources. This: https://reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/w/faqIt helps to have a coding project that you're currently working on. > \"I graduate in three years and wanted to hear from other perspectives on whether CS is a good route to take. The reason I'm so on edge is because of the job market right now. I've heard from many others that it's hard to get a job with a CS degree and I don't want to make the wrong choice for my future.\" The job market for junior programmers can be tough, yeah. To even have a chance you need a good LinkedIn, a good GitHub (you can pin up to 6 projects to the front of your GitHub), and a reviewed resume (r/CsCareerQuestions has two resume review days a week). To use GitHub you need to learn the command line tool called \"git\". To use a command line tool, you need to learn the command line. There's a lot and it's all unfamiliar to you now. Also, the job market fluctuates over years, and you don't know what the market will look like when you graduate. Will it be a market that favors employers or workers in three years? We don't know. The job market is always good for nurses, but it's not always good for tech. But yeah, sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me, I have a Computer Science bachelor's degree and 2.5 years of past professional programming experience.",

An advice I can give you is pick a programming language you want to learn properly, identify a great resource to learn it and then learn it and build projects. Don't jump from one language to another just because you think you understood the basics. Use the basics to build projects that get more complex from project to project. If you gonna learn Web Development then one resource I can recommend because I did it myself is the Odin Project. It's free and open source. However with only 8 hours a week it's gonna take you a long time to finish.",

If you want just 2d art, Krita on pc is a free drawing program that works well, I'm mostly on ipad so procreate is what I often use. If you want 3d, blender is free and great, it has a good community and a lot of tutorials, it can be a bit hard to learn but it's a nice skill to have.",

It would be best to try to have a few questions about specific theories or problems that you are not understanding written down so you have somewhere to start. However, if you just feel completely lost, that's okay to say to your professor.They may have good suggestions for you to work on things in addition to the lab and class assignments, which should help you retain and apply the information.They may even suggest you get a tutor. If a tutor is needed, try to get your professor and the student resource center to work together on meeting your needs. (My university had a student resource center to help all students with disabilities.) If you don't have a student resource center, just meet with the person or office that helped you get an interpreter. I hope my suggestions make sense. Please let me know if you need clarification on anything I have written.Good luck! You CAN do this!!!Don't give up on yourself or your CS class yet.",

Start with a key frame at 0 where the box is at 0,0.Whenever the user drags the slider to a spot, find the closest previous and next key frame. Draw the box linearly between the two. (If there is no next key frame, draw it at the previous one.)If the user manually moves the box, insert a new key frame at the current time with that position.Playing the animation would essentially be to automatically move the slider 0.1 seconds every 0.1 seconds.You should now be able to e.g. go to time 0, set the box at the left, go to time 10, set the box at the right, then go to time 20 and set the box to the left again, and when you play it you should see the box animate left to right to left again.",

You're not going to recreate something like idk... blender in v1.For you that's probably a 2 or 3 frame canvas where you can draw things on each frame and flip through them. You can expand that to a user defined animation length. To keep drawings on a frame until they're erased later. Ghost previous/future frames to help with tweening. User defined frame timings. Variable frame timings. etc And those are just ideas for if you want to have to raster draw each frame. If you want shapes and transforms and other kinds of things like Flash used to do that's another direction to take the features. Or exporting to different file formats. Or real time cooperation. Or...well, you get the idea. Focus on the simplest possible thing until that's done. You can expand it to add more features later, and then you'll learn to regret all the decisions your past self made and learn all the more for it.",

Any *actual* animation that a user makes will have some finite length, even though there's no predefined upper limit on how big that can be.Any standard data structure such as a list, dictionary, etc. will allow you to put as many entries in it as you want. The only practical limit is the amount of available memory. (Technically, there's usually also an upper limit defined by the maximum value of the integer variable storing the data structure's size, typically on the order of 2^31 which is roughly 2 billion. But you're likely to run out of memory long before you hit that limit. And nobody is likely to be creating animations with 2 billion frames.)> See, I would really love to poke around in the code of a pre-existing animation program to see how they did it, but once again, when I try to search about the code of an animation program google doesn't listen to me.The specific programs you asked about are closed-source and proprietary, so the source code isn't published anywhere. Google can't find something that doesn't exist on the internet.There's a 2D animation program called Synfig Studio which is open source: https://github.com/synfig/synfig/ But it has hundreds of thousands of lines of code so it's not going to be easy to understand for a beginner.But see, for instance, this class which defines a `Keyframe` object and a `KeyframeList` which is a sorted list of keyframes at different times: https://github.com/synfig/synfig/blob/master/synfig-core/src/synfig/keyframe.h",

There's a difference in knowing enough to follow the code, vs. knowing enough to program in it.",

        "body": "Got it. I don't know what the context is here -- and anything involving working with raw data is well above the level of this sub -- but the gist is probably this:You have an HTML file, which contains a table presenting some text, two cells per row. The *tr* is the element for a row, the *td* the element for a [cell](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/td). Each of these cells has a class called \"datavalue,\" and from that HTML file, you could write a script that grabs everything out of any cell with the \"datavalue\" class, so you end up with a text string of \"003F00502040003F00502040\".... (I assume that there are also rows with 00, 04 , etc.)The screenshot is a [hex editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_editor) of some kind -- I don't know which one but they basically all do the same thing: they open a file and let you directly see and edit the raw data. Right now you don't have the actual raw data, though, you have the text \"003F00502040003F00502040\" etc., so you'd have to convert that to the equivalent data file. (Don't worry about the specifics of that, there are probably built-in functions for it in whatever language you're using.)Then in the hex editor you can view what the bytes of the file are, where they are in the file, and what characters they would be if it was supposed to be readable text. This data is almost definitely not supposed to be text, but without more context I don't know what it's supposed to be. (i.e., the 00 3F and 00 50 are probably supposed to be 63 and 80, but I don't know exactly what the 63 and 80 are being used for.)Again, all of this is very much above the level of this sub.",

So if `action` equal 2, the program will execute the `case 2:` branch, and then it will \"fall through\" and execute `case 3:`, `case 4:` and `case 5:` as well.2. Doing `cin >> text` when `text` is a `std::string` just reads a single word, defined as a sequence of non-whitespace characters. The other words are left in the input buffer. So after first reading the word `\"Going\"`, then the next time you try to read an integer, the next word will be `\"to\"`, which can't be parsed as an integer, so it'll fail. And you're not checking for input parsing failures anywhere in your program.The console output seems to indicate that your IDE has a debugger, so you should be able to use it to single-step through the code and see these kinds of problems for yourself.",

If you don't return **exactly** what's expected, or have the **exact** output they expect, then your code just completely fails even though the logic may be sound.

I'm also usually a huge believer in throwing oneself into the deep end and just figuring it out, that's how I learn.But... I don't think that it suits every kind of person. To be able to learn effectively through such a method you need to have a certain willingness and ability to just explore and try things when you get stuck. Even and especially if you're unsure of what to do. OP says that they can't even find src/main.cpp after cloning the repo. Or that they can find it (since they can run it and it \"draws up blank\") but don't know what to uncomment? It's a bit unclear. This suggests both a lack of willingness to \"just try things\", and also a serious gap in fundamental knowledge.I think in such a situation and for such a person, they would benefit more from a course that will hold their hand through such matters. In fact, I would recommend for OP that they watch YouTube tutorials, which I don't usually do, because actually watching someone go through the steps seems like it would be very helpful for them.",

As for your complaint about matching exactly (which is what I'm more interested in responding to) I disagree that it's overly pedantic which is the impression I get that you have of it. For one, in an actual dev environment that's approximately how pedantic the tests are (although usually you'll have access to the tests which helps with matching strings). For another, most of their projects are reimplementing other projects that are in use and define a communication protocol. So, learning to read and be exact with those protocols is actually really important so that the programs that interface using the protocol are compatible.As to your point about whether to recommend it, sure I agree it's not right for everyone, but I personally feel the tests are quite reasonable. ESPECIALLY if you take the extra step to write your own unit/integration tests as you understand the spec of what you need to implement better.",

But as I said before, I think even though failure should not be the aim, it still provides the programmer with experience and foresight and intuition on what not to do or to avoid. Failure can be a great teacher if you use it correctly and genuinely attempt to learn from your mistakes. I don't know, maybe I'm wrong.>So, learning to read and be exact with those protocols is actually really important so that the programs that interface using the protocol are compatible.Ah, really?

Got some interview prep from one company telling me to prepare to be able to write a debounce from memory, and to brush up on asynchronous data fetching, manipulation of strings and arrays. Felt we were quite clearly going to do some sort of data fetching, list rendering and filtering. Nope, full blown JS fundamentals challenge around building a Wordle game in 45 minutes, obviously no AI allowed. Bumbled my way through the whole thing trying to remember the best way to map over stuff and comparing index's for matches and partial matches. Didn't even get close to finishing. Was surprised they did that challenge despite looking for a RN dev as it’s a different vertical than what they are looking for.Second company interview didn't send any prep, passed the second round which was a live 1 hour coding test in RN, third round was a discussion on architecture with some white-boarding. Passed it until they pulled a gotcha right at the end with 15 minutes to go. Gave me another coding test on JS fundementals, which I passed, not satisfied they deleted that one and gave me another with 5 minutes to go that I couldn't finish in the allotted time. They haven't even bothered to get back to me.I question the people who decided the processes to be honest, I don't think they know what they're looking for. The whole process feels broken because they don't know how to handle the whole AI aspect of things.",

I *strongly* suspect all these edge lord \"vibe coders\" are doing exactly that: Handing Claude the client's feature list and letting it run without supervision. We've already had to deal with giant balls of poo dumped on us from 3rd party contracting groups. We've always had quality issues with 3rd party dev efforts, but wowza has vibe coding amplified the bad and done nothing positive. I'm 1000% positive there are sweatshops of offshore \"developers\" now who do nothing but feed client specs into Claude with full trust and send back the poo unchecked, almost certainly running a dozen different projects through such at once. It's a poo farm.I am finding AI and especially Claude (with Perplexity for research) amazing for increasing my productivity, but I've also learned quickly that you can *not* let these things run without supervision and constant guidance, mentoring, etc. They're basically really fast interns/Jrs right now, they simply don't have the wisdom of a senior dev to make the right choices on their own.",

The overzealous vibe coder trope.What that underlying question is looking for is not to shit talk AI and be dismissive of it, nor is it to circle-jerk over AI and how it's revolutionized your life. It wants a more measured answer that talks about the pros/cons of AI, where it's useful, where it's not, and demonstrating understanding that it needs to be used with caution no matter where it's used.We all get that it's not good at complex tasks. We all get that it sucks at being able to understand business logic to do anything useful. We all get it sucks when it needs to work in a large codebase across multiple files.But it has some pros you didn't seem to mention at all.... the biggest one, which is what I use it for regularly, is as a faster Stack Overflow. Back in the day, when I was getting some error I wasn't sure why I was getting, I'd go Google that error. Then I'd sift through Stack Overflow questions until I find one that's close enough related to what I was doing that it can push me in the right direction, and usually hit my head against a wall until things finally work.Nowadays when I get an error, I type into Copilot \"Why am I getting \\[pasted error\\]?\". Copilot looks at my code, scours the internet/docs to find answers that are directly relevant to my code, and can give me relevant answers way faster than I could get on my own. It's of course not always right on the first try, but with a follow up prompt or 2 I almost always end up with an easy fix with very little effort from me. This is like 90% of what I use AI for, and it's absolutely been a massive benefit.I also like it for very mundane tasks that are conceptually simple, but are time consuming. Coming up with unit tests is one. AI can easily read code paths, and shit out enough tests to get good coverage. It's usually pretty bad at *implementing* the unit tests, but I can take over from there, it did the boring part for me.AI's also great at just asking general questions. Why read through AWS's terrible docs when I can ask a single prompt, and get a right answer most of the time.I'm on your side that I think AI's pretty bad at doing most code generation tasks beyond very simple or very isolated stuff.... but you're being overly dismissive if you can't think of any ways it can make your life easier.",

For technical skills someone typically is assigned to help mentor and onboard and teach you/docs to read etc. Having to mentor someones social skills is a lot more awkward and I doubt anyone wants to explicitly be told they need to do that. So a lot is on the individual if they know they need to grow that area and practice it themselvesAnd then with technical skills there’s a lot of room to make mistakes and failsafes to catch you. With QA/canary/code review/rollbacks etc and even if a mistake makes it to prod typically it’s fine and a learning experience. Whereas in a social setting first impressions are very important. As you mentioned it can be awkward at first but unfortunately that impression can stickIt’s definitely not untrainable but trickier",

        "body": "I mean literally every post on Reddit tells you this lol.Anyway, I was always a weird nerd, hung around nerds, shy non-popular guys etc. But because I was always great at sport and athletic I would hang around jocks and even gangsters so I learned how to get along with alot of different people.This is a big question so there's nowhere to start really but for Reddit I will say this, biggest killers for the guys here are the following: Introverted, self awareness and over-valuing intelligence. I can explain lol.1. Introverted: People use this as a self-built cage rather than just a label. It shouldn't even be a label the way this word has a mental hold on people on Reddit. Firstly, yes you can be naturally inclined toward introversion or extraversion, but there's caveats. Being introverted or extroverted doesn't neccessarily mean bad at social interaction versus good. I've seen plenty of extraverts who fucking suck at social situations and introverts who are great, they just prefer to be alone more often. You can be good at social skills and continue to carry your special little introvert label if you want, it's just going to be a little harder than if you were an extravert ***simply because you're getting in less reps.*** An extrovert will try and fail more = more chance for success. Also, you can switch between being introverted or extroverted, this isn't WoW where you can't cast a spell because you chose the paladin class. You're allowed to try being extroverted for a week, year, decade if you want.Like OP said it will feel weird at first, but ask any guy who got ripped from being fat if he felt like a natural in the gym the first day he picked up a weight. Nope, he worked through the pain and embarassment and got the reward. The good thing about social skills is that it doesn't even take that long, nor do you have to always be the social guy.. you can just learn the skills and keep it in your back pocket until you need it.2. Self awareness: Reddit copes alot by thinking that extraverts in engineering are just \"smooth talkers\" wrong. Smooth talking is a skill that comes with social skills, but it's not the whole pie. Some social people over-use smooth talking and get found out real quick and exposed, luckily here on Reddit we're all extremely intelligent and know what's best for the world so that won't be our issue... right?There's a negative connotation in engineering for having good social skills and confidence. I get laughed at by my friends for having \"good english\" and \"talking shit\".. like that's something to be embarassed about? In reality, I have great language skills to explain things to people of all levels, and I can basically nail down concepts into managable pieces for customers to understand without confusing them with jargon.. that's a skill that requires intelligence, humility and understanding concepts. Engineering isn't just about calculating numbers really fast, or memorising a fourier transform, we're here to sell products and create ideas. You NEED to be able to communicate those ideas or else the math and physics is lost in the void. What's the point of being able to create nuclear power if the government is scared of it and thus bans it because you can't explain to them why it's neccessary. 3. over-valuing intelligence: In the sense that people here like to min/max intel stats, that's great. More intelligence is always good, but again that's not a license for you to suck at conveying your ideas or to treat people like shit. Yes conceptually a team of really high intel nerds will be good for a company, but in reality we live in a market where we need to promote ideas and actually be able to understand from person to person. You can't do that by being very intelligent but a dick or can't explain your ideas to people in simple terms.",

But a lot of folks prefer keeping work & personal separate, that's totally fine too.* with regards to layoffs, generally in my exp contractors are 'first to go' of the engineers - not first to go like let go, they just don't renew your contract. A much bigger/critical layoff usually they cut ties with the staffing agency completely, i've seen.* for me it's all about stability, longevity, benefits. my contract ends just before december but i only recently started and i'm trying to bust my ass to get an extension / converted* not being eligible for some of the better FTE perks, sucks. Its like, I work just as much as any other person on the team, it'd be nice if i can be included in certain things There's some things i like - like being held to 40 hrs a week, any overtime needs approval and you actually can get paid for it. generally that means i'm off the hook for pagerduty.

I have always preferred FTE in the past because you get the good salary, there is no waiting to see if you get extended, the benefits will be better, you get PTO, and paid holidays. And who knows, you might even get a bonus, and a promotion. Who knows!I seemed to fall into temporary contract work when FTE positions were not available. I never minded doing some contract work. I didn't worry about office politics like the OP said. In some cases, I got holiday pay and even bonuses from some contracting companies. But what I didn't like was short term extensions. I worked for one client who did first 6 months, then another 6 months, and then it was 3 months, and then 3 months. I had to leave. I told my manager, who was a great person BTW, that I simply can't keep extending for 3 months. As soon as you start the 3 months, you need to start looking again halfway through ... if you;re going to extend me, at least make it for some length of time, but I know she didn't control the money, so that was that.Nowadays, I've been getting laid off a lot, the FTE roles don't seem to last very long themselves. Yeah, you might get some extra benefits from FTE, but longevity isn't one of them. I definitely have friends who have been contracting at one client for years and years, they have been around longer than most FTE employees. They just keep getting extended, and they know the work, and it's not hard. So, pros and cons for each ..........",

Try to think of any of that type of devops work you were exposed to in your career even if briefly, and highlight it on a second version of your resume and use that to target devops roles. Use your current resume with your it skills and spam those out for any it roles. It is taking forever to get interviews these days, just assume you’ll have time to complete the certs before you get the interview and cram studying for those things.One other suggestion, you can use ChatGPT for questions like this and it does an amazing job of telling you the possibilities and also generating a step by step plan… give it a shot!",

I bought a copy of Microsoft Visual C++ and learned the language (as you said, it's extremely easy to pick up a new language or framework - nowadays, you don't even have to buy anything!)But I didn't have any on-the-job experience, either, and self-taught didn't mean anything.So... I didn't _lie_ about actual on-the-job C++ experience. I never said \"so-and-so paid me to work on C++\".

It's about engineering leadership and the qualities that are likely to set them and their team up for success. Things like ability to deal with ambiguous or underdefined problems. Ability to effectively mentor junior engineers, etc.Don't stress too much about it. The only thing that's truly not learnable/coachable is experience.

You don’t have to have a maxed out charisma stat, you need to not be miserable for your coworkers to interact with. I have ADHD for example and I interrupt my coworkers all the time but they live with me.ADHD is a poor proxy for understanding what it’s like to live with autism, so please do not take this as me attempting to be reductionist toward legitimate struggles, but one thing I have found helpful is to stop assuming my condition is the barrier I’m facing. It might CONTRIBUTE to the barrier, but plenty of people before and after me have had ADHD undiagnosed their entire lives and they never even knew. I’m glad mental health is so well-known these days, but these conditions are not new and plenty before us have succeeded. Being a bit quiet, or loud, or odd, or by-the-book, or socially inexperienced are not traits limited to people with autism or ADHD. And all of us can improve.I had crippling social anxiety starting my first job and now I’m getting promoted and my boss explicitly mentioned I’m extremely well-liked in the office. People like my empathy more than they give a damn about my ADHD. Gen Z in general struggles with social skills because we were locked in a room during COVID for core developmental years.Don’t panic, you’ll be fine.edit: and watch The Residence on Netflix if you haven’t. If you pride yourself in your technical skills and know you are autistic then it could be a nice reminder that autism makes some people better at their jobs.

Without stars and citations, GitHub repos and arXiv papers are laborious to evaluate and are indistinguishable from slop.* Our work inevitably requires some research, which usually doesn't pan out. If a manager makes a bad hire, and they're not competent in ML themselves, they have to wait through a long string of failures in order to decide \"okay this person is incompetent\" and finally fire him.So hiring managers have to be very, very careful. In such murky circumstances, it's rational to resort to costly social signals. Publications in conferences, placements in Kaggle competitions, and of course experience at prestigious companies are reliable signals of competence, only because they are so costly to fake. They'd rather overpay for a highly-qualified candidate (not you or me) than gamble on someone less-credentialed who passed their interview (which they know isn't terribly high-signal to begin with).This is all many times more extreme for researchers, for whom a PhD is mandatory.>But i see people doubling their salaries all with just taking a single course on basic ML....how???This would be news to me.",

Like, you know, fortune striking them at just the right moments.Take Steve Jobs as an example. People often point out that he was poor, which is true, but he also got some extraordinary breaks that almost nobody gets. He met Wozniak, who happened to be a genius at building computers, at exactly the right time. Woz let Jobs run with the business side, they launched their first product, it took off immediately, and suddenly Jobs was financially independent. Apple went on an upward spiral so fast he never really saw any serious failure early in his life. That kind of alignment is rare.If you’re coming from very humble beginnings, you usually need multiple strokes of luck like that to become extremely successful. Getting to moderate success or financial independence is possible with hard work, but the billionaire-level outcomes are much harder without serious tailwinds.Finance and tech both show this in different ways. Finance is even more network-heavy. Running a fund is all about raising money, and raising money is basically a game of connections. Technology is also about contacts in the Valley when it comes to big fundraising rounds, but the barrier to entry can be lower.So if you’re poor, you can still make it, but you’ll need a lot of luck. Even if you claw your way up, the climb is steeper. No contacts, no capital, and no safety net mean it will take much longer to reach the same level as someone who started with connections.",

        "body": "I've been on both sides of this. I started my career as an 'ambitious overachiever,' burned out hard, and then tried the 'maintain boundaries' approach. Here's what I learned. **As an Ambitious Overachiever:** From my personal experience, going above and beyond only **works if you're able to \"showcase\" your work.** That is, people in the company need to actively **see you as someone who goes \"above and beyond\"** in order for it to matter. You should also make sure to **document your achievements and positive feedback** received so you can later present them to management when discussing raises, promotions, and so on. I would also say, though this is also another personal experience thing, that **going above and beyond in every category is both ineffective and leads to burnout.** It's better to **have one project which you own/lead and excel** **at** at a time, and do the \"regular\" amount of work on your other projects. In addition, it is important to build rapport. You don't have to be an extrovert per se, but **people should leave feeling positively after talking with you.** On the downside, **career progression** at any one company inherently **depends on how much room there is for promotion** and the budget of your department. Plus, overperformance makes you advance faster but rarely do you ever skip progression tiers. You may be a truly stellar, outstanding, junior engineer, but you won't get promoted to senior engineer immediately. You'll likely just spend one year less in junior, one year less in mid, and so on. It also only partially protects you from layoffs--**you'll be the last junior engineer laid off**, but if they're **laying off all junior engineers you're still gonna get laid off.**Something I learned the hard way is that no matter how much of a \"go above and beyond\" employee you are, **one period of poor performance**, even if do to extenuating circumstances, **can very quickly destroy your reputation** as an overperformer. If this happens, you should immediately look for a new job unless you really love your current workplace. I also found that **opportunities to truly excel can be difficult to find and sometimes even be gatekept.**It is important to remember that much of **your excellent performance will evaporate** when searching for a new job **unless you're able to show public artifacts** which showcase it. Maybe references can do this too, but you need to tell the new employer to actually contact them. I got laid off without any public artifacts to show off, and it made job searching ***much harder.*****Do great work but maintain boundaries approach:**I took this approach after burning out, though that burnout was partly due to a toxic coworker. I found it to be less stressful and often my outcomes became more consistent, which many employers value more than someone who does overall better work but in an inconsistent fashion. In general, it's only seen as a bad thing at (healthy) companies if it's the kinda role where overtime is inherently expected or a startup. How your work itself is recognized largely depends on your manager and how well they understand it. I'd say your manager's **subjective perception of your work matters far more than the actual work quality.****Advancement** felt like it **depended** more **on the state the economy**. Good economy, relatively normal advancement rate. Bad economy, slower advancement rate and layoffs. **Summary/takeaway:**Brute-force 'tryharding' is rarely worth the investment and often leads to burnout. If there's a project you can take ownership over, do that and make sure to 'show it off' like a salesman. Make sure to have evidence to support your skills for both internal promotions and getting jobs elsewhere. **Be an intelligent, strategic achiever who works to own and lead projects while building the skillset you want, rather than an overachiever for the company you work for.**",

The question should be more nuanced though- people (especially engineers) LOVE to microoptimize on a single variable when that isn't actually productive because our lives are multifaceted (e.g. either minmaxing saving money, or being a yolo spender). My practical recommendations are 2 things1) oscillate based on priority. Some projects are important, high-vis, high-impact and will leapfrog your career more than the rest of your work combined. Spending a bit more effort here pays dividends. Similarly, if you're close to a promo you care about, it's worth doing a bit extra. Rest of the time, it's okay to just do enough.2) understand the rubric better. Unlike school where assignments are graded 0-100%, work is very ambiguous. Understand who controls your career trajectory (usually your direct manager and maybe skip level), and optimize for success. Find ways to proactively make your manager's job easier, and make your manager look good to their management. This will do the most. One anecdote I've shared a few times: I grinded really hard when I joined this job, manager denied my promo again and again based on random nitpicks from career ladder doc. I eventually threw in the towel and said fuck it, that manager left, my new manager was chill and I kept sandbagging. I'd be responsive and helpful on shared projects, but I was also literally playing video games during the day (wfh). Despite all this, my new manager pretty soon put me up for promo successfully without me asking, and handwaved a bunch of career ladder \"requirements\". I did have to do a bit of extra work since manager asked me to draft my own promo doc (usually manager duty, but fair enough trade lol). It's all fuzzy and hand wavey end of day as long as those in charge approve",

However, based on what you wrote, you and many others have been both mislead and duped by these influencers. Many influencers show off a lavish life style funded by millions of dollars in debt. They aren't rich by any means. Only faking it.>I’ve noticed that in tech communities especially software engineering, there’s a lot of emphasis on talking about compensation packages, benefits, and perks. You see it everywhere from “Day in the Life” YouTube videos where someone shows off their free lunches, nap pods, and flexible schedules, to posts comparing salaries across companies.Tech encompasses a wide range of compensation, benefits and perks. What you see on social media is the top 10% of all tech. It would look completely different - perhaps even bleak, if someone actually showed the day in the life of a median (50th percentile) or worst (100th percentile) job.They certainly don't have free lunches, nap pods, and may be even lucky if they get free coffee. They might be filling out time-sheets and staring down some of the worst-maintained technology with very strict deadlines and constraints for changes. Depending on the country, the median can range anywhere from $40K-80K. Does that sound super cushy to you?>Don’t get me wrong, I get why this happens. Tech jobs *can* be cushy, with relaxed work environments, decent pay, and nice benefits. That kind of lifestyle is attractive to students and career switchers. But sometimes it feels like people act as if tech is the *only* field with these kinds of perks, which isn’t true.Do you really get why this happens?Based off of your perspective you don't. The phenomenon is more broadly categorized as \"keeping up with the jones\" within the last century. Only with the internet it has allowed people to share their accomplishments across a larger audience that would not have been possible before.Previously such people would only be able to reach as far as people similarly within their economic circle. People irrespectively have been comparing themselves to others within their social circle for millennia. The rich compared themselves with other rich. The poor compared themselves to other poor. The middle class compared themselves to other middle class. Its competition, its standard human nature that we haven't grown out of.The internet and more specifically Social Media has given everyone a microphone to broadcast themselves.>There are plenty of non-tech office jobs that can be just as cushy and well-compensated, if not more so in some cases. For example:Any job can be cushy if you're in the right positions. But your perspective is off-keel and your barking up the wrong trees. Within ALL professions, there is the top, middle, and bottom. What you see on social media being \"cushy\" jobs is nothing more than a facade - including in the industries you mentioned. They are designed to spark envy.Many of these high paying jobs are not \"cushy\" in the slightest - at least if people are actually performing their job. These so-called benefits only exist to extract more work hours out of staff. You get subjected to the political machinations resulting from the Jack Welsh Rank-And-Yank (the Hunger Games).",

Rinse and repeat, and your entire career is just shit job after shit job.It's a hard cycle to break once you're in it, because you never ditch that feeling of desperation.Layoff/management changes aren't really unique to our industry. What is fairly unique to this industry is our painful interviews, which only makes it harder to get out of the deadly spiral once you're in it because you're both burnt out from your shit job, *and* the shit interview process. Double burnout.>How do I just find some peace in this field?So the things you're talking about re: stress, unrealistic deadlines, mismanagement, shit culture, etc aren't *inherent* of this field. They're inherent of toxic companies. The trick is finding a company that isn't toxic. Just because a company has lower pay doesn't mean they'll be lower stress/not toxic. Just because a company has higher pay doesn't mean they'll be higher stress/toxic.This requires you to get really get at reverse-interviewing to sus out companies like that, *and* to be able to have the patience to not humor offers from companies that sound like they'll have cultures like that. I've said \"No thanks\" to plenty of companies.I've worked at 4 companies since graduating, 2 more if you count my internships, and I'd only describe one of them as turning toxic. That one was *great* to work for for about 2 years, but they had a CTO change who slowly tried to turn up the heat on the devs, which resulted in me and most of the good devs jumping ship before it got really bad. The other 5 companies though? Great WLB/cultures. I left one because I wanted to move to the east coast (100% onsite days), some of my friends are *still there* 12 years into their career. I left another one cause I was sick of the industry it was in, but honestly this was probably a mistake. The 3rd was the one I said turned toxic after 2 years. The one I'm at now is still smooth sailing over a year in.Good companies are out there. You just have to find them.",

Insane constraints (oh hey - now 90% of your code has to be crapped out by claude - enjoy!). More politics than DC.The mba's are only 2nd to the tech school grads in terms of being insufferable.

Ignore the politics and the idiots - don't volunteer for anything. Don't attend any optional meetings or answer anything on slack that you don't have to respond to. Let someone else do it.

Let others code be buggy - let the tests be a joke - let the libraries be undocumented and uncommented... and for all that's holy - don't worry about upgrading anything. Just code for a while. Methodically and quietly grind out some tasks and see how you feel.Eventually my ambition has always gotten the best of me and i've had to escape those easy orbits - but others stay there and seemhappy to me.

        "body": "For anyone wanting a career in anything, it is very important to highlight your accomplishments for this very reason. Keep conversations up with your manager (ask for skip level 1v1s) to ensure you stay in communication so your manager can continue to gauge how you are doing vs. what your lead is saying. That then allows your manager to know how to work with the lead to make them a better leader as well. It is not being arrogant when you say I’ve worked on this and this and this and these are the outcomes. If you mess up, own it and say I learned my lesson and don’t do Y again. That goes a long way and gains lots of respect, which helps with stability.It doesn’t hurt to put feelers out there for other jobs, but each job has his own crap to deal with. I would evaluate the opportunities you have and get vs. this lead being a pain. This lead may not be here for forever either. If the lead is your only problem, do skip level 1v1s and go from there. Remember, everyone is learning. The lead, yes is being not a great lead, but likely it’s their first time being a leader and trying to figure it out and needs some guidance. Just like you when you first started. Try to highlight the wins with the lead too! Maybe that will get them thinking more positively as well. And maybe the lead is thinking of you as more senior than you are due to the work you are doing. So reminding them how young in your career you are can help.Regarding leaving the field, this is more of a corporate life issue than the field. I deal with this in cybersecurity (got a degree in compsci so why follow) too. You will run into these issues no matter what field you are in. Unfortunately school doesn’t teach you how to traverse corporate life. I say it sounds like you are doing a great job and have a lot of opportunities to grow. Do skip level 1v1s with your manager, communicate what work you are doing and the outcomes with both your lead and manager, and see what happens. Best of luck to you!",

Your manager probably believed his team lead just because he had no reason not to. But now as soon as actual evidence was required, he's realizing the team lead is scapegoating you. Given all this, I would be surprised if he isn't massively pissed at the team lead now and you are probably mostly fine. If I were the manager, I would not believe anything. The team lead says about you from here on out and I don't think the team lead has a ton of discretion on your career trajectory. That being said, it would be totally understandable if you're not comfortable and look for a new job. I guess the big question is how much of this is company culture, and how much is one jerk?",

My previous manager on this same team was one of the smartest engineers and managers I’ve ever met. And on top of that she was honest and kind. She was transparent about her thoughts and feelings.Enter her boss, our group manager. He was the long standing ride the coattails to success type. He knew nothing about anything, but he ruled with an iron fist, and it was his way or the highway. Between my manager and our 12 person team, of which she was easily the smartest and most experienced, know who the ONLY PERSON laid off was when the company did a 5% layoff?You guessed it. Her only “crime” was that she often frequently disagreed with his opinions on how to manage the projects (which were years behind schedule now thanks to him). And the group manager had a meeting with everyone else the same day to say “I had no part in this.” Meanwhile, he had quickly become the laughing stock of the team. He would get off department calls, and the second he hung up, one of our managers would say, “oh good, he’s gone, now we can get some real work done.” So…Fortunately for me, the business saw how little value he was bringing within 6 months after, and suddenly he was forced out in a matter of months once his old boss (and best friend) left him high and dry to pursue a higher position.I hate to admit it, but someone once told me, “50% of your career is what you know, and 50% is who you know.” I’d hate to think they are right, but I’llbe damned if there isn’t a pole of evidence to support it.",

That will be your next job application!Or at least, given the 85 or so companies I have worked for or with, that's how it's had to be. Anyone showing ideas above their station, well, you know yourself now what you get.Second, despite what most people would like to think, there is no top exec keeping an eye on you, ready to pluck you for stardom! I have only ever seen a company's butt tighten up like a snare drum when it comes to spending money on someone, i.e. promotion, training, etc. This whole idea of the company needs to value you or needs to encourage you, that's not the aim of the game for most companies.And to people who just want to say, \"I guess you worked for shitty companies\", 85 or so in so far, I've yet to see it any different. If yours is different, let me know how to apply! Even the nicest of places to work get fidgety when you tell them you've gone done achieved something big that's worth a lot more on the job market. That goes double if there's someone already in the position you're working towards.Any promotion means a move. Just bide your time, learn your stuff, get your experience on your CV, and most of all, shut the hell up! Those four words are the best advice I can give you for almost any industry.",

While the rest is like data science/AI/ML adjacent. However, there is a pretty small section of industry looking for people who are good at security/reverse engineering. I heard it's growing but it doesnt seem in vogue.I'd recommend leaning into trying to become a security engineer or reverse engineering research. It's very niche but so is your skillset. I personally cannot imagine being as good as assembly and gdb as you(I suck). Maybe play some CTFs and go from there to build credibility. NSA codebreakers challenge is coming up in a few weeks/fall.

I’m not sure if it’s the case for you, but I struggle with abstractions if I don’t already understand everything that makes up that abstraction. So if you’re the same my advice there is to approach everything in a similar way, learn the underlying concepts (even if they’re “outdated”) before moving onto the more modern approaches. For instance, with frontend web, just start with plain HTML/CSS/JS, then start bringing in some libraries like JQuery (or maybe could skip this part), then move onto more modern frameworks like React, etc. And similarly when learning something like React, just start with that, then later start integrating other libraries into it (say for state management, etc.). What parts of git, CI/CD, unit testing, DBs, are you struggling with?Also maybe some books on different architectural design topics might help with the OOP or general software design principles.",

Keep in mind there are many different software domais to know, you are simply more familiar and comfortable with lower level code. To me it seems it sounds like you would benefit from studying things from the ground up. Frameworks are abstractions of behavior. And like most of the not low level software, it's made up of low level software. So maybe read up on how to make a rest server from the ground up. Or how to use JS to create a simple framework. Granted that's if you want to go in that area.Alternative look for roles more focused on C/Unix, you can also start using AI tools to judge your code and see what they come up with. As much as we hate AI it can be used to learn what to learn. Ask what's expected of a Dev in a role you want, then make it give you a small project to practice the skills you are lacking. But keep in mind that you can't simply code for yourself, you gotta pretend someone will have to use your code sooner rather than later. 5 years ago getting feedback on thst without coworkers was hard, but now you can ask AI to help you figure out how to do something better.Git and CI/CDs are tools, learn them like such, an online class for git will teach you more than you need.Testing your own code should just become 2nd nature to you for low level, it's just code that verified other code is doing what you expect it to. Web framework tests have more in mind depending what you are testing, so I wouldn't touch that just yet.As for OOP C code, have you tried looking at how some popular repos do it? Tbh certain languages have poor OOP implementations so it will always look ugly for them. And tbh some OOP code will be ugly regardless due to the complexity they can accumulate.Don't give up! You got a lot more skill that you think you do. Just remember, you need to learn the rules before you can break them.",

This is one of those rare cases I’d use your wife as the bad guy and say she’s not down with it and that she would make you seriously consider looking for new jobs if you were forced to. Makes the convo a little easier since it deflects blame from you directly and most decent managers understand that good employers dont want to force marital stress on an employee.After the dust has settled you can talk about remote leadership, but if they are already viewing it as a requirement to move, then more likely you just stay on as IC.",

I took the advice and relocated because voluntarily resigning without any offer in hand, in today's job market, was a big no. Guess what, most people who refused to relocate ended up without jobs six months later. My advice: If you are planning to reject the relocation, start looking outside immediately. Never trust your manager's sweet words. He/She won't get a say when the company decides something. This is a huge red flag.",

You need to not only finish your own work but also grow people and that’s pretty hard to do remotely. Maybe you are the exception… Have you done that successfully while leading junior dev’s growth remotely? you just confident because you’ve been an effective IC remotely? Those are two different things, tbh. Your manager’s concern is not unfounded. Especially since you’ve never been a manager before. Learning how to be a manager as a remote manager…good luck. I’ve had 3 remote managers at this point in my career and none of them grew me nearly as much as my co-located managers.Also, managers are supposed to (imo) shield their reports from unnecessary office politics as much as possible. How would you do that if you aren’t even in the office to keep tabs on the said office politics? Your reports, especially the junior ones who don’t know how to manager up, may suffer alone and not know whom to turn to or how to deal with it.Another thing to keep in mind…it’s fine to stay an IC and prioritize family. Not every stage of your career has to be growth oriented. Please don’t become a manager for the sake of the next promotion - those usually end up the worst managers. Become a manager when you are ready to mentor and grow people. When you are thinking about starting a family, it’s ok to take a backseat and coast/autopilot a bit in your current job. You can always become a manager later. But your kid(s) only grow up once.",

That said, the roles only requiring a Secret or below generally don’t pay all that well and aren’t the greatest for career advancement in general. The real money and interesting work in defense is in the roles requiring a TS/SCI clearance or above which is much more involved and expensive to obtain as a new civilian applicant than a Secret or lower clearance even as a naturalized citizen with a squeaky clean record so many companies absolutely will not sponsor new TS/SCI applications and require you to have your clearance already finalized and active to even consider you for any TS/SCI+ roles they recruit for.",

Pay will vary on the subset of the industry you enter, where in the country you enter it if you'll be working in a building, or where in the world you find yourself if you work remotely. As for your debt, 100k is never a trivial amount of money, but your most important concern is the interest rate on that debt, if it compounds, and when the debt window is closed. Just in case, let's assume that 100k doesn't include the interest rate. If you don't know it, find it and calculate how much you will truly owe on top of the 100k. Come back or go forth with the number you get; it will define what options are, for you, realistic. Try not to panic. A portfolio is most relevant in software engineering, but there's a lot of fields where you can exercise your computer science degree without it. Do you have a particular kind of role you want?",

Money spent on inventory is wages not available for new workers as well as higher prices for consumers.* Given the recent Hyundai raid, international companies will be less willing to invest in US facilities. Basically a bunch of workers from Korea working in setting up a US facility and training US workers were arrested by immigration over what seems like a big mixup.* The last budget bill ended the long streak of Tech support started by the Obama administration. Many of Obama's subsidies were killed as well as the Chips Acts. Particularly the components meant to build more US facilities for chip manufacturing. * On top of that there is prevalent sentiment that the US economy is on shaky ground, which makes companies more conservative on their budgets.That said, getting your degree puts you at good odds of getting a job.

They're posting there for a reason. And there will *always* be someone underbidding you. People are willing to do a ton of work for pennies on the dollar of what it's worth purely so they have something to put on their resume/portfolio. Even US devs. On top of that, people living in extremely LCOL countries can afford to underbid everyone and still live comfortable lives.Freelancing isn't easy. The best way to get clients is through word of mouth, self-advertising, or applying directly to contracting/freelancing postings from large companies. Not using a platform where millions of people are fighting for the same posting, and the people using said platform are looking for the cheapest option.",

You also read every once in a while someone with decent response rates to applications. You’d be surprised how far you can go in this field just by being “solid.” Or people are being overly hard on themselves. I’ve interviewed some candidates who could barely code and didn’t know pretty basic concepts. There are a lot of really bad candidates out there. When someone on the hiring side says they reject over 90% of candidates, believe them.

A lot of people read a bunch of resume advice, get people to review it online, even pay professionals to review it, and then just assume their resume can't be the problem after all of that.Well, the proof's in the pudding. If you're not getting interviews, it's your resume. So instead of blindly believing your resume is good, look into some differing advice. There's the \"meta advice\" you'll get on this subreddit (impact, KPI's, etc), but there's *lots* of different approaches to resume writing. Try some conflicting advice, and build a 2nd resume from that. Maybe even build a 3rd or a 4th all using different strategies that disagree with each other. Then A/B test those resumes. This is something I did in the middle of my job search because I had a hunch one of my titles was hurting me, so I started using 2 versions of my resume.If you're not struggling to get interviews, consider yourself lucky. It's much easier to improve on whatever interview techniques you're struggling with. Reflect, be honest with yourself where you're weak, and work to improve whatever that is. And don't sleep on the behavioral/communication aspect of interviewing, it can be hard to point the finger back at yourself and say you're not doing a good job at communicating, but you need to be able to be introspective.",

There are also levels beyond staff (senior staff, principal, distinguished, fellow).There's different leveling structures across the industry like Amazon's SDE1/2/3 and Microsoft's 59-80, and there's companies with different title progressions (e.g. again Amazon, where there's no \"staff\", or IBM, where \"staff\" means mid level and comes before senior), so talking in terms of \"L5\" just makes it easier to talk about level equivalency across companies.Each level has rubrics for both hiring and promotions, largely based on amount of scope/impact, and these rubrics are similar across different companies for the respective levels.",

The reason why a lot of new grad roles start very (typically between 2-4) is that anything under might be an intern role or a role at the company that is just lower. And for which level you interview for, it depends on your previous experience. Assume L5 is senior, if you apply to this role most companies will assume you have been senior or you have showcased senior capabilities already. Some companies will up level you or down level you depending on their definition of the level. For example meta e3 is new grad and you actually can’t have experience (I think you need less than 1) , so above that you can be E4, if you have the experience you might be E5, if you have 3 yoe but you experience aligns highly with what they want and you perform well in interviews they might up level you to E5 (rare).Also L6 is not necessarily best engineer or something. You can move up your career just having a lot of luck too (probably still a good worker). I know someone at my company who went from L3 equivalent to L6 equivalent in 1 year (internal job change, pm).You move up by showing that you have already been performing at that level. Sometimes you can’t move up though due to budget and other office politic reasons.",

Right now what most people call \"AI\" (which is really just a small subset of generative AI) is almost definitely in a bubble. There's an unbelievable amount of investment in it, a ton of business ventures that use it without a clear plan or analysis, and a lot of integration in places where it doesn't add much value. There are also a lot of people banking on it doing things in the future that it doesn't do right now, and putting money into it based on an assumption that \"it'll do everything we need soon\".There's also an issue at the very top. Companies that provide the service are not making money off it yet, and they will need to either raise their prices or lower their costs to make it profitable in the future. They're all hoping to win a market share and then hike up the prices. This is disastrous for businesses which are, by-and-large, planning as though their current rates will be stable forever.Unlike blockchain/crypto, however, AI does show many profitable use-cases. AI does work that would cost money, and it provides services people will pay for. Business analyses DO show that AI is successfully being used by businesses sometimes. It's just that most businesses don't know what works or doesn't work, and are using the technology blindly.I would liken it to the \"Dotcom Bubble\". The internet as a business technology was absolutely in a bubble in the 90s, and that bubble crashed. It wasn't because \"having a website for your business\" was a bad idea, it was because people were trying to do it without a good plan. Nowadays every business has a website, but unlike the 90s we've established clear use cases which provide value instead of just guessing what works and what doesn't.I expect AI to be the same. AI will \"crash\". There will be downtime where a lot of businesses disappear, and from the ashes will rise a few clear uses where generative AI is used by almost every business.",

Whether you would call that a bubble depends on what you think will happen when the market for the technology moves beyond hype into a mature, useful stage. There are many realistic and valuable business applications for LLMs, computer vision, etc. These tools are incredibly powerful and will only get better as the models get refined and as more skilled developers work on them (whether they are newly trained in an ML-specific context, like me, or they're crossing over from more rigorous, traditional SWE backgrounds).I'm currently a manager in a non-technical role but taking point on some exploratory AI projects, and I'm looking for a role as an ML engineer down the road. What I'm paying attention to, both in my current role and in my job search, is whether the product brings real business value. Investors and execs don't understand this stuff, they see how quickly and confidently chatgpt spits out text and they believe it's magic that's going to relieve them of the burden of workers. Dishonest hype men are more than happy to take advantage of that. But if you actually understand how these models work on even a rudimentary technical level then you can smell the bullshit from a mile away. I'm not going to peddle bullshit and I'm not going to go work for bullshit except as a last resort. I think that very few companies can survive selling bullshit (though some do) but I won't be surprised to see a lot of snake oil AI startups go under in the next few years, so I don't want to bank on that for my future.",

Not only that, but a lot of fields like customer support, legal, animation are getting distrupted by AI which is great use case for the technology. People can point to OpenAI and Anthropic not being profitable, which is the same thing as almost every other tech company when they are in hypergrowth phase: you invest money to gain market share. With that said, with AI now the startup landescape is changing. I see a lot of profitable AI enabled companies that are doing 1M revenue/employee which is insane and shows they have market fit and can be profitable: https://leanaileaderboard.com/ I think we will see more and more of that with AI enabling people to do more.",

There's likely going to be a lot of persistent demand to engineer and implement custom AI systems for specific needs in an organization. Research will also continue but those jobs are just really competitive and small in number. Writing shovelware on top of someone else's work will go away pretty quickly and is not a good career path going forward.The trend going forward is actually smaller more focused models that are part of a suite of tools (SLM's) rather than the AGI that keeps getting pushed (bigger and bigger LLM's).",

You are never going to get interviews if you aren't already working on side projects and networking. AI isn't going to help you be creative and clever, and AI will never know what a user experience is like, neither from a code maintenance standpoint, or a consumer one. The only legitimate good thing AI can do for us is write easily repeatable code snippets we already need, like test cases. You could also just learn to copy paste these kinds of things or get an extension that makes the snippet for you.The reason you should never use AI as a learning aid either is because our technology advances very quickly, but our studies might not. Your teachers may be looking for the old ways to do things, or the new ways to do things. An AI will not be able to differentiate this, and may give you now deprecated code. A great example of this would be several AI models giving me the App router version of Next.JS boilerplate when I specifically asked for a previous version's Page router version of this code. It cannot \"know\" anything, it's just making educated guesses based on text given to it as an input. That's why sometimes, it'll say that there is a safe amount of bleach to consume, because it has to assume that you or the source know what they're talking about. In a world full of crappy or incorrect code practices, why the fuck would you ever want to copy that?",

If you have a medical facility near you, any communities related to them are also a good place to look because a lot of doctors have nannies. New residents and med students with kids in particular may be looking to nanny share to save some money. Your other option is to aggresively consolidate your day and hire in-home help for that time. For example, make your working hours 9AM-1PM (or whatever). Find a part time nanny who is willing to do 4 hours per day. Then tell work that your hours for meetings and other syncronous work have shifted into that mid-day block or to hours when your husband is home. Both of these options, a nanny share or a part time nanny, will run you a similar cost to high quality infant daycare, but will keep your child from getting sick with all of the daycare sicknesses. It's also better for babies that small to be home. Group care is just not the best option for that age, so if you can avoid it, you should.

        "body": "People here have good advice but I'll tell you my story as it's very similar to yours. Advice at the end.Some background here: My wife and I had twins 4.5 months ago. My wife is a PM at a startup (she has anywhere from 2-4 hours of meetings a day), I'm a senior dev at a more established company (I have 30 minutes of meetings per day), and we both WFH full time. Also, I often can get away with working 10 hour weeks but the occasional crunch time for a project means I'm working 40 hours. My wife had \\~3 months of maternity leave and I had 2 weeks of PTO that I used all up front when the babies were born. Ours were also underbaked (lol) at 37 weeks which is actually full term for twins. Our twins for the first \\~4 months were also EXTREMELY clingy and could not be put down. We we wearing them almost all hours of the day.Our original plan was to attempt to balance them between meetings and work - we thought this might be feasible since my meeting schedule is so light and my working hours are extremely flexible.Towards the end of my wife's maternity leave, we realized things were only getting harder with the twins. On days where I happen to have a few extra meetings and she does as well (nearly every day for her) we really didn't have a backup plan other than 2 screaming babies behind me on camera or me skipping meetings. So in the final week before she went back to work, we hired a nanny who came to our house to watch the babies from 9-2. That offered us enough time to get things down and squeeze our meetings into this time window and then do any work we needed to follow up with later in the evening. Even this was not a very sustainable lifestyle as we found ourselves far too often working into the night when we were exhausted from taking care of twins most of the day. Our nanny didn't end up working out - she was unable to care for the babies as they needed a caretaker who had more energy (you can read my previous posts for more context here) so we ended up letting her go a few weeks ago and we are currently on week 3 of working while taking care of the twins. Let me tell you, it is extremely difficult. I take meetings in my airpods with screaming babies and then run out of the room to give my scrum update and then immediately after (2 min later) run back into the room to continue looking after them. I take meetings on walks. I cram as much work into their short nap windows as I possibly can. My wife and I both work late into the night to make it work. It is HARD. I would not wish it on anyone.My wife just put in her 2 weeks notice and work and I just landed a new job that gives me a raise to cover enough of her loss in comp that we should be fine for her to just be full time SAHM for now.TLDR;My situation is slightly different than yours - 2 WFH parents with 2 babies. But I think you also will find (especially with your heavy meeting load) that it's just not sustainable. You might make it work for a few weeks but inevitably you'll find that you can't dedicate enough effort to either work or your baby and likely both will suffer for it.My advice would be to spend the time now (before you go back to work) finding people in your network/community/neighborhood who would be interested in nanny sharing and then find ways if possible to reduce spending in other areas of your life to free up some funds for this. It's not going to be easy. But it will likely be SO MUCH easier than trying to do everything yourself.DM me or I can put you in contact with my wife if you have any questions!",

It's not that you have to have a deep understanding of every layer, top to bottom, but at least be able to sketch it out and know a little bit about what it does. It's totally normal if the parts \"far\" away from where you normally work you don't know so well. Nobody will care whether or not you can describe how CAN signaling works. You should probably at least be able to describe what it looks like when the CAN messages are delivered to you though.This in particular is a red flag, so hopefully it's a joke:>“Tell me something about RTOS”>“Uhhhh…you have tasks and the scheduler schedules them….”You've worked on this thing for 2 years and haven't put in the work to understand *any* part of it? An open ended question like this is really your time to shine, you get to steer the conversation. Be able to crush those kinds of questions.And to be clear here, you don't have to know everything about it by any stretch. But you should have at least a couple nuggets of hard-fought learning. Something you debugged or implemented where you had to go brush up a bit?You're going to get questions about work you've done, and you want to be able to hit more or less these couple items in the response1. What problem you were trying to solve with the example you give?2. What did your changes build leverage from the layer below, how is the layer above going to use them?3. How does what you did work, to a decent level of detail?4. What tradeoffs are there to consider?5. How did you validate what you did?Think back to some tasks you've done and try to answer those questions about them. Try just writing the answers down, don't worry about how long it takes you.If you're not able to do it, even after some time and thought, you need to start revisiting how you're trying to grow your skills as an engineer. Make sure you understand the context around stuff you are doing. Occasionally take something apart you don't understand, even if it works, just to learn it better.If you're able to do it after taking a breath and pondering on it a bit, then you probably just need to work on your speaking skills and confidence a bit. Running through the jot it down exercise will help you there as well. If you have some willing friends, try just explaining stuff to them, and have them ask you questions about it.And hey, no need to despair, these are all things you can practice and improve. Most of us deal with some level of imposter syndrome too, you're not the first guy in this situation and you won't be the last. Put in the effort and you'll be just fine. Good luck!",

The embedded knowledge you do have actually gives you a solid foundation in systems thinking and low-level concepts that many general SWE candidates lack entirely.You're probably overthinking this transition. Your embedded background demonstrates you can work with complex systems, debug tricky issues, and understand performance constraints - all valuable skills that translate well to general software development. Focus your prep time on the things that actually matter for these roles: data structures and algorithms, system design, and getting comfortable with the languages and frameworks they use. The fact that you can navigate codebases and solve problems is exactly what they're looking for, not your ability to recite protocol specifications.I'm on the team that built [AI for interviews](http://interviews.chat), and we've seen plenty of engineers successfully transition between specialties by focusing their interview prep on the core competencies that matter most for their target roles.",

        "body": "I came from defense company where i worked on a radar for 4 years. I then went into one of the companies you listed and worked in their cloud services for aobut 3 years. Your concerns are valid. I dont know how closely related my first job is to your job but here was my experience. At defense, work life balance was a lot better. I didnt have to think about work after 5 pm. The tasks were good enough to keep me engaged but i didnt need to know anything crazy or expand my knowledge really. You could get by and not understand everything. So when you said the quote about not really understanding RTOS, i get that because i worked on things that at the time if you asked me to explain it, tbh i only knew the basic overview of it, not the ins and outs. One of my tasks was actually coding a lot of the receiver and transceiver code too lol. But i was a big overperformer even if i only did like 20 hours a week and chilled the rest. In defense, nobody really disagreed as everybody was just there to give their hours and go. We never really dealt with customers as our project wasnt fully completed. After 4 years i wanted to go for bigger and better and i got in the big tech company (again it's one of the ones you lsited). They wont give you an embedded engineer to ask you things but they may ask you a system design question and the question could be related to what you have experienced at your current job. So youd have to explain how the receive and transceiver work for example. When it comes to coding questions, i think praciticng leetcode and really understanding Data structures is good enough. I think the problem in the interview iwll come when they ask questions like \"tell me a time you disagreed with an older engineer/customer?\" or \"tell me a time you had to deal with an angry customer?\". Unfortunately in embedded stuff, that doesnt come up as much, especially in defense industry. I cant speak for you job but can you answer those questions?\" The vibe i get from your post is that you just do you and there isnt much pushback from either side. Also, be careful chasing these big companies. Like i said i got into one of the cloud systems and for 3 years the work was hectic. I was doing 5x the work and it still wasnt enough for them. I got PIPd after two years and then fired half a year later. Personally the project was just a lot and they expected 60+ hour weeks but it was more like \"only do 40 \\*wink-wink\\*\". Seniors and principals were too stressed and overworked to helpout and get on calls to help jrs. Everything was a meeting. Standups would take 2 hours because they wanted to discuss something. As a mid-level i was expected to lead meetings and projects. The culture was just toxic and the thing is they can be like this because they know there's a million other people gunning for your job. During reviews you were compared to what your coworkers were doing not what was expected of you. so if you exceeded your own expectations, but all your coworkers are working 60+ hours and have 60+ hours of work to show while you only have 40 hours of work ot show, your manager will go \"why are you so behind?\" and telling them you stick to 40 hours isnt enough. Again this isnt all projects in big tech. Like i knew a guy who worked at AWS which is supposed to be the worse of all of them, but his project was very chill where he doesnt think aobut it after 5 pm. It's very project dependent. All im saying is dont just do it for the money and fame, really consider it. There's plenty of big companiees that dotn fall in that faang bucket that pay just as well. Remember our career pays very well regardless of industry. Even if you make 120k, you are making more than most careers. So dont sell your life for that 200k. Apply to these companies, but make sure it is a right fit for you. Also dont fall in love with the bonus/RSUs they will throw everything at the bonus/RSUs to get you in the door, those are not guaranteed. I didnt know this until i got there but RSUs have a long vesting period. At my last job, i didnt get it until my 1 year anniversary and even then i only got like 20% a year and it wouldnt completely vest until my 5th year.",

They can even say \"Great!\" and not be lying, because what a \"Good WLB\" is is very subjective. They may genuinely think their WLB is great because they only have you working 60 hours instead of 80.So instead, ask them about stories. In the exact same way they use \"tell me about a time when...\" questions on *you* to gain insight into *you* as opposed to directly asking. \"When was the last time the team was missing a deadline, and how was that handled?\", \"How are deadlines decided, and who decides on them?\", \"When do most people generally come in/leave for the day?\", \"When's the last time the team got an after hours support call and how was that handled?\", \"What's considered 'crunch time', and how often is the team doing that?\", \"What are your expectations of \\[role\\]?\", etc, etc.There are many, many different answers to those questions. It's up to you to decide if you think their answer demonstrates the kind of WLB/culture you're willing to join.If from any of the questions it sounds like this is a \"work hard play hard\" team, you reject them.I've worked for 2 startups, and they had amazing WLB's. I joined them *because* of that, it wasn't a surprise after-the-fact. Almost all of my reverse interview questions are focused on WLB/culture. Not all startups will make you burn the midnight oil.",

Is this a 1 year old startup that is rapidly expanding to become profitable? Also in my experience with startups- they’ll be up front about overtime. Ask them how much work goes in a given week and if any people are expected to work extra days or hours. Generally I wouldn’t join a 6 engineer startup because they are usually very early stage, the pay is not as good, and there is a lot of pressure to deliver quickly. But there are exceptions.",

It's not technically groundbreaking or anything, but it's been good to do some full-stack from scratch and hone my knowledge, and my enthusiasm for the subject matter has made it a little easier to imagine features for the thing. I also think the miniature painting hobby is pretty opaque when you first start out, and my hope is that once it's all said and done it will be genuinely useful for new folks who want to understand that term they've seen thrown around reddit constantly but never explained. It's nice to be working on something that I actually care about, rather than doing a thing for the sake of it!",

They want to see how you break down problems, ask clarifying questions, and adapt when given new information mid-problem. You can't really drill these like you would technical coding questions, but you can practice explaining your thought process out loud and getting comfortable with saying \"I'm not sure, but here's how I'd approach it.\"Jane Street's bar is high and they're looking for a specific type of analytical thinking that either clicks with you or doesn't. But the uplifting part is that if you've made it to round three, they already see potential in you. Focus on being genuinely curious about the problems they present, don't be scared to ask questions, and show them how your mind works rather than trying to guess the \"right\" answer. The topics can range from basic probability and statistics to market dynamics, so having a solid foundation there helps, but your reasoning process matters more than perfect recall of formulas.I'm on the team behind [interviews.chat](http://interviews.chat), and we built it specifically to help with these kinds of challenging interview scenarios where you need to think on your feet and articulate complex reasoning clearly.",

Started at 75k and worked my way to about 90k (not a huge bump but defense doesnt pay that crazy). I decided to jump ship during the last hiring boom of covid. Ended up at a big tech company (one of the bigger ones) for 200k TC. I took it without even thinking. Defense - i loved my co-workers and was moving up the latter quickly. It was so chill and the work was fun and easy. I did 20 hours of work and chilled the rest of the week. I was my team's scrum master and developer and i didnt think about work after 5 pm and was a top performer. There werent any real deadlines and i could sit on a task for 2 months and nobody complained. Big tech - things got hectic quickly. I was working for their cloud service. What i didnt know is that cloud is where work life balance goes to die. At first i wanted to respet my balance and stuck to 40 hour weeks for the most part. Then it slowly got more and more hectic and since i was remote id idnt realize my coworkers were pulling 50-60 hour weeks sometimes mroe. so after a year i obviously was behind the rest and even if my work was to my standards, they compared me to my coworkers standards and i got less than average. I drank the kool aid for a year and worked like crazy. Matched the 50-60 hours but i realzied i just didnt lvoe the work but the economy was shit so i kept it going. After a year i got another bad review and a few months later fired. Im not saying dont take AWS, for the money it sounds amazing. You might have a way better experience than i did. I know someone who works for AWS, has 300k+ in TC and it's one of the easier AWS projects where people sign off at 5pm and dont think about work. They dont even have on-call. You could land ion a project like that or you could land in a project that requires 80 hours from you in tough weeks. Im just saying sometimes the fame and fortune isnt what it lives up to be. You need to decide if you will be ok with the potential burnout. Also it's not always you will find a job with coworkers you like.",

You’ll feel overwhelmed at first that’s normal moving into big tech. Oncall can suck, but it’s not endless misery. You can make it better by fixing root causes, tuning alarms, and pushing back on what’s worth paging.Will you grind 60–80 hours a week? No. Major incidents can happen, but you can (and should) set boundaries. If you’re up half the night, escalate to your manager, hand off, and rest. That’s encouraged. I never had Slack/email on my phone if it was urgent, they paged. Otherwise, it waited.Make good use of your time, learn a ton, and enjoy the pay. The TC jump you’re getting is insane, and the career upside is huge. At your age, it’s the obvious move. If you were 40 with kids, then the conversation would be different IMO.Here are some comments where I left my take on Amazon if you're interested: [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1h50k4u/comment/m02giyu/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1h50k4u/comment/m02giyu/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1h50k4u/comment/m07uk19/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1h50k4u/comment/m07uk19/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",

The error messages are usually very informative you just need to know all the language. And, some less informative errors usually have specific causes.Getting very comfortable reading a stack trace also helps. In vscode you can command click the stack trace lines in the terminal to go to that part of the code. Usually you can just click the line that is right before an external library call. But, you can also click into external library code stack lines and even edit it if you want to add print statements there.A few of the tough errors I see people get stuck on are circular imports. But, it's not hard to break those.A lot of people say to use debuggers. I usually find print statements quicker.I think it helps if you have a more experienced person that can explain the information you're missing when you get stuck.There are some categories of errors I see people get stuck on, but that would be a lot to go over. if theres something in particular you struggle with I could maybe give advice.",

Stay active on LinkedIn, connect with alumni from your school who are in tech. Recruiters care more about what you can do than what your degree says.

Being expected to figure things out on your own in a small team is actually pretty common in consulting. A lot of firms put people on islands where they have to be the expert, even if they’re still learning. It’s not a bad thing but it also means you haven’t had the chance to see how larger dev teams work day to day. Your role ties with Cloud Engineer or Cloud + Automation Engineer fits well. If you want to move toward joining a dev team, you could focus more on backend development with Python frameworks (FastAPI, Flask, Django) and data tools, while still using your cloud knowledge to stand out. If you want to stay close to infrastructure, doubling down on Azure certifications and automation tools would make you stand out as a cloud engineer. If you’d rather move toward development, deepening your Python, databases, and API building skills will help.Before you leave your job, build a clear learning plan, pick projects to show off your skills, and maybe even contribute to open source to give you the momentum you’re looking for. That way, when the market improves, you’ll be ready to land the kind of structured dev team role you’re aiming for. Also, check out [Cloud Strategy Labs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) for more step by step roadmaps on cloud, backend, and career pivots as they break them down in ways that could help you.",

Less relevant for that 10% if the company uses 1 of the other 2. So you see, low value but not zero.Rest of certs are scams.*How do you stand out more after graduating?*1. Work experience. Nice if the job is a similar industry. List technology you used on the job because no one wants to train you. Make the hiring manage believe you can make significant contributions with minimal training. Easy to get the chance if they like you resume.2. Greater than 1 YoE, resume can be 1 or 2 pages, or 1.5 is okay white space kind of looks bad. Use a big font if 2 pages. Honestly, big font is underrated. Eye tracking surveys you can search for show HR reads you resume for less than 8 seconds. Don't make it an adjective fiesta. I list the tech stacks both in the job descriptions and in a separate section at the bottom for ease of reading.3. A select few companies like seeing community involvement such as volunteering. Can attend young professionals events and maybe make friends at companies that are hiring. Adult kickball leagues, I know multiple married couples that met on teams.4. Sounds obvious but be within driving distance of the office. I don't list my full address, just City, State, Zipcode. Remote jobs all well and good but those get the most applicants. Almost every company I know went back to 3-4 days in the office.>still managed to hit \\~120 applications. No job still.In 4 months, that is slack. 10 applications a day = 300 a month is still slack.

Also working in a know name means I get much more recruiters reach outs, so I don't have to spend much time applying if I need to. It helps with my job greatly with a peace of mind. The fact that I am more capable of passing interview means I don't have to stress about my current work or deadlines as much. If I go back in time, I'd want to do it as a hobby even earlier and not waste too much time on making random projects - projects are overrated for employment if you even have a single internship.TLDR - leetcoding hobby made my life so much easier.",

Squarespace definitely has a pretty chill wlb and has a good engineering culture + you should have a very supportive engineering manager. There were regular company-wide panel meetings for engineers to showcase their recent work and share interesting news and upcoming tech. However, from my own experience, the product management and roadmaps can be a little shaky and if you are the type of dev that prefers autonomy and moving at your own pace, you might feel bogged down by all of the meetings and politics between different teams & departments.As the other commenter said, options are definitely a crapshoot and thats part of the reason I left for a startup where my options would have a little more upside + I could have more eng & product ownership. By the time I left I had a few years of stock refreshers that were worth about 75k a year in straight up equity which were then converted to plain cash payouts after SQSP went private. The change to options was def a downgrade for me given that any potential value hinged on growth in valuation and going public again or doing a stock buyback/other liquidity event. At the time that I left a lot of people viewed the valuation target from the company leadership as a bit aggressive but who's to say that they can't meet it with some aggressive catch-up against their main competitors (eg. shopify with a current valuation \\~25x that of Squarespace when it went private).I'd say to not make the jump just because of the potential value of the equity, but if you're looking for a good engineering culture and interesting product to continue your career growth I would definitely suggest considering Squarespace",

        "body": "For software development, the languages that companies value most right now are Python (super versatile: backend, automation, data science, AI, security), Java (still huge in enterprise and backend), C# (popular for backend and enterprise systems), C++ (more specialized, but strong in systems, embedded, and performance heavy apps). You might find backend, automation, or even systems programming a better fit. Python is especially powerful because it crosses into both software development and cybersecurity. For cybersecurity, it’s useful for scripting, automating scans, and working with security tools.If you’re interested in cybersecurity, focus on Python scripting for automation. Networking basics (which you’ve started on). Linux security and command line skills. Certifications like CompTIA Security+ or CEH (these can help open doors). If you’re more interested in software development, building a few solid projects (maybe a command line tool, an automation script, or a backend system) will help you stand out.EU companies often look for flexible engineers who can do multiple things. Stick with Python as your main tool, add depth with either Java or C#, and build some focused projects. Also, check out [Cloud Strategy Labs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXhSfe40GX9gqDkFvvURNJA) for more clear roadmaps and step by step guides for both software development and cybersecurity.",

It’s also used in Android development and large scale data platforms. C# shines in desktop applications, enterprise software, and especially in game development with Unity. So even if you’re not into web dev, both still have strong non web uses.For projects you can still build things that stand out without touching frontends. Automation tools to write a Python or C# script that automates boring tasks (like cleaning up files, organizing data, or generating reports). System utilities to build a command line tool for network scanning, log parsing, or monitoring resources. Cybersecurity mini tools which are things like a password strength checker, simple intrusion detection script, or vulnerability scanner. Data focused projects to parse large datasets, visualize trends, or build small machine learning models. Game or simulation projects using C# with Unity or even Python with Pygame, create a small but complete game or simulator. Make the project useful and complete not just half finished code. If you can also write a short readme explaining what it does, why you built it, and how to use it, recruiters will notice.",
