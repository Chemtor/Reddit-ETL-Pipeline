Two elements you should permanently learn now:LLMs are token predictors, they don't know anything about your specific implementation except what you tell them, and by your own admission you don't know much. So \"just looking for confirmation from somewhere\"? That's called fishing. You got hooked on this half assed idea and didn't want to bother with real due diligence. Why is a question only you can answer.Never EVER drop a table unless you have complete human sign-off. This is pretty basic engineering principles: if you do it wrong, dropping is obviously the highest cost database operation. Not just financial cost but mental, as you learned. That means timing and communication matter a lot more than for general querying. Thinking through that ahead of time is one of the major differences between analysts and engineers.In conclusion, you should feel badly enough to never do anything remotely similar. But no worse than that.",

Fixing bugs in SQL logic2. Adding columns as requestedBut again, never rename tables or columns unless you know what you are doing because downstream data pipelines, dashboards, integrations all expect specific names.Best of luck!

Of course several of those only have RO support IIRC because of the clusterfuck that is catalogs – so maybe there's hope for them picking this up just because RW support will be more straightforward to implement.Either way, interested to see where this is going – perhaps the data lake format wars aren't done just yet.",

I wanted to type up a pretty detailed summary of what I've learned about all of these tools and formats recently, when looking at what stack to use for my app's pipeline but, unfortunately, my hands are fucked... arthritis is definitely coming for me.My super short summary, then, is that traditional databases use a proprietary file format to store data \"inside\" of the database (meaning it's not a file you can find in your file explorer and open); modern tools like DuckDB provide a query engine and enable SQL queries to be run on open-source file formats like parquet. Importantly, for my understanding, you can run DuckDB queries over many parquet files as if they were a single table.For me, this has shifted the way I view what a \"database\" really is. I used to think of it as the thing that stored data and let me query it. Now, I view the query engine and the stored data as two separate things, with \"database\" still referring to the engine. Then, tools like Iceberg exist to define how multiple parquet files are organised together into a table, as well as dealing with things like snapshots, partitions, schema evolution, and metadata files... at the moment I view Iceberg like a notepad I would keep on my desk that says \"to query sales, read files A, B, and C into DuckDB\" or \"Added Row X, Deleted Row Y\" so it can track how the table evolves over time without taking entire copies of the table (it actually creates a new file called a \"delete file\", to my knowledge, that works kind of like a subtraction X - Y). That means there are now three parts: data storage, the query engine, and metadata management.My understanding of the blogpost is that DuckLake replicates the kind of functionality that Iceberg provides but does so in a format that is compatible with any SQL database. This gives the management of datalakes database-like transactional guarantees, allows easier cross-table transactions, better concurrency, better snapshotting by referencing parts of files, and allows for things like views (which I guess Iceberg and other tools didn't?)Moreover, metadata is currently managed through file writing, and when performing many small updates or changes, this can be slow, and prone to conflict errors. Tools like BigQuery can be even worse, as they re-write entire blocks that have been affected by operations. DuckLake claims to solve for this by storing the metadata in a database, because they're typically good at handling high concurrency and sorting out conflicts. Correct me if I'm wrong there - that's definitely the limit of my technical knowledge.... if I ever get to work with these tools, I'm sure it'll be good knowledge to have!",

Iceberg and Delta are fundamentally metadata formats, you write a bunch of files that basically say \"table X is comprised of parquet files 1,2,...N, minus the rows at positions 1,2,...N\". But then they put a catalog on top, which is a regular relational database that says \"the latest version of table X is defined by metadata file X.N\". If we're going to have a database in the picture, why don't we just put all the metadata there?The problem I see is, I don't see how this gets adopted. Adoption of Iceberg was a multi-year process. Adoption of Delta was basically vendor-driven by Databricks and Microsoft. Right now I can't see a path by which DuckLake gets adopted by Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery, MS Fabric, and AWS Glue.

For example just automatically converting tables to pandas dataframes and processing that way could cause some big inefficiencies, especially if you could just perform the operation in SQL to start.A good place to start might be to look at your existing pipelines and process and figure out where the rubbing points are and seeing if that's a place Python could help with.",

Although, there are many other programming languages that could be used for the same stuff, Python is popular due to its extended list of excellent libraries designed for data engineering, data science and analysis purposes. So what do I use it for in data engineering: 1) building simple scraper scripts that can run in most environments as Python is very popular; 2) more traditional ETLs such as from blob storage to some data warehouse. But there many other applications but these are the common ones.",

I say sorry they have to do it, but I would be completely unable to keep track of what needs doing otherwise, and that it's also important so my manager has visibility of the workload. All of which is true. If people repeatedly try to give me work via Teams or email, after a couple of clear reminders of the process, I just start ignoring them. I also emphasise that the ticket needs to include meaningful context that will help me prioritise it against other things - I freely acknowledge that there are a lot of other things competing for my attention, and am clear that I'm not choosing favourites, my goal is always to simply be doing whatever is highest benefit to the company overall. Nobody can really disagree with that without sounding bad themselves. So in specifics, I expect every ticket to give me an idea of how much time it's going to save someone, or how much revenue it'll bring in, or what revenue we'll lose if it's not done by a certain date, etc. If the ticket doesn't, I ask for this info via the ticketing system and it goes on hold until I have it.",

There will also be a part where you talk about your experience and answer questions like “tell me a time when you recently identified a data cleaning issue” or something like that. Also it’s just a grab bag: some interviewers will be super chill and trust you when explaining your experience and the depth of it. Others won’t and then will ask you incredibly specific technical questions (eg where do you find parquet metadata in delta tables. I’ve found these types of questions typically came from Indian people sorry to generalize but it might help you). Anyways good luck",

Expect stuff like \"how would you model this entity relationship\" or \"write a query that joins these tables and does X aggregation\" 2. System design - you'll get asked to design a batch/streaming pipeline for some scenario. Know your Kafka vs Kinesis, star schema vs snowflake, batch vs micro-batch trade-offs.3. Take-home - these suck but common. Usually building a small ETL pipeline with test data. I had one where I had to build a pipeline that transformed reddit comments into a star schema and ran some basic analyses.4. Behavioral - standard stuff but focus on data quality, testing, and how you've handled data issues.Best advice: brush up on SQL window functions and Python data structures. Also be ready to talk about data quality - every company is obsessed with this right now. I've interviewed \\~25 DE candidates this quarter and most fail on basic stuff like explaining partitioning strategies or handling late-arriving data.",

None, zero, even with referrals. Every interview I got was the result of replying to recruiter messages in LinkedIn.Most of them were actually pretty good offers but the recruiter used some out of the box AI spam message so it looked sketchy as fuck. You had to have a call with them to figure out whether the offer was good.The actual interview loop mostly echoed everyone else in the comments.1. Phone screen2. Technical. Usually SQL heavy, some python. Most places didn't use a real platform like leetcode, they were instead conversational. This was a much better format at real tech companies and a MUCH MUCH worse format at wannabe tech companies, they were very \"magic word\" centric.3. Multiple panel interviews, at least one behavioral. Similar experience above, tech companies and dinosaur boomer corps were much more fluid and conversational. \"Tech\" companies were once again an awful experience. I failed a 5th round team matching interview because I mentioned DB2 literally one time. Got a rejection saying they were looking for someone with more experience. That was the only thing I remember saying that wasn't about besides hobbies, pets, interests, and other low stakes small talk so I'm assuming that was what did it",

The requirement to authenticate in the VS Code extension, along with its acceptable use policy, seems aimed at identifying medium- and large-sized organizations using the free tools and pushing them toward buying a cloud license.This isn’t just about drawing a line between core and cloud — it looks like an intentional effort to murder core without causing too much backlash. People have already noticed that development on core has slowed down significantly over the past year. At this rate, it wouldn’t be surprising if core quietly disappears in the next few years since it will inevitably be a challenge/infeasible to maintain both moving forward.",

A few things: 1. dbt-core is not going away! Have you seen the [dbt Core roadmap we published yesterday](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/blob/main/docs/roadmap/2025-05-new-engine-same-language.md)? It talks about our plans to continue supporting and adding functionality to dbt Core. 2. Totally understand having some questions about the ELv2 License. [You can read more here](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/new-code-new-license-understanding-the-new-license-for-the-dbt-fusion-engine), but the gist of it is as you can adopt it, use it, share it, modify it, all without talking to us or registering at all. The only restrictions are around building competitive managed services or circumventing the license keys. If you use dbt core at your org for your data pipelines today, you can use the dbt Fusion engine for that same work in the future. You can check out [this post for more details](https://docs.getdbt.com/blog/dbt-fusion-engine-components), but I'd be really curious to hear what's on your mind!",

If you want to 1000 lines of raw SQL (no Jinja templating), you absolutely can. dbt will submit the query to the configured warehouse. If you really need every ounce of performance, write the giant query, but you can generally make pipelines much easier to read and maintain while getting acceptable performance.My bigger issue with dbt is the invocation / scheduling overhead that can be difficult to see and extremely impactful on performance. My team uses Airflow and k8s, and we've had to refine guidelines on building DAGs a lot. Originally, we just used DbtTaskGroup() from [astronomer-cosmos](https://github.com/astronomer/astronomer-cosmos), but this approach introduces a lot of overhead for large pipelines with many small models. Essentially, it executes 1 dbt invocation per model. When you have dozens or hundreds of models, and you're waiting both for Airflow to schedule tasks and then for the tasks themselves to spin up k8s jobs, this can propagate delays through your pipeline. We ended up consolidating models into a small handful of tasks, which reduced runtime by 25%.",

Having managed and dealt with fully driven sql ETL solutions, one can see the performance benefits and the performance pain points. Separating those concerns between db and app helps to determine what type of tool you need. I’m generally dealing with a significant volume of transformation and mapping logic, to consume a hundred different pictures of sources routing to the same final destinations. This part has never done well in sql server, and we won’t even get in to the concerns on flexibility, scalability, and bloat, to use sql server for this particular piece of the paradigm, if it is a concern you are even battling. If not, I’d argue in favor of something basic, and full sql can be totally fine in this regard. But if you are some enterprise level organization in some field of work with lots of data interchange and very little in the way of rules to enforce contracts, your transformation part of ETL will become king.",

A couple of ways to look at that include: * Cost of running the process * Complexity/manageability trade-offs to make it faster * How quickly do the users need it? It's rare for them to need data within 10 seconds, but 5-30 minutes is common - so that they aren't waiting around for data they just updated to be reflected. * How quickly do the engineers need it to run in? Keep in mind that if a production process fails on the last step, and if you can't restart from the last step then an 8-hour process might now take 16 hours. What if it then fails *again*? And what if this is going on during a holiday, or the middle of the night when it's hard to get expertise to help? For these reasons I push back hard on any process than takes more than 60 minutes to run, and strongly prefer incremental jobs than can run in 5 minutes.",

You need to adjust the optimization timeline to avoid spending too much time on the optimization procedure and eventually colliding with other table commits.\\> Am I overcomplicating by suggesting separate operational/analytical stores?IMO yes. Iceberg should be able to accomodate a heavy write load and most OLAP necessities, granted that you have a good query engine on top like Dremio, Trino, Starburst, etc. You can segregate and organize tables in separate schemas/databases and use a data catalog to keep everything in check.Only if you need near real time freshness and low latency reads you should consider a separate datastore.As with everything YMMV",

This is neither large scale, nor slow moving data.Similar concept would work if each \"service\" dumped million records once an hour (and I'd say give each its own table) but this is a complete mismatch what the technology is for.Now what your colleagues are correct about is that CDC is pretty complex business and if you really have no need for real-time data, you might be better off with periodic dumps.

Yeah, if you make it more complex than a super simple app, you should design it carefully. That's not a unique concept to Streamlit but people still write blog posts acting shocked when packing 2k lines of code in a single file without a thought for state management doesn't scale the way they want it to.The argument in this article that custom components are a mess is BS. Go look at the code for most of the custom components that exist. Most of them are the simplest react wrappers you could imagine, plus a normal developer using streamlit doesn't even have to worry about any of that. Not once have I ever had to get into debugging anything besides python when working with streamlit (even when using custom components, which is absolutely not required) so why would the fact of how they are built even matter to the average joe using streamlit?Compare what you can do in a single file with a few lines of code in Streamlit vs what the equivalent would be in asp.net or react.

I don't think the cloud offering is always a huge gain, but it helped some of the less technical people on the team run processes in testing more easily. We also gained a bunch from mesh, since we had a few projects (eg one for silver and one for gold models). The explorer feature was also nice to have, but wouldn't be a deciding factor. Overall, things like macros, tests, Jinja, etc, were also fine. You could find other ways to do them in other frameworks, but they're useful in many ways and you can implement a lot without much lift.",

Before it was spaghetti SQL files with no clear dependencies. Most useful features: ref(), tests, and documentation are actually worth it. Sources and macros are heavily used. Exposures were nice in theory but nobody maintained them. Snapshots were a mess - ended up just building those in our warehouse directly.Orchestration: Airflow + dbt is still clunky. We have our dbt DAG inside Airflow but then need to manually sync when dependencies change. If I started today, I'd use Dagster since it has first-class dbt integration.For non-technical folks: The lineage graphs in dbt Cloud are nice but rarely used by stakeholders in my experience. They still just message the data team.Challenges: The learning curve for non-SQL people is steep, especially with macros and Jinja. Performance became a bottleneck with 500+ models. dbt Cloud's git workflow is rigid compared to local dev.Would I adopt again? Yes, but with caveats. I'd set much stricter conventions up front and would consider something like preswald for the Python+SQL parts since our ML engineers hate the dbt workflow. We use it for a recommender system where we need both pandas for user clustering and SQL for joining with sales data - that cross-language part is where dbt falls short.",

The most impactful changes I've seen are around collaboration and code quality - `ref()` functions eliminated our hard coded table names, builtin testing catches data quality issues early, and version control became natural. The documentation generation and lineage tracking have improved our communication, though the semantic layer features are still maturing and often feel overhyped.The real challenges I've encountered emerge around orchestration and performance at scale. While dbt handles transformation DAGs elegantly, integrating with Airflow required planning to avoid duplicate logic and scheduling conflicts. For managing data from multiple sources, I've found that solutions like Windsor.ai simplify the upstream, consolidating data from various APIs and platforms.Given your junior team's situation, I'd recommend starting with dbt Cloud despite the cost, the GUI, builtin scheduler, and easier onboarding reduce the learning curve compared to Core's CLI-heavy workflow. SQLMesh is promising but still early stage, most teams I know would adopt dbt again, but with better upfront planning around testing strategies, macro organization, and clear governance policies.",

For example, not many people using versioned models, unit testing, etc.What people do use; docs, lineage, data testing, and the bread and butter of dbt; snapshots, incremental models, etc.All this being said, dbt alone isn't gonna fix anything. The teams that realize the best outcomes change more than the tech. They add things like CI/CD, implementing tools like SQLFluff, dbt-checkpoint, etc. They rethink the whole process not just adding dbt. You also need to worry about improving how data is modeled, because that will have a big impact as well.Many people do use Airflow with dbt including people on dbt Cloud. Why? because the dbt Cloud scheduler is pretty limited. Airflow is the market leader hands down.I have seen large teams work with dbt well and I have seen small teams work with it poorly. Sometimes this is due to their philosophical differences. e.g. not letting dbt manage the dependencies but trying to manually recreate them in Airflow. As for dbt Cloud pricing, it can be an issue as teams grow. Their teams level is limited to one project and up to 8 users, so that becomes an issue when teams pass those limits because prices jump quite high.Google \"dbt alternatives\" or \"dbt cloud vs dbt Core\", lots of resources out there. This week there has been a lot of chatter about dbt Fusion, but if is not feature complete yet IMO and very Snowflake centric. The licensing restrictions will mean many people won't adopt it any time soon. Would I use it today, probably, there is a wealth of information out there on dbt, a big community, a large ecosystem, but I would also consider other options like SQLMesh which has a more open licensing model and even their VS Code extension is better than dbt's because that one requires registering with dbt cloud and it is limited to 15 users.",

Having a good mentor can help steer your own career. Working in FAANG it shouldn't be difficult to find one and they don't always need to be within your own reporting lines.- Teach, don't do. You'll find yourself a lot just fixing juniors problems but not solving the underlying issue. The teach a man to fish anecdote is so applicable and you'll feel less uncomfortable with them struggling. Failure is a part of learning so treat it like that for them.- Be informally formal. Imposter syndrome at your age is always rife and I too had the same issue. I ended up on a training course for working at an enterprise level and raised the same challenge with the trainer. The main learning was reading the situation and being yourself where applicable. The imposter syndrome is hard to shake but it'll get easier with time.- Most importantly, make time for yourself and your own development. You'll find yourself putting more time on others and taking a leading role. However don't forget to take your training days and learn. Good luck!",

If you can define success and measure it, you can reliably hit it. You can also quantify your success to your stakeholders and increase the trust. Good things to measure are: * SLA availability/uptime* MTTA/MTTR for any pipeline failures* reconciliation (are all records captured from point A present at point Z)* number of errors * costif you can measure these few things, you can describe to your stakeholders the value that you add. It's really transformational to measure yourself. Even if you are consistently shit and not hitting appropriate benchmarks, you can highlight to management that you need more resources. As long as you are well meaning and semi-competent, measurement is your friend.",

To me, it's been steep in terms of the sheer amount of new things to learn, but it can be taken step by step. I just started a role as an analytics engineer.

Anyone who tells you they know what's going to happen in the industry over the next 5-10 years is probably wrong. AI will be a disruptor. How significant that disruption will be and what form it takes is still very much a question mark. Turning towards more soft skills with job titles like \"Data Architect\" may insulate you somewhat from that disruption, but as I said, predicting the next few years is very difficult. 3. If you want a masters, do it because you like the subject area and you want to learn about it. If it costs too much then get a hold of the syllabi and read the materials. As someone who hires engineers, masters degrees mean very little to me. Comp sci education is very often a 5 years or more behind current technology and practices unless faculty are direct from the industry. Being 5 years behind in other disciplines is not a big deal. In our industry it makes a massive difference.",

Without their participation, it would be an exercise in futility, if not a tremendous waste of time, trying to find the metaphorical \"one piece\" treasure, without any knowledge of what and where it is. Debugging would also be a nightmare too. That said, often only money talks when dealing with these (cost centre type) stakeholders. Without which, things tend to be stalemated when there are insufficient carrots given.Also being able to convince your managers to invest the time and effort to document your work and knowledge is a vital life skill. Documentation is often in short supply, and recommiting the original sin of insufficient documentation is an act of self sabotage. This also makes onboarding any new staff and creates a key man risk problem which makes leave coverage more challenging than it already is too.Bottom line: Organisational management and people skills are vital.Best of luck out there.",

Airflow does get more complex when you have a lot of dependencies between dags, unique scheduling, dependencies on external factors, branching, etc. But for basic cron-style scheduling it's very straightforward, and the current UI is a significant improvement over the past. Training and tips available all over the place since it's been out a long time, and a Slack community when you have trouble with something.",

It's a pure orchestration tool, doesnt try convince you otherwise, runs everything, plugs into everything, has fantastic dbt integration. Some odd configuration requirements, but setting up the Schedules etc is very easy.Prefect, is my personal favourite, does orchestration and does it very well, has awesome support for some complex implementations, works well with any python package you decide to run, i personally like dlt or polar. Dagster, its an incredibly powerful tool, it has some incredibly features like sensors and automaterialization, however, the amount of fuck around to do some things like complicated incremental loads is a headache, especially because the way it's been designed almost forcing you to do things a certain way.I dont like the amount of inline written sql in dagsters documentation, seems like a huge fuckin liability ah, this should be handled through schema drift detection, it should be more flexible in that sense like dlt is, so easy to set up incremental loads, use state to prevent additional loads of already processed records.It feels like a serious amount of vendor lock in, im sure the software devs love it, because they want the intense finetuned control, but it'll become a headache long term.I also find retrieving data real time from the database to control current loads via looking for gaps in data or controlling max or min dates ranges for countries for example is much easier in dlt which works better with prefect or airflow mo.Dagster is amazing, I still use it, im keen to get more experienced but fuck me the documentation feels messy, 100 ways to do everything, constantly running into \"that's the old way\" It seems like a bloated tool... and that's compared to airflow which has been around more than twice as long.I'd go with prefect or airflow unless the team are software devs, they'll prefer dagster but it'll become a huge liability when the team grows imo",

I use Iceberg with Spark, Trino, Snowflake at work. Iceberg works really well with Spark, other client drivers usually are behind.5. Maintanance of small files, compaction, etc [see these docs](https://iceberg.apache.org/docs/latest/maintenance/#delete-orphan-files)I haven't used Singlestore but do not expect OLTP(or clickhouse like speeds from Iceberg.IMO its helpful to avoid vendor lock in (althought I am usually doubtful of these claims, since most vendor data can be dumped out into parquet, or some common standard).As for time travel, its definitely helpful. I've also used SCD2 and kept fact table entries as non immutable past certain lookback time with an etl_inserted column to eseential do time travel (think processing ts column).I'd really nail down the requirements, what does time travel mean to your use case, why do you need it, any other way to easily get what you are looking for? And what is fast mean (under 10s, under subsecond) can you optimize your query to make current system faster; Iceberg will not magically make your queries faster.Hope this helps, lmk if you have any questions.",

It handles Python + SQL, builds DAGs, has versioning capabilities through assets, and provides a clean UI for visualizing those DAGs. The lineage tracking is solid and deployment is way less painful than Airflow. For your text processing case, I've used it to run spaCy pipelines on product reviews that feed into Postgres - works great because you define everything as assets and Dagster handles the dependency resolution.If you're looking for something more lightweight, preswald might work too - it's open-source and handles the Python + SQL combo well. I use it for our NLP pipelines where we extract entities from news articles, transform with Python, then load to Postgres. You can build the lineage visually and it handles versioning through git. Much simpler setup than the Airflow/dbt combo we had before that required two separate systems for the sql vs python parts.",

While it isn’t a database and is just a query engine, that can be a feature although it may seem like a deficiency.The separation of ingestion + landing of data and reading from it can be nice since you don’t have to worry about the noisy neighbor problem (aka large queries monopolizing resources)Again, ClickHouse will work and really any OLAP will work (Apache Druid or Pinot). What it’ll come down to are performance requirements and maintainability.Personally I’d give ClickHouse a go first as that will be the most streamlined approach.

My idea much like your own is that analyst team still spend a lot of time doing data prep writing connectors. I've been doing it for so long that I can pretty much do it with my eyes closed so I would love to build a system you know that's managed version controlled it's got row level security, everything is a description attached to it easy to use for anybody including non-technical people. So far I've got one client, but they are a bit more involved it's helping me keep afloat in the meantime. They pay 5,000 usd monthly and do a lot of things manually have a lot of data sources that are pretty complicated Don't have API connector stuff like that. I've got lots of insights but no diamonds yet. At first I tried really small businesses like Mom and Pop shops around town, it was really hard to educate them and also they have no money. Some other key things I learned is that in person referrals are worth their weight in gold if someone else can sing your praises then the person that they're singing to doesn't really need to do any further validation that you will be able to solve their problems. This is hand in hand with finding complimentary businesses that might need to outsource their work. So if you can meet with as many people who do similar work they may eventually have work for you. The other thing is social media if you can manage to figure out what your customers paying points are specifically and then regularly make content around it that may produce leads for years to come. I suppose alternatively completely cold outreach has not worked for me yet. I tried messaging on LinkedIn I've tried to emailing people, mind you not in the hundreds but rather and let's say the tens. But still 0% response rate on any of that and most of the time you just get ignored. After a lot of talking and thinking I realized that I'm really trying to solve my own problem as an analyst for so many years. So I'm doing a micro pivot and trying to focus on helping maybe slightly technical marketing teams or analyst and scientist teams that struggle with disconnected data sources and they would like a modeled data warehouse as a service. Including all of the business metrics reports dashboards The whole works. My pricing is pretty similar to yours, depending on the number of data sources I was thinking somewhere in the ballpark of 4,000 to $10,000 for a setup, and then a retainer feed to manage everything going forwards anywhere from you know 500 to $5,000. If you or anyone else would be interested in talking virtually or even starting a discord or something that could be cool! My website is DataSeed.ca, but fyi it still reflects my soft launch and hasn't been updated in a while.",

While your current role might not feel like pure data engineering, it is still giving you valuable exposure to tools and processes that are widely used in the field.Writing ingestion scripts in PySpark and creating views for analysts may seem simple, but these tasks are part of a much bigger pipeline. You are interacting with Databricks and the lakehouse architecture, which many companies are still trying to implement. This means you're in a strong position to understand modern data workflows from the inside.If you're concerned about limited learning opportunities, try exploring what surrounds your current tasks. Ask about the scheduling systems they use for ingestion, whether it's something like Airflow or another orchestration tool. Learn how they handle data quality and transformation. These areas can give you new learning opportunities without needing to change your role immediately.For self learning, continue strengthening your Python and SQL skills. Then branch out by focusing on the tech you're already exposed to. Look deeper into Spark optimization, Delta Lake, and how Databricks operates in cloud environments. You can also study data pipeline orchestration using tools like Airflow or Prefect. Tools like dbt are also helpful for managing transformations.If you prefer structure, try building a small personal data project. For example, collect data with Python, store it in a cloud database, process it using PySpark or Pandas, and visualize it using a dashboard tool like Streamlit or Power BI. This hands-on work will connect the dots and show you how the tools work together.The internship you have now is just a stepping stone. You are not stuck. You’re gathering real experience and starting to understand how things fit.",

You need to focus firstly on executing your tasks to the absolute best of your ability, no matter how simple, and putting the people you're working with at ease about the quality of your work. This will encourage them to give you larger and more complex tasks which will increase your rate of learning more than requesting exposure to X or Y tool.

So technically the DS is kind of the DE's client so to speak. There is overlap and collaboration but the DE sets up the data so that the DS can then use that data. Not sure about how the job market compares but I think it's safe to say that both aren't going anywhere anytime soon. Good luck!",

One thing to consider is where you live which has ultimately driven my choice to go into data engineering. Here in Australia, we just don’t have enough businesses that are willing and ready to bring on data scientists to model there data, curate it or do any further analysis with the data as such yet. So data engineering has always had more opportunity as business are looking to move their data into cloud systems, just not ready for various reasons yet to go further with the data. The same is for data governance roles and perhaps even devOps, here at least most businesses are looking to hire experienced individuals who are willing to take on that particular role. I could be wrong here but this has been my analysis from friends who are senior data engineers in big corporate companies. Now that I have my masters in data science, I’ve gone ahead and done my azure data fundamentals, data bricks lake house certification as well as data bricks associate data engineering certification to make me ready for any graduate positions",

Whether the insight from data requires a dedicated DS team or DA/BI, that's the question. DS is more interesting for sure but in a corporate environment you are always going to struggle to enjoy it. It really depends on how much faith company puts in a DS team.DS generally has a lot of uncertainty and requires lot of justification to exist in a company. There are some fields like marketing and adtech where DS have more defined problems to solve. Otherwise lot of the times you are struggling to have quality data to provide business value that some DA/BI team can't already. Lot of DS roles these days have merged with ML engineer role. So I would say make a choice between DE or ML engineer. In general closer you are you to the engineering team in the company, safer your job would be. With DS that's not always the case.",

We only did PoCs with ClickHouse and Starrocks - I'd say those are kind of \"second generation real-time OLAP\" where Druid and Pinot are first generation. The difference between the \"generations\" seems to be mostly operational, and also ClickHouse and Starrocks can also do data transformation, while Pinot and Druid seem to expect the data goes out mostly in the same form as it goes in.The data transformation is also the key challenge, as for the data to be transformed you have to translate the logic into materialized views, which have some limitations. If you're mostly \"adding data to a pile\" with some aggregations and small joins, that can be done relatively easily. If you have multi-layer data warehouse style model with complex logic, it might get complicated, and that is where we got stuck.",

I'll assume you want something more general.If you have a passion project and time, it's a little easier to build out a coherent training plan, since you have something concrete to work toward. For example, if you're really into sportsball, you can find a place to get sportsball data, extract it on some cadence, transform it, maybe do some simple ML on it, and then visualize the whole thing. That gets you:1. Extraction patterns. This can be DIY Python scripts or an ETL tool like dlt or Airbyte2. Scheduling and orchestration. Maybe it's as simple as cron jobs, or maybe you'll stand up Dagster or Airflow3. Database management. You can probably comfortably do everything in DuckDB, but if you want to get fancy, you can use a single-node Spark cluster to write out to Iceberg or some other table format4. Data modeling. Your data may have quality issues or just isn't structured in a way that's easy to work with, and you can learn about patterns like dimensional modeling and Data Vault. You can also pick up a transform tool like dbt or SQLMesh5. Optional: you can do some (simple) ML with keras / Tensorflow or PyTorch. Think simple classification or prediction6. Visualization. Make a dashboard. There are a billion tools out there, both OSS and proprietary: Power BI, Tableau, Looker Studio, Lightdash, or Superset are just a few. Pick one and make a dashboard to help you understand the data you've extracted and transformed7. Optional: A lot of this stuff can be managed either via cloud resources or locally-run via containers.

So , from my experience having both backend and devops knowledge is a huge plus for data engineering roles. Backend basics is anyhow crud and you can learn easily.

A lot depends on what exactly the image is doing and how you are running it. I'd recommend only building the environment in the image and don't bake the code into the image directly. Use a volume (or bind) mount or a side car to expose your code to the container at runtime. Something like git-sync makes this easy but there are a lot of different ways to handle it. Now your version updates to the base image decreases substantiality, reducing build time and storage costs. It becomes much more practical to store many versions of the image. This has other benefits as well. Want to upgrade one pipeline to a new version? Just pin a new image version to the job. Testing becomes significantly easier by disconnecting the two pieces. Good advice when running in production is never rely on the 'latest' tag, always pin your dependencies. That goes for images as well as Python packages. tl;dr - Mount code to an image, don't build a new one every time. Pin your dependencies",

Your image should behave exactly the same way regardless of what server it runs on, that's the entire point of containers. This does differ from the approach you would take if you were building something like an API or a Django web app. In that case rebuild the image every time, for a lot of different reasons you wouldn't volume mount code in this case.For data pipelines there really isn't a good reason to do so. Build your python environment and install your required libraries as part of the image. Your pipeline code should not be responsible for managing its environment. You very much can put the code directly in the image and it is perfectly acceptable to do so. You'll just be building images extremely frequently and be storing a lot of them. If you are using cloud storage or Vms to build the costs add up at scale. At the very least though make sure you have an image per pipeline. You don't want to fall into the trap of needing to test every pipeline if you want to upgrade your image in any way. How you accomplish this can vary. Are you running on bare metal, k8s, some kind of runner? For example running in k8s using airflow as a scheduler kick off jobs from a yaml file. The yaml includes image tag, version, command to execute, some inputs or outputs depending on the pipeline. Git-sync container runs as an init container to grab the code and your image executes the desired pipeline. This makes the development cycle short and keeps testing easy. Need to run an old version, provide a tag or a sha to git sync to reference from instead of HEAD.",

Take it all in and go slow at first to learn who is who and what makes their world tick/important to them to ensure successful outcomes. Youll also get a great understanding of what skills you need to upgrade or learn from scratch as you may be hitting multiple areas of IT functions (Sysadmin, cloud admin, dba, devops and data engineering).It has definitely at times been overwhelming but take solace in the fact youre learning and becoming an one man army. Id recommend taking it with your 3 YoE as youll grow fast in your career and learn many skills other companies might already have other teams for.Best of luck if you take this step! One last tidbit, once things are built out and most functionality is there, push to get another resource for your team to help share the load.",

If you can, make a cloud account at work and make some basic work-related processes there. These can be solely for conversation in job interviews. Yes this is basically misleading but if you're able to speak intelligently to basic cloud services during the interviews and are able to pick things up quickly it likely doesn't matter. Option 2: read up on and test out as many DE related cloud technologies as you can so you can upfront say \"I haven't worked in cloud but have done personal projects and understand the technologies listed in the job description fit, and I'm confident I can contribute meaningfully in a month or less in those technologies if you hire me.\" I went this route in my onprem to cloud role transition. Regardless of the option, remember that hiring managers aren't looking for xyz skills per se, they're wanting to know if you can do the job. You're not gonna convince every single one that you can do it without prior work experience but for those you can, full confidence goes a long way.",

If your business benefits and thrives, pay the vendors because your fortune depends on their fortune.The OSS is one big lie, frankly and it only works if you have a large enough ecosystem built. If that is the case, the big vendors are willing to pony up money to finance a core group of developers to maintain and support the system. Good case in point is Linus Torvalds - he works for the Linux Foundation which is financed by all big vendors because they have good reasons for Linux to continue to thrive.",

Postgres is great and all but there’s no reason to do extract/load that you don’t need to, and if you’re licensed for MSSQL then use it!Having an intermediate layer means another tool chain. What would you use? I tried dlt for that and it can’t properly handle MSSQL sources or designations; its reader library fails on large column types and the writer library writes everything as varchar rather than nvarchar! I ended up rolling my own (for MSSQL to MSSQL). But also for performance tuning and investigation tooling wise, MSSQL has it all. I’d keep it all in there. I haven’t used dbt but I’ve been trialing sqlmesh which is a kind of successor to it. It’s good at managing nested views on top of data and materialising it, and I’m contributing a patch to make it run better on MSSQL also for my own purposes.To expand on that, sqlmesh works perfectly for all of the MSSQL data types I’ve thrown at it so far. Because you aren’t moving data through it and just managing views, that’s all it needs to do, and so in that case it’s great.It reads in your source tables and data types. You create your views and it understands what output types should be there, even in views that reference views too, and creates the output heaps to dump into with all of the right data types (they say you should explicitly declare them but I don’t want to and it seems to work without it, so why would I? that’s the whole point…).So there’s no repetition of basic data type information or table management. Just write your views and go.My patch is around improving the way it does its merge for incremental updates to the views. But also the output tables it creates are just heaps, there are ways to add indexes after the fact though and even in an automatic kind of way, it’s just not as intuitive as it could be. Still, it works!So yeah I’d keep it all in MSSQL but also if you’re mostly interested in materialising views I’d probably at least try sqlmesh before fully committing to dbt. Just in case it’s a better fit for you.",

Try very hard to understand your users' problems and not treat them as a source of requirements that you build like a checklist. Let everyone contribute ideas for solutions. Resist the urge to split the work up into a bunch of smaller \"independent\" projects (this decoupling is often impossible and dysfunctional), and instead keep some team-level objectives (e.g., OKRs) and let the team self-organize and self-manage as much as possible.",

But as others have mentioned there’s reasons why you might not want to (like performance), or you might be limited by what you can do in the source system / integrations. I know Salesforce in particular rate limits their APIs which can make it difficult to export large amounts of data (they don’t want you doing this, essentially) so that could be the reason. A properly designed & implemented CDC system shouldn’t have “data quality” issues like those that you’ve mentioned. But could it be that deletes are handled a different way? For example, if SCD type 2 is implemented in Snowflake, you’d never delete records entirely, you’d instead end-date them and insert a new row. Hope that helps!",

Here are some things I wish the company could have done / Internships in DE should be like1. Rotation: I feel DE is broad, you have members handling your K8s, Analytics Engineers, EDH teams etc... I think the internship should offer the candidates a feel of each role. This way I feel, they will get more insights about the entire flow on a prod level. Like how teams are handling the companies data needs etc..2. Reward : You will always find someone who shows more interest and passion towards DE than the others, reward them, meaning, additional responsibilities like leading a group of interns to build end-to-end pipelines, let them figure out.3. Coupons for Professional certifications as a reward (maybe?)",

We don’t have a specific rotation plan. Since we’re a consulting firm people tend to naturally rotate projects, and interns follow that once they convert into full time employees (usually happens after around 1 year of internship — in my country internship contracts can last up to 2 years, and at my company we aim to convert interns into FTEs, we don’t hire juniors, they come exclusively from the internship program). The way our program is structured is around 6 months for the learning plan (since they are undergrad students we don’t expect/require previous experience or extensive knowledge) and the remaining internship period (this can change from intern to intern based on their needs/progress) is spent allocated on project (usually the same one).We don’t have any official rewards system, but as a team our approach it to give the interns opportunities to explore according to their development and interests. Things like interns joining POCs, internal projects, etc. We have a dedicated budget for the internship programs, so any courses/certifications they take are covered by that and we provide access to the O’Reily learning portal. These are not rewards though, they are part of the internship program.",

In short all you need to do is study the above tech stack and tell the interviewer that you have worked on xyz project on DE. With less thn 3 years of Exp they wont be expecting too muchAnd the most important thing of all do some hard core Sql as part of preperation. 4 5 months is the correct estimation.

If you have to get \"everything\" our solution (though architecture and tooling is different specifically not using redshift) was delta loads for ingestion -> incremental persistent table (dbt model) (we use a variant column (snowflake) to persist a historical record of the raw data still in its semi structured format) -> then we flatten the arrays into operational tables (e.g. event params or user events) which are also incremental models (we generate a custom unique key here based on array data) ( in snowflake we cluster based on the keys that make up the operational key to improve efficiency) and we use the delete+merge snowflake strategy (this is well documented and can be replicated in other tooling, snowflake just makes it easier and cans the feature OOB).Most of our compute is snowflake for these cases and for a persistent historical BQ object of ~10b rows (semi-structured), in terms of dbt, we can run most of our models in 5-30 mins (each) depending on the array size and if we scale the Snowflake WH.Obviously if your GA4 has a bit more customization, and your traffic is significantly larger than my end users, your experience can differ but we feel this is a solid and scalable approach. A bigger risk point is if the delete+merge strategy fails during the run you could see data loss, but that's fairly unlikely and also why we have a redundant backup.",

A lakehouse definitely can be the origin for a dataset and be the only 'source' for this data. The important aspects to consider before choosing to use the lakehouse as the origin location for the data will involve your governance and auditing practices, how robust your lakehouse setup is, how reliable your processes are to ensure proper testing / auditing. Etc. Its the same concern you'd have keeping a data set in any location. In reality, depending on your use case and how your data sources store the data once its extracted, once your lakehouse ingests the data from the external sources, the external source may not always maintain a copy of that data, leaving it only in the lake of the lakehouse. Same sort of idea as using the lake & lakehouse as the data origin for a 'new' dataset that isn't derived from a raw external data set. If you're performing transformations on the raw 'bronze' or even 'silver' data, you are creating new datasets likely being held ONLY in the lake or lakehouse, unless you then moved those datasets into a different warehouse or system.These new transformed datasets may be derived from the raw external data, but they are new datasets in tables in the lakehouse. I think you'll find lakehouses to be powerful and friendly for rule-based processing. If the lakehouse is ONLY being used as a glorified ETL platform, it's kind of a silly misuse of the power. (If you have a strong data governance program requiring you to maintain storage / system of record elsewhere, then obviously the lakehouse is not the long term storage place. But this has not been the case in my experience, outside of heavily regulated industries... which generally have so many redundancies in place the data ends up living in multiple places )For clarity in how this is possible: constraints being business setting the rules and editing the data set.im not sure exactly what platform you're working with or what type of lakehouse you have, but an example way to do this for microsoft fabric: 1. Create a rules table that lives in the Fabric Lakehouse (Delta format).2. Let business users edit those rules (via Power BI, powerapps, excel ).3. Build a processing logic (in Notebook or Dataflow) that applies the rules to a dataset. 4. Trigger the Fabric pipeline when rules change or on a schedule.5. Store the final result back in the Fabric Lakehouse. Because the users can change the rules themselves, be mindful to keep a table with every recorded change if you're concerned about data loss or potentially having a need to review the intermediary changes that occurred on the datasets.[Big ND energy over here - hope the details help]",

JupySQL is another option if you're already in the Jupyter ecosystem - it has magic commands like %sql that connect to most DBs. For a pure notebook feel with SQL superpowers, try DataStation or Querybook (from Pinterest). Dealt with this recently when setting up a data analysis workflow across teams - DBeaver ended up being the most reliable for heavy postgres work, while DataStation was better for mixing SQL+Python for quick viz work. preswald is also worth looking at if you need interactive dashboards/sharing beyond just sql notebooks - lets you write sql/python in the same space and outputs to interactive apps.",

If you let business users run SQL you are significantly increasing the risk.If you are determined to go down this route then I would ensure that the data model presented to users is as simple as possible with limited opportunities for users to make things up for themselves - so this probably means creating views that pre-join your tables and where all calculations are pre-defined, and then only giving users to these views, not the underlying data.I would still limit them to running simple SELECT... WHERE...GROUP BY statements.Out of interest, have you asked your business users whether they want to be able to run their own SQL rather than, for example, using a graphical report builder (BI tool) where they can drag and drop fields onto a report?",

I can see I might not have the most popular opinion, but their connect product is very good and can alleviate the maintenance overhead of writing and deploying multiple pipelines especially when needing to handle fan out.A nice common workflow if you are trying to POC an eventing hook is to use a sink connector for http request, very much a tool box.",

Compared to PHP or Node, where you pull in tons of packages just to start writing any code, it's a really nice experience. Creating a new project is literally just creating a `.go` file and writing code.On top of that, the language surface is small and can be learned very fast, there is depth to it and gotchas you'll eventually, sooner or later, come across, but at that point you're already writing useful code.It also builds into a single binary which is easy to distribute, it has a far smaller memory footprint than Node and significantly faster start times. The builds are also very fast, making the development cycle very fast, almost like PHP or Node (in watch mode).Also, Go is often praised for its concurrency model.The syntax and paradigm of Go doesn't fit everyone, the language is definitely less expressive than TypeScript, and its type system is more rigid, at times it leads to lengthy code, but it tends to be easy to follow and understand, even if wordier than others.Go is just pretty good. Easy to write, readable, produces efficient apps, easy to deploy, if you don't mind its paradigm and wordiness, you'll generally enjoy using it.",

It's got just enough features to be powerful, but few that lead to bad design patterns. This also means that whole teams can learn it quickly. I have presided over a team learning Go and getting them ramped up, it was fun and straightforward.2. It has a static, strong typing system, which both eliminates a whole category of errors found with languages with dynamic type systems, and frees up computational resources that dynamic languages use to reason about data types. If you like data correctness and unambiguity, you'll like Go.3. While garbage collected, automatic garbage collection is great in 99% of cases and you're likely never going to run up against it in your day-to-day. Also, and sorry for burying the headline, but **Golang is almost as fast as any other compiled language like C** but monumentally safer and free of a vast majority of memory pointer errors (the biggest source of critical errors in compiled software).4. It produces all-in-one binaries that run. *And a cross-compiler is included.* Want to compile for Linux on ARM64? Windows on x86-64? NetBSD running on a PowerPC for some reason? Go's got you covered.5. Along with 4, the included tooling is fantastic - one download and unzip, a slight modification to your shell's rc script, and you're cruising. You have a compiler, a robust stdlib, a linter, etc.There are a couple of pitfalls though:1. It can hard to be understand at first how files, directories and packages are related to each other. 2. When you tread the usual, safe paths Go is absolutely phenomenal. However, that comes at a cost, so when you have to venture into things like runtime checks or the `unsafe` package, you get into a deep rabbit hole quickly. For example, working with a large volume of JSON data gets really tricky if you need it fast.",

I don't mean runtime error, this isn't like exceptions that propagate. I mean **no error**. The call seems successful, except you get nulls as a result. Nulls which you can't easily check for: see above.At this point I should note here that for a string value, null == \"\", for a number, null == 0, etc. Fun!So, what's this simple idiomatic and ugly way to check for error from the last call i hear you ask??You... you compare its second return value with a null........ go figure.Go is basically what you get when you take C, add garbage collection, and prohibit pointer arithmetics. That's the good side of go. The bad side, you're essentially in a stripped down C.They try to be \"clean\", yet keeping all the C weirdness. Like \\* in arguments meaning the thing is a pointer, but \\* everywhere else meaning the thing is no longer a pointer. But some things are pointers even without the \\*, and you need to remember which ones those are, because that dictates how can you check those for null values.For some strange reason you can't do nested struct literals. Also, you need to call some built-in initialization things to properly initialize a hashmap. Good thing is, we now have generics. Bad thing is, they're weird, don't work on methods, and they overload the interface syntax for type definitions.I actually like their OO in theory, because having methods separate from the structs allows for multimethods. Except go doesn't have multimethods.Instead, they use \"interfaces\" who's main feature is that they convert null pointers into semi-null pointers, which don't equal to null when you compare them with null, but then fail on null pointer reference anyway.Despite this, it's not actually that bad, if you embrace all the discouraged practices, which the standard library devs use everywhere anyway.It's pretty neat for small and performant production level projects. Just don't use it for anything big. It doesn't have the abstractions necessary.And if you can't make big projects, this makes their insistence on having a fast compiler pretty strange. I guess they need it to be fast to churn through all the copy pasted code.It's worth learning I'd say, it has its use and does have some redeeming qualities.But the community of apologetics is so high, you'd think that this whole thing is just a front for a large copium smuggling cartel.",

So that you can do the solution in a naive way and still get a passing, because is what I actually care about as a dev. You are able to understand and solve the issue, not that you can do in the most efficient way, that you only need to do it as a refractoring after it has been assessed that we need performance for that specific task.Classic example is to be able to do what they ask for string 10\\^12 carachter long in less than 200ms.And that's bad for two reasons:1. A requirement like that in a professional setting would have probably been stopped at the source: why do you have a string this long, and do we really need a string this long ?2. A lot of times, the DP solution is worse than the native solution for smaller sets. Something simply because it's harder to understand and as a general rule of thumb you want to make your code easy to understand, and also because sometimes is just less efficient for small sets because it requires some overhead work that the naive solutiomn won't need and while the naive solution is 0(n\\^2) instead of O(log(n)) for strings less than 200 carachter the naive solution can be faster.",

([Leetcode profile with same username as my Reddit name, with the 1000 day streak badge featured in the \"Badges\" section](https://leetcode.com/u/E3FxGaming/))In general I'd say I'm familiar with most of the problem types on Leetcode.While it was not my core focus, I would never deny that it helped me grow as a programmer. It simply was a daily routine that taught me some interesting tibits here and there.Would I copy & paste a Leetcode solution into my professional work? No. Would I apply the knowledge in the same way I apply any \"Data Structures & Algorithms\" knowledge from studying CS? Yes.>Most of these algorithms you will not need to know at all most of the time as most languages contain core libraries that do this stuff way more efficiently than most developers will be able to do.Very few problems on Leetcode tell you not to use a certain method of a core library. You can use those methods and nobody would blame you for it.After each successful submission you get some graphs showing you how your runtime and memory footprint compares to other submissions. You would quickly figure out that using standard methods isn't always the best solution.",

I don't know what I am going to do next but I don't think knowing how to program is itself useless even if you can't find work and can be a benefit in my next thing whatever that may be. I'm IT but I don't think I'm going to be able to stay. I also don't think you can really do anything to dodge layoffs anymore and the idea that you can upskill your way out of it and are anything but a number on the balance sheet to these people is kinda a cope. Like you could be the best coder ever these days and just get randomly laid off its not always because you did or didn't do something.",

It was all still difficult for me, because I was new and doing it on my own, but I also didn't take on too much at once as to discourage myself.",

        "body": "Pick a project that you are personally invested in.Create a thorough outline of features and functions. Don't know what features and functions are needed to make it work? Time to learn! Learning what you need to make the project will be your project!Break it down into smaller and smaller tasks until each task is small enough to be accomplished in less than a day or two. Create an ordered list of those tasks and tackle them one at a time. Stack up those small victories. Create momentum and ride it. Stuck on something and feel your momentum slowing? Switch tasks or call for help. Momentum is king and it's fed directly by those small victories. Small victories eventually add up to bigger ones. Those bigger ones eventually add up to a completed project. This is a marathon, not a sprint. You have to pace yourself.Once the project is done, do an analysis of what went right and what went wrong. Learn from your mistakes and keep doing what works.Bask in your victory for a short time. Treat yourself, you earned it.Pick your next project and buckle up. It's time to ride that train again.The longer you go, the easier it usually gets. If you find things are getting harder instead of easier, take a moment to step back and see why things are getting harder and how to lower the difficulty. If you find the difficulty of the project has gone past your limits, it might be time to realize your limits and find a more manageable project. Maybe, you got too ambitious and need to pick something easier, for now. Maybe, what you picked just isn't realistic to begin with. Sometimes, you have to figure these things out the hard way. It's a learning process and, if you do it right, it never ends and you don't want it to end.As for tools, you're pretty much the only person who knows what kind of tools you need.When it comes to programming, the tools you're likely to need are mostly in two categories. There are the tools that directly impact programming and the ones for organization and tracking progress.For programming, it's mostly about the environment; the editor, plugins and related tools. These are usually fairly straight forward to understand. Though, finding your preferences is a bit of a trail and error experience. Most people are fairly happy with Visual Studio Code for the editor. Try that and see what you like or don't like about it. If you're happy, move on to figuring out what additional plugins and tools make it work best for you. If not, figure out what you like and don't like about it and see if there's something that better fits your preferences or if there are plugins that fix what you don't like.For organization and tracking progress, it becomes even more personal. Maybe, you do it all in a series of post-it notes. Maybe, you type it out in a bunch of plain text documents. Maybe, you use something more sophisticated. You're the only one who knows what work flow works for you. There's more organizational and tracking tools out there than I could list in the 10000 character count limit. Do some digging and find your favorites. I'm a minimalist, so I mostly use Notepad and the occasional spreadsheet, as an example.I feel like, in the world of programming especially, searching for perfect answers is the biggest of all follies. You don't need a perfect answer, just one that isn't wrong. It's fine to occasionally take a moment to see if better answers exist but don't get obsessed.",

Do this at least 6 months to a year, and then start prepping for \"real interviews\" learn your algorithms, do leetcode, etc. You'll never be ready but as long as you have ok understanding of data structures and most common algorithms on those structures you'll be good. Don't forget to also study software/systems design/architecture.Then, start applying to companies where you'd like to work or ones where the work has meaning to you, otherwise you'll suffer. Don't believe the promises startup will make and if you're either bored or tired of a low pay then jump ship to a bigger company, this time \"the bigger the better\" you want this second company to be crazy big, avoid big companies whose main focus isn't technology, i.e. prefer Uber instead of Lenovo, streaming at Disney rather than IT at Boeing. There you'll learn about big scale and other engineering practices, this is where you go from midlevel engineer to senior, but to enter these companies sell yourself as a senior. Again be proactive, don't limit yourself to be a developer, you should also do the deployments, monitoring, become a generalist that goes deep. At least 3 years in a company like this will do. Don't fall in to the politics governing these big companies, you're there to learn, let them play their little games.After that the world is your oyster, you should be looking for companies that are surfing a generational wave, for example nowadays looking at Anthropic or OpenAI would be good, every ~10 years or so there's a big trend you should follow, personally I've found my sweetspot is remote companies of around 100 people, maybe 50 engineers, not everything depends on you but you still have impact on the future direction, no politics and no drama. Aim to at least double the pay every-time you switch companies, and during interviews never reveal what did you get paid at the previous job, at some point it would be almost impossible but if you're good you might get lucky.Good luck!...or enroll in a bootcamp.",

I had to go through a few months of minimum wage training, but it was good because they taught me the technologies I would need in the workforce, like React and Spring. After you pass the training they help you find a contracting gig with one of their clients. I ended up with Capital One, so they work with large companies. Unfortunately, you will be stuck with with a 2 year contract and lower than average pay, I only got 55k, but you still have benefits and if the company you are contracted with likes you they can buy out your contract and hire you. If not, you will at least have experience and they give you an option to stay another year and work with another client. My contract ended in 2021 and I'm not in the industry so Revature may have changed, but I would check them out. There are other companies with similar models too.",

It’s widely used for both frontend and backend development, including frameworks like React and runtime environments like Node.js. You can learn both sides pretty quickly by following large full-project tutorials on YouTube. Stick with one, and whenever you’re curious about something, dive into the documentation or use GPT for deeper understanding. You’ll learn the most by building projects, it’s fun, gives you real-world experience, and helps you start building a portfolio. Check out the FreeCodeCamp website it offers a great roadmap and exercises to learn full-stack development. You don’t need six months.

Within a program and interacting from program to program was very much not that easy. Even now, having understood and used more abstract concepts like multiple inheritance, the diamond problem, writing with and without OOP, and functional programming. Breaking down a task and putting it into code is still not easy for me. It really just takes time for the specific use case, it'll take a few iterations of design, or a completely new design in the end. It'll never be perfect, there is no perfect, but there's good enough, and good enough works until there's another good enough to compare it to. This is especially true when writing a one-off program, you don't know how much time invested into each component is worth, so those programming design patterns are now weighed with your desire to get something to work. Deadlines make everything a mess. The thing that helps is practice. Practice a lot. Practice is the best way to learn once you know how to write. There's always something new to learn so that can also feel depressing, you'll get to a point though like where I'm at that not knowing something won't bother you, because you know you can learn how to use it quickly, or you can also invest a couple hours understanding it completely. Most problems can be understood completely, don't try to look at the LZMA2 source code or code that is all sprawled out and think it'll be understood fast or completely.I've been doing this for a decade or so but my projects still seem amateur or chaotic, this is actually quite normal outside of a serious investment of time. Embrace chaos for the most part. I'm not going to report you to the FBI for having everything in a single file or reimplementing functionality, as long as you could do the opposite when you need to.",

I'm saying that because you sound like you are focusing on the tools and missing the bigger purpose as well as all the tasks needed before even starting creating a new source file. You and your team identify what the software needs then you build, select and piece together all the components, and sometimes you will be programming some logic or patterns here and there.I understand that you panicked and did something permanent in a temporary situation, but you could have believed that you had enough tools to assist you so that when it wasn't the time to code you should have focused on the rest of the software development lifecycle - a lot of which is about everyone preparing, reading and understanding their assignments.",

I either already have other patterns that centralize the logic, or I’m using a service layer to handle more complex operations. That said, I’ve found the Manager pattern can be useful in specific cases, particularly when I’m dealing with tightly coupled dependencies that I want to decouple. For example, in one of our applications, we had settings that were unfortunately intertwined with other parts of the application, like the data layer. Introducing a manager to hide those implementation details behind an abstraction allowed me to control those dependencies more easily, making it simpler to swap or adapt implementations later on.",

Your question is a \"devil's in the details\" kind of question, and it's hard to make a sweeping good or bad generalization of any and all manager classes. But if you want to approach it from the Stroustrup style, then I'd say: \\* Check that your class fields are maintaining an invariant. If they're not, then maybe this class should be a struct with plain functions. \\* Check that every method plays a role in maintaining the invariant. If one doesn't, then move it out of the class. \\* Check that every method is valid to use right after the constructor finishes. Does it make sense to invoke unload if I don't invoke load? If some method still needs more setup, then it should have its own constructor (and thus own class).Still, as always, the devil's in the details. If you can share maybe simplified example code, then we can get into the nitty-gritty.",

I've seen plenty of cases where the manager class has nothing to do with object lifecycle management. For this reason, if you read code and you encounter a manager class it tells you nothing about what it's doing. That's not only bad for understanding the code but also because these classes tend to attract more and more code because every logic fits into a manager class. It's the same issue with \"utils\" or \"common\" folders or files. They accumulate all the code people don't know or don't care to name or place properly. It just builds technical debt over time.The solution is not always to split the class into several smaller ones, often times it's enough to just pick a more meaningful name.",

Private tool servers, private agents, refactoring and tightening up RBAC on APIs to accommodate more dynamic access patterns... those are things that there won't be one vendor for. Those are the things that take you from chat app party trick to wildly better UI and capabilities for business systems.Also I'll note that just like the pre AI tech scene, the vast vast amount of positions will be not in innovation and R&D but in application development. Every shop will be building AI apps and especially extending and refactoring their existing systems to leverage AI, and the primary skill set will be building, not working at the bleeding edge of technology, but developing applications for it. UX is about to go through a bigger revolution than the smart phone. This change is going to make backends be designed differently. And platforms. There's about to be a ton of dev work, even with our shiny new tools that let us build feature X much faster than we could build it 5 years ago. We'll find ways to leverage lower experienced contributors, it just won't be endless frontend feature factories; demand for said features will go down with AI powered UX (not bolted on chat bot bs), and where they are needed, AI slop can handle that.

Remember there is no best way, this is just one way of doing things.Edit : regarding how to learn I'd ask AI how to conform code to a pattern, how to start with high level system architecture.

Same for index\\_of, also O(n) time.So, completely disregarding the correctness, you have three calls to O(n) functions in your simpler approach, making the overall runtime far worse for large inputs. (EDIT for clarity: The inside of the loop changes from O(1) to O(n), so the entire algorithm changes from O(n) to O(n²), because of the outer loop)If you want to see it for yourself, choose a large integer (like 10\\_000\\_000) as your target, and only fill the array with random integers of less than half it's size. This way, your condition will never trigger, and you will need to go through the entire array. Now make the array of length 100 million, and watch the runtime difference.(This strongly depends on a good hash map / hash function for the values. This depends on your language. Make sure that the hash map works correctly, because if it doesn't it might also have O(n) runtime and you will not see a big difference XD)",

Threw this in LC for shiggles to see how it compares, being sure to only iterate through the array when absolutely necessary: class Solution:     def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:         seen = []         for i in range(len(nums)):             complement = target - nums[i]             try:                 loc = seen.index(complement)                 return [loc, i]             except:                 seen.append(nums[i])336ms.Figured I'd try getting rid of the try/except, even knowing that built-ins like index are almost always faster: class Solution: def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]: seen = [] for i in range(len(nums)): complement = target - nums[i] for j in range(len(seen)): if seen[j] == complement: return [i, j] seen.append(nums[i])924ms.If this were another language, you could shave some time with preallocation, but I doubt the allocations are making up enough of a difference to make it worth exploring.There are edge cases with very specific problems where searching a small array is faster than using a hashmap. To be more specific, you have to completely iterate through the array in the time it takes the hashing to complete. That said, I've played around with a problem that fit this scenario, and the performance difference was negligible on an array with a max size of 20 elements in Rust. Unless you're aiming for sub-ms optimizations, and have a problem that is uniquely suited, hashmaps are pretty much always going to be faster.",

        "body": "The devs who create APIs are backend devs, and they typically work in languages like Java, Python, C#, and even JavaScript. They often use special frameworks for these languages that have built-in features that make building APIs easier or more performative. Typically they also work with databases in some capacity, as a core function of most APIs is retrieving or saving data to a database.Typically the devs consuming APIs are frontend devs who need data to display on a GUI. However, APIs can also call other APIs, so consuming APIs is something done by devs front or backend. It's becoming more common to become a full stack developer where you both create APIs and then consume them on the frontend. Often times though even full stack devs will specialize in one over the other. You'll find when you do this kind of work, you don't need to be a master of a language or framework to create passable features. Obviously it depends, but if your API consists of a lot of CRUD (create, read, update, delete) work, most devs can produce these endpoints with not a ton of experience needed.A great tool to start messing around with APIs is postman. You can call API endpoints from this tool and see exactly what type of data they return. Then you can start imagining how you could use this data, or how to build your own API that produces data you need. A real life example I'm currently working with is that I'm creating an app that uses flood data. Weather.gov has a great API that allows me to get flash flood alerts. Instead of just calling this flash flood API from my frontend, I'm actually calling the weather API from my backend. I'm doing this because I need to alter the data to fit my needs before using it. So I'm using my API to grab data with weather.gov's API, manipulating that data into a usable form for myself, storing that data in my own database, and then calling my own API from my own frontend to get that data out of my database so I can display flood alerts to users in the way that I need. Hopefully that helps!",

        "body": "One good way to think about APIs is a way to connect 30+ different services, instead of having a single service that tries to do it all. You need a way for service 1 to talk to service 3. This is done through APIs. Here is a long winded example:Imagine you have one central platform that users interface with (the UI/website).But then you also have three services {A1-3} that take in data at the start, from three different sources. Say the data coming into A1-3 is different user activity, say everytime a user logs into some systems {S1-3}. Those systems send data in different ways to A1-3. A1-3 may transform the data in some way and send it down the pipeline. Possibly convert it into some central schema, since the three sources {S1-3} provide different sources data formats.Maybe one of these data-consumers {A2} needs to query some other service {B1} that provides additional user data. Perhaps A1 and A3 already get this additional data directly from their sources, S1 and S3. B1 is a service your company created that just stores a bunch of specific data in a database. When the service A2 queries it (or any other service), it returns some useful information. Maybe the database holds user host information (like their computer name). So B1 is an API that takes in a User ID, and returns their hostname/Mac address/location, ect. It just queries the database by user ID, and returns the information. So you might say, why not just have A2 query the database directly? Well, what if later on you have another service that wants the same data. So you made the API B1, which is the only connection point to this particular database. Once A1-3 enrich and convert their data into a central schema, they send that data using some messaging service (e.g. Kafka) to one consumer, C1. C1's job is to just store this data in some database. All it does is read data from A1-3 and store it (in a DB), and then it provides an API to retrieve this data on-demand. All of these could be called 'microservices'. Instead of having a single service that does it all, we have 6 that just handle their own little section. The user interface (the front end), needs to be able to provide information to customers. If the customer needs to know when User#45 last logged in, it queries C1. This event has the original data A2 consumed + some enrichment from B1. Now is the best part. Remember how we made B1 its own independent service? When the UI wants to give the latest login info about a user it query C1.But what about when it needs to provide just hostname information (which is not directly tied to a particular login instance). These hostnames are unrelated to the login information from C1 (even though C1 has some hostname info, but only when related to logins).So now the UI can query B1 to provide a bunch of hostname information. In this long example, we only have two APIs, B1 and C1. But whilst populates B1? Imagine we also need to manage payment information, basic account info, ect. If it's closely related, it could be with one API and in one database. But often there will be disparate data from different sources. Better to make everything modular. So you end up with a bunch of small services that make their data available through their individual APIs.",

That's an API. So the answer to your question is both. I both take advantage of libraries that others have written and expose an API for consumption, and deliver libraries that are used by others. This goes for REST as well -- if you work with microservices, it's very common for the individual services to all communicate via REST APIs. Each service exposes its capabilities via REST verbs and endpoints, and in turn consumes other REST endpoints. Of course, certain services may use a message broker or queuing mechanism for communication, but REST is still very common when reliable message delivery and multiple message consumers aren't important.",

Plus it deals with Unicode for you.Having said that, you will be fighting the Rust compiler to begin with as you learn Rust's rules.

How many projects?That's kind of a self-answering question. If you need to know what types projects, how complex, and how many, then your portfolio isn't strong enough to negate a degree. Building real things, that actually work, that people can use (might use, and are using) is what's important. Whether it be a frontend template, or a full application that helps you find shoes for the cheapest price, across every popular sales marketplace (let's say). And you don't feature a \"certain number of projects\", you feature \"your best work to date\", whatever it might be, usually 4 to 8 things (and then maybe show off the rest of your stuff outside of your \"featured projects\"). And, what's featured will depend on what you do, what you're building, and what types of roles you're applying for.>Does language matter?Yes.

Do you want to build whizzy gadgets using microcontrollers? Get involved in designing new chips? Layout circuit boards for computers? Are you interested in RF engineering?You can start doing some of that stuff in the comfort of your own workshop while still earning a decent living as a software developer. Invest a few hundred bucks in basic tools like a good multimeter, soldering iron, etc., and few microcontroller boards such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi Pico, and some simple components like switches, wire, resistors, etc. There are all sorts of fun projects that you can build with the most basic electronics knowledge. Modern microcontrollers are very easy to use and a ton of fun. This is probably the hardware equivalent of getting started in programming with an easy language like Python.Becoming a professional \"hardware engineer\" obviously involves a lot more than that. Go look up the degree requirements for a bachelors degree in electrical engineering at your favorite university to get a taste of what you don't know.Probably your best bet would be to find a software development role that's hardware-adjacent. You could start building microcontroller projects in your spare time to start learning about embedded programming, and once you feel up to speed on that start looking for programming roles on hardware development projects.",

This is called a foreign function interface. You see it most often with C because C is so old and has a well defined, unchanging way that functions are compiled.And the third way is the one you know- send bytes to another program in a defined format like json or xml and deserialize it on the other side. If you want to make it easy to define the types and methods in multiple languages at once, you can use an interface definition language like Google's protocol buffers, which can then be used to generate functions and type definitions in a number of supported programming languages.",

An ABI doesn't have friction calls so much as \"put a value in this address in memory and/or jump to this memory address\". Anything where the thing you're calling is defined in source code terms is an API. A really common example of two languages talking to eachother is Python and C. Python is very easy to use but not very fast, so many of the performance-focused libraries like NumPy have the number crunching written in C and the python code calls the C code. There's a guide on that here https://realpython.com/python-bindings-overview/Another example: every single web browser that supports web assembly (WASM) does this; certain things can't be done in WASM so you need to be able to run JavaScript from your WASM code. The browsers provide an API for this. If you want to communicate between two different running programs there are a variety of message passing methods out here.",

The reason you might want this is to improve security further, it means if an attacker chooses the password \"password123\" and they somehow get access to the encrypted passwords, they won't be able to know everyone else that used the same password (since they will have different encrypted passwords even though they had the same original password).Whenever you generate a password with a salt, you are supposed to store that salt and use it again when validating the password. If you don't store the salt, you CAN'T authenticate the password when the user tries to log in.Note that you can absolutely use unsalted encryption if you want, but it's less secure so it's not recommended.",

But when I jumped into web dev, I had to learn how HTTP works, how to structure a web app, and how to connect to databases. If you want to build apps (like desktop or mobile), that’s another layer you’d learn different tools (like Kivy for desktop apps or something else for mobile).

Up and walking for 1-2 minutes every so often does a lot to extend your stamina. On lunch breaks, try walking around outside (if you have a park or walking path nearby then that's a great place, but even just around the block can do wonders). If you can walk somewhere for lunch instead of driven then try that as well.

Don't be abstract like \"calculate value\", but rather, be as specific as possible, like \"multiply cost with (1 + tax), then divide results by 100\".Do this for each step until you are able to manually, with no code at all, complete the process reliably, regardless of which values are used.Once you're done, copy all the steps as comments to your code. Translate manual actions to code. Using the above example, you'd do a line like `(cost * (1 + tax)) / 100`. Repeat until all steps are done, and that should work great.Writing code is the easy part, but when it's coupled with having to solve a problem, it becomes complex. When you do this, you're fully separating the problem solving and the code. Once you got the process done, you can then set up the code for each step.Edit: some time ago, I was working on a mod, and used this method a lot as I was learning how to get things running. You can still see the comments as I copied them from the notepad: https://github.com/Shushishtok/dota-reimagined/blob/7282a8a781496aeee4d3338750657fae93e24a14/game/scripts/vscripts/GameMode.ts#L304Of course, in a professional settings those comments are discouraged, but it's my hobby project so I didn't care about leaving those up.",

Then, develop a manual solution, as you, the person, would solve it. Note each step you take down. Be as detailed as possible. Refine the steps. Test the steps.

The code is the last, final part of programming, not the beginning. The problem analysis is the first step. Then, deriving an algorithmic step by step solution. Then testing the solution. Then, implementation in code.Also, practice, practice, practice, and practice more. That's the onyl way to improve.",

Code is infinity changeable as long as there isn’t much existing code that depends on its details.Let’s say you need to parse some data to objects and then process them. Rather than agonizing over class design and how the processing will happen, just go ahead and write the file parser. As a shitty first draft, it doesn’t even really need to return anything. It could just print the data to the console. Then you have all the details of the data right there in the code and can focus on thinking how to return it so that it’s convenient to use in the rest of the code.",

Choose a problem, something relatively easy - look for code kata examples 2. Person A writes a failing test 3. Person B, writes the implementation that makes the test pass 4. Person B, writes a failing test 4. Person A, writes the implementation that males the test pass 5. repeat until the solution is solvedYou can add as many people as you want.The thing here is that by doing it public, you are put under a certain amount of psychological pressure. I've known many good coders who placed in public suddenly choke and go cold. It's very different giving a speech to yourself in the mirror vs standing in front of a group of real people. Do this once a week. I guarantee you will get much better quickly! Not only that but you'll perform better later on when you're put on the spot in a job interview. Now, that being said - you could probably do this in a less stressful environment using AI as your person. There's probably some value in that but you won't get the stress response you really need. Best of luck!",

I'll tell you one key topic you need to master, network. Ask yourself how cyber attacks happen. Look up real cyber attacks that has happened recently, learn how an attack happens.Learning coding opens door to you to have software engineer positions, but it is not needed to be in the cyber security field.

I really recommend doing an online Java course as it is a very good first language and will likely be used in your classes. Maybe take an online web-dev course as well. Also, use AI as a learning and exposure tool (by exposure I mean getting updated on what technical skills you should be learning). Read job descriptions and see what technical skills they are looking for, then do some prep with those technologies. Lastly, stay interested and have an open-minded and positive attitude, that's probably one of the most important things.",

It listens to those local Telegram groups, extracts location and context from messages, saves it to a database, and shows the results on an interactive map. Basically, you can load the map and see where people say TCC recruiters are. Like Pokémon Go, but very... Ukrainian :grinning_face_with_sweat:It works pretty well locally — but I haven’t shared it publicly, because there’s a risk I could be accused of “obstructing military operations,” which is a very sensitive topic here.Anyway, it’s not really real-time (no WebSockets or live updates yet), more like a snapshot when the page loads. I’d love to build something more light-hearted next, something fun and safe to share with others. Maybe even silly.Thanks again for the inspiration!",

HTML + CSS, the default option for simple sites 4. JavaScript for interactivity 5. Python/PHP (or other languages) for server implementationsThe \"correct\" choice really depends on what you plan to make and what you plan to use it for.The long answer: HTML is technically not a full-fledged programming language, but more a tool to build the skeleton of the website. Basics you can mostly learn in a day/week. CSS is for everything style (fonts, colors, layouts, ...) and works as addition to HTML. For real-time interactivity, you need JavaScript. There are variations, but JS is the only language supported by basically all browser, which is why it is the go-to programming language for this.If you want your page to have the ability to save/access data, through a database or multi-user interactivity or such.. Then you generally need to have a programming language on the web server. PHP was most common for a long time, but nowadays you see a lot of people use Python instead. You can generally use any programming language you want on the server, it will effectively read data coming in from web pages, and produce web pages as output. It also deals with a file systems or databases.Unlike HTML and CSS, any programming language will take a lot of effort to master. So if you really want to build a web page that sits there and shows information, you'll be fine with HTML and CSS.Easy-Mode: HTML + CSS Medium-Mode: add JavaScript Hard-Mode: add PHP or Python (or other...) for server based interactions and databasesKind regards, Mr. Prototype and the Broken Pony Studios team (I am just an indie game developer who made his companies website :D)",

To learn anything from this you already have know a bunch of Japanese.***Tutorials*** are guides for learning a tool. They’re a narrative, a kind of story that leads a learner along a path, teaching a little about each feature they present – usually just enough about the feature to achieve the next task.Tutorials don’t assume you know anything about the tool. They’re not useful for checking fine details about a specific thing, but they’re very useful for getting to know the basics.***How-tos*** are a sort of mini-tutorial for a specific area.

Find a *tutorial*. Not all tools have good tutorials, but if you search for “ beginner tutorial” you will find one.

For frameworks, I do better once I understand their underlying model but tutorial docs are where I start, then I visit the more detailed \"how it works under the hood\" documentation.Regardless of the kind of documentation, though, try to practice with the language, libraries, and frameworks as you go through the materials. When I learned C# for work way back when, I created a scratch solution with, eventually, dozens of projects. Each one had maybe 20-100 lines of code in them that exercised different parts of the C# language, C# libraries, or third party libraries I was trying to use. Whenever I found a new corner of the language I didn't know, I'd add a new one and practice.I do the same thing for exploring other concepts in CS, programming, networking, etc. Small throwaway projects that let me verify my understanding and, if it doesn't work, identify my gaps.",

        "body": "The MOST important thing to keep in mind is that a library/framework/tool is a **solution to a problem**.So instead of thinking about \"learning a library\", your primary focus should be understanding the problem.For example, suppose you wanted to implement user authentication into your system. You should start by understanding what authentication is and the various challenges and concepts that are involved.Once you have an idea what kind of things are involved, you might decide that you want to save yourself the time and effort and just use a library that someone else wrote, and turn to the documentation to figure out how to use their solution.Essentially, learning from documentation is **reverse engineering the steps that the author took** to solve the problem. You identify the various components that you need, and then while you're going through the class list or API or whatever, you create a mind-map of all the classes/methods and what purpose they serve.If you're lucky, the documentation will provide some tutorials to demonstrate how to use the library so that at least you have something working.Ultimately, you should have some general understanding of what problem you're trying to solve, before jumping into a library.",

The main reason for this is I can get caught up in wanting to make sure I'm doing something the optimal way, considering all options, looking at upstream and downstream dependencies to see how my work affects them, etc. This means I'm slower than someone who just crushes through the ticket, doing only what was asked. But doing this in my early career has allowed me to learn so much more, and develop more intuition for these kind of things. Now I can think of broad problems that touch many systems and much more easily consider the broad impact of changes in one system. This sets me up nicely to do high level design spanning many systems, makes me helpful in XFN collaboration with other teams, and helps me a lot with debugging/incident response. So I'm slower to code but I'm building the skills to become a senior+ engineer. Whereas in most companies just being fast and good at coding takes you to mid level tops.None of this matters if your company doesn't realize the value in that though.",

Research array vs set and learn when to use a set instead of an array for certain situations). So don't just code the solution because you won't learn anything meaningful by doing that.",

Python or NodeJS, or some other language. That basically opens a port and accepts HTTP connections. The usual data transfer format is JSON. Your API is basically the gateway and processing in front of the database. You send requests in some format, say the expressions the user enters, and the API takes your requests and writes them to the database.When your page loads, or some user-initated mechanism like a button, your web app will make a request to load the history from the database.Then you will need some function to manage the history, i.e. delete it.This of course is quite involved at your stage. A good thing about programming is that you can build simulations of what you need. Make an interface (a set of functions) for managing history in your web app. Then implement it as modifying some array in memory. Save it to localStorage if you want.Then later, when you are ready to jump into server-side programming, you can replace the functions with ones that call to your API instead.",

Your frontend can then make requests to the `/api/recent` URL using the browser's Fetch API (or any number of wrapper libraries around it).Writing an HTTP server in nothing but Node is doable but you have to deal with a bunch of low-level details yourself (e.g. URL parsing and routing).

Essentially, you’ll want to have MongoDB as your data layer, Node as your application layer, and your UI as the presentation layer. You can use a library like Express to easily build your Node app to store and retrieve data from your DB (using what’s called an Application Programming Interface, or API).

If you have one, great - focus your time and energy on polishing that and do the other things post-launch. Remember, you do not need a perfect app out of the gate, you just need one killer feature - one new way of thinking. Lastly, if you focus all of your time on dev and don’t think about marketing, it won’t matter how good and polished the app is. Start right now splitting your time up between dev and marketing.",

Then the two values will be multiplied together, getting the final result of 1.0.As for your second example of 1.0 * 3 / 2 = 1.5, you follow the same logic. First you have the multiplication of 1.0 * 3. The integer value of 3 is converted to the floating value of 3.0. The multiplication occurs, giving the floating result of 3.0.

Obviously, documentation gets easier to understand the more you understand documentation. Needing to look up too many terms can make it quite difficult. But also, plenty of people write awful documentation. They've spent too much time thinking too deeply about the problem they're solving and they neglect to simplify it for the reader, and the documentation is at least as much about bragging about their accomplishments or geeking or about their model train as it is helping people. I admit I'm prone to that myself.Others abstract away too much information. It's really hard to feel like you understand something if you're understanding is full of \"trust me\" and \"just because\".If an AI can explain something so it makes sense to you, then the problem isn't you. You can make sense of it. You're capable of understanding. The AI is better at explaining than the documentation.

Maybe there is a Parser class which sounds like a good starting point, but maybe I'm supposed to use a factory method to create the appropriate parser instead of instantiating it myself.It takes a lot more effort to go and write tutorials explaining how the library is supposed to be used, and library maintainers generally are working for free and having to write the documentation likely doesn't excite them as much as building the actual library.This is why there is an entire market for content creators whose sole job is to take other people's libraries and make youtube videos on how to use it.

        "body": "\"Documentation\" is a pretty general term and typically falls into a number of sub-categories with different use cases:* API documentation: what classes/methods/functions exist, what arguments they take and what they return. This is useful a reference for people who *already know* how to use the library in question and need a reminder. Also a nice way, once you know how to use the library generally, to fully explore all the things it can do. e.g. what methods exist on \\`class Router\\`* Guides: Explore a single topic in *depth* \"How to route incoming requests in Framework X\". Good for seeing how classes/methods/functions can be used to solve real world problems in a single focused domain. E.g. [https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html)* Tutorials: Explore a set of related topics in a library (perhaps in combination with other libraries that commonly go together) in *breadth* to accomplish some real world task. This is what most blog articles and video how-tos are going to be. E.g. [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjItgYqIzJ9WGy9WMf-44DXHB\\_7aWwJMc](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjItgYqIzJ9WGy9WMf-44DXHB_7aWwJMc)* Books: Explore a set of related topics in a library (perhaps in combination with other libraries that commonly go together) in *breadth and depth* to accomplish some real world tasks. [https://pragprog.com/titles/rails7/agile-web-development-with-rails-7/](https://pragprog.com/titles/rails7/agile-web-development-with-rails-7/) Knowing which type of documentation best matches your current question and skill level is important!As tempting as it is to accelerate towards a single answer using AI for a work task, I would encourage any beginner in a topic to avoid doing this. Learning, and indeed authoring, code is considerably more than answering a question or completing a task. As you read API docs for one method, you stumble upon another that might better solve your problem. When researching \"how do I route with an optional parameter\" you also learn a bit about how the library processes routes in order; a month later a \"weird routing bug\" has an obvious and simple solution to you (\"this route just needs to be higher precedence\").To write new code you need to read existing code, sometimes code right where you're working, sometimes code many hops away in a callstack. The more you read, the more you slowly build up valuable context about the code in totality, the better your future code comes.The acceptance criteria for AI tools in their current form is the same as an incredibly eager intern or early career professional: \"Well, *it works\".* A large application that is an accumulation of tasks completed to a \"well, it works\" level becomes increasingly difficult to understand and change. This can happen *incredibly* quickly.",

Normally you would learn faster and efficiently what you actually like.To learn, a lot of it is deliberate thinking through of processes, and a lot of internalization of concepts comes through prolonged exposure.When you say you have 'forgotten a lot', what do you mean? There is always a constant set of concepts that underlies a lot of programming paradigms. Have a good grasp over those. Other things are a matter of comfort, and you can always re-learn and remember once you start working back in a language, framework etc.To specifically answer you:1. It is definitely okay to go with web dev and frontend path now. 2. Use LLM as a resource to learn. Write code to do simple things and make projects. And show that code to LLMs to ask for improvements and suggest conceptual lackings that are present in that code. 3. Titles are unimportant imo. Learn as much, and be ready to learn when you have a job. What matter is the ability to learn. 4. If your parents are asking for you to get a job, prioritize good learning environment. Ideally with senior devs. Good mentorship is totally another level of learning. I assume you are still early in your career. 3. Don't be too hard on yourself. Everything takes time. You seems to have a sense of urgency. It can be useful, but remember long term you want to grow as a more complete dev.",

I would still need to check documentation for tailwind, and css grids to get things properly, but the point was I knew what the approach would be.\\---One thing I will say. Your first project that you completely do on your own will be long and hard. But keep in mind that this difficulty and frustration is the actualy a sign and a process of becoming better.Tutorials are there to give you a direction. To get out of the tutorial hell - give this strategy a shot: 1. Stop watching tutorial (specially if you feel you have reached a saturation point in terms of 'knowledge of doing things') 2. Start making things on by yourself. 3. You will get stuck in basic things like tsconfigs, vite, setting up, integrating tailwind. This is fine. 4. When you do solve them, be mindful how you solved them, and take notes as to why it worked now and not before.It will be a bit slow, but a project driven learning is something I personally like.",

Just find a good balance between them, it is still good to study so that you know how things work under the hood, especially subjects like Data Structs and Algs, Discrete Maths, etc, because the concepts taught in these subjects will act as supplement for your programming knowledge.",

Then I could just go implement one little thing at a time and make sure it works as expected, and see if other little surprises crop up.But I can only do this because I spent so much time at one point just making trivial client and server, or just making a trivial web UI that does nothing, or just really basic data structure stuff, etc.You also need to have a reasonable environment where you can run your code very often comfortably, and be ready to print things or use a debugger to inspect what's going on.

Reading and understanding, and writing are two completely different skills. Just because you can do the former does not mean you can do the latter.You can only learn to write code through writing code. Through solving problems.You should not focus on the code, on the implementation in a programming language - that's the final part.Focus on analyzing, dissecting, and solving the problem at hand first - on paper, with pencil, your way, as you, the person would solve it.Once you have a detailed working step by step solution, start thinking about implementing it in code.And practice, practice, practice, practice more.",

You can do just about anything with a web app, but there are a few things like full screen and playing sounds that require the user to accept a permission first.Or you could build a desktop app like a Windows or Mac app.If you have a strong preference on what type of app you want it to be, that will help us give you advice on what language to learn first.If you have no preference at all, my advice would be to learn Python, then learn to use pygame. That'd be one of the easiest ways to build it. You could start here: [https://programming-25.mooc.fi/part-1](https://programming-25.mooc.fi/part-1) \\- then in a few weeks when you're comfortable with basics, follow a pygame tutorial.Either way, I think a reasonable expectation might be that if you start to learn programming today, it might be a month or two of learning before you'd be ready to try building something like this. Maybe more or less. It's not something you could start on day one, but it wouldn't take years.",

Personally I prefer learning from videos, and think Pluralsight is better in this regard. However, if I want to learn something in depth, I think specific courses on Udemy are better, especially those courses which are updated often. Books are set in stone, so what you're learning may not always be the most up to date. However, if you learn well from books, O'Reilly has a massive collection. You can't download as a PDF/epub from the site, but you can download the books to read within the O'Reilly app on Android and iOS. There are supposedly some chrome extensions and tools which allow you to download the books as PDFs to bypass the rights restrictions, but to be honest if you're going to do that anyway, you might just consider downloading the books from illegitimate sources, as pretty much all the books are available from the usual pirated ebook places. That's a moral decision on your part - subscribing to O'Reilly means at least the authors are getting, I assume, a cut of the subscription fee if the books are accessed.",

Especially nowadays where the cost of degrees are astronomical compared to what I paid (I graduated in 2010 and paid off my degree through work contributions alone in 2018). As a PHP developer you will have some income and also proven time spent actually doing development. As you get further and further into your career the fact you have a degree becomes less and less important. The only thing I would say that you would benefit from perpetually from a degree is learning the fundamentals as in my experience self taught engineers often skip a lot of these and struggle at certain points in their career when these fundamentals become more important (switching languages, architecture etc). Id also say that in my experience a lot of people doing ML / Machine learning that I encountered in the wild aren't actually people with Computer Science degrees they tend to be mathematicians. Two very different disciplines despite what people say (I'm awful at maths as I'm dyscalculic but really good at software development as it's more akin to algebra).",

Having different names of columns on one table vs another that it references by fkey isn't that weird if that's what you mean for the sub_id/original_sub_id thing.That said, I don't know any more about the company than what you've said here, so there could be a reason for how things are, and if it does have to be changed, it's probably going to be a lot more time consuming than you might hope. It's not the end of the world to have some tech debt jank, especially for a startup. I'd ask why things are how they are before even considering how to fix it.

But due to three naming conventions I have to go through each and every one of them just to figure out what is the name here. To further add headache the relationship are many to many. I am not even sure if this helps but there are many columns that come from API but even there the naming conventions are different. Here's an example country_id is the column name in table1 and I need table2 to join at country_id because that's where the weather report comes from but the column is called weather_ids_country I thought this was a mistake so I asked the team they are like no this is correct. It means the same thing. I am like fine. Now everything is in integer so I need the values which comes from API on that it is called currency_code_id it means the same thing.

And also, you're not the author, so you don't need to feel that their explanations and lessons all make sense to you. There is no standard for how fast the books will teach what it talks about, so you'll likely discover much later if you're taking anything out of a book.So just having read is a great gain, trying to maximize the benefits will make you read slower, read less or feel pressured to be 'better' at getting your money and time's worth from books during reading or immediately after.

Even when using Go or Rust, you have to deal with complexity as the codebase grows, and eventually, you have to design an architecture that scales.I think learning Go or Rust and trying to make a web app is a good experience and gives you insight into why Spring needs to be such a complex piece of software.",

Not advanced stuff.\\~15 minutes of role-related knowledge questions. Again, the goal is to see if their resume is correct.

The extra time was to allow the candidate to take time to disuss the problem, maybe have a false start or two, and still have plenty of time to get to a working solution.My general advice: Try to relax. Try to think out loud if you can - the interviewer is probably trying desperately to figure out how you think about problems and whether you consider alternative solutions and tradeoffs between different ways of answering questions or solving problems.",

A software engineering role at say a car manufacturer might need to know a bunch of math, electrical and mechanical stuff while the same role at a online clothing store might need none of that.Programming is *sorta* similar to healthcare in the way that concepts build upon each other. For example, to fully grasp diabetes knowing what insulin actually does first helps a lot, but it’s not a hard requirement to understand the disease. Similarly för programming, learning the basics like stacks, pointers, arrays etc. will make further concepts so much easier to understand, but it’s not required.If you’re interested in AI you’d need at least a bachelors, and probobly a masters as well. AI works on a lot of linear algebra and multi-variable calculus. You basically have an input, break it down into a bunch of smaller components represented by numbers. You then feed these numbers through a magical web consisting of a 1000+ tunable dials which outputs a prediction. You need linear algebra to efficiently traverse this web, and you need the calc. to identify how *wrong* an AI and how to best adjust the 1000+ dials to make it less wrong.It’s never to late to start coding, it’s a really cool space and I hope you’ll enjoy it!Here are some videos graphically showing how AIs work:https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?si=XmQwghEwlM-x11H7",

I couldn't get the Gemini the transcribe audio sadly so that's as far as I got so far. I tried recording audio with Sox but I didn't know how how transcribe it on my laptop with the command line.However I did get spchcat on my pi to work.

        "body": "Okay, so you want to make a Roblox game that's similar to other Roblox games. That's a reasonable goal. And you've got a pretty good list of the sorts of things you'll need some knowledge on: modeling, rigging, coding, level design, art, plus a couple more things you left out, like music and sound.So, first, be aware that this is ambibitous. You probably won't finish the project unless you devote ungodly hours to it over the next, say, year or so. Second, be aware that, if you do succeed, by all likelihood it will not be successful. Most Roblox games are never discovered, and if you really want success, you'll need a bunch of other skills, mostly around networking and promotion. Plus maybe money to pay for advertising and to influencers.Okay, all that out of the way, here's my suggested rough path:First, try building a tiny proof of concept game without the art. You're gonna need to learn some Roblox scripting. Ignore the mods, voting, etc. Just try and get the very core of your idea to work. There are a lot of Lua and Roblox scripting tutorials out there, and you'll run into a bunch of challenges, but you can at least try out the basic idea of your game to see if you like it.Next, try making a character for your game in Blender. Start with some basic Blender tutorials. Make the donut. Everybody starts with the donut. Then start following along with some basic modeling tutorials. Find one specific to Roblox, if you can, exporting to Roblox is its own thing. This is a totally different skill to learn about, and it'll also take time.Now you've got one character and one basic version of your gameplay. If you made it this far, good job! That's way further than most kids get with their idea. I'm legit proud of you. You have the basics of your game more or less working! Now comes the hard part: the rest of it! Add the menu. Add the UI. Add the voting. Add more characters. Just keep going, one little piece at a time. Remember to save your work somewhere, probably several somewheres!",

First of all, make yourself familiar with lua foundamentals: [https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html#P2](https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html#P2)Take tour time, study concept by concept. Each time you learn a new thing, sit down and ponder how can you utilise given programming technique, and write your own test script to reinforce that idea.Once you get fundamentals, ask yourself how can you model those systems using Lua constructs, specifically:- what data I need to store?- how will I store that data?- What operations should I be able to do on that data?For example, here is how I would approach designing a round system: What data I need to store?\\- I am pretty certain, we want to store a round number for sure, but we also need to track when the round ends. How can I store this data?I would need two variables to store this data: one for round number, and one for round end time stamp What operations I would need?I definitely want to be able to start a new round with given round number, and with given duration. I also want to have operation to check if round has ended. Example code ( I don't know LUA, so example here is in python): import time class Round: def __init__(self): self.round = 0 self.timestamp = 0 def start_rund(self, round, duration): self.round = round self.timestamp = time.time() + duration def has_ended(self): return time.time() > self.timestamp if __name__ == '__main__': round = Round() round_nr = 1 while True: round.start_round(round_nr, 300) round_nr = round_nr + 1 while not round.has_ended(): # do something here # do something when the current ends",

I've done CS50, MIT's entire CS undergrad curriculum via MITOCW (or at least the 90%+ of the curriculum that is on OCW), and completed the Odin Project, but nobody really gives a shit because I don't have a degree to back it up. If I could do it over again, I would just go do a masters at somewhere like Georgia Tech, be done in 2 years, and who knows, maybe be working in the industry by now.Yes you can do projects and that will help some, and you should absolutely do that whether you go for the degree or not. But having a masters from a reputable university will help you get your foot in the door, clear hiring screens, etc. There are also plenty of affordable programs from highly-regarded public universities for you to choose from, so cost shouldn't be that big of a deterrent. The one caveat is that you do already have a STEM bachelors (which I don't have), so *maybe* you could pull it off if you leverage that plus some quality self-studying. But in this job market, I still think a masters is going to be your best bet.",

Don’t wait until you’re finished to start working on projects. There will always be more to learn, so if you wait, you’ll wait forever. As often as you can, try to push yourself to find projects you can do using mostly things you know already. The CS50 course has a lot of good project ideas already I think but also don’t be afraid to come up with your own ideas.

Breakpoints, step over and step into are nice, because you can see what is happening step by step.In web development, it can be server-side code mixed in client side, where it requires the ' instead of \" or sometimes miss spelling of html methods or even simple things like missing semicolon or the compiler removing shit with IntelliSense etc.I would even say unit testing could help fix bugs or find errors within logic of the code. This is awesome in figuring out edge cases or if QA reports an issue can you replicate it with a test environment. Then you can create code coverage for the future. I like this approach, because you can define a wide range of test for fun and see what fails and what passed and try to debug the logic or even step through specific cases.",

        "body": "When it comes to debugging, while simple methods like console.log, print statements, or dump and die are useful for inspecting values and responses, effective debugging requires a more structured approach.My general advice is to start by isolating the issue and confirming each part of the workflow independently. For example, in web development, if I'm passing a value from the backend to the frontend, I would first hardcode an expected value directly into the frontend to verify that the interface and frontend logic behave as expected. This helps determine whether the issue lies in the frontend or further back in the stack.Once the frontend behaves correctly with the hardcoded value, I would then pass the same value from the controller to confirm that the data flow through the backend to the frontend is working as intended. If this succeeds, I proceed to review the logic within the controller itself. Essentially, the idea is to work backwards from a known, working state toward the suspected issue.For game development, I take a similar approach. If, for example, I encounter a bug in a movement script, I would isolate that script by moving it to a new, minimal scene with a single object. Once it works correctly in isolation, I would then reintroduce the object to the original scene and observe whether the issue persists. This process of isolating and testing components individually allows you to narrow down the source of a bug systematically.In both cases, the principle remains the same: isolate, confirm working states, and incrementally trace the problem back to its origin.One last trick is the rubber duck, honestly works :flexed_biceps: explain what your trying to achieve to a rubber duck or colleague in the explanation, you will realize where you went wrong.Good luck, troubleshooting and debugging can be super fun when you get some wins :flexed_biceps::thumbs_up:",

Read the Error Message Error messages are your first clue. They often point to the line number and type of error (e.g., “TypeError: undefined is not a function” in JavaScript). It might sound cliche, but most people really get stuck on a problem just because they didn't read the error message properly. And you will want to read error messages when you first 'befriend bugs'.2. Break your Code Intentionally Test small pieces of code to isolate the issue. Comment out parts to narrow down the problem.Remember that debugging is a skill. And the more bugs you deal with, the better you become at it. Solve it yourself first, and if you get really stuck on a problem, don't hesitate to ask others online. Pretty sure a lot of people can help you.",

You can then look at the values of your variables while stepping through your code.If you're IDE doesn't allow for breakpoints then you can try adding print statements in your code in order to gather more information. This also works if you are testing in an environment that doesn't allow you to use breakpoints.Lastly you can try commenting out parts of your code.

The big wheels you should only re-invent if it's truly the project's area of innovation. The medium wheels are a bit more case-by-case but generally you shouldn't re-invent these wheels, either, without a good reason. But if for example, the medium wheel needs to be integrated in a novel way or or in a way that has to be coupled for performance reasons or other unusual considerations then it can make sense to re-invent even medium wheels. Just depends.Re: your JavaFX program, if it gives the results you want, you're fine. I don't know anything about JavaFX but If the UI isn't snappy you might want an event bus more for its asynchronicity than its decoupling purposes. I find an event bus annoying if not needed because things can feel like 1x1 squares and it can start to be hard to debug really complicated situations. I'd prefer a typical pub/sub approach if just trying to break the bi-directional dependency between the sub controllers and the top-level controller simply because it's easier to reason about and trace through the code than an event bus integration. But it totally depends on the scenario and the tradeoffs.",

Many error arise from forgetting about dependencies: you change something *here* and something else *on the other hand “side” of the code* breaks. Experienced programmers often still believe that they know all the dependencies in the code base, or can easily get them from the code. I call this hubris. The code base *is* complex, many people are working on it and *changing* it. For a school project your sharp, young mind can actually remember it all.",

There's also a lot of value in understanding the code inside and out, even if it's not as streamlined / professional as it could be. This is 10x as true when you're learning!My guideline is to lean heavily towards \"roll your own\" on *anything* that is \"core\" to your project. Whatever the value add of your project is, **don't** outsource that to someone or something else, because that can leave you really vulnerable. It sounds like you're applying this principle well already. :thumbs_up:Also as a note... It's really unlikely that existing software is as fast as possible *for your specific use case,* because off-the-shelf software by it's very nature needs to be built more robustly to handle *multiple* potential use cases. If you could peak \"under the hood\" of the Google event service... You would likely find lots and lots of code and checks *your project doesn't need,* because it's written to be broadly applicable to multiple different kinds of clients. Which is all to say... I'm skeptical that it's actually faster, and if it is it's because you don't yet know how to write an optimized event service... Which is a *really good reason* to get experience writing event services. :upside-down_face:I definitely would use JavaFX or Swing, or w/e else for the \"skin\" of the UI, and not feel bad about it because it doesn't really impact the core of the project. If JavaFX suddenly (for some reason) became totally unavailable for you to use, you *could* totally re-write the GUI of the project to use Swing instead, and it would suck, but it would be doable. The *core* of the project would stay intact, and it would be just as valid and useful regardless of what the UI looks like.Where it's really tough, is when you're under a lot of time / financial / social pressure to release a finished project fast, and although you would *rather* roll your own for certain parts of the project... You're pushed towards using off-the-shelf solutions. I think in that case, all I can say is 1.) be careful about identifying which things are closer to the core of your project, and 2.) be reasonable and honest about the tradeoffs you're making.",

You could certainly still use PHP and MySQL for the backend, but at this point they're a bit outdated. I'd say PostgreSQL is the default database of choice these days, but since it's still SQL it might not even feel different to you.So that leaves the question of the server/backend technology, and I'd say it depends a lot on what exact application you're building:- If you'd get any benefits from having the backend in the same language as your frontend (JS/TS), and if your app is simple enough, you could just use Node or Bun or Deno to run JS server-side too. (Disclaimer: I am of the personal opinion that JavaScript is awful and should only be used for client-side code since it's built into every modern web browser, but I think I'm in the minority with that opinion)- If you're doing something science-y or AI-powered, python might be a good fit.- Lots of people like Java/Kotlin because of the stronger safeguards you get from compilation.- Golang (AKA \"Go\") also seems to be a popular compiled choice, but I personally dislike it for a variety of reasons.Regardless of your chosen programming languages and frameworks, you'll probably want to learn some of these other tools:- Git and GitHub- GitHub Actions- Cloud providers (e.g. AWS, GCP, SupaBase) and what they provide (e.g. S3/GCS, SQS/PubSub, secret managers etc.)Extra credit:- Docker- Kubernetes- Infrastructure-as-code (e.g. OpenTofu, Terraform)",

I wouldn’t actively discourage someone from going into them, but it’s worth noting.I would also take note of the other commenter, who pointed out the possibility of entering these fields without a degree. Anecdotally, it is totally possible to enter IT, particularly Help Desk roles, without a degree. You are at a severe disadvantage however, and given the current market, it’s unlikely you’d be a competitive applicant in the slightest for any positions.",

I definitely would have benefited from a formal CS education.However you may want to consider a few things.Programming is so incredibly saturated. We have people coming from all points on the globe and they get hired even when they don't speak English.Programming by itself will get you doing repetitive grunt work. If you're like me, you envision yourself breathing life into creative projects. This is not what the majority of consumers use their hardware for. Banks will have you programming in nothing but PySpark. You'll be doing PySpark for years. Is it stable? Yes. Is it boring and repetitive? Absolutely.If you are able to pair your ability to program with another discipline/skill then you can have valuable insights that others without your knowledge won't have.Don't shy away from personal projects.

In other words, if you represent their interactions as sets (of IDs), you want the intersection of those sets.I don't know of any fancy general-purpose algorithm that can do this better than the simple, brute-force approach of just computing the intersection on the fly. Precomputing the intersections is not a good idea because if you have N users, there are O(N^(2)) possible pairs, and most of those pairs will never be queried.Beyond that, you just have to estimate/benchmark the performance and optimize for your particular situation. Here's a very hand-wavy and totally hypothetical estimate:* Let's say that for future-proofing, each \"interaction\" (the ID of a post or whatever) can be represented as a 64-bit integer, occupying 8 bytes of space.* Assume that a typical user does 1000 interactions per day, and has a 10-year activity history on the site (if your site is very successful). So you can store a user's entire history in 1000 x 365 x 10 x 8 bytes, or about 30MB. Maybe this compresses down to 10MB or so.* With an SSD that has a sequential read throughput of maybe 500MB/sec, you can read 10MB in 20 milliseconds. Double that for two users.* Actually finding the intersection between two sorted lists of integers can be done easily in linear time. So the CPU is unlikely to be a bottleneck.* If one request fully utilizes the SSD for 40ms, then you can handle 25 \"common interaction\" queries per second. If you need to do more than that, you can add more read-only replicas of the same data.* Don't forget to account for the disk utilization associated with updating the user histories when new interactions happen. This depends on your requirements, e.g. do the query results need to be perfectly up to date with the latest interactions, or is it OK to perform batch updates once an hour, or once a day?* Maybe you want to find the top 10 most *recent* interactions in common. In that case, choose your 64-bit IDs so that they are (exactly or approximately) increasing in timestamp order. Then if the intersection has a million IDs in common, you don't have to fetch a million rows from the DB. You just sort the integer IDs themselves (very cheap since they're already in memory) and then only fetch the largest 10.",

It's not gonna happen everywhere, but a lot of places are trashing your resume and moving on- it's not worth their time to look in detail at every candidate who claims to be good with no degree. 4 years of self study with projects is not more valuable than 4 years of formal study with projects, which is what a degree indicates you have. The only real exception is if the projects are _really_ exceptional, like if you literally invented python or something else wildly popular, and you probably don't have anything to worry about in the first place if you did do that.Also, projects are mostly for you to talk about in the actual interview, they're not really for the recruiter who probably doesn't know that much about tech.

As of 2019, approximately 90% of Chinese international students return to China after completing their degree. The idea that the U.S. has been benefiting from a brain drain is no longer valid. The reality is that University admins love international students because they typically come from wealthy families, require less financial assistance and pay much more tuition. America’s top universities are sitting on fabulously large endowments and are fully capable of subsidizing the education of U.S. students in need. However, their highly paid administrators seem intent upon transforming these institutions into tax-sheltered political think-tanks rather than educating America’s best and brightest. Why should U.S. universities educate Chinese citizens in bleeding edge industries? Imo, we should be putting resources into US citizens.",

FAANG engineers have also created the illusion that earning $150K+ is the expected salary level when in reality it's probably closer to $80-90K for most people. Outside of FAANG and Fintech, SWEs at \"normal companies\" honestly don't earn that much more than other white collar workers especially in this current job market.I also feel like the bar for entry has been raised a lot over the past few years. Companies that once only did behavioral interviews now do OA and LC type questions over multiple rounds to emulate big tech. It has also reached a point where there is no room for error during interviews, anything short of solving the problem using the optimal solution basically means a rejection.",

A few months at a company isn't worth anything, and can only look bad or neutral. More often it's the latter, but in your case it was unfortunately the former.Being unemployed also doesn't look great, obviously, but in this market it's easier to explain away as there's a lot of unemployed people currently, which makes it a more typical conversation to be having.I don't think you need to remove your current company from your resume, but you should not state salary as a reason for leaving. Say it's a culture fit problem, or the team process doesn't work for you, or something else that you couldn't have known when you signed the offer. You knew the salary going in, and you don't like it. That's a red flag for an early stage startup where retention is important. You look like a job hopper who leaves when a new shiny toy shows up.You used to work at FAANG, so they're already worried they can't keep up with your salary needs.

Exactly that. You're fielding calls for new jobs, when you've *just* started a job a few months ago. While the recruiter might've thought that was fine, the hiring manager obviously did not. Usually when you start a new job, you at least give it a fair shot. I'm not taking recruiter calls, or looking at job boards, when I've just started a new job.I take longer to decide if I actually like a new shirt I bought or not than you've given your current job.>What’s the alternative? Don’t mention I just started a new role and what, claim I’m still at my old company? Or claim that I’m unemployed?Sure, you can do that. If you ever find yourself in a position where you're job searching when you've only been at your current company for a couple months... leaving that off your resume and never mentioning it would save you a lot of trouble. Don't lie about being at your old company, otherwise the dates on the background check won't line up, but you can totally say you left your other company because it wasn't a good fit and have been job searching since.

And why empathy is so important. There's a total lack of historical knowledge, critical thinking, and an absurd level of naivety.",

I jumped into the market in the booming years following and have been very fortunate to be able to enjoy an IT worker’s market for many years where so many companies were desperate for good employees. Right now, it’s just not an employee’s market. The big tech companies and all the other smaller companies that look up to them are bracing for economic slowdown. They’re laying off hundreds of thousands of workers - flooding the labor market and increasing competition for the companies that are hiring. People don’t quit bad jobs - they quit bad bosses. Try to keep your head up and not take all of this too personally. No manager or person will ever be perfect, but I promise you will have much better experiences moving forward than you have had so far. It’s very hard to grow under an unsupportive manager, but it’s incredible what a supportive one can do for you when they learn and value your strengths.",

Honestly leetcode is only maybe 20% of the prep I do when I decide to job hop. Most of my time goes towards behavioral prep and STAR scenarios, but a decent chunk of time goes towards very general technical prep. Language-specific terms/concepts, differences between versions if it's relevant (Java 6 vs Java 8 for example), re-reviewing data structures, SOLID, the 4 fundamental OOP concepts, design patterns, etc.Basically a review of all the fundamentals that are things we don't consciously think of during our day to day, but we're doing subconsciously. The exact kinda stuff pop-quiz style interviews tend to poke at.For example, if I asked you what the L stands for in SOLID, and explain it, could you do that right now? I know I couldn't. But when I'm looking for a job, you bet your ass I could rattle off any of those letters from memory and explain them. I *have* absolutely been asked about SOLID/OOP before. I remember one interviewer off-handedly asked me \"What's your favorite design pattern?\". I'm not a theory guy really, so I'm not really thinking about the textbook names and definitions of design patterns day to day.... but I had prepped on design patterns, so I was able to give a great answer that cultivated a good discussion. My answer wasn't \"Builder... because it's the only one I remember\". I got that job.There's a lot of stuff in between a pure leetcode interview and a 2 hour pop-quiz session, most interviews may settle at a natural blend of the 2 types of questions. But you should absolutely still expect to be asked questions about the basics and fundamentals. Even an hour of prep should make those kinds of questions trivial for you to answer.",

You have been doing PHP for 13 years and they ask such random PHP question that you couldn’t answer. That basically means that either you have just been fucking around with PHP for the past 13 years as a fraud, which I don’t believe, or the questions are just so arcane that you most likely wouldn’t have been able to answer even with preparation anyways.Also the recruiter has been completely misleading too, let’s not forget that part. You were told to prepare for sys design and some knowledge on redis/java, which had nothing on PHP. You were set up to fail from this perspective too.The company also clearly didn’t know what to do for interviews. Pop quiz on random knowledge is stupid and insane. They would have been better to give you a take home even.I just think calling yourself a failure after what clearly is failure on their part is unwarranted.

Turned out they just wanted me to say like \"decorate the methods with @GET\". It never crossed my mind that the answer they were looking for was so basic.Anyway real question for OP: In your 10 years doing PHP professionally did you ever encounter a real world problem where the solution was anything like a leetcode problem/solution?",

Yeah, lots of \"influencers\" seem to think programmers are out of a job within a year or two but realistically that's going to be more like a few decades. And jobs will shift around; not go away completely.I'm a senior SWE and I don't really use that much AI or LLMs. I use it like a tool: GitHub Copilot does a pretty good job of being an auto-complete on steroids. And other LLMs are great at helping me construct a complex SQL query. But I use them like tools to complete the task I need to complete. I don't really use them ever for system design or architectural decisions.My recommendation is to stay the course and get your degree!",

        "body": ">I'll do junior stuff and take low end salariesAnd companies won't believe you.One of the most important parts of recruiting is retention. If a company doesn't think they can retain you, they're not going to hire you.Lots of things can make a company think they can't retain you. For example, if you blurt out your salary expectation are $200k, but the company is only able to offer $80k, they're not going to even bother extending the offer. Even if you say \"Oh, actually, I'm totally willing to accept $80k!\", they're not going to bother. You already showed your hand. They know you want $200k, and they know even though you'll accept their offer of $80k, because $200k was your expectation you're going to continue job searching and leave them the moment you get an offer that's more aligned with your expectations.Another example, if you've gotten a PhD and are highly specialized in a niche area of the industry, and the company you're talking to is just hiring for a basic CRUD role... they know you'll be impossible to retain. You got a PhD, you're highly specialized. Even if you say to the company \"I'll be totally happy in your role\", they know it's BS. They know you'll be out the door the second you get an offer that's relevant to your PhD.That same idea applies to you. You have 10 YOE. You can claim you'll be happy with junior roles, and low end salaries, but companies know that's total BS and you'll quit the moment you get a Senior role with a Senior salary lined up. Even if it's the truth, from the company's perspective, they're not going to believe it for a second, and you'll fall into the \"impossible to retain\" category. No company will hire someone they don't think they can retain.All of that said, you can absolutely be a 10+ YOE dev and be part of the team, and code regularly. Most of us do. A Senior SWE is still an IC. A Staff SWE, and a Principal SWE, are still IC's. They still code every day, they're still an active contributing member of the engineering team, their responsibilities just get zoomed out a bit. Instead of looking at things at the single-Jira-ticket level, they might be thinking at the epic-level, or the quarterly-deliverables-level, or the company-wide-architecture-level. You're still extremely technical, you're not a manager. Plenty of people stay an IC their entire career, and you can too.But your problem is you're trying to stay on the IC-route, but aren't actually evolving beyond a junior/mid-level in terms of skills/contribution. So that makes you a very, very, very expensive developer that doesn't deliver on their price tag. And because of the aforementioned issue, companies aren't just going to continue paying you junior level salaries when you're carrying with you 10+ YOE.You need to dive into the deep end, and apply for Senior+ level roles. If you can convince a company you're ready for that role, even if you don't feel like you are, that's how you'll set yourself up for the next 20 years of your career. If you don't do that, you'll find yourself struggling a lot, and you'll claim \"age-ism\", but it's very much about your career path, not about your age.",

What it won't teach you is how to deal with stakeholders, find which of 90 microservices you need to connect to fetch a certain piece of data, office politics, prioritization and putting together a minimum viable product, dealing with ambiguous and poorly thought out requests from users, and a ton of other things that are actually useful in a real world software engineer job.

I actually believe the 30% of code written by AI because it is genuinely a super useful tool writing unit tests, boiler plate code, some specific LINQ or SQL query, etc. I don't think that statement is the equivalent of 30% of engineers are purely using AI to write their code while 70% are not. Even the smartest engineers I know use AI to help them write code. For the future, I think every developer is going to need to have a solid understanding of AI.

The other is that at some of these levels, you do have to build bespoke tooling.Of course, it's also the case that when you usually only have \"a bunch of Linux machines, an SSH session, and some certs\" (as the joke in the interview went, I think), you spend less time on keeping up with general tooling that you can't use anyway.>I'm curious why he's calling this out when pointing out a need for availability, given that CRDB's [FAQ](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/frequently-asked-questions#how-is-cockroachdb-both-highly-available-and-strongly-consistent) points out that they're explicitly strongly consistent. I don't think the post is quite summarizing right here. I don't recall if CRDB actually came up? There's very real operational and latency costs with strong consistency though, and for a problem of this kind strong consistency is probably going to burn you - hot keys are a real problem. >As an aside, eventual consistency is such a weak guarantee lolOh?",

But what makes you think anything would be different if you pivot to an entirely different career path? You're not going to be safe from getting fired or laid off if you jump into something like sales. You're not going to get any better growth opportunities than you do here.I read your other comment where you described what led to the issues with your past 2 jobs... what immediately jumps out at me is you're working at startups, or at least small enough companies where you're interacting directly with the founder, and the CTO. Startup environments like that are chaotic, and can be very exhausting, and aren't good fits for *most* people. I think you might be burnt out on startup culture, not the industry itself.Instead of abandoning your career entirely, have you considered looking for a more traditional job at a large company? Where you could work on a normal team, doing normal things, with normal expectations, where you aren't in a fast-paced high expectation environment where the founder or CTO aren't talking to you directly and are many, many layers removed from you and the work you do? Working a job like that will be like night and day from a startup.If you're truly no longer interested in the work, then by all means pivot. I'm just worried that you're thinking a pivot is going to be a magic cure that fixes all your problems. The grass is always greener and all that. I think changing the type of company you work for would be a much smaller and easier to achieve change that could be refreshing for you. You don't need to immediately jump to the nuclear option when there's still smaller changes you can make that could make a major difference.",

It argued you want your finances in check and after that, be in a stable work situation. Part of your problem is that your current work situation sucks, so you feel pressure to find something better. You might not properly vet your next position, then you get caught in a vicious cycle. I'm in a somewhat similar situation. I was trying to get out of a job before I expected layoffs were coming, so I've accepted some less-than-ideal positions, and I've found myself with constant anxiety about needing to find something better. Perhaps you can find some small ways to get your sanity back. Yes, you'd like a new job, but maybe it's OK to just say you're not going to study for a month or two, and use that free time for something else. Do something relaxing, get some exercise, just something to hopefully help with healing. Then, when you start looking for another job, be mindful of vetting them. While you want a new job, you want to make sure you find something that aligns with what you want (work-life balance being a priority). Another option is to reach out to people you trust and see if their current companies are hiring. This depends on your network, though. If it helps at all, realize there are other people in similar situations. So, it's not an issue with you.",

It was written by a lot of people who have vested interest in AI hype staying as high as possible. This paper just happens to come out when we are seeing chatgpt fail to release 5.0 and revising what it's supposed to accomplish down harder than the old 5g definitions. It is becoming more apparent that AI is being used as a marketing tactic to do layoffs and still raise stock prices. AI hype is almost single handedly floating the stock market. The AI 2027 paper was also spread ad nauseam by other people who have even More vested interest in the hype train staying rolling than the authors themselves. Not that I really care what Bill Gates says in a press release. It's not like he is transparently sharing insight or anything, it is also PR and marketing.I'm sure I'll catch plenty of downvotes over it, but you asked where we saw this going ourselves. Personally, I'm of the mind that AI is already showing fundamental issues that more compute won't solve, and there will be a breaking point that VC money stops fueling AI research companies. The public gets compute time on a supercomputer for a Google search summary now. That is not a reasonable business plan, they make no money doing that for you. Why do it? Stock. Google can't be the only giant left behind. Once investment money isn't forcing the business plan to work it'd probably enshitify. Think about how good and revolutionary Uber/DoorDash/AirBnB were when they first came out, and how those disruptor business evolved over time into nickel and dime hell holes. For all of those, we went from the old inconvenient model that had full time employees, to now the gig economy with no benefits and lower wages. We disrupted those markets so good. I'm well aware that I would be considered an AI pessimist, but it boggles my mind at how uncritically everyone is accepting a home brew board game research paper saying we hit singularity in 18 months. It feels like there is no space for caution or reasoning now that every tech illiterate middle manager thinks it's a freaking panacea for unlimited profit margin",

But I'm guessing that slow regulations and irrationality means this won't happen as quickly as it should.Meanwhile, nothing excites developers more than building a new tool for developers. So that's where we're seeing most of the hype and movement right now. It's not really what the market needs but since we can't trust AI for much else, code generation becomes the focus. It doesn't hurt that good developers are expensive and there is potentially trillions in value if they can figure out a fully capable AI developer.",

It's possible if you had gotten past the recruiter, it wouldn't have been an issue with devs you interviewed with. Every company will be different. To be perfectly honest, most of the companies I've interviewed at cared about explicit language experience. Once you're working there, they may throw you on a project where you don't have experience with the stack, but you're already being paid by that point. Someone I know who worked in the FAANG space said that language-specific experience seemed really bizarre to him. We can argue about what's fair and what makes sense, but it's ultimately the company's decision of how they want to evaluate candidates.Part of being more selective is because of the market. They can afford to be. A few years ago, the bar dropped quite a bit. There's also some argument for practical experience. Yes, you can have great fundamentals, but what about someone with great fundamentals and relevant experience? There's a strong chance that there are plenty of people who can pick things up and be successful, but they're just trying to have more of a \"sure thing.\"Here's another question. If you don't have Java on your resume, and it was a requirement, why would they even set up a call with you? It's a very flawed system.",

Both have great resume value despite what you hear online. Apple is more “prestigious”, which will impress people whose opinion doesn’t matter. The name probably has a leg up when it comes to recruiting, but the difference is small unless you work on something notable (in IS&T… you probably won’t).I got interviews at OpenAI, every other FAANG, Uber, etc etc and my Amazon experience was the focus of most discussions (mainly because it was most recent, but partly because it was more challenging work).In general, IS&T is a shitshow. Many contractors who, frankly, could not pull their weight. Apple is also frugal - despite, again, Amazon’s reputation here, Apple is pretty similar (low PTO, very few “freebies”, pays less than AMZN etc). In general though, I still think Amazon is a worse place to work. Culture sucks, too much bureaucracy, and a lot more busy work than what I had at Apple.To be completely honest, if I were in your shoes, I’d choose the place you’d rather live: Austin or Seattle. Spend time building connections, making friends, etc. Personally, I’d aim to do good work and bounce within 2 years. Your exit opportunities should be similar.",

Without a positive keeping you here, the negatives of weather and COL will become overwhelming.2. Does advancing in your career matter to you? There are more high paying but demanding software jobs available in the Seattle area than anywhere except the Bay Area. If you care about growing your career or making more money, there are more opportunities. If you care about having a chill job where everyone works less than 40 hours a week, you're probably going to find these demanding jobs miserable eventually.Hybrid in Seattle is fine if your employer has a good office and you have an easy commute to it. Those who hate working in the office the most where I work all have long, hellish driving commutes. If you can walk, bike, light rail, or bus to downtown in a small amount of time, or have a short driving commute to a suburban office park based job, it is much more manageable.",

        "body": "One very important thing to keep in mind is that the markets from 2010-2022 were not all the same. We can't just give a single description/anecdote to describe that entire period.2010 for example was the recovery period from the Great Recession. Hiring was picking up compared to 2008-2009, but it was still slow and cautious. Companies were not hiring with confidence.2021 for example was the golden era of SWE. Companies were massively over hiring, the demand for SWE drastically outpaced the supply of CS grads, and that single-handedly created an entirely new sub-market of bootcampers and self-teachers. People already in the industry were job hopping and getting insane 100% raises,.That said, in my experience, good market or bad market, thing's aren't all that different. I still do the same interview prep, there's still the same kinds of startups/companies hiring, the expectation of this industry is still that you have a CS degree, etc. The difference I notice between a normal market (2011-2018-ish) and a bad market (2023+) is that the response rate is much lower. You need more applications to get responses. When I was applying for jobs in 2016 I did 10 applications total. When I was applying for jobs in 2021, I did 11 applications total. When I was applying for jobs in 2024, I did 82 applications total. I didn't feel like there was any difference in the process itself between those markets, once I got a company to actually interview me, the process was the sameFor your second note, I think the insane over-hiring of 2021 is what ruined todays market. Not AI. We're still recovering from that overhiring. A lot of people that wouldn't have had a chance of being hired in a normal market broke into the industry in 2021, and the industry is trying to self-correct. It's a slow, and painful process.AI is a valuable tool for SWE's. Some companies are buying into the hype, and might try to reduce headcount as a result, but it's still just hype. There's always some sexy new hyped up thing in the industry that companies try to chase, and might make them increase/reduce headcount. AI is no different. A company that laid off a bunch of employees because of AI-hype might be desperate to hire a ton more employees a year from now to fix all the shit that the vibe coders did.",

I didn’t prep for interviews either, it just wasn’t a thing and I nailed it every time. “Cracking the coding interview” at most, and you were good. Things are just so different now. AI is an excuse for layoffs, not the root cause. A moderately skilled engineer still does a better job than AI tools. Often because you have to know what is actually a good solution and how to prompt your way to it. It’s easy to see it do tricks and get excited, but it’s not replacing real experience for a while. Many big businesses are messy, hesitant for countless reasons, or existing code just too complicated for it to work right now. Can’t say that will be true forever. The economy, at least in the US, depends on consumers consuming and a top fraction exploiting everyone else’s labor. Billionaires are living proof that there is no end - there is seemingly not limit so the cycle continues. Probably until enough people have nothing to lose and revolt. Have to keep the masses placated so I believe there is incentive in preventing critical mass job loss.",

They were actually in the process of interviewing web designers but since I was new to it and already worked for the company, I undercut them. I got paid $3k per location to set it up. Then $300 a month per location to host and maintain. What they saved on the upfront, they have been still paying me now 12 years later. And that is just a side gig I have, it isn’t my primary job.On top of that, when they had employees move on, they remembered they knew a guy that made websites and people brought me more clients. My point is, if you’re interested, ask around, and then give it a shot. You might find out you don’t like the work, which I found out about a ton of professions.

Spending a couple in the Midwest isn't going to ruin your 20's, or your life.What you're doing right now is what *most* people do when they start a new career. Not many people get to be picky enough that they can choose where they live in the country straight out of college.Most people move to wherever they can get a job. There's your reality check.So if you can find a job in a big city, then you're free to move. But don't do anything stupid like quitting without another job lined up, or giving your manager an ultimatum \"Relocate me or I'm out\". ***Don't*** work at a restaurant or something while applying to jobs. That choice might have long-lasting repercussions on your career, stuff that 30-year-old you would think \"Wow, I was a dumbass, if only I had just kept my job and looked on the side\".I went through all this myself, so I'm speaking from very direct experience. I also prefer living in big cities. Out of college I was considering 2 full time offers, one in a big city that was for a PM role, and the other was in the Midwest for a SWE role. I chose the SWE role, because that's the direction I wanted to take my career. The cost of that choice was now I'm living in a medium sized city in the Midwest.But I don't regret that decision for a second. I made some lifelong friends there, I did a lot of fun shit there, I found a way to have a lot of fun in a small-ish city. My early 20's were really fucking wild, despite not being in a big city. I still occassionally fly back there. Don't blame Ohio for your inability to have a good time.Then once I had around 3.5 YOE, I decided to finally make the move to a big city. The job search was extremely easy with that level of experience. I hyper-targetted only jobs in the city I wanted to move to, and had an amazing offer lined up in *one month*.I'd recommend that approach to all people early career. Get a solid 3 YOE wherever you can, and ***then*** you can start being picky about things like location, salary, type of work, etc. You need to put the work in first. Don't try to jump straight to being picky when you're a new grad that most companies don't really want to hire, let alone in a big city.",

At least for 2 years for your resume so you actually have a better chance at securing a job. Be the model employee. Go above and beyond. Build a reputation as a Subject Matter Expert or the Go-To guy on your team. That way you can spend the rest of your 20's doing what you want and not just barely scraping by washing dishes in a big city because you couldn't do the work to build your career a little bit before jumping ship and making yourself look to be the most flaky worker ever. No one is going to want to hire someone who quit their job in the first few months. You're not even worth considering to train because you've ALREADY proven you can't be trusted from the perspective of the employer. They could put all their time and energy into training you, which is VERY EXPENSIVE, by the way. (It's part of why so many are basically just looking for flawlessly perfect matches on jobs, they don't want to train you). Only for their very expensive investment to come back and whine they ain't happy. Move me to a bigger city or I QUIT to go work at some crappy minimum wage job in a big city because that's obviously better than making a good salary at a mid-size company in a \"small town\" (I kind of doubt your town is that small with the vibe you give). Would you want to hire you in that case? I know I wouldn't. I wouldn't even give your resume a second thought because 1.) there's nothing on there and 2.) you quit so fast you're not even worth investing in. What's to stop you from doing the same to me? How do I know you ain't going to quit on me in 4 months or demand a move somewhere? I don't and as an Employer, I operate automatically on the principle of least trust. You only give the minimum amount of trust to anyone working under you. Never take your employees for granted. They can leave and quit any time they want and leave you with a labor shortage that you have to fill. You would not be a very good candidate for filling in that labor shortage because you're currently just as likely to cause them. Right now you sound very entitled and flaky. You've worked a SWE all of a couple months and it's already unbearable for you? You blame the city but it really sounds like you got fixated on what you thought your life would look like and are now feeling intense things that it's not going like that. That's normal. When I was your age, I thought I would be able to advance my salary quickly enough that I'd be able to buy a house in 2-3 years. That wound up not happening. I thought I'd get on the PM track and not have to do a bunch of coding when I initially just wanted to get into management. Instead I've basically been stuck in the SWE path. It is what it is, I'll eventually get back to where I want to be but for now, I'm making the best of what I've got. That's how life goes. It very rarely goes according to plan unless you're super wealthy and can just make problems disappear with money. But that doesn't sound like that's your case. Finally, just be wise. I mean, follow your heart and all but do be logical about it.",

I ended up being pretty successful, even through COVID. I made lots of friends, went to lots of parties, and (mostly) lived my ideal life through the rest of my 20's. A year before I turned 30, I realized I was ready for something more stable, so I taught myself to code and started my first SWE job 2 days after my 30th birthday. To be honest, I was miserable at that point too. COVID killed my interest in being hypersocial and having to get out to do things.You're in a career sub. Folks are giving you great advice for your career. Up and leaving your job for some idealized version of your perfect life is seriously risky. What if you move to a city and absolutely hate it? What if you have to work so much to afford living there that you miss out on the experiences you are actually after? At the same time, you do only live once, and I wouldn't recommend spending any amount of time being miserable with their life choices if they have the ability to change their circumstances. I think there is a balance to strike here; if your job is really well paying, why not do weekend trips to some cities you're interested in? Stay in a hostel to meet folks/work on soft skills, go to local tech meetups like you live there while building a network. When I left my job, I wasn't starting at square one; I had already been playing in bands and making money playing and teaching music on the side. It just took time to build up to what I wanted. Spend your time, money, and energy where you are now getting to where you want to be. It will help with the bad feelings and give you something to be excited about. You'll actually be armed and educated to make a decision about where you want to live, and you'll already know people there that can help you get a job. Best of luck!",

You will quickly get used to getting things done quickly and effectively and learning how to manage priorities and getting confidence to innovate. You would also likely build a much stronger network and bond with the startup team than the run of the mill mature larger company with a lot more established processes. Most likely you will also quickly outpace the average FAANG engineer in terms of upskilling and improving by far. But this is all assuming you can pull your weight in the startup and not get let go for underperforming in the first month and also assuming the startup itself is a good environment (good leadership/mentors/culture, etc). The answer to this is how risk averse you are and how willing you are to put in work and what your priorities are. The smaller the startup, the more brutal it will be in terms of workload and expectations and “hire fast, fire faster” is the norm but there are benefits to it that I mentioned above. The larger the company is, you will have more stability but the work in general tends to be more boring with less agency, you don’t learn as much as quickly as at a startup, and the amount of process and red tape required to do things get more and more overwhelming. This leads to a lot of incompetent people that are just coasting and coworkers that are dead weight in larger companies whereas in a startup they would be canned in a week.To me, your situation is not about the difference in pay at all. It is not relevant. The startup will have you work many more hours than the government job so if you account for hours worked, the government job would technically be higher pay.",

Prospective employer calls previous employer, asks exactly: did person work here, with this title, for this period of time2. Previous employer responds with yes, or no, and practically nothing else for liability reasons3. Prospective employer says thanks, hangs up the phoneAnd if your title/tenure doesn’t at least kinda match what is in your previous employer’s ERP, you have introduced a new line of questioning for your prospective employer.In so far as job seeking is concerned, nothing title-wise really matters outside of very large tech companies with well understood levels. The sort of stuff you see on levels.fyi. What you actually did in the role, and how it’s represented on a CV/resume, is the more important thing.You can certainly lie about what you did, and be reasonably confident those lies aren’t surfaced as part of a routine background check. Most people are terrible liars, and worse liars in the context of a job interview.If you care about whether you’re growing appropriately, focus on engineering management and staff+ roles. Plenty of very good books/blogs on those specific career paths exist.

Will probably be able to handle some of the smallest task the team does without direction, likely because they’ve done something like that task about a dozen times now. I’ll say this is someone about 6-24 months on the job.Mid: Solid understanding of the Tech Stack and Code Base. Likely capable of giving some input on smaller tasks. Should be able to handle medium sized, week long tasks with just a Q&A session for clarification. I’d say this can go from about 3 years to around 7 depending on the person.Senior: Should know the system and tech stack (assuming they aren’t new to the team) well enough to discuss architecture with others as well as give input on a wide range of things with the code base. Should need very little guidance outside of larger tasks, even then it’ll likely fall more into a requirements clarification discussion like “Should this button open a dialog with an are you sure prompt, or simply bounce them back to another page?” than an actual “I need help with this”. I’d say this is most people with 5-6 years of experience.These are blurred lines though and people mature faster than others, no doubt there’s guys better than Seniors with just 18 months of experience and guys who are barely better than Junior’s with over 10 years of experience (probably when a lot of the “I have 13 YOE and can’t find a job” posts get made)",

You have a great chance to learn a lot here and earn a strong reputation in your current company. If you have a good manager he should understand your side of the situation, and try to support you.If you get more people, that’s great, I wouldn’t worry too much, there’s very few downsides in the long run. You’ll learn from the principal engineer and have a team to rely on.If you don’t though it’ll obviously be harder for you and the team. You’ll still learn a lot, and there’s a great leadership opportunity there for both yourself and the other engineer you’ll be working with, but yes you’re right it’ll be more stressful for you both.IMO it depends on how much the company is willing to support the team. I was in a similar situation about a year ago and the company gave the bare minimum support, and basically told our manager to make it work. I left after about 6 months of that pattern.",

Since you're being given a 6-month window, you can ask about things like backfilling. But, it takes time to hire people, especially the right people. There's no guarantee you'll find someone before the other dev leaves. There's also no guarantee the new person is actually good. So, for the overall stability of the team, it's good that the knowledge be shared/spread around.Ask your manager about the backfill and your concerns about workload, due to handling all the requests from the customer. Hopefully, they will help manage that. This might be a really great opportunity, or it could turn into a nightmare. At least some of it will be impacted by your attitude going into it. There are a lot of times in life something will come up, and you won't feel ready. But a lot of people rise to the occasion. And if you don't, hopefully you can still learn from it.",

Whether those goals are a boatload of money, ridiculously good WLB, handling increasingly more difficult technical challenges, or anything else that isn't trivially attainable.",

When I first started, I was told \"Go build an integration between our product and X CRM\" and that was about as much interaction as I got.Same thing where everything is always urgent, everything is always broken, everyone always needs something from you CONSTANTLY. I think that's unfortunately pretty common in SWE, but even more so at a startup.My advice would be first, to stop caring so much, and second, keep looking for new opportunities with a healthier company. I'm not saying give up, or slack off, but I am saying that you should understand and accept that you will always have work to do and tickets to complete, and if you put forth your best effort and don't get all of those tickets done, it's not a reflection of you or your productivity, it's a result of poor management and unrealistic expectations.When I first started, I felt like I had to grind late nights and weekends so that I could meet the needs of every customer, and I would often work 60+ hours a week just to push a project past the finish line. Time and time again, I would put in all of this extra work and a few weeks down the road, the customer would churn for a reason unrelated to my work and then suddenly all of those extra hours were for nothing.Nobody else cares about your mental health as much as you do, so you need to learn to set boundaries to protect your mental.I adopted the mantra \"Not my circus, not my monkeys\" lol. At the end of the day, if this company lives or dies, your life will ultimately be the same. Don't let it consume your life or your mental health, because one day you will find that it was all for nothing. My only other coworker in my department was just like me -- he stressed out about customers after hours and worked extra, and guess what? One day they decided he was too expensive and they canned him. All of those late nights and extra hours for nothing.Put forth your best effort during the work day and try to leave the stress in the office. If work is unfinished, it's unfinished, but it's not your problem because you already did as much as you reasonably should.I could go on and on, but my point is, *while you're looking for another job,* try to at least make this one more tolerable in the meantime by learning reasonable ways to protect your mental health. If you get punished for that in any way, let it roll off your shoulder knowing you're gonna leave the toxic environment as soon as you can anyway.",

I know it hurts to hear this but I think you should tough it out at the current gig. 6 months isn’t enough experience in the current market to meaningfully increase your odds of a new job, it may even hurt them as it can make you look “incompetent” hopping too early. That didn’t matter 5 years ago and it’s not fair that it matters today, but that’s just the state of things. Addressing your bullet points:- micro management: this usually stems from either fear or perception of incompetence. You have to get around it by either being hyper competent or find out what your manager is afraid of. Talk to them and try to get them to back off, if that fails go to their manager. - zero mentorship: that’s just the state of things today. It’s kind of on you to ask seniors and seek out the help you need. If they say no go to management or ask LLMs. Look up some tutorials on navigating large codebases. Everyone’s stretched to thin at most firms for dedicated mentorship right now. - unrealistic expectations: also pretty standard. As you level up and gain experience you’ll notice that you have the power to push back on tasks and tell management “this isn’t important” or “I’m overloaded and someone else needs to take this”. Both are fine and expected. Even as a college hire. Your manager should respect your opinion and listen to that feedback. - commute: man that sucks. If you can’t move I’d try to count at least some of your commute as working hours and be hyper productive at work. Be a mercenary on a mission to get out the door as quick as possible so your door to door + work time is not more than 8-9 hours. It’s hard, but if you do good work most managers will be chill about it.",

If you are silently reading the question, and then taking a few minutes to silently formulate a good answer, I am going to think you are cheating somehow.

If you come up with a bad or mediocre solution after not vocalizing anything, I'll think you don't know what you're doing and if you somehow miraculously come up with the perfect solution with no apparent thought process that also reinforces the idea that you've got some sort of cheating situation going on.I don't want to see you type out a good solution, I want to know how you determined that was a good solution. I want to know why you choose a dictionary or a stack for this solution. I want to know that you thought through the brute force solution and how you got to your improved option. I'm totally stream of consciousness on coding problems, but, I will make sure I preface things. I will vocalize that I like to think through the brute force or basic solution first and identify the deficiencies. This should take like a minute, during which you can formulate specifically why your eventual solution is the right one.Also make sure to explicitly tell them if you put them on a different monitor from your coding so they understand why you're looking to the side if you are doing that.I'm looking for basic coding skills and understanding how you problem solve. I'll never assume that the first solution you start talking about is your ultimate plan unless you then start looking to me for validation.",

Experiences obviously vary and you can definitely go an entire career without the CS degree, but having it doesn't really hurt. It can only help or do nothing.",

No AI generation, IMO those sound so fake and such insincere BS.  Get a template going written uhhh ‘from the heart’ and tailor it per company based on the company’s mission statement on their website, and include some things from the job posting as to why you would be a good fit and how much this would mean to you, and you believe in their mission of xyz  - something like that-focus on applying locally, hybrid or on site.  Remote jobs are flooded with hundreds of applicants, all with the same AI generated buzz-word-salad, I have no idea how HR swifts through them without choosing the completely wrong people. In my experience hospitals, local colleges and some insurance companies have easier interview processes with easy programming tests/questions (as they’re usually behind on the times, err…)-get a friend to do a mock interview with you, get them to ask questions a company would, and get their input on your answers.  or if you have no friends, watch YouTube videos on interviewing questions and how to answer them well, and practice in front of the mirror-also I agree with other comments, leave your gpa out and don’t say you were let go due to performance.  If anything you can turn this into a decent “what’s a flaw you have” answer…. I actually used this on my interview (that I got the job for).  I said I had a problem saying no, and take too much on and get stressed out.  But that I have learned to prioritize better and set better expectations with others.  This might help you exceed more in your new role too, sounds like you were like me. Good luck",

Especially cloud security or multi cloud expertise. Embedded software also has no saturation yet, especially if there is a lot of assembly use. The reason is the training data is scarce so AI could not train well enough like with js or python. And finally expertise is still scarce in GEN AI.

It is subsidized by the unlimited money faucet of Ads to do cutting edge shit that may or may not benefit the company; their spending power is basically incomparable to the others. Keep in mind we also have in house TPUs we vertically integrate while the others have to rely on Nvidia for their compute.

Improve competency in a specific skill or just expand your scope as a skilled generalist.Or build network. It's a bit of a shot in the dark. Simply attend every meeting or event and just meet as many people as you can and try connecting where you can.NGL ..it's not easy but need to be persistent.The masters in physics is something I would definitely avoid at this juncture. It simply gives you extreme options. Either you are left holding the bag or you are in some niche lab in aeronautics, nuclear or device modelling and stuff like that.

For all they know by just looking at your CV you could be 22. Obviously a 37 year old will look older when it gets to the in-person interview, but by then you're at least able to make your case.Sadly ageism is a huge problem in the industry, but I've worked with people who have pivoted to CS at an older age, I think oldest was a junior dev in her 50s. So there are definitely companies willing to give older people a go.The disability could be another issue. I don't agree with it at all, but sadly remote work is being more and more rare with at least 3+ days in the office being the norm here. Plus if you can't work full time obviously that puts you in a tight spot because I rarely see part time dev roles. Legally they shouldn't discriminate due to disability either, but sadly in practice it happens",

The piece of paper you get at the end is one thing, but what's more important are the general skills that you can learn from pursuing a college degree: time management on a progressively longer scale, learning independently, collaborating with other people. Of course, these may be skills you have picked up from elsewhere, but if they are not (or if not to the level you would like), then this is an excellent opportunity to pick them up. Note that these are not necessarily things that happen automatically, though; graduation requirements get you the piece of paper, but how you spend your time engaging with your coursework determines what skills you'll actually get out of your degree. This is especially true if you're able to go full time and not worry about work during that time, because otherwise you will rarely have the time and energy to spend as you like on thinking and learning as you will during those 4 years.On majoring in CS: choosing CS because you \"like math and computers\" is a much better rationale than choosing it because of the job market, and part of why there are a lot of people complaining about the job market now is because a lot of people entered this field only because of the second reason back when the market was good. This of course does not guarantee you a job, but it does mean you're more likely to engage more deeply with the material in the degree, which means you will get more out of the degree one way or another. That said, do you know whether the program will allow you to switch majors? While you shouldn't switch out just because some class is harder than expected, if you discover that CS is really not for you, having the option to switch into something that better matches with your interests will make starting the program feel less constraining.On getting a job after: Let's be honest, no one actually knows what the job market will look like 4 years from now. Will it be challenging, especially with your nontraditional background? Probably. But would it be so bad that you would regret even \\*trying\\* in the first place? Some people on this sub may say so, but that outlook has a nasty habit of becoming self-fulfilling.",

If one of my nieces or nephews asked me whether to major in CS, I would tell them to change your major to anything that requires in-person work outside of a cubicle such as healthcare with patients seeking medical services or the trades. If you're picking CS because of remote work, you're mostly wasting your time unless you've been lucky with lottery tickets because remote job is the dream job. Most roles require in-person nowadays. Don't get fooled by the cheap or free tuition from the state if the bargain requires majoring in something CS or IT related. This field is way, way oversaturated thanks to Learn2Code. With AI coming up to bat, this trend of AI eventually replacing IT workers and developers is IMHO irreversible and permanent. Learn to become a plumber. Seriously.

I'm also 32, so it sometimes feels like the clock is ticking, but what can I do, it's either complete the degree and be 35 or don't complete it and still be 35. If I were in your shoes, I'd try out some free resources before signing up for any classes. Check out CS50 for a formal introduction, I've heard it's a bit difficult but it's a great intro to programming and CS fundamentals. The Odin Project is a great starter resource if you're into / want to try web development. If you choose the school route, go to a community college first to save some money, then transfer to a state school. See if you qualify for any grants. If not, check out scholarships. Regardless of your decision, I don't think you should base it solely off of the opinions of people from the internet. Not saying you are, but I just wanted to make note. Do your own research, make a plan (budget, time, courseload) and look into possible programs. Do you have any connections in the industry? Even a connection in something software-adjacent, like IT, would be valuable. Any sort of connection would help. Even a help desk job, or some IT position on campus would be great, assuming it makes financial sense for you. Sign up for CS50 or start The Odin Project to see if you enjoy this stuff. I can't speak for CS50, but the actual CS degree would be different from The Odin Project. The common ground is problem-solving. Just see if you enjoy the actual problem-solving process, whether it's practical or theoretical.Best of luck!",

But if you’re expecting big tech salary then it’s a big no. If you do go I would encourage you to get involved in research as early as possible. It will help you build you resume (which is extremely important as an older student) and it will help you find out what parts of CS you do and don’t like. Given you like tech and visual arts I would suggest game design but that industry has a really bad reputation. But maybe you can do some indie stuff with it. As an older student I would go with what another commenter basically said, you’re starting your career way too late to have a “serious” career. You might as well try to follow your dreams and do something you’ll love regardless of the money. Hopefully this helps some. Also beware there are a lot of doomers in CS and generally those seem to be people unwilling to move or who were only in it for the money. So take things with a grain of salt. I think most people on this sub are in college or still fairly early in their career. Just follow your passion and things will work out.",

Your best chance is making the move internally since you at least have some reputation there. When the tech market was booming pre COVID sure you could easily make PM as a senior engineer with decent social skills.

        "body": "English is my first language, but I learned Spanish well enough to present at tech conferences in Spanish, so I do have language learning experience.Regarding A1-A2 active vocabulary: you’ve gotta move a lot of stuff from passive to active vocabulary. Writing may be a good stepping stone to practice output without the time pressure of speaking. r/WriteStreakEN will give you daily corrections. You could even note in your posts that you want corrections that elevate your vocabulary.Also, if you have flash cards, work them in the “I need to produce English” direction. If you don’t have flash cards, maybe get started with some. I had 5000 words in my Spanish study list back when I was studying.Also: read. A LOT. Reading is huge for increasing a person’s vocabulary. Since English pronunciation and orthography are only loosely related, and we’re talking about learning new words, reading along to an audiobook may be wise to ensure you pick up the correct pronunciations.For specifically-tech stuff, watching conference talks might not be a bad idea; you can learn a lot of domain-specific vocabulary that way, and there are a ton on YouTube.Regarding filler words: spend at least one hour a week with a tutor doing conversation practice. If you can do an hour twice a week, even better. This is to get you practicing with the time pressure. As your vocabulary and production under time pressure improve, you’ll spend less time searching for words and trying to hide it with filler words. But also: are you using English filler words/sounds/phrases or ones from your first language? If first language, switch to English fillers. “That’s a really interesting question because well, you know, the thing is, when you consider all aspects of that topic…” is a nice long string of words that give you time to actually think of your answer without it just being “uhhhhh” or worse, a non-English filler like “eeehmmmmmm.”Regarding pronunciation: record yourself repeating after something you’ve just heard. Maybe you watch a technical video and pause and repeat back a sentence. Then play back the original and yourself and compare. You can do a fair bit of accent training this way. You can also hire tutors who specifically do accent coaching. If your native language has far fewer vowels than English (for example, Spanish has 5, and Italian has 7), then you will want to learn some new ones. The two Italian has that Spanish doesn’t (open o and open e) are common in English, but English also has an open i, where the tongue is placed midway between Spanish’s i and e, and the sound in “put” which is midway between o and u.",

Don't assume someone will be thorough or truly mindful while searching. Here's an example. It should be \"Spring Boot.\" If you have \"springboot\" on your resume/LinkedIn, there's a chance it won't be a match.

What kind of personality traits and such do I care about? What kind of work will the people be doing? What are positive signs? What are negative signs? And they will study the job description. They will ask how I'm going to run the interviews etc.Then they go out, and find a few people's resumes and we do expectation setting. They ask what do I think about these candidates? And I say I don't like the way the resume's formatted, I expect to see these kinds of things etc. We go back and forth a few times, before he starts sending me people he's interviewed and have passed the test. He sends me interview requests for next stages of the interviewing and after I interview the candidate we go through the expectations once more. This person did really well but didn't meet these requirements, and that again helps him narrow down his own HR screening process.Through none of this process, is anyone asking me if Springboot is Java, or if Laravel is PHP. The recruiter is not a developer, and has never coded before, and it's not even going to be a thing he considers or even thinks about, because it's not his domain of expertise, and I'm being asked like 50 questions and it's not on my mind either.",

And this is one class without much complexity. They are a long way from being let loose on our 10 million line codebase of bespoke classes. I was looking at one of my kids homework assignments the other day as she could not figure it out. I started with LLMs but they could not do C allocation and deallocation. Only because the assignment used an int\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* for an array of ints, instead o int\\*. It was off by one on every function, because it does not understand anything and is just predicting the next token which breaks down when something goofy is asked for like in the assignment.

        "body": "Approximately 1/50 application to interviews is pretty good in the current market. My advice would be to try to figure out what went wrong in the three interviews you did get, and work on fixing that in addition to applying. Because if you can fix that, you just need 1-2 more shots and you're good! Assuming you posted your resume to solicit feedback, here's a huge text wall of resume advice you can take or leave: As another user suggested, you might want a different template. I linked one at the bottom. I'm not sure if your template is the issue, but it doesn't hurt to try something different and test results, you can always circle back to what you have now. I'd also include a projects section, put your 2-3 most impressive school projects with some jazzed up bullet points (you can get an llm to help you with jazzing them up) and work on a project yourself using industry tools in the space you want to work in. Using and mentioning industry tools in projects is a great way to get through ATS assuming it's checking for keywords (for example \"Docker\", \"React\" and \"Java\"). Here's an example of what I mean by a personal project, say you want to work with python full stack? Make and deploy a django app or something. Link the frontend on your resume, maybe the github too. What kind of app? I don't know. It doesn't have to be crazy, but try to use docker, a common database, maybe make the frontend with react that's popular af. If you can't get actual work experience in a company, try to get a bit of experience doing a project. You don't have to use industry tools to make a toy project, but doing so gives you a little practice and exposure to them which is what's valuable, and can help you get through ATS. Maybe even better than a personal project would be if you could contribute to an open source project and put that on your resume under the projects section. TLDR get a projects section and have your 3-4 most impressive projects on there until you get enough work experience to de-prioritize them. I'd shorten the skills section up to make room for the projects, mine is only two lines, languages and frameworks. I had an interview where the person was like, ok i'm going to list stuff from your skills section, you tell me on a scale of 1 to 10 how good you are with it, then proceeded to ask me corresponding difficulty questions about that skill/language/framework. After that, I trimmed my skills section up to stuff i'm at least a 4/10 confident in and it hasn't had a negative impact on my response rate.I'd consider putting one or two of those summer jobs back, you could put them under \"additional experience\" section at the bottom or something, just one liners very brief, if you give a description I think that describing teamwork and communication would help the most. For a template that has additional work experience I think the \"additional expereince\" template in this google doc from Codepath would be a good start (make a copy don't request edit access). [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDGkSD5l--GjKu56jw6frHmjr075QHbr\\_wfma\\_gmv8s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gjdgxs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TDGkSD5l--GjKu56jw6frHmjr075QHbr_wfma_gmv8s/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.gjdgxs)You might want to consider making tailored resumes for different roles like swe, data analyst, etc where you put the popular keywords in. For example in your data analyst resume put a data project you did in there that uses powerBI or something at the top of the projects list, maybe change the skills up to include numpy pandas excel and tableau. Anyways, good luck. I'm curious from a scientific perspective if your response rate will improve after tweaking your resume. If you do change it up, you'll have to let me know if it made a difference.",

        "body": "Here's some actually helpful advice:1. Make maintaining good work/life balance an explicit goal. If you budget your time like you have 60 hours a week, you will be working 60 hours a week. Most people find 45-50 hours a week with short bursts above that sustainable, and I think that's a good place to target. You will be be pressured to work more; be ready to gracefully wiggle out of it.2. Whenever you ask someone for a piece of information (\"what is X?\", \"how do I do Y?\"), also find out how they know/obtained that information. Getting questions answered is good (and you should ask a lot of questions), but you should also be learning how to find answers yourself.3. Underpromise and overdeliver. You should describe every single task task you complete as both absolutely amazing and the product of tons of hard work.4. Optimize your commute. If you spend an hour sitting in the car each way, that's equivalent to working an extra 10 hours a week. Live close to work, work from home, or go in early and leave early to beat traffic. I usually listen to a podcast on the way in and call out of state family on the way home, much better than feeling your brain bleed out your ears as you sit in traffic.5. Be *very* careful when it comes to agreeing to take responsibility for something. Once you take responsibility for a project or feature you become the person on the hook for it, and if/when things go poorly you're going to be working 80 hour weeks while out of your mind. You need to be strategic, you need to advocate for yourself, and you need to resist peer pressure.6. If you're on a team of workaholics, just lie. Work 45 hours a week and tell people you're working 60.",

Sure, if we get a higher salary the recruiter gets a slightly bigger cut, but the recruiter would rather lowball you and get you placed fast. The higher the salary you demand, the harder you are for them to place. They'll do anything they can to get you placed *anywhere*. A cut of a lowball $60k offer is better than a cut of $0. They don't care if the company is toxic, boring, and a bait & switch, they get paid either way the minute you accept the offer.I'm not a fan of 3rd party recruiters.

Still, I'd wager it's easier than getting a full time job.I'll say that there's a massive difference in difficulty for technical interviews. Unless you're trying for FAANG, there is little to no technical interview in my experience. If you do get asked questions, they're usually very easy.For one of my past internships, I got asked an (easier) variation of the fizzbuzz problem.

I'm now ***18 years*** into my career, and I'm already planning to leave this place when the market improves enough to look for something better. My average tenure is around 2 years, and I've found that I'm almost always ready to move on for more money and a change in scenery by then.I also do hiring with some frequency, and let me tell you that ***some*** short tenures on resumes don't really bother me much at all. This career doesn't have much stability and finding a good fit can be really hard.Additionally, my experience has been that people who stay with the same employer for long periods of time (5+ years) tend to have less varied/useful amounts of experience and will not generally have as versatile (or up-to-date) a skillset as someone who has had 3 different jobs in the same amount of time.There's definitely a lower limit though, a career that's only multiple years of 6 month contracts/employers, for example, does not look great to anyone, as it appears to signal that the employee can't ever meet expectations well enough to stay on anywhere.",

The key is reframing your experience to highlight what you do know rather than focusing on what you don't.Stop trying to become an expert in everything and pick one path to focus on. If you want data engineering, lean into your Databricks and PySpark experience even if it was 2 years ago - refresh yourself with some quick projects and be honest about the timeline when asked. For the business analyst roles, emphasize your analytical thinking and problem-solving approach even without direct client interaction.

Since you enjoyed complex SQL queries and system design, lean into that - start building projects that let you implement interesting database architectures or solve actual scaling problems. Think about creating something like a URL shortener with custom analytics, a chat application that handles real concurrency issues, or even contributing to open source projects where you can work on meaningful backend challenges. The key is picking projects where you'll naturally encounter and solve the problems that backend engineers face daily, rather than building yet another CRUD API.

There will be less positions available to you relating to your current role if you re-enter the market, but you're much more likely to get the positions you DO align with, because you have the experience of working with C/C++ that a frontend webdev wouldn't have. Not quite that simple, but it basically is. Does that make sense?",

I am going to wait around until at least the promotion or if I hit 3yoe since the job market with layoffs is scary to think about. I would hate to switch positions and then be hit with a mass layoff or something but life is all about taking risks too. Do you have any keywords that would help filter C/C++ jobs? I am just curious what is actually out there and if anything interests me. If it doesn't, brushing up on fullstack and switching would be better to do it earlier in my career than later I think",

In one, I got into an argument with the founder of this company, and thinking it was okay, I just kept going. The recruiter called, and told me all about it. I just thought it was discussion. You don't want to work for people like that, who aren't comfortable enough with their decisions to entertain other ideas or viewpoints.Another interview, I basically was used in a consulting mode: \"tell us exactly how you would solve this\", and the just kept drilling into these really small, and more practical concerns. I figured that one out during the interview, but it was no surprise one of the dudes in the room, taking notes, got the job. Tools.Anyway, you'll get a bunch of these stories. Remember, you are playing with probabilistic outcomes, so numbers on your side are good. If you can't be yourself in a professional way and pass an interview, working their will be a problem!",

When it's an employer's market, some hiring managers let the sway over applicants' lives get to their head and they pull stunts like this. Worst I personally received was the interviewer refusing to discuss the job or my qualification and spent 20 minutes asking me triva about the history of the organization while they fruitlessly tried to resolve tech issues on their end and shouting \"turn up your microphone, I can't hear you\". It was an old man claiming to be a senior SWE who'd muted his desktop speakers at some point during his little trivia performance...Its almost as bad as my first and only technical interview at google, where the interviewer asked me to turn on my webcam, looked me up and down and just played angry birds on their phone and spun around in their chair, slouched and despondent after putting up a leetcode hard with 15 minutes to solve it.OP, terrible interviewing practices are very common- take it as a sign you wouldn't have been better off working there and keep plugging elsewhere.",
