I spend 75% of my time writing 1000 line python scripts that are either complex one-off multisystem data pulls or building custom pipelines for merging data from those systems in a deployable way. 10% of my time is spent providing guidance on data systems, admin on our business applications and dev on functions internal to those. 10% is spent doing huge data cleaning jobs (our data is a complete shitshow). And the remaining 5% is basic analyst stuff like dashboards, live reports, and light analysis. Hell one of my current 6 main projects is building a Data Lakehouse on AWS for serving business data and reporting.The difference for me is we are a global SaaS company, but even one of our data scientists has come to me for pipeline dev and recommendations for data arch for a function in a chatbot they are developing.Fortunately my direct superior is on the same page and helping advocate for a title change (which would get a raise with it per company policy). But what I did was took the job description, broke the tasks in the job description down into 'typical role of task' (ie dashboarding and light analysis is typically a data analyst, building and maintaining pipelines via script and platform engineering is data engineer, but more fleshed out than that), I then added in any tasks I do that are not in my job description. I then gave a percentage of my time spent on each domain to illustrate that 90% of my time goes to tasks that are firmly in the domain of a Data Engineer. Fortunately my boss is chill and an advocate and he took that and actually added supporting examples of tasks I have completed that are outside of my job description and is taking it to the C-Suite person he reports to so we can get me a title that reflects my work. I recommend doing something of that nature with some added answers to what is the value add for the company of each of these tasks.",

I’m assuming you want a DE career path; if not shut it down and stopped doing the extra work. Generally speaking DE is not an entry level position. And with this economy even so called junior roles are asking for a lot of experience/skillsets. It sounds like you have a great opportunity to shape your own career and have on the job training/experience without much restrictions. Start offering to make everything you built so far, more efficient, more analytical, more robust, more real time. If they like what you’re saying, then you have free rein to set up traditional DE systems and architecture, giving you experience people would gladly pay for. Once you feel you’ve nailed down the experience and skillset, go and explore the market.",

How do you know that fixed it, other than adding a basic regression test each time you find one that doesn't get caught. I do think it's useful for examples, asking questions about your code and best practices (also it's OK to not align with best practices the real world very rarely has perfect alignment to what Fang companies use). Using SQL is also so important, I'm often in calls where I'm able to prove whether something is true during the call. Or just look at a coworkers query and understand why their results aren't as expected. That takes some time. To me LLMs are like having a junior coworker, I think if you treat it like another junior coworker and double check it's work but assume it can do 70% of it, then it'll be a useful tool.

I would break it down into two: the ability to perform the tasks well, and the ability to grow as engineer. The first means that the stuff you produce is maintainable by other engineers and has a good quality artifacts on output. The second is about making more complex projects without losing quality of the solution.If you can do both, it doesn't matter if you use LLMs or not. Just keep in mind that the closer you are to more senior roles, the further your focus may drift from pure coding to organizational and communicational tasks. That's where LLMs won't help you much.",

I know it sounds boring but I’ll rather hire a junior which return me a take home test without spelling errors, with a ok code but that’s structure and well explain than someone with awesome code but that’s all over the place that didn’t have description on topics and that did way more than expected.In terms of stack focus on SQL. Not because it’s the best but because it’s the easiest. And because it’s the easiest It’s the most used. I’ll rather use a transformation framework with SQL than pandas for example because I know anyone in the company will be able to use it and so some simple transformation. Even if something it would make more sense to go the other way.Go read DBT best practices docs. They have a bunch on their site. Read them multiple times. Understanding the structure is th le best thing you can do.Then python. Maybe learn the request framework and how to dump a response to json or parquet in s3.Than prefect, Dagster, mage, Luigi are good candidates for orchestration. Learn the basics. I don’t think you’ll find a project which give you enough things that you’ll hit common business issues with them. But having an overview on how you structure your things is already great.Good luck",

It’s very powerful and flexible, but still has quite a bit of abstraction/simplifications via snowflake and prefect. Where are you hosting and executing your prefect code? Is it all on your local machine? If you become a full-time data engineer, it’s definitely not going to be on your computer. You’re going to want at least some basic understanding of how cloud services work, probably UNIX operating systems, and different ways to manage remote devices. A lot of data engineering is infrastructure Ideally you won’t have to worry about this too much as a junior. but that really depends on where you go.

I've witnessed teams overspend on auto-scaling clusters when a straightforward Glue or EMR job would have done the trick.2. **Vendor Lock-In:** The more integrated you become with Delta Lake and Unity Catalog, the tougher it is to switch gears. One client faced challenges when their new CTO advocated for a Snowflake-centric approach.3. **The AI Hype:** The integration of MLflow and LLM is impressive for MLOps, but I've observed several teams paying for features that go unused.",

The idea is that they identify the row as a first-class thing in its own right. This is useful if the data model (or your understanding of the data) changes. For example, many things which _should_ be natural keys can end up being non-unique in practice due to dirty data, particularly at a large enough scale.Surrogate primary keys have to be unique, but can't rely on the data from the row to provide that uniqueness, so the guarantee that no two rows have the same key had to come from somewhere else. The basic options to guarantee uniqueness are:- Generate keys randomly and check for duplicates- Generate keys randomly from such a large keyspace that collisions are \"unlikely enough\"- Generate keys in some way that is mathematically guaranteed never to generate the same key twiceJust about simplest mathematical approach that is guaranteed never to generate the same output twice is an incrementing integer sequence. It's also easy to implement, and produces an output (a smallish integer) that is very efficient to work with and which often has relatively nice properties for things like database indexes.",

        "body": "I'll take MSSQL as the example hereYour question is more related on what makes a clustered index. Per default, the primary key is used as the clustered index, but it does not have to be. Anyway, when I say clustered index, you pretty much can think \"primary key\".I won't go to deep here, but essentially, the clustered index is the physical sorting of the table. If the clustered index is sequential, you add a new row, it gets appended at \"the end\". The number sequence is irrelevant, nobody cares, its only used to ensure the sorting order. If your clustered index is not sequential, the new row needs to get added \"in the middle\"That will cause something called page splits. With a page split, the data can not be written where it should be, since the 8kb page at that position is full, so instead a pointer to a new page is written there. When querying the data for that row, the page where it should be is read, pointer to other page is found, other page gets read as well. So it is not good for performance.That's why you quite often see maintainance jobs, that rebuild / reorganize the clustered indexes of the entire database, running during some weekend night or something like that.The reason it is common to have that sequence as an integer is, the size. Int32 is 4 byte. Every non clustered index will reference the clustered index, so having a larger field for the clustered index, will bloat the size of all non clustered indexes, which is again bad for performance, since more data gets written / read / cached.That's the gist of why you often read about and see identity columns as clustered index.Why would you not use that:Now here it gets a bit harder, to not write a small book. The clustered index is your physical data on disk. The more efficient you can look up a value given your data access paths, the faster your queries will execute. On a typical OLTP database, you will see 90%+ read traffic, so read access is very important.Lets say you have 100 million rows in your table, that contains a lets say zip code. Lets also say, you usually query by a filter on that zip code. Something along the lines of WHERE zipCode = @@param1 AND .... In that case, for read access, it would likely be a good idea to create a clustered index, with zip code as the first field (you can create a clustered index containing more than one column). Since the search trough the B+ tree can be more efficient that way.If you had an identity as the clustered index, you would create a non clustered index on the zipCode, which works, but after the relevant data is found in the non clustered index, it will have to be looked up in the clustered index to get the actual data. As long as it was not a covering non clustered index. It also depends on data distribution an the statistics on the table, an index is useless if in that example your data is split between two zip codes.You see what I mean by saying, \"hard to not write a small book\" ?Random Guids should only be used in special cases. Massive concurrent users, where you run into hot spots on the \"last page\" data needs to get written to for example (would be called latch contention on mssql), or distributed systems.The reason for that is, that the data ends up essentially unsorted, which is not good, while also causing the page split problem, which creates the need for regular maintenance tasks.I'll try to give a bit of a TLDR on how you should choose your clustered index :* It should be chosen with intent, it is the most powerful tool for performance optimizing on the data modeling level* It should be narrow (small data size)* it should be selective. Think along the lines of a hash table, you don't benefit from a hashtable much, if you end up with two hash buckets, containing 50 million rows. Still a hash table... but you are far from O(1) in such a case.* sequential ID's can work but don't have to. They are rarely ideal, but are better than nothing* Think about how your data gets accessed, and choose the index to best support most of your workload* At least as a health check, keep an eye on your index fragmentation (there are system views for that on mssql, I'm sure there is something like that on any serious database)* The clustered index does not have to be unique! Sql Server, will append a small row identifier if needed behind the scene. It is not a good idea to append a guid in the datamodel* As a default when creating a table, the primary key gets used as the clustered index, that does not have to be done. It is usually a better idea to have a thought out clustered index, instead of just defaulting to the PK. In cases where the PK is not the clustered index, a non clustered index gets created, to ensure uniqueness of said key.Edit: Jesus Christ that ended up as a blog post pretty much, and I tried to be brief...",

So often the PK & FK were text based, and this was slow.Some vendors in the DBase III+ era, Foxpro, started copying the popular Informix & SQL-92 ansi standard, to have a database \"engine\" assign the PK key with an auto increment column of type INT. These early DB engines were only 32 bit of course.They allowed the DB engine to lock the table, assign a PK automatically on INSERT based on last value used, write the record, unlock the table. This was seen as a more secure way, since the engine was assigning the key, not the application. Because of course in a network, you get network errors, and the application would often hang or use an incorrect PK causing duplicates.My early DBA days mid-90's was handling duplicates on micro computers and mini computers (like the VAX). A mini computer used ASCII terminals, so everything ran inside 1 computer with a multi-threaded CPU, why they were huge & expensive.Micro computer decentralized the expensive mini computer, and you could use Wordperfect & Lotus 1-2-3, not just a homegrown ERP/WMS/MES application. So all the micro-computer vendors mid-90's offered auto increment with their SQL db engine because the demand was there, CPUs were only 32 bit, and the GUID() or MD5() functions didn't exist yet.Some companies had to use datetime strings instead, like Wall Street, or the UK-France tunnel car tracking system, because auto increment had reached its limit in transactions count.Was still used for lookup tables, like a string PK for a product table, but category, sub-category, color tables used auto inc for PK.Merging data from various systems was a major PITA (duplicate ID #'s with different data) and by the late 90's the auto inc was being abandonned globally for GUID instead, or a datetime string down to the milisecond 5 digits, I've seen both.Then Lo' & Behold, 64 bit CPUs, and now we have BIGINT with MSSQL 2000 in the year 2000, and auto inc came back with a vengeance because who ever hits the 2\\^64-1 limit?I blame Microsoft for bringing Auto Inc back to life when it should have died out in 1999 and the Y2K bug.",

It doesn't matter if your user id is 1234 or 9876—what matters is that one and only one person is associated with 1234.Some people will tell you integer/numeric based keys allow for faster joins or key generation—but that has to do with the efficiency of sorting/storing that particular data type and nothing to do with 'sequential-ness'. In fact, Oracle DBMS encourages configuring SEQUENCEs to cache blocks/ranges of integers per transaction to speed up certain operations, which will lead to non-consecutive gaps in the sequence of all keys. In fact, this will blow your mind: it's not even a case of either/or. You can hash strings into a 64-bit integer, such as how BigQuery's [FARM_FINGERPRINT()](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/hash_functions#farm_fingerprint) function works.If you can get ahold of a copy of Ralph Kimball's \"ETL Toolkit\" book, there's a great section on the importance and meaning of how to choose a surrogate key. 1000% recommend.",

Really depends on what your database is doing although the idea of something being fully normalised when you just don't need it i.e. largely static data, is just a huge waste of time and energy compared to simply having duplicate values in a table.I used to work with somebody who absolutely insisted on everything being fully normalised, was the type of person who can't see somebody else's perspective, and could only do things one way. Every time they saw a duplicate value - normalised. They normalised so much they actually went full circle and started duplicating data, but across multiple tables instead of duplicate values in a single table which didn't change much.Personally, I think normalisation is a lot more nuanced than it can appear.",

You can now point Sail at existing Delta datasets and run queries with Spark-compatible syntax—without the JVM.To enable this, we integrated directly with the internals of `delta-rs` and `delta-kernel-rs`, bypassing the higher-level APIs. It took considerably more effort, but the result is long-lasting confidence in high read/write performance.Check out our full blog → [https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3-2/](https://lakesail.com/blog/sail-0-3-2/)# LakeSail MerchWe’re now sending LakeSail merch to anyone currently using Sail!

Mess up the retry settings and you are either burning through your quota or missing data with no clue why.Fivetran handles retries better but if something silently fails or rows get dropped, you may not know until you are paged. We had a few late night surprises there. Integrate.io’s worth a look. Handles PII masking and lets you tweak backoff/retry per connector, throws alerts when throttling hits, and has row-level tracking so you can pinpoint what went wrong. You can also look into dlt if you are already deep in the Databricks ecosystem.API reliability and incremental syncs are way tougher than people think especially if your SLA’s under 15 minutes.

It’s not perfect but it keeps us compliant without blowing up our whole pipeline.If you don't want to maintain that layer long-term then you might want to explore hybrid models. If you don’t wanna deal with maintaining that forever, look into hybrid setups. Something like Kafka + Flink for real-time masking or dbt with staging schemas and tight permissions (still after load but manageable). The whole point is that you need PII masked before the warehouse or you are screwed. Either build this yourself or hunt for a tool that does inline transform.",

        "body": "Fivetran will save you setup and maintenance pain, but you're right that the post-load transform model kills you for PII compliance. There's just no way around that unless you front it with a proxy or pre-processor, which kinda defeats the point of Fivetran. SCD2 via dbt also works but adds overhead fast.Airbyte gives you the control, especially if you're self-hosting, but the PII masking and SCD2 will be on you to build or glue together. That gets messy if you're trying to hit a 15-min SLA with high reliability and source API quirks.Have you considered using a streaming CDC layer like Debezium or a change-data tool in front of the warehouse, and doing light pre-processing (like hashing) inline before landing to Snowflake? Or using something like Estuary, which can do incremental syncs, apply hashing inline before data hits the destination, and supports low-latency replication with built-in schema drift handling. Bonus is no maintaining connectors or DAGs.Quick q's: How often do schemas actually change in Salesforce for you? And are the PII fields always in fixed locations or could they appear in custom fields too?I work at Estuary, so naturally I'm biased, but it's built exactly for this kind of setup where off-the-shelf tools either fall short on compliance or require too much engineering lift. Also, we're adding true source-level masking functionality very soon, it's already being build",

Shallow learning curve, juniors can do senior work with it. Supports parallelism etc, it can scale to faster than the tools you mentioned. Much cheaper than the more expensive tool you mentioned (about 1-2% cost, idk about the other tool)1. you can [pseudonymise](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/customising-pipelines/pseudonymizing_columns) before loading. you can even load to a local duckdb and then [sync](https://dlthub.com/blog/datasets2) to your final destination after transforming if you prefer to hash in sql.2. Here is [SCD2](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/merge-loading#scd2-strategy)3. dlt is self maintaining with [schema evolution](https://dlthub.com/docs/general-usage/schema-evolution#alert-schema-changes-to-curate-new-data) and offers you hubspot and salesforce [sources](https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/) too. Community loves schema evolution because it takes most of maintenance and hard repetitive work away.4. if you don't have a run environment you could use[ github actions](https://dlthub.com/docs/walkthroughs/deploy-a-pipeline/deploy-with-github-actions) or any runner, we offer deployment helpers.5. dlt is a full toolkit for just about any other common requirements you might have, and when it misses something you can just use python to bridge any gap",

Replication is incremental with SFDC (for most tables) and it will tell you if it can't do that for a specific object.I don't remember about Airbyte (looked at it before). I don't think it is as easy to maintain as compared to Fivetran, but then Fivetran probably costs more.Re: API rate limits (for SFDC): we have never had an issue with this. However, our account is allocated a very large quota for this.You can setup a new Fivetran replication to Snowflake in 15min as long as you have setup the requisite security in SFDC and in Snowflake.in terms of SLA. Fivetran offers various plans. We use the 'standard' plan and it provides for a 15min sync time. Any lower than that you you need the 'enterprise' plan (I think).Fivetran will not directly help with building SCD Type 2. However, you can do a couple things here: 1) you can have it run in history mode, in which case it will not update in place rows that have changed. It will create new versioned rows as needed. 2) you can let Fivetran update rows in place but then use Snowflake STREAMS to detect the changes and then use that to drive any sort of SCD Type 2 dimensional needs (with whatever etl tool you have).Fivetran also supports Schema Drift (for SFDC and other connectors). You can control it so that FT will add new columns but not new tables (unless you want that). It also handles cases where column datatypes change (although that can still break downstream etl). Fivetran or Airbyte the best pick for this? \\>>> I see no reason why Fivetran would not work for your needs but you need the budget. For SFDC replication, budget for $800 USD per month (depending on what objects you need). Hubspot maybe less per month.* Have you dealt with PII masking before landing data in a warehouse? How did you handle it? Fivetran handles this OOTB.* Any experience building or managing SCD Type 2? Not really a function of Fivetran or Airbyte * If you have pulled data from Salesforce or HubSpot, were there any surprises around rate limits or schema changes? We have had no major issues with Fivetran replication of SFDC. However, as mentioned it will not do formula fields.",

This works good enough when users understand that they can ask only things that are relevant to the concrete dataset. Some users trying to ask questions that only, maybe, deus ex machina can answer ever. In general, this function is good for non-experienced users and helps them to build their first reports. For advanced report options it seems a classic UI (report builder) is still more useful and less painful that typing prompts.- Report-specific prompts: when prompt's context is a report data itself (tabular data) and users can ask their own questions to this concrete report. Typical prompts like \"discover insights\" or \"find anomalies\" are available via menu items so this is just a one click and doesn't require any efforts from end users. These predefined prompts may be specific to the concrete dataset or usage of concrete dimensions/measures - for instance, when report uses \"Sales\" values and \"Year\" dimension, admin-configured prompt may compare values according to company's specific analysis.

First off, enjoy the times in your career where things are open because things won't always be this way, but also dont twiddle your thumbs when you have downtime. Go read something or make a POC.",

In the first example he gave he broke out the demographics into a different dimension which had fewer possible values, but created many more rows when in the customer dimension as they changed over time. This reduces the number of rows in customer because there are fewer changes triggering a new row in the Type 2 side and maybe the demographic dimension's requirement only requires the latest value, so you can go with a type 1. Effectively he is just saying, don't just dump everything that's conceptually related in the same dimension, consider performance too and break the dimensions down as necessary.",

For some of the smaller-scale ELT pipelines in our data platform, the final tables are exported to GCS in Parquet format.It’s extremely convenient for downstream analytics; DuckDB can attach directly to the Parquet files, has solid support for partitioned tables, and lets you skip the whole \"import into a db\" step. It also makes reusing the datasets for ML much easier than going through db queries, especially with local prototyping, etc.DuckDB on top of these modern table formats is a really powerful, especially for analytics workflows. I’m always weighing querying BQ directly (from where our data is exported) vs. just reading an exported, e.g., Parquet file. In the end, the final tables already contain all the necessary transformations, so I don’t need the crazy compute capabilities of BQ at that point. The native caching is nice though.",

Your manager isn't necessarily your friend either, if they've been enabling this type of team for a long time now. If they are on your side, then that means they don't have enough weight to pull to fix the team.**So the bad news is** you can't fix a team that doesn't want to be fixed. So go job hunting.**If you don't necessarily want to go job hunting**, then talk to other people, other teams. Not about your team, but about what they want to do and how you can enable them, if you were on their team. If asked, tell people that you see potential to contribute more to the business and that it would give you an opportunity to grow more as an individual as well.**If you can't leave the team**, then the most important thing to do in my opinion is to avoid burning out. That doesn't mean slow down. That means reallocate your time while keeping up the minimum to the team. Burn out is not defined by the amount of work you do. Burn out is defined by setting expectations and failing to meet those expectations. If you define your expectations around the team, like meeting project deadlines, and those deadlines fail to be met, then you will feel burnt out, even if it's not your fault, because you put in effort and failed to receive positive feedback for your efforts.So, set your own expectations, and set them around things that alight with YOU. Go learn some cool stuff. Grab a book about data engineering. Pick up a tool related to what you do like Data Build Tool (DBT). Attend a conference if you can (DBT Coalesce is free online).

On the one hand, if you actually manage to create some kind of long-shot digital transformation and data driven success story, that'd be pretty strong for you... OTOH yeah I think the odds of that succeeding are 0.01% given the factors you describe + your own lack of commitment to actually turning things around (you make it sound hopeless, which makes me think you yourself lack the grit to make a successful pivot happen).If you want to stick around and try, you'll probably need to suck it up and pay out of pocket for some cloud subscriptions, buy your own Mac laptop, etc. The silver lining thing about a company with bad IT practices is -- you have the freedom to just go rogue, and \"probably\" no one will stop you if you intentionally build out your own shadow IT environment. Go sign up for a free Snowflake account ($400 in free credits), go hook it up with your own GitHub, and load up data from SharePoint by just downloading CSV files to your laptop... Yeah that would be all terrible and not best practices, but in this situation, it gives you autonomy and frees you from being blocked by IT. Then, with your rogue shadow IT environment, go BUILD something useful and amazing and revolutionary... You're trying to foment a rebellion here, but for your vision to win, you have to actually demonstrate something meaningfully different and revolutionary that COULD NOT BE ACHIEVED in their legacy stack -- if all you do is say, \"look guys I put our code into git, see this is better now\", then no one will give a shit because that by itself doesn't matter, doesn't change the business. But I don't think you are going to be able to pull it off. So jumping ship seems like it would be better for you, but to be totally honest and blunt, your post gives me a weird vibe of someone trying to \"shortcut\" the career ladder by looking to be opportunistic about what's-best-for-your-brand, instead of someone who's actually sincere about putting in the work, engaging with stakeholders, learning how to dig out of a hole, etc. If you really want to be a director, you're supposed to learn how to overcome adversity, and not just look for the smoothest easiest path to inflate your title as high as you can with as little work or struggle as you can.",

In your pipelines you can build robust expectations, use some of the lesser know math functions (depending on your platform) to identify outliers, some of it just comes to good old fashion domain expertise, and understanding if x, then probably y.As others said though, none of this will fully replace scrolling through table data on ssms, some databricks SQL workspace, whatever.Im a bit curious about the root of the question, because this is literally what data analyst and engineers do. Even with all of the tools in the world, it still involves someone defining the query (SQL, low code, no code, it's all still a query) and analyzing the results. Then, if a problem is found, add it to monitoring or update your expectations.",

It sounds like you're already taking such actions though so consider this reinforcement that you're on the right path.* The others kind of go hand-in-hand with governance and making sure lineage is well documented. There are lots of tools that handle this gracefully, something like dbt could help, but from my experience you need to fix the operational issues. Whether that's permission management like the other commenter noted or just establishing a more collaborative and over-communicative culture, when people being careless is the problem, any tool you choose will only go so far.",

So, there's always a small (nonzero) risk of losing data if the system instantly crashes. Postgres doesn't really have this problem, because it doesn't complete the transaction until the data is safely on disk.Because Mongo just appends to a file, you may have to deal with compaction, which is when old entries get garbage collected (more or less). This isn't a problem if you're always creating new entries, but if you update or delete entries often, compaction can take time.Postgres also has compaction, but it's called vacuum and is done differently.It's supposed to be easier to use partitions/sharding in Mongo. You can distribute your data across multiple clusters.You can partition data in postgres, and that data can be queried in parallel, but I'm not sure if you can actually split partitions across clusters.",

They have Iceberg compatibility which means you get some level of ACID compliance. Delta Lake is for OLAP use cases no matter how you look at it. So if you are sure that your use case is purely OLAP, then you are good to go with Databricks. You will have the same challenge of porting your DynamoDB queries though to Databricks SQL. Postgres is the most compliant SQL database where you can express your queries from very simple to very complex. It's origins is in OLTP but a lot of organizations are using them now for OLAP too. It's now even powering Vector Search use cases for AI workloads. Because of its multi-modal storage, it becomes really flexible in terms of supporting many use cases that requires certain formats - JSON, JSONB, Free Form Text, Binary, etc. You'll have to dig deeper in terms of what those users are doing with your data. That will drive your next architecture.",

Always remember to not bring in any PI data and leave it at source if not needed. It avoids whole lot of hassle and pains later. PI data has to have lots of checks in place from the model level and during DML. I'd create a word document and submit to cyber team on what AD groups, what roles, which tables access to be given to who and fields that needs to be encrypted. Document like that can be used for tracking. RBAC or column level access can be controlled and automated after identifying PI data. We have model versions in Erwin for back tracking, use GitHub PR for approvals. After our PR is approved then we merge feature branch into main branch and merge our modeling Erwin model mart. This ensures both GitHub and Erwin models are in sync.",

Outside of that model, companies value people who:* Can evaluate and stand up *new* tools without hand-holding* Build internal standards/templates so teams adopt tech faster* Translate between tech stacks during migrations* Troubleshoot across systems instead of being blocked by “that’s not my tool”If you stay in consulting, you might want **one anchor skill/tool** on paper (Snowflake, dbt, Spark, etc.) to get past resume filters — doesn’t mean you have to become a one-tool person, just that you have a “flag” to plant for recruiters. A quick certification or portfolio project can fill that gap.If you move to an in-house or smaller shop, lean hard into your **adaptability story**: multiple toolchains, successful migrations, and how your approach saved ramp-up time and reduced vendor lock-in.

I got hired to expand a team but one month in a consultant completely changed everything. Then my technical boss and the consultant were butting heads and a clear plan/path went out the window. I'm pretty sure the consulting firms plan was to get rid of the team and bring in more consultants. They absolutely refused to allow any time to learn new tools and used that as a selling point to bring in consultants. The \"it's impossible to hire a team that can meet the wide needs of specific software we want to implement. Zero time for a learning curve.

Your biggest concern will likely be the LaTeX formatted data.

Your average open-source, python package probably isn’t going to do that, so after extracting the data with any of the tools that other users have pointed to, I would then go over the formulas you extracted with something like the LatexOCR class in the pix2text library to then store the actual reversed LaTeX code, so whatever application you create from your data has the capability of re-rendering the formula in actual LaTeX.",

I won't hide that I've leaned on AI assistance quite a bit, but even with that help, organizing and maintaining a \\~18k line codebase is no joke (medium-sized for Rust but still requires significant architectural planning). There are actually many files I keep locally for personal experimentation that never make it to the repo, which adds another layer of complexity to manage.What really surprised me workflow-wise is how completely I've switched over to using .parquet for everything. The format is just so practical for handling large volumes of textual data with lots of special characters and edge cases that used to give me headaches with CSV. Now I basically run all my data through nail-parquet and keep adding new functions as I bump into new needs.The subcommands I find myself reaching for constantly are `preview`, `drop`, and `select` \\- probably use those three in like 80% of my data exploration sessions. It's funny how having everything in one tool changes your whole approach to data work.Thanks again for taking the time to check it out!",

I used Looker Studio at my previous company (small company and also used AWS RDS just like yours) and it works fine with the MySQL connector but it’s obvious how well integrated the BigQuery connectors are. One way to possibly improve performance on the RDS is to create separate schema for a makeshift data warehouse. Populate this schema once a day using stored procedures from your transactional tables. You can put all the complicated joins and stuff in these stored procedures. Then only connect Looker to this dedicated schema with a simple select * from datawarehouse.cleanTable. That way you’re not relying on Looker to run these complex queries externally which I frequently had problems with.",

You know that if they all have a date field you can load Jan 1st.

Reminder that tech people’s business knowledge isn’t always great.So with revenue center vs cost center. The question becomes do you directly add to top line revenue in any way or do you not. Direct being key. That should answer your question regarding Google.If your job is specifically within the software for a sales team I would argue you as revenue. They couldn’t do their sales jobs as good without you 2 is a hard distinction, almost all cost centers support the revenue business in some way as all companies exist to make money. You wouldn’t have them in the first place if they contributed nothing. I think the way to look at is do you fully support the revenue cycle or do you support everyone. IT desk support can have higher overall job security even being a cost center because a business cannot afford to fire all of them 3, it depends on how much of your time is spent on the chargeable service. Sometimes you can think of it this way. If the business fires your whole team would there be a way they could continue to survive without you be it outsourcing, praying, etc. that question may cause more questions because certain sales guys could be fired in that context. And guess what, sales guys do get fired in hard times, but the top/critical sales guys usually are not. Once a company intentionally negatively impacts revenue they enter a tailspin and they have a finite amount of time to correct5 I can answer this directly. Yes. Unless you are some hyper modern fintech bank. Yes. It is a cost center",

Profit center and cost center are finance terms that mean the “buckets” or hierarchy that you assign dollars to.So if the company gets a check for $100k they need to assign it to a profit center so that they can do financial reporting. Same thing with your salary, or an AWS bill, they need to go to a cost center.Finance people/executives understand that you literally can’t run a company without cost centers. Even if you were a one person remote consulting firm you’d have your salary cost. What they will do though is cut cost centers more aggressively than profit centers.So what the saying is trying to say is “be on the team who’s work directly causes cash to come into the business” which, unfortunately, data engineering teams almost never bring money directly into the business.It also doesn’t mean that positions in cost centers are inherently dangerous. It’s more that if given the choice it’s (usually) safer to work in a profit center. I’d argue that working in a profit center comes with its own problems though.",

You should be able to justify your expenses in terms of added business value (\"yes Mr. CEO, my expenses did increase by 300k year over year, but the new system integrations are estimated to increase bottom line profits by over 1 million per year\"). A data engineering profit center should be churning out valuable data pipelines, minimizing time to market, working closely with stakeholders, etc. Or you can have the worst of both worlds where you have the expectations of a profit center (build things fast, enable the business, etc) but then get treated as a cost center when budget allocations come around. Profit centers are more fun to work for, but they are also going to be more demanding. Cost centers are usually stable employment, but with outsourcing, it is much less so.",

Profit = income - cost. You can break costs down to things like operating expenses and taxes if you feel fancy. If the business unit you work in brings in more money than it costs, you are a profit centre. There are no second order effects. When the business wants to lay people off to improve the numbers for a quarter, those business units will be amongst the last people they lay off. If your business unit has a red number next to it in the monthly P&L meeting, that will be the first thing to go unless it’s deemed essential. You’re absolutely right that the real picture is far more nuanced, and many essential teams are cost centres- accounts, IT, facilities, and usually. the executives themselves. If your work has no price tag, it has no value in MBA math. To reiterate, essential things are still costs. Buildings, utilities, salaries, so on. But the business will generally look to keep costs low.to use your example, the IT department is like rent- it’s an unavoidable necessity. The trick as a cost center is to make sure your work gets properly credited to you, often through internal billing, sometimes via other KPIs and metrics. And there is still very much the risk that the ‘true’ profit centres complain that you’re a cost to *them*, bringing their numbers down come bonus time.",

People here are confusing an accounting system concept for some sort of philosophical judgement.One transaction can hit both a profit center and a cost center at the same, too!! In fact, many do.Profit centers are used to categorize the products or services that a company sells. By using profit centers, when examining a business you could say one division is more profitable than another division, etc.You might try to say oh well Jeff is responsible for increasing profit through his role, but that’s an indirect thing. Jeff has to be paid a salary and the accounting line for that gets assigned to a cost center. Jeff probably isn’t a product, though I guess you can stretch this to say it’s possible when talking about a person who is a model, or stripper, or something like that haha. Then they are what’s being sold. But so long as Jeff is something like a sales manager a logistics director, he’s not the product. It’s not that he doesn’t matter, but on the books, he doesn’t get to directly be tagged like a product. Now, his work is more directly involved in transactions that do get tagged with profit centers, though, than someone who is, say, in human resources. Transactions for inventory changes of physical consumer goods often end up getting tagged to both a profit center and a cost center. The profit center is just related to what the good is. But the cost center is usually location based. Factory A and Factory B are different cost centers. This becomes important because other costs are posted to each factory and can differ, like labor costs and electricity and rent. So when doing financial analysis we can say that one product, while worth the same end sale price, might cost differently when produced in different factories.",

For any kind of ethical webscraping you want to never in the slightest overload the existing infrastructure. That means for a large news site you could easily target 1-2/sec. but not for e.g. a personal blog. This would put you at 100-200K requests/day which would not cover your needs if it’s a single news site, but could be fine if it’s multiple that can run in parallel. As for the actual scraping, of course the site will try and prevent scraping or overloading of their infrastructure, so try these things (somewhat in order)- fetch and save just the html of the url with curl, curl_cffi, httpx or similar. This could work fine if you stay under any rate limits. You can then extract the text from the html later on. - adjust your user agent and cookies, for example by copying the request headers from an actual browser session- Try and figure out if they have a front-end API that serves one or multiple articles at the same time. This could make it easier to get the correct text and stay under rate limits. - Use an automated browser like playwright - Use an automated browser and hide any features that give away that it’s automated (e.g. puppeteer stealth)- If you hit any rate limits, use a service that provides residential proxies and use any of the above",

        "body": "Sorry, contract with employer doesn't allow me to, and she sql produced is snowflake-specific (uses as-of joins) I can describe the steps of the algo, though. you start with a collection of events. To make examples simpler we will assume you only have one entity that produces the events, and all rows (events) represent states of that one entity. If the terminology is confusing, just think that event can be pressing a lever to open a door, and the door being open or cloded is a state. let's say event a (little a) causes state A (big a) to begin. If the entity (e.g. door) already was in state A, then it continues to be in that state. Event b causes state B, etc. For further simplification, we will count time in integer numbers 1,2,5,...,8,12,... . In reality time is usually a date, or timestamp, but anything that is orderable can be used here. So assuming our times and events look like this: \\`\\`\\` 1, a 3, a 4, b 5, b 7, a 9, c \\`\\`\\` We have contiguous repetitions of events a and b, and we have non-contiguous repetition of a (at time 7) What we want to get is a table representing the states and their durations state, start-time, end-time \\`\\`\\` A, 1, 4 B, 4, 7 A, 7, 9 C, 9, Null \\`\\`\\` We kept the non-contiguous repetitions, but ignored the contiguous ones.This is close to our real end-result, so how can we get from there to here?First find all consecutive pairs. More formally - pair each row with the row that has smallest time which is still bigger than this row's time. This can be done with a self-join (or two), join + window functions or as-of join.Get rid of all result rows, where the event is the same, we only want transitions.We'll call this data set Transitions. \\`\\`\\` 3, a, 4, b 5, b, 7, a 7, a, 9, c \\`\\`\\`From transitions we can take the earlier time + event in a separate CTE - these will be our state endings.Yes, endings, even though we thought of them as the earlier ones. Since we listed state transitions - then it follows that the last event representing some state will happen BEFORE the first event in the next state.Also, from transitions, we take the later time + event and call them Beginnings, due to the same reasoning.Eagle eyed reader will have noticed that we are missing the first event of the first state. We should add that to Beginnings (e.g. with a union all)Now that we have beginning and endings of each state we join each beginning with the next consecutive ending (again, smallest time, that is larger / later than that if a particular beginning)the time of beginning is the island start time, time of ending is the island end time. the state, that corresponds to the beginning event is the state of the island.Of course that was a simplified example. In reality, the state is an ensemble of various fields, but these can be hashed into one, or compared one to one.Usually we also deal with more than one entity (think many doors and their corresponding levers), but to accommodate that, you just group your CTEs by the columns that constitute the entity identifier.",

Assumptions: * Moderately complex source system for general primary care (i.e., not hospital)* Source is consistent across the 20-locations, at least in terms of major schema/versions* Source provides high quality API or SQL end points* Your organisation is 100-500 people and/or growing quickly* Report requirements not limited to billing, but some degree of clinical outcomes, research and organisation operations (KPIs, govt compliance, insurance/regulatory, non-clinical depts)* You are not interested in building an internal BI or Data team in the next 3-5 years, so need a fully managed end-to-end solution (allowing super users / ad hoc analysts to benefit from DWH as req).* Minimal custom requirements such as Power BI automated paginated report public distribution or embedded reports.",

This person should not be a bidder in the design/construction. You then use then them to review possible solution providers (contractors) and help you find one that makes economic sense and meets your other criteria.Based on what you wrote, you can toss out the first 2-3 options (nothing is getting done properly for less than $100k (and it may be a lot more given HIPPA and data security/privacy). All you have to do is consider that an average contractor is at least $120/hr times 3 contractors = $54,000 per month (and resources will likely be more expensive unless you go off-shore).We just had a 3rd party consulting company build a data mart and PBI from scratch for a team.

My biggest piece of advice would be that trust and reputation are everything. There are millions of ways to put these systems together, lots of them are unnecessarily expensive. Your first offer is reasonable if not for the time frame. 3 weeks is enough to put The software together, but it's likely not enough time to understand how your business operates, how you calculate your metrics and what your users are actually doing with the data. 500k is a joke, you could hire a senior developer for 5 years for that rate and just have them build the system in 6 months. For your situation, I'd not pay over $100k. But a realistic ballpark, 20k to 50K if you get somebody really good and it's going to take a month or two including testing. This would generally lack deep support. I would tack on $1,000 a month if you need ongoing support or development work at your scale. So far I've done two of these implementations. One of them has taken 3 months, but that data is very messy, simply put. Working on another one that's rather clean and it's going to take 3 weeks just for a proof of concept.",

For hands-on learning, practice with real scenarios on platforms like LeetCode's database problems, study case studies from companies like Netflix and Uber about their data architecture decisions, and get familiar with both OLTP and OLAP system design patterns. The key is understanding not just how these systems work, but when and why you'd choose one approach over another.The reality is that interviewers will throw curveball questions about specific trade-offs between consistency and availability, or ask you to design a system that handles both real-time and batch processing. They want to see you think through problems like choosing between row-based and columnar storage, or explaining why you'd use a particular indexing strategy for a given query pattern. These conversations can get technical fast, and having real examples from your experience combined with solid theoretical knowledge makes all the difference. I'm on the team that built [interview copilot](http://interviews.chat) because these database design questions can make or break data engineering interviews - having a tool to help you navigate the technical depth and articulate your reasoning clearly can be a game changer when you're in the hot seat.",

First, don't throw LLMs at everything despite what the vendors say. Like don't write a data process with the goal to incorporate AI when there is an algorithmic alternative that costs much less to run. They might not like that you are not using an LLM, but it's easy to show why the LLM is a bad idea.Second, focus on cases where the user can validate the output and iterate with the LLM. The one I am trying to avoid until AI gets more reliable is cases where you need a deterministic output. So text to SQL, customer facing applications, etc. Thinks that work are things like document lookup with links to the original documents so that the user can verify the information. Also just applications with RAG to bring company knowledge into the conversation with the LLM.We are seeing success with stuff like software development tools and document-based knowledge bases. AI integrated with tools has been helpful as well depending on how well the vendor did with the AI implementation.",

You're correct that Synapse is no longer seeing significant feature development; we do continue to ship security fixes, bug fixes, et cetera. I personally reviewed a few Synapse specific PRs this week, actually :D. And it's still Generally Available with no deprecation date set. And I wholeheartedly would agree new development should go to Fabric instead.I also think most customers of Synapse would benefit from migrating to Fabric when they feel ready to do so; it has many major improvements, both to performance and to the architecture. One of the big ones is that Fabric Warehouse uses Parquet as it's on disk format accessible in OneLake - no more \"best performance or least duplication\" tradeoff.Why wouldn't I blame Fabric for Synapse not seeing much feature development?Well, designs of Synapse Dedicated and Synapse Serverless respectively had limitations that weren't practical to address without a major rearchitecting under the hood. Synapse Dedicated, for example, is the result of over a decade of incremental improvements that did not change its fundamental architecture (APS/PDW was released in 2012); we basically took it as far as it could go. So we had to do some fairly major rearchitecting to make something fundamentally better than that; the result is Fabric. Could we have called it Synapse v2 or something? Maybe. But it still would have been a migration to move to it, so I'm not sure that would have been any better. And marketing isn't my area :D. If you have questions on migrating to Fabric, or on Synapse, you can find me and many other folks who work on both Fabric and Synapse in r/MicrosoftFabric or lurking here.Or just tag me or message me, though there's no Service Level Agreement for my response times on Reddit :P",

You can use Airflow's lineage backend to emit events that OpenMetadata consumes. Much more reliable than pulling.Alternative approach:If you're already capturing lineage in your warehouse (via dbt artifacts or query logs), you can sync that directly to OpenMetadata's API. We do this with Stacksync for clients who want real-time lineage without touching their production orchestration.The key is treating metadata as a first-class data product, not an afterthought.

Not sure about Athena and the like, but databases like Snowflake support column level security through things like projection policies, which hide columns which users should not have access to entirely. As far as stacking DBT on top of this, although I haven't tested it, you can probably write queries similar to this:```sqlselect colA, colB, colC, * exclude (colA, colB, colC) -- Include additional columns if you have access to those columns.from {{ ref('my_model') }}```Alternatively, you can dynamically query what columns are available using DBT's `adapter.get_columns_in_relation`:```sql{% set columns = adapter.get_columns_in_relation(ref('my_model')) -%}select colA, colB, colC, {% for column in columns -%} {{ column.name }} {{- ',' if not loop.last }} {% endif -%}from {{ ref('my_model') }}```",

You’ll need to store a reference to the max(timestamp) from BOTH tables in the destination, so you can easily select only new records from both.In case when you run you queries and a record for one table is not available you’ll need to set a field that identify that the records is incomplete. Create a Boolean for this.Then in your downstream query you select from both sources where the timestamp is higher than the max one you store in downstream table + reload any incomplete records which exist. At some point you’ll get both tables and you can set the Boolean to true.The merge statement will handle the refresh.If possible don’t just put the UUID as the key in your upset statement put some timestamp or sequential columns so you can prune records and not lookup the entire table.Goodluck",

If the database doesn't scale and your queries become complex and frequent, you might crash an operational system. Similar concerns exist for change management: if your analysis depends on the internal workings of that database, they will very easily introduce breaking changes. The API serves as a contract to stabilise the interface in both scenarios. If you want an odbc connection, the operational system should at least provide you with the views that form the contract so their changes won't break your system.MCP would just layer on top of the view or the API.

I should probably delete my account right after this post so I'll try to make this last one count.When I encounter a hard problem, I can't take it. People don't want to do hard things and the brain gets wired to equate ***difficulty*** as something 'bad' so they reach for their phone to entertain themselves. We have an entire generation of people with weak self-control because they're addicted to being entertained and doing the easy thing as a **way of life**.I'm not getting high and mighty like I'm better than everyone. This is something I see in myself daily as I grind through hours of difficult material.every day I study I meet the following criteria:* 7 hours of sleep at least. ( focus / self control diminishes if I go any less )* I have coffee* I sit in my chair in my room and there is NOTHING in my field of view to distract me. If my butt is in the chair I am here to work. Anything else I want to do in my life is free to do, but NOT in this chair. It's just like a bed: it's for sleep and sex; if I want to scroll on my phone I can do it on the couch or watch tv.* I put a focus track for 30 minutes from [brain.fm](http://brain.fm) ( they have freebies on youtube ) and I just get through 30 minutes. After that I mark one tally on my whiteboard, take a walk outside for 5 minutes, then come back.Rinse and repeat, with the intent to do 5 hours that day. Maybe more, maybe less, but that's what I shoot for.You have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. You can train your mind to not freak out and rush for the digital equivalent of a candy bar but it takes training. That training requires an environment, routine, and a schedule.... and plugins to prevent going on youtube and reddit... if the temptation is there you will go for it, again and again.anyway, good luck.",

If you can’t focus because you don’t know what is going on use structured tutorials like boots.dev or TechwithTim (good course on python with projects) to get your foundations and do not move on to the next lesson until you absolutely understand everything, use AI like a tutor to explain to you.

Then there's binary trees ( which are really just linked lists with each node having 1 or 2 nodes ) and the same problem of trying to reason about what is actually happening at any point point.i found in particular that index cards were wonderful for this. lines on one side for writing out code, and a blank side for drawing out the data structure. most of the algorithms fit into the 13-15 lines but what I find most helpful is that I don't feel bad about tossing them.after a pile of them grew by my tv I really started getting it. I haven't done DSA in a long time but once I get back to it I'll employ the same method.I still struggle with novel problems though. Sometimes the problems are SO weird that its harder to figure out what the problem is asking than implementing the solution.",

The greatest skill of any good computer scientist is problem solving.For example, say I want to make a basic, terminal-based tic-tac-toe game in python.I start working on the board, make a list to hold to values and a way for the player to input their choice, etc. Now, I want the computer to randomly pick an empty spot for their turn, but I don't know how to randomize stuff.Then I would search \"How do I generate random numbers in python\", and I would find that I have to import the \"random\" library and use the \"randint\" function from it.Of course, I would recommend looking at documentation of libraries before using them, so you know all the things you can do with each function and how they work.Then, I would consider how I would implement this function. For a basic game, I would just have it pick a random index in the board list until it finds an empty one, and have the computer choose that spot.Rinse and repeat. Try to solve a problem, if you run into an issue, look for solutions (not answers).This is the best way to learn as a beginner.",

I asked the receptionist nicely and she went and grabbed a spare for me. When I got back to the office, I got to hear the management telling my boss that the keys were numbered and it simply wasn't possible to give me a key. As I triumphantly held up the key, my boss told them that their system had failed and hung up. The next week I baked a batch of cookies in the morning and dropped them off for the office next door. Soft skills makes things smoother. People look out for you and you can sometimes get a small job squeaked through even though everything is booked.But you have to remember that everything goes both ways. You have to express your appreciation and bribery when people bend over backwards to help you out. Fresh bread, cookies, a box of live crickets delivered to the office, whatever will spark joy in the person who helped you. Hell, mail them a physical card saying thank you.",

Back when we were starting, you could just have the basic skills with almost no qualifications and stumble into a job. Also, startups aside, there used to be a lot more job security in general at the bigger corporations, but that doesn't seem to be the current climate.Regarding AI, I'm not saying it's gonna replace us all, but it's certainly causing a kind of mass hysteria/industry transformation/paradigm shift, and I don't know whether that will ultimately be for better or worse, I'm betting on worse. My personal thing is that I got into this career because I love to code and debug, but I never enjoyed all the other stuff, from design to meetings to bureaucracy to operations. Well with AI, the coding aspect is kind of ruined in my opinion, like being a good coder gives you very little edge, and on the job the coding will become more and more prompt engineering stuff which is just whatever, and the job will reduce down to just the other aspects.",

But once you actually get what problem SQL is trying to solve, how to databases generally work, and what are the general things you do with SQL like joins, aggregations, etc. then it becomes much more intuitive.I highly recommend looking at [https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2025/](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2025/) \\- it goes way more in depth than what any beginner needs but even if you do just the very first lecture and homework that already makes you more competent than most",

The port is dictating that you can plug any usb cable/device into it and \"something\" happens, at a minimum the device could probably charge. Well the port remains fixed, but the device you plug in could change, it could be a phone, a watch, a controller, a keyboard, etc. Or another analogy is a car, you could probably swap out the engine or the muffler or something, Idk I'm not an expert, but basically you still have a car, it still is this big carriage that can transport itself.In your OOP program, you could for example have an object which is a component that can be responsible for interacting with a database, for example. Let's call it the DBManager. Now, normally your app logic would say \"hey, DBManager, get me the account info for user x\" or something. So that would work as expected, but now you could also for instance write a unit test that says \"ok the app will handle a request, and it will go to the DBManager, but instead we're gonna plug in a fake DBManager which just serves up some canned response, it doesn't have to query a real database\". We just swap out the components in the test only, without having to hack up all the code, and we are able to test our app logic without dealing with the database specifically.This, to me, is the essence of the types of problems OOP is aiming to solve. I glossed over some details for sure, but this idea helped it click for me when I was earlier on in my journey.",

For example, in the context of back end web dev you've used Express to specify a chain of handlers/behaviour that each request will pass through at runtime (using .use(), .get(), .post() for config etc.). One way you could build this (I haven't looked at the Express implementation) is using OOP and the Builder pattern. You could store the chain of behaviour as state on an object, e.g. an array of objects containing callback functions and metadata or similar, and use Builder to repeatedly add to that state at runtime. The mutations happen through those methods mentioned above. Once all the top-level calls have finished, Express has an object that can be given a request to process, and some code associated with the object can dispatch the correct series of calls based on conditional logic over the received request.It contrasts with viewing code and data separately like in other paradigms. Ultimately it's just a way to organise data and code in a program.Maybe looking at the GoF design patterns will give you ideas about how OOP is applied to problems commonly faced building software.

        "body": "It is a course at Harvard, but I've taught C as well (not recently). Pointers are one of those concepts that some people struggle with a lot. You may want to slow down, and not go at the pace the courses suggests (something like 8 weeks). You can spend a few weeks per \"week\" of the class.The difficulty, of course, depends on the person. Those that have a more mathematical mindset tend to do better at programming though it's not a requirement. CS50x projects do use some math which makes it challenging on top of the programming.To explain further, you might be a good speechwriter. You can tell a story of your summer vacation and make it interesting. You have a strong vocabulary and use sophisticated words. This shows a mastery of the English language. But if you were asked to give a talk about calculus and derivatives (let's assume you know very little), it would be much harder to give a speech because you lack domain knowledge, meaning you don't know much about the subject you're talking about (in this case, math). That doesn't mean you can't speak English. You can. It's the topic that makes it challenging.That can happen in programming too. You are asked to write a program that requires math. Maybe you know how to write loops and use arrays, but the math part is the difficulty. If you were asked to write a program to do a Monte Carlo simulation or do simulated annealing, you might struggle even if you know programming.Some would say \"I don't know how to program\", but they might know how to program (just like you can give a speech in English), but not know the math so you don't know how to implement it.TLDR: Yeah, people struggle with pointers. CS50x is even more challenging because the programming assignments (called *problem sets*) have more math than usual.",

The third of those eventually migrated to C#, and for a while there was a component built in Microsoft Silverlight. The whole thing was source controlled in Rational Clear Case, but for some reason I don’t recall we couldn’t run it on the Linux boxes where we built that part of the product. (Young folks: Silverlight was an unsuccessful competitor to Macromedia / Adobe Flash. At the time I was working on it, VB6 was already ancient. ClearCase is what big companies used before git.)To tie all this random crap together, I wrote a Ruby script that applied labels, downloaded snapshots of the code, then either pushed the code to a Linux box to be built there, or built it locally on the server. It was an insane, janky, Rube Goldberg setup. And to drive it all, I wrote a DSL in Ruby to tell it what I wanted it to build. As horrible as the whole thing was in retrospect, the DSL was incredibly easy to understand. Nobody working on the project would have any difficulty understanding what it did, even if they didn’t know precisely how it was doing it. I could have made that whole thing just take a JSON file, but it would probably have been just a little more confusing for users. Also, at the time, JSON was only three years old. Holy shit I feel ancient.",

Naturally, you do need the experience to know what is insignificant and what shouldn't be left to AI. Quick little sanity checks (e.g. is this thread safe, link the docs, does this database driver support X, .etc) when you're tired are also nice.it is not a 10x increase unless you're a beginner who struggles with many concepts and having them written out for you saves you a lot of time.",

In no circumstance would I have read through all my documentation to spot issues this way, because it would take at least a whole day.Then I asked it to improve test coverage, it ran the test coverage tools and unit tests, after about 10 minutes it had suggested another batch of changes that took me 5-10 minutes to review. I brought my test coverage up from 87 to 96%.I then asked it to check that terminology is consistent between my function documentation. Asked it to organise my unit tests into logically related blocks, asked it to write descriptions for unit tests into a particular way. Essentially I have a lot of tasks that I would need to spend a few hours on, that AI can do for me in a few minutes, and I can check in 5-10 minutes.

I can read the code and understand what it's doing but if I did it myself I would need to look up the syntax.You know, it actually feels like the AI is a scribe and more an accessibility feature for someone that doesn't have hands or something.When I first used AI to code I was much less experienced with programming and I would trust it much more. I would give it broader statements about what I wanted and trust the code it produced. That would lead to bugs I couldn't fix and code I didn't understand.

Create tight feedback loops. Run your code often.2. When experimenting or debugging, create hypothesis and then systematically test them3. Write more documentation, learn to tell the difference between good documentation and bad documentation.To create tight feedback loops, you need to have a very short time between when you've written a bit of code, and find out if it's working or not. There are a lot of good strategies for this, and you can mix and match them according to your needs. A few I like are: Static types, tell you a lot of information about your program's correctness at compile time. REPL driven development, run snippets of code in a REPL to get immediate feedback on whether they're working as you're developing more complex systems. Good testing practices, writing tests as you work let you run the test suite as a very good way to get fast feedback on your code. When coding, I start to get nervous if I've gone more than a few minutes without running some of the code I'm writing.For creating hypothesis, I see way too many new developers just randomly change things whenever they get stuck. If you can't clearly communicate why you think the change will fix a problem, or what the expected result of a change is, that's a sign you need to take a step back and do some thinking / learning. It takes discipline, but forming explicit hypotheses and then testing them drives you to actually understand the how and why of your code.Writing good documentation doesn't mean just adding comments to your code, but thinking about how other users of your functions / classes / projects will use them, and giving them all the necessary information to be successful. This means beginner guides, project overviews, as well as function / class level documentation. Writing good docs makes you really think about your API design and software usability on a new level.",

You want the code to become concrete applications/servers/… that your public can use (website visitors, mobile application users, other companies,…).The devops job is made so that the work produced by devs can be made concrete.A code always needs resources (like a server, a domain name, CDNs,… there are many kinds of resources), informations (like username/passwords, ip addresses, urls, …), and we generally setup different processes to fill some needs.Like, for instance, the pipelines you mentioned, are like pipes in a way. Once code (for short) goes in a specific pipeline, it ends up to the desired location. A pipeline could be created to provide new versions to a test environment, or to a beta version, or to prod. There is no fixed recipe but its frequent to see test/staging/beta/production.The role of the devops is to try and automatise that. So, for instance, when devs deliver a new version of the code, the magic behind happens and the cogs spin until the new version of the application is delivered to the clients.The job is highly technical and highly complex. Depending on the needs, the team can require high technical expertises in multiple different domains (security, kubernetes/dockers, azure/aws/… cloud vendors, …). It can be as simple as being a \"clickops\" (the devops guy goes on a cloud vendor like azure or aws website and clicks/fills forms manually) up to a more fully automated process (also possible with cloud vendors, terraform,…).So, if you wanted to learn visually something about how your devops team functions, you gotta be more precise.But I think management 101 would tell you to learn directly from your team, if good communication is possible.",

It helps eliminate a lot of bugs and apart from a little bit of extra work getting started there are very few reasons ever to write JS directly when you can use TS instead. In fact, JS should probably only ever be used by anybody if and when they have a compelling reason why they can't use TS instead.Learning TS will also teach you JS; all you need to learn there are which TS bits are \"extra\".The one thing JS has over TS is the way you can just plug a tiny snippet into a webpage and have it do something. That's probably helpful for beginners on day 1, but by the end of a week they'd have been better off starting with TS.",

Stores the salt as part of the final hash string (bcrypt hashes are structured strings with version info, cost factor, salt, and hash all together).When you call bcrypt.compare(password, storedHash):1. It reads the salt from storedHash.2. Repeats the hashing process with that exact salt and the password you just entered.3.

Maybe when work finally slows down a bit.Here’s a few pointers:The biggest thing is you need to pick a project and use it for a while. Meaning you understand how it actually works. You can’t contribute meaningfully to something you have never used.After using it for a bit, start looking through the codebase. Get a feel for the main language and all the supporting technologies (frameworks, libraries, build system, etc). If you’re new expect this to take a few weeks. Then download the project and try to get it running locally. Make a tiny change (change a text) and see if you can get it to show up.Then try setting a debug point. Now go and trace a specific feature and see how it works.If you want a cheat sheet look at recent PRs that got merged and see what changes were required. Lastly pick a smaller project rather than a huge one. It will make all of the above steps much easier.",

Probably the best way to do it is to read the docs (if they exist), then copy and paste everything you see that is of relevance into an AI chat, which will take time and you will have to worry about context awareness. But, once that is done, ask the AI to explain the concepts that dont make sense. Then go through old PRs to make sense of what work has been done before you came along and tried to contribute, and when that is all over, just take on a ticket and start working through it. Each step sounds awful, because it lowkey is, that is the pain of dev onboarding. You also will need to be patient with yourself in the beginning as you try to figure out where to even make code changes given an issue to resolve and how to actually resolve it properly without over engineering.Good luck, though, working on intense projects helped me get a job at amazon, so hopefully it helps you out with ur financial goals too.",

Sometimes you can gain the domain knowledge simply by being a user of the software, but other times you will have to do research and/or read documentation. A personal anecdote is that I recently fixed a bug on Ffmpeg without being very knowledgeable about media encoding but only because I encountered the bug while using the software, so I knew what the issue and expected outcome was, and since it was a simple fix in an isolated portion of the code I didn’t have to be an expert on the code base.

See how people raise issues, how they get assigned, what a PR looks like, how the discussion looks and what PRs are getting approved. 2. Create your own small project and structure it the same way. Add basic tests, use basic GitHub actions, create a CONTRIBUTING.md. Then create an issue, assign it to yourself. Complete the issue and submit a PR like it's someone else's project. 3. Review your own PR like you're a maintainer and approve it when it looks good. At this point you at least understand the process of contributing to open source, now it's about finding issues you can actually handle.4. Find a small project that has some good first issue tags. Usually this is someone just trying to do what I outlined above for themself. The codebase and issue should be simple. Work on getting assigned some easy issues and getting your PRs merged. 5. Then just repeat with slightly larger and more complex tasks as you feel more and more comfortable. When learning to swim you wouldn't jump into the middle of the ocean, so don't do it with open source. Start in the shallow end and build up your confidence and skills slowly. I don't think this is a quick way to make money however. It's a long game. If all you need is money id look into trying to teach coding to beginners or have a completely seperate side job. You'll get more ROI on your time in the short term through those channels. I know you said you won't consider it because of your schedule, but it'll be a more efficient use of your time and help you develop your soft skills.",

Big corporations in the US, Germany, Japan, etc. may indeed have strict degree requirements for SWE roles, especially entry-level. Highly competitive graduate schemes and certain government and defense jobs do require accredited degrees. In these contexts, projects and open-source contributions can help, but HR filters simply will block applications without formal education.In contrast, startups, scale-ups and smaller companies often prioritize skills, portfolio projects and interview performance over formal credentials.Many US tech companies (see Google, IBM, Apple) do have officially dropped strict degree requirements, though competition means degrees still give an advantage. Also countries with high demand for developers will sometimes hire based on bootcamp training or self-taught experience.If you look globally, there’s a shift toward skills-based hiring in tech. Portfolios, GitHub contributions and competitive programming results (from LeetCode, HackerRank) can open doors. Networking and referrals indeed do often bypass degree filters.Without a degree, you will need a strong portfolio, relevant certifications, and networking to compete. In markets with “degree fever” (as one commenter called it), getting past automated HR filters is harder. In more flexible markets, you can get hired without a degree, with proof of skills and good interview performance.But even with a degree and relevant certifications, you will still have to prove that you have been able to apply the knowledge and expertise you acquired, combined with quantifying the use and profit your work has. Nobody will give you a high paying job just for waving with degrees and certain alone. Amassing a ton of certs without any real work done and lacking a strong focus will also do the opposite, making you look like a “qualifications hoarder”.",

I would start big projects and stop because it almost felt like a chore even though CS is my passion, the reason was because they were simply too big of a project for my own head. So what did I do? I broke the big projects down into manageable components and started building each component one by one. I treated each component as its own project and it was much more manageable that way to finish them and enjoy building something. For example, ive been developing a game engine for the past couple of years so i split it into multiple components. Currently i built a serialization framework, and ECS, a Functional library to help with my style of coding and a many more. Though when i was coding I never thought about the end goal (game engine) i thought about the best possible code i could write for this specific component.",

Each of your 4 sections has a very different width, it just looks off-putting. Make some kind of a wrapper and make sure all sections fit and take up as much space in it.

Responsiveness doesnt just mean that nothing breaks and overflows, it needs to be proportional and usable on all devices- As cool as the nav is, it suffers from poor UX, because its highly unclear what it is, and once you click on it to figure out, at that point you dont even need it. One thing that came to my mind is putting it vertical on the left side for example. That way you can show the section names on hover, and keep your original design. - Same UX applies to your technologies. Always write in words what the technologies are. This helps searchability and makes it clear for people who do not know what a whale with boxes on it or an elephant mean.- 2/3 of your listed projets require login (or something adjacent), no one is gonna do it. Either make sure these projects have a landing page, preview, or anything else. Or make a showcase with pictures and videos in your portfolio - For some reason the whole website feels cheap, i cannot quite explain why objectively. I think its the look and the color scheme of the stars in the background. But could also be the overal color scheme and font- Last but not least, i would put maybe a little bit more information about yourself and in general, its kinda emptyAnd one note, whatever the SEO situation is, you probably don't need seo at all for a personal portolio. No one who you didn't already send your portfolio website is gonna look you up on google and search for it.This is all constructive criticism. Hope the post doesnt turn into a [deleted] and you actually make some improvements and update us. Good luck!",

Now its a mix of udemy, YT, documentation, building stuff, and recently AI.You can try the following:Learn HTML and get comfy building static single page websites. Use the official documentation, W3 schools and MDN Docs to find what you need. You can watch web dev simplified or other tutorials if you need. Theres alot of content so dont get stuck looking for the best. Just find something and start then you can look for better when yiu can identify issues. Html is pretty easy so it shouldn't take too long. Dont worry about mastering it. Just be comfortable with it.Apply the same to CSS, also learn how websites work, i.e. If you google W3 schools... So what happens for you to be able to see the site (http requests, servers). Again juat a working understanding, you dont need to do a phd in this. When you can build and style a site with relative comfort. Dip into Javascript (no frameworks yet), learn the syntax, data types, primary and secondary data types, loops, if statements, JS objects. After that then start going into frameworks. I learnt Jquery, node, express and EJS, as part of my udemy course and im currently building a CRUD app (create, read, update, delete) with this. From here I'm going to learn about APIs, SQL, React, And finish my python course that i set aside initially. Dont just watch videos and tutorials. Code along. Code by youreself. When you get stuck and search and try to figure out and understand whats going wrong is when you will make tons of progress. My recommendation wrt AI. Dont use it initially. Try to get to a point where you know the basics, that way you can ask it smarter questions and you will know when it says something sketchy or something you dont understand, that way you can interrogate it better. You can also explicitly tell it to not give you code but 'go socrates mode' . It will ask YOU questions that you have to go and research. I use AI in a collaborative manner where it acts in a mentorship role to guide me to the info i need to put stuff together. I did this so i dont become reliant on it. At the end if the day, just start with the basics, build something, learn intermediate topics, build intermediate stuff, learn advanced topics, build advanced stuff. Itll take time. Ive been learning by myself since Jan. I just simply don't have money to go back to varsity so im reliant on my courses i bought when i still had money, free online content and my ability to read and understand documentation.",

I try to replicate the final project but with very small personal changes.

It seems so obvious and aligns with so much advice but I was resistant to taking my time. I would constantly be trying to find the faster and better way to learn. It turns out, taking your time, reading the material, and accepting that learning is a slow process was the trick.",

A lot of your comments are completely unnecessary, and gives absolutely no extra information. Such as the x != y, followed by \"#chedks that x != y\", as you pretty much have in one of your examples. This comment is useless, as is does not add anything of value what so ever, it's just clutter. Comments can be ok if it states the why, if that is not clear and obvious from the context. If the comments are on your own code, and you are the only one reading it, it does not matter so much, but it could be a good idea to focus on writing code that is easy enough to read that you don't need to write so many comments. One thing is that the comments can get in the way, make clutter, and actually make it more tedious to read. Another thing is that if you change the code, you also have to change around the comments, and that creates extra work, and could cause problems if you forget to update a comment, and it no longer matches your code.",

In fact they're probably a good idea!When you start to work with other people, the rule is \"Good code is self-documenting,\" meaning it should be obvious what the code does without needing explanatory comments.Use variable names, data structures and encapsulation to minimise the amount of thinking that a reader has to do. For example, I'd refactor your code to make `Card` a class:```class Card: def __init__(self, cardString): self.name = self._getName(cardString[0]) self.value = self._getValue(cardString[0]) self.suit = self._getSuit(cardString[1]) def _getName(self, cardFirstCharacter): if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards: return v.faceCards[cardFirstCharacter] elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A': return 'Ace' else: return cardFirstCharacter def _getValue(self, cardFirstCharacter): if cardFirstCharacter in v.faceCards: return 10 elif cardFirstCharacter.upper() == 'A': return 11 else: return int(cardFirstCharacter) def _getSuit(self, cardSecondCharacter): suits = [\"Hearts\", \"Diamonds\", \"Clubs\", \"Spades\"] return next((suit for suit in suits if suit[0] == cardSecondCharacter), None)```Then `hit()` becomes easy:```def hit(): drawnCard = drawCard() v.cardIdens.append(drawnCard) card = Card(drawnCard) return card.name, card.value```**Variable names** - `drawnCard` and `cardString` are the exact same thing, given different names in different contexts. The `Card` class doesn't need to care that a `cardString` was just drawn from `drawCard()`. Similarly, `cardString[0]` might look a bit mad, but when we pass it to a method we rename it to `cardFirstCharacter` in the method, which clearly tells you what it is.**Data structures** - I'm really bad at this to be honest. I'm a JavaScript dev, and JavaScript only has arrays (lists) and objects (dicts), so I tend to think only in arrays and objects for any problem.**Encapsulation** - `hit()` doesn't need to know or care how a card's value is calculated, because that implementation is _encapsulated_ in the `Card` class. If `Card` is assumed to work fine (because we also wrote tests!) then a developer debugging `hit()` can ignore it. Similarly, `Card._getSuit` contains some _really_ funky code, it's borderline unreadable. But if we only care how a card gets its name and value, we don't have to read any of the funky code that gets the suit.",

        "body": "Yeah, we would not do this. Your issue is that your code isn't yet structured like someone with more experience would structure it, so you need more comments explaining what it does instead of documenting why it does what it does.All that code in `hit()` doesn't belong there. A \"card\" - whatever that is in your game, should know it's value already when it's drawn. The value calculation bleeds into your hit function (and even then not very idiomatic), so you get weird effects like the hit function returning two values.As some immediate ideas:- if you feel the need to comment, try to put that comment into the naming of the commented thing. Sometimes a dissonance between your naming and your comment just highlights that your code doesn't actually do what the naming suggests.- Try to keep properties close to the data. In your case, the value of a card is a property of the card. Maybe you want functions for `cardValue` and `cardName` that compute those values, then your `hit` function reduces a lot.",

Are you working with someone who’s going to review your code?

Nest them in ways that the context provides useful information \\- Avoiding shared state: restrict the contexts on which state is available for manipulation. When possible, avoid state altogether by using preferentially transparent functions \\- Apply the single responsibility principle: One abstraction should only have a single reason to be changed. \\- Name your abstractions carefully",

I'm guessing no.Right now, your skills are pretty basic.For example, if someone wanted you to design a web application where customers could put in orders, and make payment via credit card, would you know how to do that? This becomes a bit dangerous because you'd have to store credit card info securely, find some company that does that work (it would be unrealistic for you to do it) or use something like Paypal. If you tried, you might get something to work, but it could be done in a pretty janky way, and they may expect you to maintain it for free forever which would be crazy.Customers might request something insane for little to no money, and keep adding requests, figuring they can get something for cheap.I'd agree to look at fiverr and try some of the projects on your own, but I suspect, with only one year of experience, it's not enough unless someone wants something super basic which they could easily hire someone more experienced to do.Again, imagine what code *you'd* pay for--and how much you'd pay for it.",

Often at the beginning it's not clear what should be spelled out explicitly, vs what's built into the OS, vs what's built into the language, vs what you should import a package for. You'll build familiarity and comfort with this over time. For example, I used to TA an operating system lab where everything was written in C. It was PAINFUL for most students to internalize that all file IO would be handled by system calls, or that the computer knows what folder it should be referring to by referencing the file system relative to the folder the console or executable was launched from. This is, in some sense, the point of hello world. \"Oh wow, I wrote 4 lines of code and computer somehow knew to interface with my keyboard and monitor (not to mention the hardware of the computer itself). How is that even possible?\" If you spend long enough writing code, you will internalize the reasons why this is possible in a way that will have made it seem obvious in retrospect. But it wasn't, and it isn't, and you could spend an arbitrary amount of time learning more details if you really wanted to. Your goal for now should at least be to get to the point where you build up an expectation for what will be abstracted away for you and what you need to explicitly write into your code.You also mentioned some discomfort with dictionaries. It could be worth spending a little time reading into why they are useful, and some common cases where they are the go to data structure. You'll come away with a more powerful familiarity than if you simply memorize the access rules by brute force.",

It doesn't have to be bound to a controller. It can be, but a DTO is just that: A data transfer object. It is a box of properties that simply moves data from A to B. It can be used to move data outside of the application, but it can also be used to simplify transferring data from one side of the codebase to the other.However, if we assume that a DTO in this case always correlates with some data being returned in a controller, then you'd most likely want to do the mapping in the controller. Being dogmatic about this can be a little difficult, as you'd quickly end up making DTO objects between the service and the controller layer for situations where you have to join together data from different sources (which can be fine as well).The issue with having the service layer coupled with API DTOs is that other parts of the system might want to use your service without being coupled to the API (which you point out in your post), which can become a problem. However, if that doesn't happen, then there's no issue.My point is that there's no single rule. It depends on the dependencies within the system, as well as how the system will develop over time. My general advice here is to push everything outward from the core of your application until it starts to become annoying. When you've found the sweetspot, then keep it there until other things start making it annoying, then consider pushing it further out (or pull it inwards) depending on how it is annoying. Don't be set in stone; instead, be pragmatic and flexible.",

To transfer this to a persistence layer, DTO is used and in the ORM context, they are entities. Without it, we have to do this mapping on our own.Then we can can make a simplified DAO service, which provide CRUD operations we can use in the controller (presentation layer). It's already possible to use the ORM operations directly in the controller, but I prefer a service class to make this cleaner.Somehow, we have to map from entityDTO to presentationDTO. The presentationDTO is used to return a response to the client. I read that this mapping is done in the service layer, the problem:If we map the entityDTO in the service to the presentationDTO, the service will always return a presentationDTO that is expected to be used in a controller or view. For example, in [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) core, we do not want to return a response from the entityDTO directly, since they contain navigation properties. We want the JSON output to exclude the navigation props and instead translate type references to foreign key fields. That is why we map to a presentationDTO.But sometimes we want to use service class in another service class and we do not want to already return a presentationDTO from the service. In this case, the service should return an entityDTO so we can use this data in the other services if necessary. Then if we want to map this entityDTO to a presentationDTO, it's best to do this in the controller.Do you know what I mean?",

You *can, it's possible,* in the same way anything you want to code is possible. The convention is to not return these in this form. They are mapped the moment they are retrieved from a database, so by definition they are returned from the Data Access Object (or DB layer) and this is unavoidable - so you always start by mapping the data from a persistence driver to a language class instance (or dictionary). While controllers return a *response* that can easily just be whatever the service returns wrapped in whatever response your protocol expects. The response from a service is what is in question here.In spring for example, you will commonly see in a service:example() { var stuff = repo.getStuff(); ...business logic... return stuff.stream().map(StuffToDtoMapper::EntityToDTO}....;)This is done in the service layer because the service doesn't want to return the entire entity model to the controller, assuming it's a service method that is called directly by a controller, often times, the service might not even be receiving the entity itself, but rather an intermittent object still on the database side (e.g. spring projections) which it would still want mapped to a presentation DTO, as you said.When you want to use the entire entity in a different service, which is completely normal, you define a separate method in your service (some even opt for different services, but that's overkill in my opinion) that returns the entity itself, indicating that it is used for inter-service communication and not to be routed back through a controller.All these things are just conventions, you can technically do anything you want, but this communicates intent to other developers who are familiar with the convention.",

You then create a service class, which is just a simplified DAO with CRUD operations and the output of each operation maps to whatever DTO that belongs to the entity.You call the service operation in the controller and the DTO that is returned from this service will be serialized to JSON in the response to the client.So you default the return of each service operation in the CRUD DAO to a DTO and when you want the full entity POJO instead to reuse in whatever class, you use the defined method in your service CRUD DAO. Let's call the method \\`getFullServiceEntityDTO\\`.This is your approach if I read it correctly.",

Hibernate isn't returning anything, you are defining an Entity class, denoted by an annotation, to either generate your database schema or match it.The reason the entity class is not usable outside the repository class and some select service methods is that you do not want to couple your schema and anything your API returns.Example: You're in the process of migrating your hashing algorithm, this requires users to reset their passwords, you have millions of users - this will take a lot of time. You add a hash\\_version field to your user class, so you know which hashing algorithm to use to verify their passwords. This new column in your database has no business being in absolutely any of your controllers, but obviously you want to retrieve the value when getting a user since the service needs to know what to do). This applies to any entity derivatives like projections or manual mappings with native query.Service calls one or more repositories requesting data from the database that it needs, this can be returned as an entity class, projection, manually created class mapped by a jdbc handler, it doesn't matter - this is the class that will store the data you request from the database. This class will change if you ever change your database query. You don't want changes to this class to affect whatever any of your endpoints are using, this is not specific to java.",

There were a few milestones I do remember, though: First, when I learned to focus on projects over practice, programming started to come much more naturally to me. Second, when I learned the concepts of software engineering, I started to view programming as an end rather than some thing on its own (when it became a medium for a story like English in your analogy).It was a continuous process, but I can't really quantify how skilled I was at the time, because I wasn't doing the same thing enough to compare over time.To go into domains a little:The process will be different for every domain, as programming is just means to an end. This means learning how to learn is a step in its own. You're probably best just looking for an online community of software engineers with experience and asking there (forums, discords, etc), or just Googling it and hoping you find results. Examples:Banking and financial processing are extremely heavy on the security, regulations, and infrastructure side of things, so that's where most of your research/investment goes- under the hood I'd imagine most banks etc use very similar software, all just making secure API calls to one-another. Your learning resources are going to be regulations and industry insights to the current norms. Your only hope to breaking into the market is probably innovation (doing something known, just cheaper or higher quality).Comparatively, something like game development would be the opposite. You're creating a lot of unique systems; usually without significant regard for standards/security. I.e. outside of specific cases, there's not really one preferred solution. Your learning resources are gonna be more subjective and decentralized, as the requirements are much fuzzier and the market isn't \"solved.\" This means you can break into the market via invention *or* innovation.",

Set up a load balancer, experiment with kubernetes, use services like Kafka and write your services to operate on a stream processing model, try setting up a sharded and replicated database, write a CI/CD pipeline, get used to working with containers and IaaC. you can even load test your own box or a VPS to test its scalability.

[https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/) Google colab is a free place to host and run jupyter notebooks. You can write python code inside of a code cell and execute it one block at a time. As someone who struggled way more than necessary trying to figure out the right environment to practice coding, I wish someone had shown me this when I first started. Make sure all autocomplete and any AI assistants are turned off. They will not help you at all in this stage, only hinder you.",

I'm not trying to sound like a smartass or anything, but sometimes the most simple route can be the best! You can learn stuff like design patterns and algorithms and stuff, but if you feel like you are too heavily reliant on AI I'd suggest trying to make a simple project (like a sudoku or a simple calculator ) and just turn off copilot or anything of the likes and just start googling (the AI from Google also doesn't count) learning to use documentation and efficient research helps a lot for becoming a better programmer especially if you try to dissect your problem in smaller bites and start to get hang of how you could figure out problems by pure logic it will then only make you stronger in coding when you do allow yourself to use AI. But practising is the best medicine imo. You seem like a smart individual but don't get yourself twisted over achieving stuff like becoming a 10x developer, I'm guessing a part of having that amount of skill is also part of just loving to code and doing it a lot (of course there are cases of people who just inhale knowledge and have such a robust logical mind that it comes easy to them but that is besides the point) and if you can think of the logic how to tackle problems during coding before even touching your keyboard then you're on the right track (not a must but is nice) coding is just logical thinking.

If someone just wanted to vibe code their way into software that's going to be riddled with problems that's probably a different story.Assuming AI is going to reach the point where it's actually useful at scale then you'll want to be in a position where you can still read, debug, and modify whatever code the various models you use will output.At the moment AI isn't really a net benefit for a lot of companies or projects that are rather large, but realistically with the amount of investment they've seen they likely will be. To clarify a bit, they're decent at writing a number of things, but I've also seen them do a number of dumb things that cost more time than they've saved.The other rather significant problem is that while you can use them to build a number of things by piecing things together it starts to fail when you have to debug even relatively small programs. Even if you've all the features enabled to have it try to analyze, run, and test a program it will still often fail somewhere. Though it will completely confidently proclaim that what it wrote it works properly when it definitely doesn't. I've seen this just trying to get it write unit tests for things that are only mildly complicated. Other times the project is just too big to fit in the context window. A bit of an anecdote here, but I still find it humorous seeing certain models try to run code (not written using Python) in a Python interpreter even when you explicitly told it not to.I expect we'll see a shift from monolithic to more microservice based programs to help meet AI in the middle, but we're not there across the industry today.",

It just has to make some sense to you somehow and you alone. Think of it like your subconscious working for you. And once you have enough pieces built, everything will just click and make sense. If you ever watch an artist working on a brand new piece, you would understand what this is about. Professional artists always do a super rough sketch skeleton first, then they work a bit here and a bit there, but never complete. The process would look very strange to everyone including the artist. But when it is all done, the artist would look back and think about how he/she actually arrive at the final piece. From that experience, he/she would rationalize what must have been going on in his/her head. And that's the story he/she tells the world. Same thing with novel writers, this is why most good writers are constantly revising, never satisfied.e: A key to successfully learning from your projects is making mistakes.

        "body": "In 1990 I bought a Commodore Amiga with the tax refund. At the time it was lightyears ahead of anything else available. As a complete novice, I was astonished. That thing could knock my eyeballs out. I wasn't using my brain for anything at the time, so I would get up in the middle of the night and spend a couple hours playing around with it. Eventually I started writing code in Amiga Basic. Then I realized that Basic sucked, and I bought an Amiga C compiler, and eventually a debugger. Then it occurred to me that with these newfound skills, I might be able to stop delivering furniture. Actually... I delivered some desks to a warehouse in Phoenix where they were working on the first really successful map program for PCs. Can't remember what it was called. I tried to make an appointment to deliver some more desks the next day, and one of the guys there said in sort of a lofty, sophisticated voice, \"I shouldn't be disturbed tomorrow, I'll be writing code.\" That was one of the coolest things I had ever heard.So at that point I wanted to be a real programmer. I started applying for jobs. Nothing happened. Then I thought \"Maybe if I SEND these people my code...\" It was a stupid idea, but it got me a couple of interviews. I went to the first interview, but they were already mad at me because I hadn't put enough postage on my printout. The second time I sent code out I put plenty of postage on it, and they hired me for Customer Support because the code I sent was event-driven UI, and that's where they were going. No more moving furniture.So after a week of doing Customer Support, I went and told the guy in charge of programming department, \"Hey, I found a bug in the code.\" And he literally said, \"Well, fix it.\" So I fixed it. And then I just jumped in the deep end. Eventually they put me in the programming dept, but didn't replace me in Customer Support. So I just kept doing both jobs. After a year or so, they hired somebody for Customer Support and started giving me raises. Really, that company was a terrific place to Be All You Could Be. I just wish I had realized that. Because after 10 years, I quit, looking for something better. I didn't realize that there were WAY worse places I could be. Had to learn the hard way.I doubt that this story can help you. Things are different now. Back then, there was a terrible shortage of programmers. Now it's a glut. Also, I could do wonders with copy of Petzold's Programming Windows, a DOS 4.0 manual, and some DB stuff. Now the list of things to learn is as long as both of your arms.I'd say, if that's what you want to do, don't let anything stop you, work or study 12 hours a day or more, WRITE CODE ALL THE TIME, be persistent and focused. Maybe that'll work eventually.",

No frameworks) -> OOP, multithreading, multi process, signal handling, etc… Front/back end, Cloud platforms, Project management tools, Orchestration tools, and deployment pipelines are all things I’m still learning on the job.Keep in mind a Computer Science programming doesn’t focus on the “programming” aspect of it. It focuses on the “computer” and “science” parts of it (i.e., theory). So frameworks like Vue, react, angular, spring, springboot, Django, etc., are never taught nor even mentioned in the core CS coursework, and probably only explored in 1 out of however many electives are available. Even as I’m doing a MSCS, frameworks are either assumed knowledge or you are expected to self teach them to complete your assignments.",

But once I learned a bit of C it really helped me get a better understanding of the nuts and bolts behind the abstractions that Python uses/hides from you. Then that made learning Python easier for me.Some people get overwhelmed by the fundamentals, but others prefer having a grasp of that before moving onto higher level languages. I'd likely use Python for any projects going forward, but I am indebted to learning a little of C first.",

It’s good for slop coding where it can do remedial tasks great but it’s never going to beat you to the punch on a memory/time optimized solution.Regardless of what field you end up going to work for just keep in mind it’s tough right now and a ton of young people are going through the exact same thing right now. There’s always opportunity to work in adjacent fields of study. Example, I work as a PLC Tech in the manufacturing industry. I work and design front end applications. Update existing projects to accommodate workers needs and install new hardware where needed. I’m sure if anyone else chimes in they might be able to speak to things they do as well.

Right now the government isn’t hiring anyone even very little coops. Also it’s not about the curriculum it’s what you demonstrate on your resume, have an active github to showcase, put projects in your Experience section of your resume and advertise it like experience. I had extremely high grades and added relevant projects in my resume to the application as experience and I think that’s what got me an interview (gov). Also had a cloud cert. I also knew someone in class who got an interview at Shopify no previous degree but a very active GitHub of many projects, did great on her initial assessment of building a wikipedia backend (she added great frontend). She previously received an interview from referral, so it was easier for her to get selected for subsequent interviews. So curriculum is less of a factor",

It's a hard skill to fully describe but you eventually get used to skimming documentation like this to very quickly get \"the point\" and the kind of style and thought patterns behind the idea of this library or framework, and then as you start to work with it, you dive in to the relevant details. I feel like people fall into this trap of being a bit \\*too\\* lead by these kind of guided tours. They can keep you a little too \"on piste\", waiting for the next chapter, and that isn't \\*really\\* how true learning is done. You have seen the kind of thing react can do now.

So you likely won't be writing a website using Java, but the service that powers it and the endpoints. ) You will find Java mostly at large scale enterprise software and Backend systems.

CS50AI in 2 weeks.I was hooked on \"tutorial hell\" and broke out of it by building a multi-agent AI workflow from scratch. I now see and echo the advice by many others to start working on your own projects.

As you know it uses C and python to introduce fundamental concepts about programming, and as you recall it also uses Scratch to introduce ideas such as variables and early syntax. If you are worried about not getting everything down you may as well worry about the fact that you haven't mastered Scratch in it's entirety.Use cs50 as a springboard. Refine and revisit fundamentals as you continue your learning journey as you need them. Dive into other areas of specialisation to build the projects you want to. And it's honestly pointless to compare yourself with others - whether you are really fast or slow. Prof Malan himself mentions something along the lines of it only being useful to compare the knowledge and expertise you've acquired with your previous knowledge and expertise. Some people have prior experience, others none. Some people are interested in particular areas and will deep dive, others will just skim sections they aren't that into. So just focus on what you are getting out of it and whether that fulfils your goals.",

So what I have are a bunch of these scratch files in a few thematically named folders inside my IDEs \"Scratch files\" section so I can quickly open them and copy paste whatever I need out of them. They stay with the IDE, sync across instances and are project independent, so whatever I open in my IDE I will always have access to those. I can access them Quickly through keyboard shortcuts or the search function. They are clean, searchable and cloud synced. So would tick all boxes for you if you are on Jetbrains.I often store them together with a quick implementation example to help me remember how I intended it to be used.",

The 6502 CPU is one of the most commonly used CPUs in history. It was used in famous systems like the Apple II series, the Commodore ViC20, C64, C128 (where also a Zilog Z-80 CPU was used along), and even in NES systems. It is a well documented architecture with plenty available Assemblers, Disassemblers, emulators, tutorials/courses, etc.So, if you don't have a particular goal in mind, and maybe want to dive a little into retro computing, then, the 6502 architecture is the way to go.I started with the Zilog Z-80 CPU as this was the architecture my home computer used way back in the 1980s. Also wasn't too difficult to get into.Another option would be, if you are interested in microcontrollers, embedded programming, to go with the Intel 8031/8051/8080 CPU architecture, which somewhat is the predecessor of the Intel 8086 CPU. That's what I used at my degree. Also very well documented and easy to learn.In general, the 8-bit architectures of old are way easier to learn than the modern 32 and 64 bit architectures.",

It teaches you lexing/tokenizing/scanning, making a parser, etc.Once you do a reasonable portion of the book, I'd say you could start branching out to making your own interpreted PL, or if you want to go into compiler dev, start out by making a brainf\\*ck compiler. That's what I did. Right now I'm reading through the book \"Writing a C Compiler\" by Nora Sandler. It's very challenging, but I'm learning quite a bit. I have some books on osdev, but I haven't read them yet, so I don't feel like I have useful insight into that field. I have a bunch of books in my little library that I'm reading and plan on finishing lol.",

To reuse the code, we need to give it a name. So we decided to name it after what it does, like AddNumbers or GetBirthday So a function is simply a named block of code. When we write def GetBirthday we are saying here is a block of code I plan to reuse and I will call this code GetBirthdayHowever, it's not super useful if our function always returns the same data every time. For example, I may not want to get my birthday, I want to get anyone's birthday. So we introduced arguments. Arguments are input parameters that a function will accept. Some functions take no argument. Some have required arguments, and some allow for optional arguments. When I create GetBirthday, I have to include what these argument parameters are going to be.function GetBirthday(person)Then when I want to use it, I call the function.let bday = GetBirthday(john)So what's important to understand is that a function is a named block of code. It accepts inputs, which we call arguments, and it returns outputs based on the input. It can have no input, required input, or optional input, depending on how the function is defined.In most programming languages, we use the () to list the input arguments to our functions.",

        "body": "The brackets allow you to pass data into a function. In a basic sense functions take in data do something with it then return data back to whatever called it.it’s generally bad practice to have functions work on non local variables if you can avoid it because it makes the code less reusable and more prone to weird difficult to diagnose bugs because you have many functions work on the same data it becomes much harder to diagnose and fix undefined behavior.Simple pattern to start. If you need to mutate a variable, instead of the function mutating the variable directly, set the function to take an input, mutate that input and return the value you want to mutate. That way the function can do the same behavior, mutating the variable, but it can also save that variable to a new variable.Here’s a sample snippet of python code to explain what I mean.Edit: Reddit messing up formatting here.def increment(x): return x + 1count = 0count = increment(count) # updates originalnew_count = increment(count) # keeps originalCount starts at zero, the increment function increments it by one and then you save the incremented count to new_count. This structure is much clearer to people reading your code, the function can now be used for more than just mutating a single global variable and you are discouraged from creating single use functions.As you get better at programming, free floating variables become much rarer. Most variables are used as temporary storage for working data, (and if we are really to get into the weeds they act as human readable abstractions that become pure memory operations at compile time) while all persistent data has a clear owner. This makes it much easier to reason about where data lives, who’s allowed to change it, and how long it will exist. If you are making simple python scripts right now it might seem tempting to do things quick and dirty, after all that is what python is good for, but developing good habits in the beginning pay dividends once you have to start working on more complex systems.",

If you want a better understanding of digital logic and how it's used to assemble a functioning computer, it's a good course and fairly easy to follow in a self-study manner. And it's a survey, you'll want to follow it up with actual compiler, OS, or computer architecture courses afterward but you'll have a better foundation to start them.SICP is a CS textbook that kind of tackles things from the other direction, though also gets to the point of building a compiler for a simulated register machine. It does not really get down into the hardware logic quite like Nand2Tetris does. If you want a better conceptual understanding of how software is evaluated, SICP is a good course. It's important to keep in mind it's context though, it was intended for first year students at MIT who would also be taking (or have taken) courses in calculus, physics, and EE topics so many of the examples and exercises relate back to that. Section 3.5 Streams (which also introduces the concepts of promises and implements them) has examples of using streams for simulations of electric circuits, for instance. They don't always explain the math that they expect students to know, so you may need to devise some of your own exercises or go and study a bit outside SICP to progress on all the exercises.On that last point, SICP is somewhat less self-contained because of the context it was intended for, but is still a very good textbook overall. Nand2Tetris provides you, from recollection it's been years, with everything you should need to be able to progress through it.From the perspective of being a backend developer, I'm not sure either will really give you much ROI except that you might understand computers and software better following either.",

A second edition is due out in January 2026 but if you have access to [O'Reilly's digital library](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781098119058/) you can read it now. Three chapters aren't available yet and it's still subject to editing.I do think both of the books you're interested are good things to go through. There's nothing wrong with being a better, well-rounded developer. I just don't know that they'll directly give you any kind of return for your work as a backend developer.",

It's the most important bit to practice, and every problem you'll ever be given begins with you not knowing how to start working on it.That said, once you're very familiar with certain platforms and tools, building new things with those tools gets a lot faster. If you're super familiar with, say, using Ruby on Rails to build websites, then the first couple of hours of building new websites with Ruby on Rails is gonna go very very fast. Looks great at a Hackathon. Same with stuff like Godot. Obviously somebody with a few years experience making games with Godot is gonna be able to knock out WAY more game than anyone else at a game dev hackathon. That doesn't mean they're a better programmer in general, it means you've identified one of their strengths.You will probably also develop some strengths depending on your interests. Don't worry too much about it. But do keep trying to make things. It's a critical skill.",

        "body": "It's not clear, to me, what algorithm you are using. There's one (or more inefficiency) which is the malloc/free which is considered a bit slow. There's a question of what your objective is, that is, do you want to have an array of the factors as a result or just print it out. Printing it out would be much easier, but then it's hard to use the factors afterwards.But the optimization is something rather simple and follows a trick that you use to determine if a number is prime.Instead of going from 1 to n, you go from 1 to ceil(sqrt(n)). Here's why you can stop at the square root of n. Suppose you find a factor that's smaller than the square root of n. Let's call it x. Because it's a factor, there's also another factor y such that `x * y = n`.Now `y` has to be bigger than (or equal to) the square root of n. If it weren't, then you have two numbers smaller than the square root of n which, when multiplied, will be smaller than n.You might wonder, could we miss some factors greater than the square root of n by stopping so soon? The answer is no. Why? For a similar reason. Suppose there is a factor, `y` that's bigger than the square root of n. Then, it must have a corresponding factor, `x`, which is less than the square root. If it didn't, then both `x` and `y` would both be greater than the square root of n, and their product would be greater than n (which would mean they aren't factors).So, you could modify it something like float root= sqrt((float) n); // or however you get the square root // Crude way to get the ceiling of the root int limit = (int) (root + 1); for (int i = 1; i <= limit; i++) { if (n % i == 0) { // Check if it's a factor // It is printf(\"%d is a factor\\n\", i); int other = n / i; // Get other factor if (other != i) { // Don't double print if we hit the square root printf(\"%d is a also a factor\\n\", i); } }If you wanted to save the array allocation cost and do it once, you could run this loop twice. The first time, you'd check for how many factors there were (create a counter before the loop and increment each time you print). Then, you'd malloc the array, then fill in the array again.Hard to say which is more efficient, but the square root trick is pretty useful because square root of n is MUCH smaller than n, so that's the number 1 idea you can use.",

        "body": "Squeezing this kind of optimization (to me) seems silly. You're calling the square root function *once*. On the other hand, you're computing `i * i` each time through the loop. When both are good enough (C programmers from the 1980s and 1990s obsessed over writing the fastest code, but these days, if the code runs fast enough, then clarity of code matters more than efficiency), you opt for the one that is clearer to the reader which could be you or be someone else.This is why some people use Python (with Django or Flask) on the backend or even Node. A Rust backend would be faster, at the expense of being harder to read. Speed isn't everything, and even when it is, guessing what is fast or slow is not an effective way to improve the speed: you need a way to measure your program's execution (this is called instrumenting it). There are tools called *profilers* that can do this, but it's not super easy to set up and differs from language to language.For example, you can call a very expensive function that takes, say, a second once, but if you have a loop that goes a million times, and you can shave a millisecond off each iteration, that matters more.In this case, the square root trick really reduces the number of iterations and has the biggest impact, far more than deciding whether to use square root or i * i. I think it's fine to stick with i * i, because it's pretty close to saying square root. This is where it's useful to have a comment like // Not using square root because i * i is more efficientcan help. Often, when you're trying to speed things up, comments help indicate you're writing less obvious code to help speed it up.However, many beginners obsess over speed without truly knowing how to speed it up (basically, they try a bunch of things). Algorithmic improvements are usually the ones to aim for rather than smaller things like how fast square root runs. Having said that, many years ago I wrote a program using sine and cosine, and because I computed it over and over, it was slow (I had no idea).The solution was to create an array with the results pre-computed. I only had a limited number of values I was running these trig functions on (say, 60), so placing the pre-computed values in the array and looking those values up was far more efficient.So, it *can* matter. But usually you want to spot big loops which is where things tend to slow down.",

The whole process made some exercises take a lot longer than they could have done, but as I learnt not only how I could do things better, but also how other people do, I found things easier and quicker. Sometimes I'd go and look at my 'good' solutions and see how bad they really are. And on occasion I realised the brute force approach may have actually been better as it was so much easier to understand and re-use. I think, personally, brute force isn't so bad on small scripts with small data sets that I only use for simple things. As long as I'm not loading files when I don't need to, then even looping over data sets more than I need isn't always bad. As soon as I have a nested loop I pay far more attention, likewise when I suddenly have a far larger data set than expected. (Case in point, I have a script I'm using right now where I'm sorting through a text file for some specific identifiers and false positives. My first run through the input was a couple of hundred lines. I didn't pay much attention to how I was scanning through the text. Yesterday I started looking at a file with \\~1M lines. Suddenly I paid a lot more attention to what my script was doing, and, for example, filtering out inputs early.)",

        "body": "> I guess my ultimate question for you guys is: is a janky solution that still works good enough, even if that solution feels like you're cheating?If it gets the work done with a reasonable amount of resources, then sure. But it's also generally a good idea in this industry to not move on from a problem as soon as we have some viable solution. If we have the time, refining the solution is absolutely recommended. If you can find a constant-time solution instead of using a loop, or something else that reduces the time/memory use, that's usually highly appreciated.Often also it's worth struggling and trying out various solutions. If you get a real _oh, riiiight_ reaction when you're shown the solution, then you likely learned something. :)I still get that for the math problems over at projecteuler, and sometimes when I go to the forums there I just conclude that I don't understand the best solutions. Likely I _could_ understand them if I actually applied myself to more math studies, but being able to figure out a solution even if I don't have all the background knowledge I could have had can still be fun.---I'll also note we generally use the `while` loop for when the loop is going to have some spicy development. Like in [the hailstone sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) we don't really know how many steps will be involved or how we'd express it as a for-each loop, so it's more expected to get a `while n != 1`.But if we want to repeat a step exactly `k` times, then we generally use a for-each loop, like `for i in range(k): …`I don't know how the MOOC you're taking teaches loops.",

For example, you could try the following: low = 1 high = int(input(\"Please type in a number: \"))Then, you run the check. If `low < high` you print, otherwise you quit. while low <= high: # print low # increment low # check the negation of the condition if high > low: # break else # print high # decrement highSo basically, you track two variables, one for the beginning (`low`), one for the end (`high`), and you print the `low` and increment, then check if the condition `low <= high` is true, if so then print `high` and decrement the value.You can test this out with, say, an input of 3.* Prints 1 and increments low to 2* Prints 3 and decrements high to 2* Prints 2 and increments low to 3* low > high, so quit outThis was a little tricky because the decision of whether it's `low < high` or `low <= high` is not obvious and can lead to an off-by-1 error if you select the wrong one.",

Generally speaking, my approach is to always take it one step at a time and internalize as you go.Ask yourself:* What is the real life problem that I am experiencing.* What is the cause of the problem.* What are possible solutions to alleviate this problem at the root cause.* Google/Search: Does Qt have a class that will help me with this (99% of the time it has the thing you need)From there on, once you've identified which Qt object/class you actually need, you can dive into the particular documentation of the class and hopefully figure out the details. The classes are big and cover a lot of ground. Don't waste too much time reading things that do not directly relate to the exact thing you're dealing with. No point in distracting yourself with other details of a class.If you're not sure how to apply the class in actual software, just google 'Qt QWhateverClass example'. There's almost always something to help you along.P.s. Qt Creator IDE is one of the few pieces of software where F1 is your friend.

If you don't want to do that you are better off learning by yourself unless you know you don't have the discipline in which case maybe try a bootcamp but I'm not sure those are worth it anymore.[https://books.trinket.io/pfe/01-intro.html](https://books.trinket.io/pfe/01-intro.html) I recommend this free book. Skip intro if you want. What you HAVE to do is the tasks, understand them , do them , change them, use what you learn to do stuff yourself. The more curious you are the better.Tips to remember:1. Only use video tutorials for basics like data types, creating variables , loops, if else , functions, etc... then everything else should come from your imagination of how to combine the basics or use libraries which you'll learn later.2. Best way to learn is to create projects by yourself using websites like [w3school.com](http://w3school.com) to check stuff you forget instead of watching more tutorials.3. Add to last tip , best way to learn is also ask for help and maybe get a mentor after you learn the basics.4. Look up tips/tutorials on how to read documentation.5. After you know some stuff you should look at branches of programming so you can find what you like to do , check the website [https://roadmap.sh/](https://roadmap.sh/) and also look up videos online about branches / types of programmingFinally, maybe find a mentor on the internet along the way, having someone with experience help you will only make learning easier, faster and maybe more fun.",

        "body": "Two communities on Reddit to check out:- r/programminglanguages- r/compilers (I just saw you also posted there)Regarding languages, someone asked a similar question on another forum I frequent recently and my answer there is the same here:The language mostly doesn't matter. You can build a compiler in pretty much any language. The advantage *some* languages have are with respect to:1. Parsing libraries or tools like parser generators.2. Backend support if you don't want to implement code generation yourself. LLVM is a pretty popular one to use, and you'll want language bindings to it in whatever language you use so that may limit you.But, if you're building the full compiler, just use a language you know, or a language you want to learn. I've written compilers and interpreters in C, Java, SML, Scheme (Racket, but 99% the Scheme subset), C++, Python, and toyed with it in Rust.A feature that is very helpful is good support for pattern matching (present in Rust, Swift, SML, OCaml, Haskell, and a number of others). But it's not strictly *required*, your code will just be more verbose without it.For a beginner friendly path, I haven't worked all the way through it but I like the premise and what I've read in Nora Sandler's _Writing a C Compiler_. But it's not the only path out there. The reason I like it for beginners is it breaks up a common pattern in compilers courses and other textbooks.Compilers have a natural structure: parser -> analyzer -> optimizers -> code generationA lot of books and courses have you focus on the parser, then the analyzer, then the optimizers (possibly skipped), and then code generation. If your parser doesn't handle the full language, your analyzer will be wrong, and your code generation will be wrong. Sandler's book (inspired by a paper by Ghuloum) takes an iterative approach which starts with essentially the simplest C program and then grows both what's parsed and what can be generated with each chapter. The first compiler can only compile this: int main() { return 42; }Then with each chapter the parser, analyzer, and code generator gets increasingly complex and supports more and more C features.Jeremy Siek has a pair of books, both called _Essentials of Compilation_, that, depending on which you read, uses Python to compile a Python-like language or Racket for a Scheme/Racket-like language. Both his books are free, but they do tie you more to the specific language the book covers which is why I Sandler's book comes out ahead for me as a recommendation. Sandler's book is roughly the same structure but your implementation language is up to you. Use JS if you want, the tests are all C programs and whether they execute correctly.If you want to build an interpreter, *Crafting Interpreters* by Nystrom is a pretty popular recommendation and free. A book I like, but isn't free (legally) is *Essentials of Programming Languages* but it also uses Scheme or Racket, though you could follow along in a language of your choice with some effort.",

I was able to have an interesting conversation with the HM during the final interview. And I have a lot of social anxiety, but had a job in the past that required I talk to people a lot on the phone. So even tho I may be awkward in social settings, my work relationships are usually much easier to maintain. Then again, I like playing politics at work, I think it's kinda fun. But here are some additional tips I'd recommend:* audibly repeat back your understanding of what someone else wants you to do to avoid confusion* Don't complain about co workers, it's fine to ask your boss for feedback on how to handle a coworker, but don't come across as attacking them. * Only bitch upwards, it's not a good look if you're complaining about bosses to people less senior than you,but when you do complain about something to your boss, offer solutions* praise often, praise early - if someone has a good idea, tell them. This avoids coming across like a contrarian and shows you're open to other people's ideas. * admit when you don't know something - no one likes a no it all especially about matters you clearly don't understand. This gives your thoughts and opinions more weight when you do express them.* Use words like \"We\", \"Us\", & \"As a team\", instead of \"you created this bug on this PR\", \"we created this bug, and we missed it during the PR\", \"what if we need to add X functionality?\"* form relationships with users (if non public facing software) and stakeholders. If you have a bug you're investigating, just tell the user, this builds more trust and good will. * when debating about designs/patterns/architecture, just don't say \"this isn't good because X, Y, Z\", ask people questions in a way that it will lead them to the conclusion you want them to make. \"Will this work under this use case?\", \"what if the user does X?\", etc. * ask your manager how other folks are doing, \"how is John doing lately? He seems a bit stressed out or anxious\". Shows you're aware of people's emotions and you're concerned about others. I feel like there are more, but this is what I've found.",

We've gotten to this point where leaders think that they are the supermegaminds that are the only ones who could possible know what the company needs to focus on, and the reality is that figuring out what a company needs should be much more bottom up than top down - because it always needs to go to the bottom and come back up anyway.Right now the model - especially for internal work, but I'm sure also for external work - is:1. Executive comes up with \"great idea\" that is neither great nor feasible2. Executive hands idea down to VP, who loves the idea3. Executive hands project down to Director with timelines and super aggressive goals. Director already starts getting nervous because this idea sounds unreasonable, and so do the timelines. Also, maybe not that great of an idea once you layer reality on it4. Executive breaks into smaller projects, hands to Managers. Managers shitting bricks because they *know* this shit is unreasonable and they start pushing back while simultaneously getting ICs lined up on how to get things moving in a direction that is most likely to be palatable to leadership when it inevitbaly becomes clear the original idea wasn't possible.5. Manager pushes on Director, Director pushes on VP, VP punches Director in face, Director pushes back again on VP, VP starts softening language with executive, executive punches VP in face, VP pushes back a bit harder, executive punches again, VP remembers that executive doesn't know shit so he starts redifining things so that they sound like what the executive wanted while banking on the possibility that the executive doesn't even really know what they want. It works6. Manager gets go ahead to build the thing they've been building already. It is not what executive wanted, but executive doesn't care as long as he can sell it, so everyone - executive, vp, director, manager, ICs - now have to make a bunch of powerpoint slides to convince everyone else that the bullshit they built - which was good and useful - is actually the greates development ever.",

        "body": "Maybe. But I think it has as much to do with the fact that code has a very easy bar to measure it against, \"does it do the thing I want\". People asking that question, who agent technical, don't know enough to ask about non functional requirements. Is it secure, scalable, extensible, understandable, handle errors correctly, etc? Not even in their consideration. They can poke at an AI until it creates code that does the thing they want, a fact they can see, and at that point say \"what do I need developers for?!\"Whereas most other industries that isn't the case, even white collar ones. Lawyer? They can't tell if the legal brief that was written is good or not. Doctor? They can't tell if the results the AI spits out are correct. Accountant? If they could validate the ledger they'd not need an accountant in the first place. Even something like marketing, they have no way to validate the campaign being proposed, nor confirm how well it's working without people. Creative fields are somewhere in between, and it's why you see people turn to AI to create, but few people are happy consuming content created by AI. If you can't write, AI can help you tell a story... but readers will find it derivative and uninspired. If you can't create an image you can use AI...and viewers will find it cold, its style unoriginal, and oftentimes find issues with the anatomy or texture or similar with it. And either way, many people will be turned off if they find out or suspect you used AI.",

To change your assertion slightly: the real pitch being made here is not AI as a tool that the PMC can use to discipline traditional labor, but as a tool that gives capital more leverage against the technocratic elite it has become increasingly reliant on. Think of the other ways startups are trying to employ it:-medical diagnostics-legal work -teaching -etc The dream they are selling investors on is freedom from the demands of the primary PMC professions - this is important to capital because this class has been the only one able to secure increasing wages/a greater slice of the pie over the last 40some years.I think the rest of your argument makes sense, as the tech stands it will probably slow down a lot of these other professions, but I guess I disagree with the power dynamics at play.Edit: can’t format on mobile",

        "body": "Companies will always make the bold claims that will sell their product. Having worked in tech for my entire career since 2009 (banks, big tech, startups, scale-ups), I can see why a lot of businesses really want it to be true:\\- Many regular non-tech businesses (think banks, insurance companies, etc) really suck at delivering software projects, most of their initiatives either outright fail, or go massively over-budget. They also have big consultancies (like Accenture, Deloitte, PwC, E&Y, etc) charging them massive fees for embedded software development squads - mainly because they themselves can't properly deliver.\\- Many business people still think in the mindset of build vs run for how the world works. i.e I spend time and money to build something (with a team specialising in building), then I get to run it (without the builders). Think of something like building a house or an apartment block - after the house is complete you don't need structural engineers, electricians and carpenters hanging around on full-time salaries - they leave, you don't need them anymore. This is how a lot of people expect the world to work for most things, but its not really the case with software products / platforms. There is a real desire from many businesses to have it become this way. For example, if I'm a successful apparel retailer like Nike / Adidas - my business would be way more profitable if I only had to really fork out software development costs during major projects / uplifts. In the absence of those types of projects it would be way better to not have software development salaries bloating operational expenses, and would be able to deliver way better returns to shareholders.On the above points, I want to make it clear that I'm mainly talking about companies where you don't really think of them as a tech company, but because of how important web/mobile/digital channels are these days almost every company has had to build software out of pure necessity. If you think of companies like Nike, Walmart, Nespresso, banks, insurance companies, etc - you don't intuitively think of them as a tech company, yet over the past decade(s) software development salaries/costs have become a big part of their operational expenses, and how they operate in general. A lot of people in business want have their cake and eat it too - they want to have a strong digital presence but without necessarily being a tech company and employing tonnes of software engineers.",

They are all fighting over a finite number of roles.The demand for devs has certainly increased in the last 10years or so, but the supply has increased a LOT more.AI is a factor, it doesn't replace developers, but it can make us a lot more productive, and thus lowering the demand side of things.",

The silent recession that no one in Canada/usa wanted to admit too is the culprit.Back in the day, people used to code in assembly, and when compilers became cheap ans widly available it caused a major disruption in the job market.Same thing with the \"no hardware, all code\" mantra that established itself in the 2000s. Today, almost no cs major knows (or admits to using) C. Or even that its a seperate language from C++.Im so happy i stayed away from web stacks and kept to low level programing on Ucs and embedded linux. Not saying that AI won't replace me, but its hard to replace me when im coding gpio configs that drive transistors and debugging with scopes and DMMs.They cant replace me if were making hardware.

        "body": "Nah, the theory is wrong, on two fronts. First, AI is just the excuse companies give so you'll blame someone other than them. The reality is companies are trying to squeeze devs harder and invest less in training (especially less junior hires and interns). They're squeezing harder because interest rates are higher and changes in tax policy meant they can't deduct R&D expenses from their income. Profitability is king right now. Second, juniors definitely are getting shafted hard right now (not 2008 level bad, but still rough). But mid/senior roles also getting shafted too, and our jobs are anything BUT safe. We got the benefit of a *little* bit of lube first, but it's still not enough to stop things from being painful. To explain: a ton of mid & senior+ devs got laid off over the last few years. I was one of them. Less than 6 months after hopping to a different Principal job they gutted my new department. Basically nothing I could have done would have saved me. *Some* of us were able to line up replacement jobs (thankfully me) due to having the right experience. But the job prospects are still not great, even for proven seniors. Companies know this and are using it to squeeze us hard to get more work for the same pay, and they're not afraid to fire people if they can't keep up.In a few years the pendulum will probably swing back for tech. AI isn't the silver bullet clueless executives claim. If the code I'm seeing daily is any indicator, ultimately AI code generation will ALSO generate a lot of maintenance (and scalability and quality) nightmares. Plus if companies DON'T hire juniors, then when the market recovers they'll have to pay a lot more to get experienced talent... and then they're going to turn back to hiring juniors to save money.",

That's how i imagine future software dev will be like, AI agents doing most of the work and the senior there \"just in case\". Like flying a plane, business don't want to risk their entire mission critical software to fully automated technology. They would rather just pay a salary to reduce that risk. So even if AI becomes senior level at coding, i think seniors will still have a job. I feel for those juniors tho, I can't imagine the situation will get better for them in the future.",

However, the business problems get more complex. When you go from having a few hundred users to a few billion users, how you build a product changes dramatically. You can't just YOLO out code in the same way anymore - everything needs to go through a more rigorous product development process. Also, while the work you're doing may seem simple, you're a small cog in a bigger machine. As you get more senior in your org, you become more and more responsible for figuring out how all of these cogs fit together rather than shipping out code yourself.If you're working on internal tools and infra, those teams have many of the same challenges, but also some of their own. The business problems you deal with at a large enterprise are pretty unique and require you to build bespoke solutions. Senior engineers have to deal directly with stakeholders within the company - product teams, other infra teams, program managers, etc. I work in a security org, and honestly stakeholder management is at least as difficult a problem for us as the engineering itself is.",

You'll see that nothing can be achieved alone, and in order to do anything, you need buy-ins, cross functional coordination, and the stars to align. This is okay when you're a L4 and you're typically judged on execution. So you could shrug it off and leave it to your manager or senior to manage that BS part of it and write it down as \"blocked\" because the roadmaps don't cross and you'll just work on something else.As you get more senior (this could also mean more tenured at the same level), there are higher stakes. It could range from promotion to your very survival. Once you have that kind of pressure pushing on you, it is \\*entirely\\* on you to move that social aspect of things to deliver on the final product. You can no longer lean on reasons like, oh other org wasn't on board. Nope, it was your job to plan for it.While all of this is happening, you're still coding at the fastest velocity you can go. You're constantly migrating and innovating the underlying tooling so the next wave of L4s can just plug and go. You're thinking about your own performance reviews where \"delivered crud app\" becomes a mediocre expected outcome. Have you raised the bar on yourself? on your team? on the company itself? No?

Booths would get maybe half or a third of the footfall you'd see previously. Those we did speak to only wanted to speak about layoffs.* The quality of hiring across the board in all big tech companies have fallen off a cliff. It might be a reliance on GenAI, or it might be the drop I mentioned previously, but we see far more rejections than the last few years.IMO fewer people will take CS, because they've seen enough to suggest that the jobs are hard to land, there is zero employee protection, and that the big salaries are meaningless when you're going to get PIP or laid off soon anyway.",

Then some day the stories of those exact people having to leave a completely oversaturaded market and of CS being a meatgrinder fueling on broken dreams will come to the awareness of the mainstream. As a consequence some enrollments will then fall under a rate at which people will level up from Junior to regular and then and only from then on, it's just another 3 years until pressure on Juniors drop.Let me be clear: for graduates this current situation is not a game where you just have to wait long enough to get a seat. It's a \"musical chairs\" game, where the music stopped playing 2 years ago and you either want to work with computers at the help desk or look for jobs in other industries. Or you are absolutely borderline hacker genius since kindergarten. Then this doesn't apply to you and you get a Junior role at some place, that didn't even have an open role advertised.",

The reason to pay for leetcode/sys design is so that if an opportunity comes your way, you are absolutely ready to pounce. Otherwise, you might find yourself putting it off and never get around to it. It's a form of career security.Next, I would recommend doing some projects with low-level programming. It will help build your profile.The idea is to future-proof yourself as much as possible. Being skilled in one thing will matter a lot. Otherwise, you might end up like me: chasing everything \"because I know I can do it\" :(",

The desire for more and higher quality of those things scales with their relative ease in production. I don't understand why software wouldn't follow a similar pattern. We still have tailors and farmers today, it's just that their jobs are very different than they were before certain tools existed.The 'AI will replace devs' narrative is a bad take because it assumes the desire for software is a known or static amount.

        "body": "Ph.D holding macroeconomist here. Work in tech side of finance (quant)It was much worse. The unemployment rate was 9 percent, over double the current unemployment rate. Furthermore the unemployment rate continued to rise for 2 years after the recession to almost 11 percent and didn't meaningfully fall for half a decade. Just so you know the unemployment rate for young people is ALWAYS higher than the average unemployment rate, so you were in a market where almost 20 percent (18.8%) of people under 25 could not find ANY job, including part time work, source: (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LRUN24TTUSM156S)Outside the U.S. it was worse, Spain and Greece youth unemployment rose to 50 percent and remained there through the first half of the 2010s. It wasn't until 2014 when the economy started too feel like it was going back to normal and even then the U.S. unemployment rate was still 6 percent (which is recessionary).[https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/aug/30/spain-youth-unemployment-record-high)My facebook, which back then was young cool social media, could be divided into two types of people. People with bachelors degrees from prestigious schools and people who went to normal schools. The people at prestigious schools ended up fine, but the ones who went to your average school had their lives permanently altered. Your talking about people with business degrees go or math degrees go work dead end service industry jobs until their mid 20s or teach english in Japan. Some of those people eventually retooled or went back to school and have careers, others are still bar tending somewhere.This is economic research from that time period, from IZA, which is one of the top affiliation groups in labor economics [https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf](https://docs.iza.org/dp5674.pdf)Now for the CS job market faired better than most other jobs. Smart phones had just been invented so the tech boom seeds had been planted, but back then people weren't throwing money at software companies like they have been the past 6 or 7 years. Like I worked a data science/risk quant job at a regional bank and all the old guys in the office were laughing at the \"ridiculously high IPO price for facebook at 35$\". People would throw money into apple, which had great P&L financials, but the things that companies were really looking at then where oil and energy. Fracking had just taken off etc.Futhermore, the 2010 recession was a financial crisis. That means it effected the finance industry and guess what is part fo the finance industry? Venture Capital. Venture Capital is partially funded by banks. 2009 was a time when there was a lot of regulation was introduced on banks. Banks had taken or were foreced to take government loans, wells fargo and JP Morgan were asked to do acquisitions of bad banks. The crisis caused a lot of focus on risk management practices in ganks and venture capital inherently is taking high risks. So it basically meant that startup funding was inherently lot harder to get. Furthemore, at the time of that recession the last big recession was the previous tech bubble, so there was a lot more skepticism about the tech industry.I think one thing to realize when talking about job markets is that most people who went through the last recession are in their mid 30s. Like people who graduated college beween 2009 and 2012 are all 33 to 40. This means you have an entire generation of workers that are in their late 20s that have never seen a recession and don't ahve anything base it on. So they are quick to toss the word around. The other thing is that people who graduated between 2020 through 2022 basically went to the best job market in 50 years and its completely due to COVID stimulus. That means that people who missed the boat feel that the job market is worse than it actually is, because your expectations are anchored on that boom. LIke I don't buy for a second AI is the main reason entry level hiring is down. Sure this is part of it, but the real reason that hiring is down is that interest rates are high (meaning capital is expensive and finance firms won't throw around money) and you had massive over hiring in the panemic.[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IHLIDXUSTPSOFTDEVE)Like this is a time series plot of software engineering job postings on indeed from the FED. See how it goes up and down, that isn't normal behavior. If it was growing normally it would be slight increase over time. What his shows is the the number of job postings in the peak of 2021 over doubled relative to the prepandemic number of job postings. In 2025 its about 60 percent of the prepandemic level.There is very good chacne that tech industry might have a slower recovery than every other industry after a recession. I don't think this will be CS and Data Science as a whole, its just that a lot more hiring of those jobs are going to be taking place at non-tech companies and your not going to see these salaries of people making 200k TC straight out of school at tier one companies. Its going to be a lot more I just go my first CS job making 85k at a regional bank or home depot, and less of those fat equity grants.",

There was a lot happening still in 'the underground' side of things, as well as tech startups.But, there were hiring freezes. There was lack of funding for startups, widespread layoffs. The basic stuff you'd expect for a dwindling economy.But, the internet, and tech was more fun. Things were fresh, new; not every idea and thing created was built with a paywall behind it.Then, there was nothing even relatable to the scale of what's going on now. AI tech, social media showing what little promise, lack of privacy. A lot of it has been learning new things that re-invent the wheel over and over again.And discussing the current market allows for teams to discuss strategy. Being in the know of what's going on, and having experience in new and arising tech puts you ahead of others, and not only that, allows you to better seek talent that align with goals.Back then, there weren't job sites with jobs that will never be filled, there wasn't a massive amount of CS degrees and engineering was what people promoted. Software engineers weren't as prevalent.They weren't good economic times though. Houses where I'm from sold for about the price of a VCR after being gutted. Amazing companies and projects died soon after staring. I wouldn't say they're near as bad as what's going on now though.If you took AI back to 2008 he'd be the one boohooing.",

My cynical theory is that during COVID, so many high school kids saw these videos of influencers traveling the country in their vans, doing remote tech work, and making good money along the way, so these kids all said \"yeah that's what I want\" and entered CS/IT programs in droves. Now, the growth is gone. Entry-level hiring is still happening, but there is far more supply than demand so lots of graduates are being left without opportunities.",

Agentic AI is where companies are now adding evals, memRAGs, pre-determined prompts and answers, and much more to increase accuracy with a proper workflow to solve a bunch of different tasks. Keep a lookout in the next month and all these new industry panels should be on the ai4 website and you can see for yourself how these companies are using LLM properly https://ai4.io/videos/. Whenever you use Grok or ChatGPT on the web is just the surface level what the latest companies are using LLM for. At the end of the day these LLMs are just probabilistic neural nets trained on very generic public internet data and are not as accurate as you want them to be since they aren't trained on the specific data for your specific needs. The accuracy is based on the transformer model and it seems we might be nearing the end of that architecture's accuracy https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large\\_language\\_model. The reason why LLMs are notoriously bad with logical or math calculation is because it doesn't actually do deterministic calculations but just probabilistic \"what is the most likely words it should output is\" based on your token input, aka prompt.Also, a large majority of these companies still need software developers as they are the final guard rails of these LLM outputs. Its just that the economy is kinda cooked that's all and everyone is trying to save a buck.",

The promotion despite acknowledged slow work is your company's way of saying \"we don't really care about output as long as you show up,\" which sounds great until you realize it's professional purgatory for someone who actually wants to contribute meaningfully.The stark contrast between your startup energy and day job lethargy tells you everything you need to know. When you're passionate about work, 4 hours feels productive and energizing. When you're not, 3 days feels like slow torture. Your motivation isn't broken, it's just directed elsewhere, which is completely normal for high achievers stuck in low-challenge environments.Consider setting artificial deadlines and challenges for yourself while you figure out your exit strategy. Sometimes gamifying boring work or finding ways to exceed expectations can restore some sense of accomplishment. A service like Applyre could help you explore roles that better match your drive and interests without your current employer knowing.Your startup success proves you still have that rockstar capability when the work matters to you. Don't let corporate welfare syndrome convince you otherwise. Use this stable income to fund your side project's growth, but don't let comfort trap you in mediocrity forever. Your fulfillment matters more than easy paychecks.",

If you have a local office for a huge tech employer but aren't competitive at the 90th percentile they hire at, local statistics can be skewed upwards as well.Median salaries represent pay where half of people make more, half less - if you're just barely reaching a level, you should not be surprised if you make 5-10% less than the median.But the data is still super useful - if you can remove the big variables and still see your pay is 30% lower than what the data suggests it should be, that's an excellent sign to start looking around.",

This is after a week of working overtime to keep up by the way.I could immediately see my team eyeing up my jobs, just ready to get one over on me to be above me on the pile.Month after month, I would be bottom of the pile despite 70 hour weeks. After a while of this, I decided, you know what, I am contracted at 37 hours a week, I am not getting overtime, I am now starting at 9am and finishing at 5:30pm.My check ins and \"performance\" fell off a cliff. I was warned that my performance was down, I wrote an email response explaining that I was no longer going to be doing free overtime. I also sent a copy to HR, but separately, not CC'd in.I had work colleagues warn me in a friendly way that I'd get my butt spanked if I didn't rethink it. I was sent another email a week later demanding to know why my performance was so poor. I reiterated my working hours. The response, a bit more interesting this time, stated that the tasks I was set should be easily completed in my working week and if I thought not then I should request a meeting to discuss my performance.OK says I, let's have that meeting. And boy, did we. I had my phone in my pocket recording the meeting. It quickly descended into a meeting where my manager was downgrading sprint estimates to force it into a week's of work. Apparently, creating a process to read, modify and re-save CSV files is a sprint score of 1 suddenly - not the 8 points we did have it set to!Despite his hammering down of SPRINT estimates which actually all ended up with SPRINT score 1, he still couldn't fit it into my week. What an interesting conversation to have recorded.I didn't even get 1/4 of the way through my SPRINT, my manager discussed the idea of my lack of performance. This would go on for months. I would keep logs, he would keep complaining, he would call me with passive aggressive advice to help me out, asking if the best use of my time really was to go and see Slayer that weekend or try to catch up with my work, citing all my colleagues who were so bent out of shape that they were declaring all their work being done in the 37 hour work week. I refused to do it.Eventually, I was put on a PIP. Long story short, I failed, so I was asked to attend an HR interview citing my suitability for the role and discussion of continued employment. I filled a formal grievance at work and told them that I had no option but to resign due to the unreasonable mismanagement of workload. It took about 3 months but I was going down the constructive dismissal route. I didn't know what I was doing and was taking bits of advice from here and there. One day, HR called up and on a conference call, asked me if we could come to an agreement. In short, I settled for £12,000 and a standard reference.",

I've seen people refuse to help unless it was documented that they'd benefit (e.g., as a mentor), and I've had coworkers who'd always give very \"constructive\" feedback to try taking people down a peg * Hold the stakeholders hostage: If your manager decides who to pip, make sure you own a process that can't fail, and never set it up to be handed off.

        "body": "I don't live in the US (thank god) but I was close to when I got an offer from a company to go to the US to work as an H1B migrant worker. I can tell you this.The fault is not on the H1B visa workers, nor on the offshore engineers who earn 1/10th of the salary of an american doing the same role.The fault is in the capitalist system under which most western countries operate, where profit is the one and only thing that matters for companies and for the government.When the industrial revolution came, thousands of factory workers were replaced by machines to increase profits. Even though this was a catastrophe for the workers who were laid off, it is seen as a net positive in history because working conditions at that time were just awfil in factory. This was the first example of such a situation happening in large scale.Then later, with the advent of automation and advanced manufacturing, a large part of the remaining people working in factories has been automated by smart machines and robotics. This time we shrug it off and said \"yeah it sucks, but you should have learned how to code\". They sold people the idea that the boring, factory jobs would simply be replaced by automation, so people would just all become engineers instead. Then the entire factories were offshored to developing countries to cut cost. But since you bought into this idea, it is ok because everyone in the first world will be engineers and the low level factory work will be done by the third world.More or less by the time I was in university it was already becoming a well known fact that engineering jobs were also starting to become offshored. I guess US and Europe were once again sold the idea that it was ok, because now the third world would provide the manufacturing and engineering, and the first world would be only designing the products (why do you think so many products nowadays say \"designed in France/ designed in California/ designed in Flanders\"?).But the greed of the capitalist system knows no limits. It has no concept of loyalty for its citizens. If allowed, companies will offshore every single job that can be done remotely to cut costs. And for the rest that need to be done manually, they will probably deploy robots autonomously or teleoperated (by people in the third wolrd of course).Yes, eventually companies will consist only of the owners, who will own all of the capital and be an elite iltra-rich minority in society. The rest of the population will be a very thin middle class, and a majority of lower class, who will be kept alive by providing them with the minimal necessities just so they can keep consuming, but they will probably own nothing since most of the wealth like businesses and houses will be owned by huge corporations.You might think this is all some insane idea but if you look in the news, with recent massive layoffs, amazon warehouse workers, ai replacing desk receptionists at hotels, it seems this is not just a dystopian future, but a reality that day by day gets closer to us.What is the solution then? Well, for me I don't have enough sympathy for society to even fight for a change or an improvement. I believe it's going in a downward spiral and eventually I too will be laid off because AI will make my job easily replaced by an offshore engineer with an ai tool. So until that day, I'm just riding the wave and enjoying while I can. When the day finally comes for me, I'll become homeless too and live off of my car or in the street I guess.",

Founder gets frustrated, admits he needs a more experienced dev. So he replaces the intern. Maybe there is an element like that in this story.But you write “improve the communication part even though it's pretty much useless for my work” - this is not true. Communication is part of engineering work, and maybe something you need to improve on.",

        "body": "Despite what it may say on a job posting, most of the requirements aren’t actually requirements. Job posting requirements are usually a wish list for the perfect candidate and should be treated as such. The person hired almost never meets all the requirements.That said, yeah, if you’re self taught or even a bootcamp grad the market is not going to be a kind place for you right now. Part of a good hiring process is about reducing risk. Generally, for entry level positions, candidates with CS degrees are stronger hires than non-CS degree candidates. There’s still strong candidates in both groups, but their tend to be fewer really terrible candidates who have a CS degree since many of them were flushed out in college.Right now there’s a lot of candidates with CS degrees looking for jobs, so most companies don’t have a ton of incentive to look in that more risky pool of candidates.As someone who broke into the industry over a decade ago with no degree, I really do wish I had something better to tell you, but honestly, that’s just where the market is at right now.The best advice I can give you is:- Dont let the CS degree requirement in a job posting deter you from applying. If you feel like you can do the job and you meet 60%-70% of the requirements, just apply. Realize it’s a long shot and don’t get your hopes up, but it doesn’t hurt to shoot off a resume. You never know.- You need to focus on getting your foot in the door anywhere. Focus on smaller companies that aren’t “tech” companies. You need to get a job on your resume that says “developer”, “software engineer”, or something like that. Remember what I said earlier about risk? If you can show that someone else paid you for a year to be a developer, that tells other companies that, on some level, you can do the job, which reduces risk. Again, I realize you’re probably applying to just about anything you can, but I want to emphasize that if your goal is really to break into the industry then you should prioritize getting experience in the field on your resume above all else.",

I think that the companies that hyper-fixate on not hiring junior engineers and using AI as a quick fix will die. I include Amazon, Meta, maybe even Google in this list, for the sole reason that outside of AI you can probably count the new service or major product launches that any average person has heard of from any of them on one hand. It's all a crux to keep the share price high, at a time where MBA's seem to be ruling tech.What I can see happening is a company or two, maybe more emerging, and eating their lunch. It might be an innovation in search, a social network that dooms Facebook and Instagram, a marketplace that dominates the market, or maybe even something totally new. They'll look at how directionless big tech is, and they'll build something great from a hoard of juniors with respectful senior leadership. Those companies will be what people aspire to work for, relegating FAANG to Boomer Tech.Ultimately, engineers don't *need* to be employed. They could build something, or they could make their own luck. A shift in the stock market and a downturn in tech might be enough for VC's to think that big tech has had its day, and for them to invest elsewhere - causing a shift towards new tech.",

But most companies aren't.FWIW - most places I've been at stopped hiring juniors due to belt tightening.

Maybe the goals aren't to get to \"the next levels\", but you'll need to have goals nevertheless. Doesn't mean they need to force you to write 15 SMART goals with metrics and everything, but still.Companies that do career ladders well will have a concept of \"career role\" or \"terminal\" role. That's the place you need to get to if you want to stay there forever. At most companies that do this, that's a mid to high senior level.That means that until you are at that mid to high senior, a part of your job is to get better until you are. That means goals and progress. If you don't want to do that, you're out.Once you get to the terminal level, things get a bit more nuanced. You no longer need to work toward your next promotion. You can say \"I'll be a senior my entire life\". If you're ok with that and won't complain if all you get are cost of living adjustments, and never get to Staff/Principal, that's fine. But you still need to have goals and move forward. Why? Skill inflation. Someone who was a high senior in 2010 isn't the same as someone in 2020. The world changes, technologies change, there's more resources, like AI. So the bar is continually raising. To stay at the same \"level\" as everyone else relatively, you have to keep growing, else you're going backward. That's why there's some level of age discrimination: when you're young you're kind of at the bar by default because you didn't have time to regress. But as you get older, if you don't keep up, you fall behind. And a lot of people do.The goals you set are there to make sure you stay at the bar. As a mid to high senior your job is more than just taking a ticket and executing, too. You'll be tasked with doing project work, collaboration, etc, and those become goals too, in addition to learning, coaching, and various other responsibilities at that level.But if you want to come in at work, look at Jira/Linear, pick the ticket at the top of the queue, write the code, open a pull request, pick the next ticket, and repeat until its time to go home... I'm sorry to say, but fewer and fewer companies are willing to pay for that. Many never did.",

The main thing I hate is the commute, but thankfully my boss is pretty flexible. The usual in-office days are Tuesday through Thursday, but he's fine with me doing Monday through Wednesday. I like to get it out of the way sooner, and since we only have two cars between three adults (my MIL lives with us and one of the cars is hers) it works better for our schedule. Technically I also only need to be in for 50% of my time, so some days I'll head home for lunch and work remote the rest of the day. My boss' general stance is as long as it doesn't become an issue for him, he doesn't care how we handle ourselves with regards to how much were in the office.I very much preferred to work remote, but this place also has a very generous PTO policy, sick time that's separate from the PTO, other forms of leave that I may find useful, and they actually have a pension, so it's worth putting up with the in-office requirement for me. I too am generally pretty introverted, but you sort of build a tolerance for it after a bit and learn when you need to compartmentalize. I also do feel like I know more folks here than other places I started and was fully remote, which can be nice.If anything, be thankful it's not a full five days in the office.",

A year could go by, and they \"may not have the budget\" to convert you yet. So then it becomes two years. Then three. And so on...Yes there are success stories of FTE conversion, but don't have that as an expectation.And if your manager changes at any point, you're basically at square one.

I took notes on the amount of gaslighting too - I was told I was asking too many questions and not working independently enough, yet when i didn’t mind read, I would have to do it all over again. Wound up getting laid off in January because that entire project lead to a bad review in 2023. Yes, I was laid off in 2025 for a bad review two years ago from a team I wasn’t on anymore. Needless to say, I have very little interest in working for Microsoft again.",

It's objectively a fault on the lead's ability to make everyone on their team succeed. It may or may not be the \"right\" decision for the project, but in no way is being on a team that doesn't have the time or energy to onboard you, your fault. Business can be cold, and management pressure basically squeezes you as a tech lead: you give the managers what they want, or you're out, so when someone questions the plan, or tries to bring new ideas, it's difficult to entertain those ideas unless they are bringing new information to the table that change assumptions, and the right time is during planning.Thus, don't let any of this be a reflection on you! It just doesn't work out on some teams. Maybe that's your fault, maybe it's the team or companies fault, but does it really matter? I don't think so. This is a stressful job that asks a lot out of us, and the what you experienced happens to a lot of devs, and has happened to me on both sides of the table.Dust off your resume, and get ready to apply. 3 years is good experience, if you focus on applications, you'll likely find something else.",

You and your senior with 10+ years of experience might have seen a lot, but there is still more you haven't seen. The idea that 2 heads are better than 1 is true. Not even the best dev can think of every edge case or they sometimes fall down rabbit holes and waste a bunch of time on nonsense features no one cares about. That is really why it's always good to get a second opinion at the very least as a sanity check.Without tight feedback loops you might really waste more time on building the wrong thing. That's the whole point on why Agile processes exist!Anyway, it's not you.",

Even though, ostensibly, they have junior and intern level openings, they usually can't afford to use those as more than seasonal positions for specific deliverables. So it's really not uncommon for a fiscal quarter to approach and for them to lay off staff to compensate for venture capital shortfalls or profitability overestimates.Another thing is that junior and intern level staff are a drain on precious resources the start-up cannot afford to bleed out. So, even though they do hire newer programmers, they're *hoping* they can get a new mid or potential leadership candidate for minimal cost. They usually can afford to keep rolling that slot machine every few seasons. So start-ups and consultancies are (often but not always) incredibly hard places to start out, despite their need to hire to appeal to investors or receive grants for training.",

This is likely true only if you have other offers, or if you're willing to forego the only offer you have and you'd rather continue looking without accepting. Keep in mind you can accept *and* continue looking.I recommend against negotiating if this is your only offer.Also worth considering:The company may have a few candidates they are interested in, of whom you are their first pick. If aren't willing to accept the $80k but their number 2 candidate is, they may not increase their offer to land you. It depends on whether the company thinks $10k-$20k is worth their #1 vs candidate over their #2In today's tech world, there are lots of entry level candidates and few entry level jobs. It is a buyer's market right now for new grads (you, the candidate, are selling).Lastly, imo, $80k starting now vs $100k starting in 3 months is likely going to come out pretty even in the long run. Two reasons for this:1 - After 1 year, the $80k/yr earned you $80k. After waiting 3 months to land a $100k/yr job, you'll earn 9 months of the $100k/yr job with is $67k. After 2 years: it's $160k vs $166k.2 - The sooner you reach the ~2 year mark, the sooner you can look for a new job and make a very large pay increase without being seen as a job hopper, changing too quickly and having little loyalty.It may even take longer than 3 months to land a $100k job.My advice, accept and optionally keep interviewing.",

I’ve been slipping over the years in performance as well. But when I code my own I’d use to get tickets were all customer facing. (If X ui element is touched Y happens) But I’m progressively finding myself dealing with more and more developer specific issues on my plate. I had a ticket I sent back because it was literally “Verify the IDE the developers use works”. I think if VS code didn’t work Microsoft would be on fire. Or a favorite of mine “Verify we support X package” but when I talk to dev the use case for the package is its present on the system, but the customer doesn’t touch it.

I would just say if you are able to do software development and write code, you are smart enough to be a manual or automation QA. If you weren't \"getting it\" odds are there are some structural problems in your QA department that have nothing to do with you.

I recommend you start trying to think of simple project ideas as you go about your life. You will start to notice little things that are a little annoying and can be simplified, or think \"What if I had a tool to help me do \\_\\_\\_?\" The best projects, imo, are ones that solve an actual problem or serve an actual purpose in your day-to-day life. It shows that you're always thinking about how you can harness CS to improve some pain point, and you take action to do so. You can start off with something really simple, since you're pretty new to the field. Maybe kind of overdone, but a pomodoro timer is an example of a potential project - someone thought, \"I wish there was a way I could time my study sessions to maximize productivity,\" and then took action and coded something up to do it. The more unique and personal this idea is to you, the better. Lastly, something important to note is that you likely won't get all the knowledge you need in your classes. You're more than likely going to have to learn some stuff on your own, but luckily, YouTube makes that fairly easy!",

When you're a freshman it's harder, they mostly go for sophomores and juniors since they're closer to grad and thus return the company's investment quicker.If you're a freshman now, it sets a pretty good schedule for you. If you can't get an internship, which is usually the case, you spend the first year working on projects for the resume, and then use that for internships the next two years, and try to get a return offer after grad from one of those. When you're a sophomore, set yourself a fixed (# of apps) daily goal, even if small, and start.As for the projects themselves, I can't tell you what to make, but I'd started with a website with three.js. It was fun to write thanks to Three, it lightly dabbled in the process of hosting it etc., and it resulted in something permanent online, which imo is more satisfying than a local terminal program unless that serves a real use. Even better if you do something with even a small amount of users, so you can get started on databases.If you want to go more hardware/embedded CS, look into making an RC with as many functional systems you can put into it. I made one last year that I remotely (from the library lmao) attended some in person courses with and had classmates charge it in the room. Very transferable to swe? Not really, realistically. But it made me get to know many people and boomed my enthusiasm, and you really need that.TLDR don't care about my experiences: For your projects I'd recommend trying to solve a real problem but realistically, people usually fail to find something like that, you just need to start with anything to fill the resume and get the habit going.",

        "body": "Welcome to an awesome field! I also did C++ in high school xDAs for projects, there are a few things you can do now that you're comfortable with the basics:1. Expand on uni projects, especially those you find interesting. You're already doing them, you can work on them further and put 'em on GitHub.2. Think of whatever CS topic you enjoy or think you might enjoy (gaming, data analysis, web development) and/or real-life topic (history, finance, music, medical) and make something related. Doesn't matter if it's overdone (web shop, library record keeping) or novel, do something you'll like :)3. Don't go too big, you'll burn yourself out.4. On a similar note as 3, don't worry about perfection. Make something perfectable first.5. Use Git with all of your projects (publishable or not), get in the habit of writing good commit messages, and push everything to GitHub (and/or GitLab, if you want). These are greay habits for later. I think only 20% of my repos are public.Don't worry about publishing a project. Play around, take tutorials, make dumb scripts, and write whatever code comes to mind. Maybe some of it will be interesting enough for you to work on it further and take public.You can also try Advent of Code for code challenges similar to what you know (algorithms, data structures), with more flexibility than LeetCode/CodeWars. You can make your solutions public too (not the inputs!).You're very young and have tons of time to find your niche(s), so experiment early and cheaply.Things to keep in mind:- Try learning testing (unit testing especially) early, it's insanely useful and highly required in industry.- As mentioned, use Git with all of your projects.- Don't let LLMs like ChatGPT write for you. Especially this early, your skills will stagnate. This includes BOTH code and regular text (comments, commit messages, README files).- Do use ChatGPT to learn what you don't know, but also read documentation. Both are very useful skills.- Write a Readme for all of your projects (not right away, but over time). Markdown and documentation are both very useful in industry, and for those repositories you make public, READMEs are super important (arguably more so than the code).Don't overwork yourself into early burnout. Work on what you enjoy (and obviously your actual uni work), and if something is good enough, feel free to make it public. But until then, explore as many areas of CS as you can (embedded, low-level, programming language theory, AI (many subfields here), web development (front and back), operations/devops & Cloud (maybe a bit later), desktop applications (like your console apps), etc.).There's no deadline for this, do it in your own time :)",

It’s literally why inflation exists. I employ you at market rate. (Once)I try keep you as long as possible because pay is gradual and the system tells you to stay for years. (Annual change 1 - 5%)Then I raise prices (annual change 5 - whatever works %)= margins go up. If I raise prices and my own costs (your salary) I would have to exceed inflation at a rate where customers/clients would leave.Edit:When I say I, I’m being figurative.

You will inevitably be looked at by a few as a bad guy, that's just life. But if you know how to properly manage, people will defend you like crazy. I've run into people I used to manage that I hadn't seen in a decade come up excited to see me and wish me well and tell me how much I helped them. It's just about standing on your business, and being a good person. Being a good manager tends to take a lot of extra work over being a regular run of the mill manager. You need to be able to sus out your workers' primary strengths and weaknesses, help them with roadblocks, and effectively communicate to your superiors what realistic goals look like. Many managers just want to look good and will place unrealistic expectations on workers and delegate tasks they should be handling themselves given the workloads. TLDR, you can totally be a \"good guy\" manager, assuming your company isn't shit.",

But you can lead and manage without being the bad guy.I have also observed that the middle managers and junior executives will tend to expect their lower managers to be \"bad guys\" (see cultural expectation above), so if you resist being a jerk somehow this makes you a bad manager, and your head will be on the chopping block if somebody needs to be let go.Very glad I don't work in software development anymore.",

Now, given that it's hard to find jobs right now, what I would do instead of arguing and looking retroactively, is at least pretending to be coopeartive, and becoming proactive about planning out what you're going to be doing and making sure your boss is on board with it. So instead of saying \"you're wrong, look at everything I did\", you should say \"huh, I'm sorry that I haven't been meeting your standards - I'll get on that. I think what would be good then is if, as I'm planning out my day/week, I give you a summary of everything I'm looking to tackle and we can make sure I'm working on the right things and at the right pace\".So every day, you start off by looking at what tickets you're going to work on, and you send your boss a slack saying \"Today I'm tackling x, y and z. Is there anything else you'd like me to focus on today?\".Now, to give your bosses' some benefit of the doubt: it might very well be that 2-5 tickets a day isn't enough. That maybe she expects 5-10 tickets a day and you're just working too slowly.",

You could say something like, I think I work slower then other people in the organization because I close an average of 5 tickets each day or hour or whatever. What do you think I should be my average? Tell your manager what you do to make sure your work is done to a high standard (you double check your work before you close them or maybe you spend additional time with clients,etc). Ask your manager for feedback about your work and be willing to change. Try not to be defensive if your manager gives you honest feedback or make excuses. It can be helpful to ask for suggestions on how to improve. (Thank you for letting me know I am closing 25% less tickets then my colleagues, is there training available to me to improve my speed.)If you have been diligent during your work day and you are not as fast as other team members, your manager should be able to explain that to you. Nobody wants a micro-manager for a boss and bosses don’t want to micro-manage. They want to have confidence each member of the team is producing the work they are paid to do. The way to give your manager confidence you are doing your job capably is to do your job capably.I know it’s difficult to start this conversation, but I’m pretty sure you will feel better once you have a discussion with your manager.

Why would the previous manager expect you to be awake or even wake up for his call? I never had this issue before but this time I work remotely for an APAC team and there are many cultural differences in terms of working hours etc. I could handle it the first two years as I usually don't mind working extra hours and the people were generally nice, even though there were a lot of issues like cultural differences, no other woman in the whole department etc. Last year my ex manager got promoted so another guy took his place and I ve been reporting to this new guy. The situation is exactly like yours. Continuously moving targets to always make me feel inadequate, never praising any kind of work I do even though the previous manager and my manager 's manager were giving me very good reviews etc. He is exactly like your current manager, giving no clear expectations, no clear communication and always saying that I should have thought of XYZ from the start. I don't mind feedback and I actually implement a lot of his technical feedback. It's the continuous subtle accusation about lack of professionalism, carelessness etc. there were many times that I was the only one looking at prod issues, I would resolve them, put a summary in public channels of what was the issue and how i resolved it, and then instead of getting a \" good job for figuring this out\", I would have to explain to him why did it take me 2 hours to resolve for example instead of 1. But what REALLY pisses me off is that he doesn't practice what he preaches about professionalism. He will release stuff without testing, release stuff without updating the database to be on the same version etc. But no one tells him anything because the rest of them are nice people. Anyway there is not much we can do. I actually did go to my previous manager and asked him if I could report back to him. I didn't go into details about my current manager though, I tried to avoid all the extra drama. I just want to get out of this situation. He said yes and he would request for the change. So I guess it helped having someone higher up that I had worked with in the past and he knows me already. But it's been a few weeks and nothing has happened. Maybe he didn't think it was urgent. I think we are hiring now and he might want to give him new direct reports from the new hire before changing me back to him, I don't know. I will ask again and probably this time I will be more specific about what the issue is, because I can't keep asking without giving concrete reasons. It's hard though to do it without making yourself looking like the one who is just complaining or the problematic one. So I am also looking for a new job, but the job market sucks. I think though we don't really have a choice, just have to keep looking. Good luck, I hope you find a better manager or a better job :folded_hands_light_skin_tone::folded_hands_light_skin_tone: let us know how it goes.",

Will you be in the top 10-30% of AI/ML masters graduates (remember, you'll also compete with phds, and some very smart high schoolers)? You might be, but you can start proving that to yourself doing self-study today (I really liked the Stanford NLP course with Christopher Manning on YouTube back in 2022 if you want something free to try out. If you're going to do it, do every problem they assign in homework. Half-assing it is a waste of time)I think it's very likely there are overlooked sections of the market where entry level isn't that bad. If your whole goal is getting a job, find one of those overlooked skills to get very good at (which might involve getting a masters)",

(If you know tech stack thats plus, but over last 2 years we've hired plenty that didn't over prob more tech savvy candiate given x person was a better personality, communication skills, etc)4. Market is trash no denying that but eod value does not come from job and never will.",

It's broken out into sections for each level of engineering, so you'd definitely get a lot of mileage out of it.\\- Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Mark Richards and Neal Ford. This is a little more advanced, and you probably wouldn't need the last third that talks more about selling your architectural vision, but it's a great overview of the different kinds of distributed architectures you'll encounter in the wild.\\- A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout. Really quick read and an implied rebuttal to Clean Code by Bob Martin. I really enjoyed this one and it provides a good framework for how to think when writing code.The reason I've read way too many software books is because I host a podcast called Book Overflow ([YouTube link here](https://www.youtube.com/@BookOverflowPod), but we're on every major platform) where each week my co-host and I read and discuss a new tech book. We've done episodes on all the books I've listed, and have even interviewed every one of their authors! If you don't have time to read the whole books, you might get a lot of insight from just listening to the episodes!",

No other part is more critical to the success of the project.”**— Fred Brooks, \"No Silver Bullet: Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering\" (1986)*Software is created to fulfill stakeholders’ objectives. To achieve that, you need to understand and document three key aspects: WHO your stakeholders are, WHAT their objectives are, and WHY those objectives matter. Most failed projects don’t fail in code; they fail in understanding what the stakeholders actually need.\"Software Requirements Essentials\" by Karl Wiegers and Candase Hokanson is short, accessible, and a great introduction.The \"bible\" of the field is Karl Wiegers’ classic \"Software Requirements\" (now in its 3rd edition, co-authored with Joy Beatty). It covers everything from stakeholder analysis to requirements elicitation techniques to use cases and beyond. It’s comprehensive, methodical, and full of real-world examples.Focusing on stakeholders and requirements makes you a better software engineer regardless of your tech stack or methodology.",

And you worked on the same embedded stuff twice, which means you have a considerable amount of time spent. Even if it felt like you were relearning everything the second time, I can almost guarantee you that you were picking it up way faster than someone green. And that you still have a lot of latent knowledge in the area.I would try and rebrand yourself as a yocto embedded guy, with a bunch of extra nice to haves -- Rust, etc. Also try applying to different sized companies. Startups love guys who have a ton of different experience in different domains. Some really large (non-elite) companies, have less strict requirements because you'll be doing exactly on thing over and over, etc. The market sucks, the market is a statistical analysis that really doesn't represent any one person's experience.Also, (and it's no one's business but yours) but it seems like you have a lot going on outside of work being the only bread winner, only driver, doing all the chores, etc. It may be that the stress of whatever you have going on at home is bleeding into your career anxieties. It might be worth trying to find a solution/compromise to one or more of those problems to see if it helps with workday pressures as a side effect. Something to think about as your managing everything.Good luck! Not sure if any of my advice was that practical, but hopefully something in there helped.",

I graduated in CS this year and I've felt like my degree (even before I got it) opened doors for me, but then again, I didn't go the SWE route. I intended to be a programmer when I first enrolled in CS back in 2019, but after my freshman year I realized that coding for a living wasn't for me- just as a hobby. I stayed in school because I was more than halfway done with my bachelor's and I didn't want all of that money to go to waste. In my junior year, I applied to an IT internship and I ended up getting it. I continued to work in IT for 2 years, got my bachelors (with my minor being in IT), and now I'm a Network Engineer making $60,000. Even before I got promoted to engineer, I got offers to do tech sales and even got to do some traveling for it. I would've not gotten those opportunities if my anticipated degree wasn't listed in my resume.However, someone else's experience may be different from mine- maybe they've worked unpaid internships and now they can't get hired anywhere. I don't want to invalidate anyone's experiences, but please understand that there's a whole set of variables that impact the job market for everyone- as it is different in every city, and country especially. Maybe if you're only concerned about job outlook, compare CS' outlook with ME/Aero and see which is better. I chose CS because I love computers and nothing else mattered to me, but I know everyone has their own reasons.",

Also, practice mock interviews in real time with peers or mentors getting reps in a simulated high-pressure setting can rewire that freeze response.

        "body": "That depends.If you're not particularly struggling to get interviews, then you have the power to reject offers and just continue interviewing until you find one that fits your wants. That's why it's called a \"job search\", you're searching for the right job.If you're barely getting interviews at all, and this startup was your 1 and only opportunity you've had in months, you'd be crazy to turn it down.It all comes down to how you're doing in your job search. There are people out there who have done hundreds of applications over the course of several months who would die for that chance. But there's also people out there that are getting interviews just fine that probably wouldn't bother.One thing I will add is don't make up your mind from online reviews. Always make up your mind based on first-hand evidence after talking with your hiring manager, and some SWE's you'd be working with. The reverse interview is the most important part of the interview.You never know, maybe the vibes you get from this startup are completely different once you actually talk to them. Things constantly change, especially in the startup world, and places like Glassdoor tend to attract people that have things to complain about so it always skews negative.One startup I was interviewing had a bunch of negative reviews saying it was a boys club, and if you weren't buddy buddy with the CEO you would never get good raises or promotions. When I actually spoke with people at the company, thats not the vibe I got at all, so I joined despite those reviews. I'm extremely glad I did. I bet those reviews were just from salty employees bad at their job, because I'm the last person to be \"buddy buddy\" with anyone at work, especially the CEO, but I got amazing raises and several promotions. I've had 2 of the biggest raises of my career at that company.So I'd encourage you at least humor it, and walk into it with good intentions. If when you speak to these people its as terrible as what you've read say, *then* you can reject them.",

To me, the long term financial freedom you gain, namely the ability to retire early, outweighs the temporary grind but not everyone can afford to go all in. If you a have a young family for example I imagine it’s incredibly hard to interview grind or to even willingly take on the work life balance of big tech so it isn’t purely a financial choice.",

        "body": "I would suggest giving it a shot. Early in my career I worked for mostly very small companies, under 100 employees with the largest being maybe 400. I like/liked the small team environment and didn't think I'd take to huge company life, but like yourself I ended up feeling bored, limited and dead-ended. I ended up taking on offer with a big tech company working as a manufacturing-adjacent software engineer (factory automation, hardware QA, test instrumentation). Huge perspective shift, both a personal and professional level up. I was fortunate (IMO) in that my role had a lot of field support so I ended up in factories troubleshooting and deploying software and equipment on the assembly lines, which wasn't really where I expected to find myself with a CS degree. Your mileage may vary, obviously, but the difference between a small and very large scale organization is something that is worth experiencing to expand your perspective on how work gets done in different environments. For me it was very interesting to see how the biggest and best companies make the biggest and best products. The downsides were considerably more friction, inefficiency and socializing/soft skills just to get anything done, it always felt like I was interacting and negotiating with dozens of people to get anything done vs. just quietly grinding out code on a \\~10 person team. That took a lot of getting used to and was honestly exhausting, and at times it was more of a lifestyle than a job. The upside to that was a lot more money, and with some financial planning and investing I was able to retire after ten years.If you are feeling bored and nothing is tying you down then take the shot, the worst thing that can happen is you'll hate it but if they're paying you much more than your current job, put the difference in a war chest so you can afford to bridge the gap if you have to bail. You don't mention where you live but there's a harsh reality that the best paying, most interesting jobs are clustered in a few cities so realistically this may require relocation which is a bigger commitment and disruption to your life, and puts you in an awkward spot if you really don't like it.",

The question of how to pay for school has already been answered by the GI bill, but the question of “what does your life look like currently” hasn’t. Simply put, if you don’t own a house, don’t have kids/are married and don’t have a ton of responsibilities outside of work, you might be able to go to a brick and mortar school after graduating from the community college you are currently going to and be better off for your goals if you chose a tier 2 or higher school. If you have kids, a house, etc, and need to work while you are in school, tier 4 is your best option for both personal time and money. tl;dr: it matters a bit but only if you’re in those top 2 tiers. *this includes their online only options too",

Attend GaTech for the Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS) — Total Tuition: <$10k USDI’d attend GaTech for OMSCS after WGU because:* The better reputation of GaTech* Fill in any gaps*Note: It’s possible to complete this combo in ~4-6 years, and you can land a job while working on the masters*",

The market was probably better when I got the job, but regardless, pursuing a career in tech is not automatically a lifetime sentence of unemployment. If I were asking myself the same thing today, given my experience so far, I’d say:- remember many of these articles are written to get attention and increase metrics for whoever published it- big tech companies and the tech industry in general do not represent the vast majority of the actual jobs you’re going to find- doesn’t matter what industry or career you end up with, you’re going to have to figure out how to cut through the demotivating and discouraging bs and realize the knowledge and experience you acquire for your career (whether by a degree or otherwise) is simply a set of skills you’ll always be developing over time to improve your “employability”; countless people have walked your path; and there is no cutoff date/circumstances for allowing more people into the field- identify your expectations and work on adjusting those rather than letting a job market always in flux dictate your life choices - for example, do you expect to graduate with a degree and immediately get a 6 figure job offer? If so, you’ll need to honestly explore your thinking behind that expectation and adjust accordingly. “Expectations are premeditated resentments” - this applies to your career, job, education, professional relationships, everything. If you go into it determined to get something specific out of it, you’re probably going to be disappointed. But if you go into it knowing more about what challenges you are likely to face (exposed by the discouraging articles and posts), you’ll be able to spend more time preparing to face them instead of just trying to hit arbitrary benchmarks you think should get you a job (such as leetcode grinding for x hours every day/week, knowing certain languages/frameworks, which degree you get, etc)Modal of the story - do you WANT to pursue this career path? If it was as “easy” to do as any other job you’re already qualified for, and paid at least a living wage, would you still want to do it? If the answer is yes, start thinking about the scary stories and predictions as clickbait and YOU DO YOU BOO",

It's certainly good to have if your job involves running GUI tools on Linux since you'll be able to get further debugging things yourself if you're comfortable with the command line as well. Most people get by learning this stuff on the job.",

Back to the example, are you just asking how to center a div, or are you asking how to center a div in the containing element, because you tried adding spacers, but that didn't seem to work.Are you constantly asking about the same thing? If you asked how to center a div in the containing element yesterday, why can't you figure it out today?What's the overall situation? Is your mentor under a tight deadline for something else? If so, he might be short just because he has more pressing issues to deal with.Did you read the error? The error usually outright tells you what's wrong. And if not, it will provide clues as to where to look.Do you know your tools? Are your packages cached? Do you need authentication to access your company's package repository? Did you even install the dependencies? Some ecosystems download packages as part of a build, some don't.However, if you've covered the above, you *should* be good.

In-person career fairs are how I got all my opportunity.Half the CS advice is wrong because it's by students and cosplayers who never got hired in CS.On your own time, you can learn tech stacks. Is a reasonable idea. Recruiters don't care about and won't look at your GitHub. I have never listed mine. If you can hold a conversation and talk through the programming language and common software it uses, you're in good shape. You still have to get to the interview stage and the #1 way to help that is land an internship. At this point, your grades matter. Competition is fierce. Be willing to relocate and sublease.Most jobs are in 1 of C# or Java or TypeScript/JavaScript, with Python for support. Learn a database such as Postgres and writing CRUD to it. I'd hope your classes cover this. Don't try to learn everything. Look at job descriptions and see what they ask for. You don't need 30/30 requirements but a few are mandatory.

Go to career fairs, school events, and as much as I hate it, cold network with the occasional LinkedIn recruiter. It works sometimes.

Yes, I always hated when people said that. 'Just learn'. Not that easy, especially when you get trapped in tutorial hell. Follow a couple of tutorials and then try to make something on your own.

I lost some interviews because I did not clarify before I started solving stuff.You also want to be correct though. Something I did wrong was not asking \"do you mind if I take a minute or two to think?\" And just be quiet and focus. Ask questions and focus. Competitive programmer part. Unfortunately due to the time constraint, it's like a competition. You have to figure out how to make a MVP in a short time, and be able to explain how you would do more given more time. Making it work and covering general edgecadds and showing awareness of stuff you can't cover in 15-30 mins is probably what would of improved my odds. I practiced this by doing LC easies and timing myself for 10 mins.For the other code stuff.

I’ve been lied to about contact renewals before. This was by contacting management. I was told s contact had been renewed for another year, only to learn “it’s pretty much done” after joining. I joined in August. It was supposed to be renewed for January. By February, the client renewed, but they dictated a lot of new terms. It ended up being good for me. I moved to an internal team (still a contractor) rather than being on a contracting team. I was also at a small government contractor that similarly lied about contract state to people. Some people are now out of work because of lack of honesty. The amount of arrogance and lack of concern for people was appalling.",

That’s before we get to the studies that show commuting even 40 minutes reduces job satisfaction significantly enough that you’d have to earn nearly double to be just as happy. With other studies from Sean Achors research on happiness that show the happier the staff, the more productive. So, what immediately happens is you’re more likely to fail onsite. Because you have to maintain a lot for your mood.If those things are ok, then you have to deal with those who struggle to socialise outside of work and tend to like the office from the social aspect. By that I mean, they think this is the place to get all their social fill and interrupt, talk about shit I don’t care about, gossip, and generally make the day worse purely for their own benefit. That’s if they’re not disrupting you, there’s equal studies from the nords on the open office plan being cancer for focus. Anyways, that’s how I feel about it. When you’re onsite, suddenly your requirements expand 10 fold. — worked remote for 8 years, also been on site for 8 years prior. That’s just my opinion though. Hope it goes well either way.Edit: format, and appending, then telling you they’ll make you manager doesn’t mean much. And for only 10k more? I dunno. Work life balance will give you the progression as you’ll have the energy to keep going.",

Without a substantial pay increase that would improve your overall quality of life there just isn't any benefit to more stress and in-office working.",
