SQL Server actually has columnar storage, which is useful for OLAP workloads, through using the \"columnstore indexes\".3. Extract logic: Python, could use some higher level framework like Meltano or dlt.4. Transformation logic: DBT, could be replaced with SQLMesh.5. Orchestration: Dagster.6. Git server: Gitea, could be replaced with newer fork Forgejo.7. Dashboarding: Metabase. It is much easier to use than Superset.8. Ad-hoc analysis: SQL, Python or R.It worked perfectly fine on a single production server, although it was planned to split it into one server for production pipelines and one server for ad-hoc analytics, for more production safety.",

This isn’t meant to trash open source services, it’s just to highlight you can be very successful and happy sticking with those tools, and thousands of companies do this and are very happy.

We validate a billion+ records daily and upload via api using that approach of chunking and batching and don’t use more than 10gbs of RAM on a single node.Small files can be a real pain in the ass for performance if you end up using them in Spark or Trino…",

Cloud hides it by allowing your compute to be elastic but it is either increasing teams budget or masking real issue. Atleast on-prem problems get exposed.I might be wrong but all the problems you mentioned sound like good things to have. eg whenever possible split a large workload in smaller workloads for easier repeatability, easier scheduling etc.Generally what I recommend1. QA should be similar to PROD.2. Have automated load tests to know breaking points.3. Good observability similar to services with proactive monitoring.4. Good data contracts (you already have them).5. Repeatable fixed size workloads through out the pipeline (you can have a generic splitter component that you can hook to any of your stages to ensure that any component always gets regulated input).Honestly the problems that you highlighted light up my eyes, DEs are excited to solve these problems :)All the best!",

No.The original problem was two fold: 1) reporting was being done against transactional databases which slowed those transactional systems down noticeably and 2) it’s wasn’t spreadsheets it was extracts. Systems were very siloed in the pre-ERP days and all of these systems needed to be connected with data extracts - often time for reporting purposes. The extracts all were done at different times causing massive data quality issues. Data warehousing was invented to deal with these two issues. Spreadsheet technology was just ramping up at this time, and would soon become yet another challenge for data professions, but it was not the original challenge. Remember, in the pre-1980s the average office worker didn’t have a computer.Edit: the star schema was added early on to help BI queries execute more efficiently on database platforms at the time (and be more understandable to analysts as PCs became more widespread in the workforce). Star schemas are still very important today, but as our computing resources have grown the performance benefits are not quite as apparent.",

Secondly, if you have enough motivation to spend the time to write down a test, why not already include the deduplication logic in your DAG from the beginning? Finally, a little detail, QUALIFY is not standard SQL, Spark or Trino don't support it for example. In your first use, you should be able to replace it with WHERE, since you computed the window aggregation in a CTE before. In the second use, you could use a CTE with a WHERE too.P.S.: I think it should be possible to have an automatic fix when the test fail. Put your test macro as an if condition in your DAG, it triggers the fix CTE when it is true. You can also send an alert when it happens.",

If it is a real issue, you add a test in the the data quality / user acceptance test suite to keep tabs the issue. Then either you fix it or wait for upstream to fix it.

One of the goals here is to surface known issues — and fix them safely — without breaking the stream.QUALIFY— good catch. I chose it for clarity/readability since it's native to Snowflake, but you’re totally right that it’s not portable. A WHERE would work just as well in the example And triggering fixes via orchestration? Definitely worth exploring",

And Kafka is excellent for the right job, but sometimes he is really overselling Kafka as one-tool-to-rule-them-all.Scalable - absolutely. Easy to query - not so much. Cheap way to store data - probably not.Instead of seeing Kafka as a viable solution for this use problem (which I really don't think it is), then I would ask about like what are the characteristics of the data, size of data, the query patterns (raw data or aggregated) and who's gonna query data to determine the right strategy.Other solutions could be to load (aggregated) data to a warehouse or use a lakehouse architecture with S3 as the storage layer and a table format like Delta Lake or Iceberg on top of that. Just examples. Depending on requirements there may be other solutions that are better.",

However, with the growing interest in leveraging public datasets to enrich LLMs, the community around scraping has expanded significantly. Personally, I’ve had good success using Selenium for sites with a stable and predictable structure. I’ve also built a more advanced scraping project using Puppeteer, which addresses many of the scenarios you outlined. It’s taken nearly a year to bring it to a point where I’d rate it around 8/10 in terms of robustness. Once it's fully polished and validated by a broader audience, I plan to open source it on GitHub.",

Objectively speaking, a DL/DLH offers the most flexibility and range of technologies. Many services, cloud providers, and other stacks will work natively with open formats in a DL/DLH. So you can always leverage or pivot different technologies. And it’s a lot more forgiving in an architecture choice. You can mix and match lots of different stacks on the same data if desired. When talking with customers and users, this is typically the place we start for the above reasons. DWH on RDBMS or similar technologies are usually proprietary formats. Like SQL, Oracle, Snowflake, etc. Assuming you are not leveraging newer features to store in open formats. That isn’t meant to discourage or trash DWH it’s just you need to understand the goals of the platform, requirements, and how users consume and develop to see what would be best. For example, the above about DL/DLH are objectively better at transformation engines and scalability. However, if your users eat and breathe TSQL, and refuse to learn anything else. Then Spark or DL/DLH might not be a solution that would be right for that team or platform. I have this conversation a lot where we discuss everything above and a tech stack change is a non starter even if the performance or cost would be better for the platform in a greenfield.",

Here's the argument: the whole point of conformed dimensions is to have a consistent set of dimensions that can be used across many many fact tables. Not every source has timestamps at the second/millisecond resolution. Sometimes you just have dates. So if you build a datetime dimension at the second granularity, either you'd have to arbitrarily assign those dates to the first second of the day, which is misleading and wrong, or create a different dim_date dimension anyway.For a similar reason it's sometimes useful to have a separate dim_month table with year-month as the key (can be created as just a view on the dim_date table.) If you get data that is only available at the month resolution, you can either assign it to a specific day (not ideal) or use the month dimension to faithfully represent the data as it was recorded in the source.Retain the timestamps as measures, use two dimensions as you have.",

Joining time dimension with date dimension to create a datetime dimension (at the… millisecond? grain) is really against the idea here. Similar to a degenerate dimension like a source system unique key - does it go on the fact or a separate dim? Well, if it’s a unique value per fact row (ie: it’s 1:1 with fact) then it should go on the fact, not in a dim. If you take some time and revisit dimensional modeling points like these you will see that you are correct, and the idea here is certain ratios.

This makes it very easy to gradually adopt dataframely in a code base (and, similarly, to get rid of it again).* Dataframely natively implements the definition of schemas instead of \"dispatching\" to pydantic. This allows for much more flexibility in the schema definition.Second, dataframely provides a bunch of features that patito does not currently implement:* Support for composite primary keys* Validation across groups of rows (i.e. grouping by one or more columns, ensure that the _group_ satisfies a condition)* Validation of interdependent data frames with a common primary key (dataframely introduces the concept of a \"Collection\" here: invalid data in one data frame can then also remove rows from another data frame)* \"Soft-validation\" via `filter` which allows to partition data frames into rows that satisfy the schema and rows that don't* Structured info about failures that can be used e.g. for more debugging or advanced logging* Integration of the schema with external tools (e.g. export to SQL schemas)* Automatic data generation for unit testing, both for individual data frames and collections (in this case, dataframely takes care of generating rows with common primary keys to allow rows to be joined)",

Separately, you have certain events end users want to be alerted to immediately but you aren’t as concerned in the moment about seeing the trend, such as in this case you are trying to detect cheating.

Do you think bridge engineers start their career by saying \"oh I'm going to be a suspension bridge engineer, and I'll only work on suspension bridges because they've got the coolest conferences\"? No, of course not! They learn about the different types of bridges, their strengths and weaknesses, when they're appropriate, and how they fit into the context of the total project. They might have a preference, they might even build a speciality over time. But I'm guessing the best suspension bridge guy in the world is still going to be pretty good at designing a cantilever (idk, I'm not a bridge guy).Tech changes too fast to hook yourself up to a single pony and ride it into the sunset.

If it's thousands of files daily it doesn't mean you need autoloader at all, especially if you only need to process them once. In practice autoloader just simplifies the parallelization when it comes to ingesting many small files daily and provides a checkpointing system for you to maintain progress. You can achieve all of that with your own system especially if it is encrypted because as you noticed, you can't use autoloader out of the box for that. The other question is how simple (read: manageable) it is, because once you have any issues with your lambda system built on autoloader you might have to reprocess everything.",

Don’t worry about duplicates when loading raw data since you can deduplicate later if you are willing to treat it as a medallion load (load the raw data in bronze as is and then work on it in silver)No need to over complicate nor over think things for that small amount of data.

I wouldn't attempt to migrate the code to dbt instead run python into another tool - spark is inefficient for most api pagination queries unless parallelism is set up correctly (which is not done in 99% of cases)Then look into testing, you can use out of the box anomaly detection like lakehouse monitoring or write your own dq scripts to run on each of your new tables (think of it as bronze/silver/gold medallion)After you have some working product you can probably look into moving the API ingest out of databricks into some other orchestration tool or ingest tools which would run on a single node and probably give you better cost/performance for bronze stage but this is something you should keep away from a deadlineThis doesn't seem crazy, databricks code naturally is not written like application code, its better to be declarative than overly modularized, and if you need to DRY, you're better off building common parameterized notebooks or building custom spark connectors",

        "body": "It's ok to write lots of files to open table formats like iceberg *up to a point*, and as long as you're doing blind inserts.The append-only blind-inserts are part of the purpose of a bronze layer. By appending everything you receive without reference to what is already in the table at the time you insert it you can have multiple writers all writing at the same time without conflict. If you start doing merge operations or `where not exists` on the target table then you can start getting write conflicts.Having lots of small files is an issue when you're reading the data back, as it takes longer and longer to make all the individual API calls to grab each object. That can be handled by periodically doing a compaction on the files. A compaction can be run at the same time as blind inserts -- they don't conflict with each other.But this is all fine on a scale up to writing every second or so. If you're *constantly* making tiny writes and inserts then you're crossing more into streaming territory. If you can receive your data through a stream (or queue) then you can buffer up writes for a while then bulk write them to iceberg. AWS Data Firehose and Azure Event Hubs can do some of this for you automatically - each has a capability to automatically write all streamed data out to data files every time a buffer threshold is reached (up to ~15 minutes / ~300MB, whichever is first). If you don't need ultra-low latency queries, then these can work, and generally if you're working off of some open table format your queries have a certain minimum latency anyway.---The post you read may be talking about something like [Databricks autoloader](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/ingestion/cloud-object-storage/auto-loader/). If anything else automatically does this for you it will have to be part of the execution & orchestration engine that you're working on. It *needs* some kind of eventing system and metadata-storing db to track everything. Iceberg is just a table format spec, not an ingestion engine of its own.Whatever it is it will basically be catching blob triggers and writing their data into a managed low latency db, then periodically grabbing any unprocessed files and batch loading them. It isn't super difficult to roll your own, but there's a few components and you'll have to reason things out yourself around managing the state for un/processed file metadata.",

Focus on high level info (like this query takes transaction data and joins with customer information and customer returns info or something). Drawing chats can be really helpful, i use lucid chart through my company but theres free alternatives out there, or use a pen/paper. There's not really an easy answer (that I've seen) but you'd be surprised how much progress you can make slowly and steadily. Once you understand the whole thing, then I'd create a new/optimized process in parallel so you always have the old one running in the background and can compare results over time. It can also be helpful to understand the sources of the data to get an idea of what each section is doing. You mentioned that there's no incremental processing, maybe look at some of the larger tables to see how you can process those incrementally or check if there are any obvious bottlenecks in the query logic and fix those",

There are lots of best practices on this so just get the top 3 or 5 that seems would be important to your case like isolation and abstraction. 5. Write, unit test, regression test loop - as you increase in complexity test, and test, and test.6. Pre cut over - run in parallel with production and see if results are consistent.Anything you miss here by this point would be isolated cases and can be dealt with much easier and faster since youve documentEd and refactor to be much easier to modify After that resign and become a farmer",

It tracks snapshots and data file metadata, so (in theory) you can query the table using `VERSION AS OF` or `snapshot_id` to only process new data. that said.. some newer Glue versions support Iceberg metadata pretty wellIf this metadata isn’t accessible for you, the DynamoDB method can work as a fallback. You’d keep a simple table of processed file paths (or timestamps), and compare that during each run. Only process the new files, then update the table. It’s a bit (way) more work but gives you controlThat said, if this becomes hard to maintain or scale, check out [Estuary](https://estuary.dev/solutions/technology/apache-iceberg/). It’s a managed tool that supports real-time ingestion into Iceberg, with built-in support for tracking state and running merge/upsert logic. No extra infra needed. Might save you a lot of effort down the road. Disclaimer: I work at Estuary.",

We worked with a Faroese company information platform that pushed all their raw events into Flowcore — and even though the events were pretty basic (like CRUD changes and updates), we were able to layer meaning on top during replay to build dedicated AI-optimized models. The result was that they now have an AI chat interface where users can ask super abstract questions, like *“Which municipality had the most new companies in 2024?”* or *“Tell me about this specific person and all the companies they’re involved in”* — and it just works.

There are things you dislike about your current position, the new offer would allow you growth. The only thing that seems to be holding you back is the tuition repayment. How good's your relationship with that current manager? How long's it been since you finished that degree? Are there ways you could get 'em down from the full amount?

That's also a hit. The numbers don't make sense yet.When you change jobs, it is for a large increase in pay. These numbers make the opportunity look like a COLA adjustment.If the new job is open to a counter offer,* pay your loan off for you with the previous company, call it a signing bonus* 155 base seems more aligned for a move (still with the 10% bonum)This isn't as much as you might think.Things that don't matter: * The tools stack - there is always another one* Remote vs In Office - unless you are commuting a rediculous amount, it's a wash. You have to be somewhere.* The DS/DE may not have been helping the bottom line enough to warrant the cost. * The title - Not one bank I have ever been involved with was impressed by my title, just my W-2Things that matter more than money* Your current manager - you don't work for a company, you work for your manager. A good one is gold* Benefits - this is especially true if you are thinking of growing your family.",

For example, I’d like to get notified (e.g., via email) when a sensor value crosses a certain threshold, so I can keep an eye on whether the sensors are functioning properly.In that case, I might need to look into the data around that event, but most of the time I wouldn’t be constantly querying the live data. The system doesn’t need to be real-time either – near real-time is absolutely fine. On average, I might just visualize a handful of values per day unless there’s an issue.What is important, though, is that I’ll download each day’s data as a file for later analysis. I plan to convert the raw data into an MDF format with a daily job and then process it elsewhere. So everything I store, I will at least once download.That said, it’s really hard to estimate how often I’ll query or access the data, since that heavily depends on whether problems occur or not.",

Built in Import-Csv should be able to read your files and load them into PSObjectsThe SqlServer module then has a Write-SqlTableData cmdlet that will take the PSobject you made. With the -Force param set, it will create the table for you if it doesn't already exist.Then it's just standard pwsh code to loop over all the files. I've done variations on this many times, it's probably 10 or so lines of pwsh all in.ETA: side note, there's no such thing as an SSMS table. The table is in a MS SQL Server instance. SSMS is just the vendor-default client application that you use to explore and work with the SQL Server instance - but you could use other applications like VS Code just as easily.",

Both of them have huge shortcomings in my opinion, which competitors like Prefect or Dagster have good solutions for (or SQLmesh in the case of dbt).If you want to explore newer technologies just to learn them, great. But1) You are a more attractive candidate if you know Airflow. Knowing the warts and how to work around them is itself a useful skill.2) When onboarding new DEs, far more of them will be accustomed to Airflow, which makes onboarding simpler.3) The ecosystem around Airflow is more mature. Nearly every tool that can be orchestrated has an integration with Airflow, usually as a first-class citizen.4) If you have the budget there are services like Astronomer that make setting up and maintaining Airflow much simpler. They have free credits that you can use if your project isn't that big.",

There’s also a [free tier](https://cloud.getcollate.io/signup/) if you just want to try it out quickly.# 3. Is the Open Source Version Production-Ready?* **Absolutely** * The open source release is self-sufficient, with features covering data catalog, lineage, governance, data quality, and collaboration. * 1000s of organizations run it in production—some with small teams and others with hundreds of data users.* **Collate’s Enterprise Enhancements** * Beyond simple hosting, Collate adds advanced automations, governance workflows, deeper data diff capabilities, and more (see [this comparison](https://www.getcollate.io/comparison) for a side-by-side feature breakdown). * If you need enterprise-grade security, SSO/SAML, or advanced compliance features out of the box, Collate might be a good fit.#",

But we were skeptical if they can pull it off. However, the project has moved at a very high velocity, incorporating community feedback. Few things we like: 1. Last time I saw OM had 100+ releases in 3 years. Datahub over maybe over 8 years has 95 releases. 2. Datahub has just started adding native data quality support. Seems like it is not available in OSS. Datahub is behind OM in many important features. 3. We like collaboration features in OpenMetadata (activity feed, alerts, conversations, etc.) that are preserved/tracked around data. We were losing these in Slack threads. 4. Architectural simplicity. Not too many moving parts and no core dependency on Kafka. We could easily operationalize in our small infra team. 5. Community support on Slack is amazing. Some issues we reported were fixed immediately in the next release (our previous paid solution did not provide such support after paying a lot of money). 6. They have a sandbox that runs the latest release that we can play around with and give feedback. 7. APIs are very comprehensive and intuitive. We have built many custom workflows specific to our company for governance and data quality.They also have an offering built around OpenMetadata with additional features. But for us, the OSS features are good enough.",

It still is not geo replication across datacenters which is what most big clouds can offer.Nowadays instead of 3 full replicas which costs 3x the capacity, erasure encoding is more often used in different schema’s.

Apache Spark is much more widely used now than Hadoop itself. In many ways it's just the next evolution of the same ideas. Apache Parquet is the de facto standard for column-oriented data, and it came out of the Hadoop ecosystem. The table metadata usually is Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, or Apache Hudi (in no particular order). These are the modern version of say, the Hive metastore from Hadoop days, but less coupled to one engine. These take advantage of the capabilities of modern cloud storage, such as conditional atomic writes of a file. A lot has changed in the past decade, but the fundamental principles from Hadoop remains highly relevant.",

Now, you could start with something local, but that means additional time for development and setup).A feedback pipeline is the simplest in terms of implementation and infrastructure. But you'd need to figure out what's the cost associated with unmapped names. Is it an annoyance for a user? Will it create troubles downstream (e.g. queries won't work)?

What this mean is that you would have new “schemas” and “tables” in snowflake that are technically never loaded in Snowflake but only lives in S3.Reason for snowflake to do this is that they want you to use their query engine to load the data and do anything else with it. And since they will allow writes to iceberg table, someone could just use snowflake engine instead of spark for example if they don’t want to spawn a spark cluster themselves.They also all have their own catalog which will have “more” feature then the other which would lock you in a little because anytime you derive from the default opening table specification you list interoperability with other catalogs.",

For the catalog, there will be no equivalent in your local dev env, so you will be hard coding database names, and table names, which can be good for development and testing but you will not need it in Glue.

Then capturing this to a data warehouse for centralised analytics workflows. For example, snowflake can read S3 data using the 'external tables' quite well - this is good where files are just added over time and records don't change.I used to be a mass spectrometry researcher so I understand what you mean about the closed source export methods. Be careful about vendors like Thermo trying to sell their cloud solutions, unless you like paying for a suite of contractors and a funky proprietary cloud solution.The interpretation can be left to the scientists. If it's clean and in one place, it shouldn't be an issue for them. Though it's worth testing at least one pipeline with them to ensure it's fit for purpose. And honestly even just getting data into S3 might work for some, as many researchers I knew (myself included) were comfortable using python to analyse cloud data - otherwise probably R.",

Do you want to produce a weekly calibration report and dashboard to show the machines are in spec? Do you have a particular kind of analysis that is repeated multiple times a day that you'd like to automate?For the use case of calibration reports, we collaborated with lab management to have a technican use the machine's proprietary software to export the raw data and a standard analysis to a csv report, and we stored these csv's in a specific network folder. Periodically, a scraper searched the networked folder for new data and loaded it to the warehouse. An ETL cleaned the data and formatted it so that it could be displayed on the calibration status dashboard. The cleaned data were also available on the self service abalytics platform. Lab data is challenging because it's ofte less structured than data from an API or service backend. At all times you need to make sure the extraction and transformation process is representative of something physical that really happened. It involves a lot of conversation and buy in from stakeholders and lab management to do this right. So, I'd recommend to start there.",

I'd recommend having a folder structure by instrument name, date, and split it either by user, by the test, or by both e.g:`FTIR/01Jan2025/Test/file.csv` or `FTIR/01Jan2025/User/file.csv` or `FTIR/01Jan2025/Test/User/file.csv`(I label dates like this because for my sins I have spent time working in QC where I sent samples around the world and we needed a universal date format everybody understood)This will be on your local network so all computers connected to instruments can dump the data there and then you have a single location to point your data processing tools to.> The output files are typically in a binary format. Instrument vendors usually don’t provide parsers or APIs, as they want to protect their proprietary technologies.This is a huge ballache. You'll want to put all unprocessed binary files into their own folder and convert them into a digestible format if absolutely required. Bear in mind each file might need it's own process, hence, the ballache.> In most cases, the instruments come with dedicated software for data analysis, and the results can be exported as XLSX or CSV files. However, since each user may perform the analysis differently and customize how the reports are exported, the output formats can vary significantly—even for the same instrument.One potential way is to have a standardised output. I get this massively depends on the instrument and testing although if that's possible, it would make everybody's lives easier.> Even if we can parse the raw or exported files, interpreting the data often requires domain knowledge from the lab scientists.Which makes complete sense. What happens to the data after you parse it? i.e. do you email it to specific users, do you have it printed out? etc> Given these constraints, is it even possible to build a reliable ELT/ETL pipeline?I'd say yes, although there's a high level of complexity.",

If they are readable, you can either write custom parsers, or find some online.That being said. It is quite ambitious to try and reimplement a whole bunch of specialised lab equipment software at scale.

Specificity of substrings is a useful starting point for when you find fuzzywuzzy blows out the available memory.",

However, the overarching point is that we can do these types of workflows because everything is designed to be composable. The composability is enabled by the expression system in Ibis and Arrow standard that we can build interfaces around. Our primary usecase is portable UDFs (backed by datafusion engine) and optimizing workloads based on the engine choice. The asof join usecase just happens to fit really nicely and has an added benefit of performance and guarantees provided by the semantics (not just functionality) that is common in ML. In ML, you may require asof joins to safeguard against data leakage, particularly useful if you deal with time series data at an organization level. Here is the duckdb blogpost on how they optimized it We currently support a handful of engines but Ibis (the expression system xorq is based on) support 20+ engines. It’s really easy for us to add support for another engine (SQL or Python) so let us know if something that may benefit your workflow is missing. We believe this work is necessary to build pipelines that can be easy to reason about and optimized without tying to a single engine/ecosystem. Also, composite workflows are super common so might as well do it right!",

People like to think if they can touch their server or hug their storage, it is better than hosting it in the cloud. It just isn't true. There are more controls in the cloud for access control and security than I have seen in anyone's data center and I have seen many Fortune 100 companies data centers. Starting from physical security to data in flight & at rest to designs clouds are almost always able to be more secure. The issues come with knowledge and implementation. This is the same no matter the location.I have secured data in cloud providers where not even the CSP can get to them and they remain very performant. It just takes a bit of creativity on your part.From an architectural standpoint, splitting your analytic workload across a wide area network is a bad idea. The physics just work against you. The bandwidth between on-premises and cloud is never enough. Consider bouncing a 1TB table at one location against a 1TB table at a different location. Even with tricks like predicate pushdown and column reduction, you will still end up moving quite a bit of data to compare/join the tables. That has to happen over a WAN instead of an internal bus. It just doesn't fly. Like I said, the physics doesn't lie and can't be bargained with.The term \"Lakehouse\" is a Databricks marketing term and not a technical one. I try not to feed marketing monsters. The concepts behind their particular flavor of DW have been around for a long time. Don't get confused by a new coat of paint.",

The expression should be something like `@equals(activity('Lkp_archivepath').output.firstRow.archive_delete_flag,'Y')`.I'd suggest adding additional validation to check if the archive\\_delete\\_flag exists in the lookup results before evaluating it. Companies implementing similar ETL patterns with tools like Windsor.ai often use parameter validation to avoid runtime errors when expected configuration values are missing from metadata stores.Another optimization would be to consider implementing a single copy approach with dynamic sink paths instead of separate copy activities, which would reduce pipeline complexity and potential points of failure while maintaining your conditional deletion logic.",

It missed that Trino has native file readers and writers for all relevant file formats ([and has had some of them for half a decade](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/2004)), and [I'm particularly unsure what's going on here](https://i.imgur.com/SBqUvU7.png) - are we giving Presto a higher score for using a deprecated Delta reader?

No... unless you are a service provider you does this and helps companies get started or mature their DG in a cost effective manner. But for many it is a necessary evil and those in such roles are not treated well or not prepared properly or not even qualified (many DG folks are typically business users with no real understanding of the regulations they are supposed to police). Will it be safe in the near future? Say 2 years or so likely it will be a better choice for some but such programs take a while to settle.",

Then they use that account to buy ads that are shown on legitimate sites. Generally just viewing the ad is not going to get you hacked. What they try to get you to download is a [JScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JScript#JScript_\\(COM_Classic\\)) file that will contact a command and control server to download the latest version of their malware and either mine your computer for important data such as passwords or use it as part of a botnet.

        "body": "Some hard-won advice on this topic: 1. Have a good working relationship with your manager. Build trust. This will ensure they _actually hear you_ when you ask to take on opportunities to push yourself. Pushing yourself without this trust can cause your manager to view you as self-sabotaging (causing delays, \"biting off more than they can chew\"), which makes everything harder. 2. Identify the developers on your team (or close to your team, this includes DevOps, architects, and even senior QA) who actually care about the quality of their work. Like someone else in this thread said, many people work in software simply because of the pay. Sometimes the \"this is just a job\" people are very talented engineers, but it's not as likely. When you find the people who really care, pair with them on your work, go to them with questions, etc. 3. Don't waste time, but ask questions when you can. In particular, if someone more experienced than you has work you can look at (e.g. in a pull request), and their implementation doesn't line up with how you would have approached the problem, ask them (politely/when it's convenient) to help you understand why they chose their approach vs your \"obvious\" approach. A major strength of more senior engineers is their ability to perceive/understand complicating factors, with nuance (see the last sentence in #4). A word of warning here... don't ask endless follow-up questions/don't get really in the weeds on every little thing. You run the risk of being seen as overly pedantic, nitpicking, or wasting time (for the pull request example, keep in mind that often the PR is only a final \"does this make sense to everyone?\" check before merging new code. So a developer might not appreciate having long conversations on every PR. For this reason, having a conversation or DMing them is often better than leaving a vague question as a PR comment). 4. Get involved in the design process as _early_ as possible. If you have the opportunity to sit-in on a meeting with an architect/dev lead while they design a new feature/project/service, _do it_. You won't be able to contribute (probably), and that is fine. But especially if these people are the ones you identified in #2, watching them work through a complex problem from the beginning will be a great learning experience. A big part of having engineering expertise is knowing what's important vs what is not important to the actual business requirement(s) (especially as it relates to the existing constraints of your application), not just knowing the ins and outs of your language/framework. 5. Talk to your coworkers about the work and build up your reputation as someone who cares. When you discover cool language features or software development practices, bring them up with people (\"I found this cool HN article the other day talking about , do we use that here?\"). Then, when other devs are working on something new, they'll think \"I bet /u/Spiritual_Donkey_521 would love to hear about this.\" This can help get you exposed to parts of dev work you wouldn't normally encounter until later in your career.",

Make it known to the seniors around you that you're really invested in learning, ask to take on harder tasks, be willing to say \"I don't know how to do that but if you give me a chance I'll figure it out\" and sincerely mean it.I think the big thing that stops juniors from becoming seniors is a lack of ambition - some people, a lot of people even, are content to just do their job and not stretch themselves to learn or do anything new. But if you show you've got intelligence and motivation and are eager to step up, the opportunities to do so are usually there - they just usually aren't handed to you.A lot of this depends on the specific work environment you're in, of course. Big tech focused companies tend to put more thought into how to develop talent, but if you were employed there you'd probably already be asking whoever you report to during a performance evaluation instead of asking us. But at smaller companies or non-tech focused ones, you might have to be more forward in hunting down opportunities to grow.I am writing this assuming you're already professionally employed as a software developer. If you are not, work on that first before worrying about what being a senior looks like. :P",

Now, Python does a lot of things under the hood to help you out, which is why it's good to have knowledge of different data structures. For example, Python doesn't natively have arrays. Instead, it has lists, which handle lots of things for you that you would have to do in other languages. It's good to have a knowledge of how these things work so you can better understand how to program in other languages as well, since Python won't work for all applications. You shouldn't \"choose\" C++, you use the language that is best for your application, especially if you're doing personal projects.

You're exactly right with your analogy of a hatchet vs an axe. There are a lot of people who will tell you that you need an axe, when in reality, you only need the hatchet. But to answer your question, yes, Python is absolutely a real programming language, and no, it doesn't matter that it's simple. It just helps to have a little knowledge of what's really going on. Once you have a good grasp on the language, you should try branching out into a different language to learn a little bit more about programming. I personally learned Java after Python, then C++, then C (since I primarily work on microcontrollers now), and that really helped me understand what's going on, since C++ and C do not hold your hand at all. Java is easier to learn than C++, which is why I recommend it after Python. But you'll have a million people telling you what they think is the best way to do something. In reality, if you aren't doing this for work, then the best advice I can give you is just to have fun. This is a super enjoyable hobby and a great skill to have, but don't let someone suck the life out of it for you by telling you that there's one deterministic way to enjoy your programming journey. There isn't. Have fun, enjoy what you're doing, and the knowledge and skills will come ten times faster than if you were to force yourself to do something you don't want because of some stupid arbitrary rule that someone put forth.",

Chip makers don't always release diagrams that detail how the hardware implements microcoded instructions etc, so you often don't know the implementation details, just the interface (e.g. `add r1 r2 r3` will add r2 and r3 and place the result in r1 is the interface over the hardware that does that) It gets very hardware specific.Cancelling like terms is usually the job of the optimising assembler/compiler. Whole books have been written but generally they work by looking at the relationship between memory reads and writes and try to produce code with the same result but either optimised for space or time.The Python and C compilers would be where most of the optimisation to your source code happens.

They don't do many for complex tricks because analyzing the number to see if the trick applies would take longer than just computing the answer.So how fast can a modern processor \"grind everything out\" for something like an integer multiplication?The important thing to understand is that it's hard-coded in circuitry. It doesn't have to execute a bunch of steps to multiply, one at a time - the circuits are right there in the chip and they parallelize as much as possible.That said, multiplication is not instantaneous. On a modern processor you can expect it to take 3 - 5 clock cycles, whereas something like addition can be done in 1 clock cycle.So, it is worth checking for some really easy tricks like multiplying by 1 or 0. Maybe multiplying by 2 even. Those checks are simple enough that the processor can detect them when decoding the instruction and shift it to another instruction, and that's exactly what's done.But, there are a lot of \"tricks\" that humans use to save time that wouldn't make sense for computer processors, because they can just \"grind out\" the answer faster than checking it.In general when you write code in a language like C or Python, the compiler/interpreter does some easy optimizations, and then your processor does some easy optimizations. Neither of them are likely to do tricky optimizations - they're usually just not worth the cost.There are specialized mathematical programming environments, like Mathematica, where using number theory and other advanced tricks are possible.",

So if you add 01 and 01 you get 10, if you add 10 and 01 you get 11. So you can look at this as a truth table. For the first bit if you have:0 + 0 = 0 1 + 0 = 1 0 + 1 = 1 1 + 1 = 0 (with a carry)Electrically this is a xor circuit. If they are both 0 or 1 the first bit of the sum is 0, if the are different values then the first bit of the sum is 1. Now for the second bit of the sum you have the logic:If there is no carry from the first bit, xor the second bits. If there is a carry then you now have the truth table:0 + 0 = 1 0 + 1 = 0 (with a carry) 1 + 0 = 0 (with a carry) 1 + 1 = 1 (with a carry)Remember that there is carry you have an additional 1 coming it. This truth table is a xor and a not. Now you can add in the logic for the 3rd bit and so on.You might want to read: [https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb\\_7.html](https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/combination/comb_7.html) which appears to give a good description of a binary adder.As for shifting instead of multiplications all I can answer is probably not. This is because it would increase the time to do most of the multiplications, because now you have a first step of checking if only 1 bit is set on one of the numbers then do a shift, otherwise continue with the multiplication. That check is only going to help rarely, and the check does take time.Now with a computer the compiler might notice that you are always multiplying a number by a constant like 16 and insert a shift instruction into the output rather than doing a multiplication. But that means you are always multiplying some number not known at compile time by a constant that is a power of 2. Most compilers will actually do all the math it can during compile time so if you have it calculate x \\* (1 + 3) / 2 then the compiler might look at that say oh, you want really want to just multiple by 2, oh that is a power of 16, you just want to shift by one, rather than making the computer always add 1 + 3 multiple that by the input value then divide by 2.",

So when trying to sort by distance developers will just skip the square root and find the smallest dX\\^2+dY\\^2+dZ\\^2.Other than that: compilers will do all kinds to tricks to reduce complexity, which is done with optimisation loops.e.g. constant folding.

The limit and series stuff is usually not taught in DM.But overall I would say that you got it all.Edit: Ok technically, you would have to include the theory of computation still in it as the major cornerstone of proper CS but given you are a self-taught dev, it might not be the most pressing thing.But if you want to explore CS, ToC is kind of a must in a regular degree for the fundamentals.",

        "body": "Have you ever completed a course by yourself? The reason I ask is because there's a reason people go to university and major in computer science. This content isn't easy. Keep in mind, in the US, it takes 4 years to graduate with a CS degree.To be fair, in the US, you have to take a bunch of other courses. Maybe 1/4 of your courses are CS courses, and the rest are some related courses (say, in math and sciences) plus more general education (humanities such as history and English).Even so, there's a linearity to the CS curriculum where certain courses are taken before others. Much of which courses you focus on will depend on your goals. In any case, if you want to master this, you could go back to school. Yes, unrealistic, but as pointed out earlier, it's tough for CS majors to complete this curriculum with decent grades. They have the added benefit of time, friends, teaching assistants, professors, and perhaps even free tutoring (or paid tutoring). CS majors are often under time pressure to learn this material so some feel, even after a semester, that they missed stuff along the way.OK, now to address your question, this is my opinion on what to take.1. Discrete Math * This is a precursor to data structures and algorithms. I would say it's not fully required. Discrete math, in my opinion, should be a course where you learn how to do mathematical proofs. Specifically, direct proofs, proof by contradiction, and the various induction proofs (weak, strong, structural). It should also cover formal logic, in particular, propositional and predicate calculus. The rest of discrete math is a bunch of topics where you can apply your knowledge of proofs. Many self-taught learners tend to skip this and head into DSA, and that can work too.1. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) * If you were to take a real courses in DSA, especially algorithms, then you'd do work on solving recurrence relations. This is the math behind big O notation. Otherwise, you could skip that, and just know certain algorithms O(n) or O(lg n) or whatever. It would help to work out book problems, but I think implementing the various data structures and algorithms is educational. For example, I don't use pointers for work (at least, not to build linked data structures).1. Computer Architecture * I taught this a number of times. My current belief is the goal of a computer architecture course is to show you can build a CPU that can run a simple assembly language out of a clock, a flip-flop (a one-bit register), and logic gates. I had envisioned the class building this in software, but never got around to doing that. Personally, I think CS majors learn that the computer isn't completely magic (yes, it does do a lot) and realize, yes, 0's and 1's can make a program do something.Beyond that, I think you can read about the rest (e.g., computer networking and operating systems). I've taken OS before, so building something (again, super simple) is interesting, but you realize that real OSes are extremely complex, but at its core, it's something you can understand if you strip it to its bare essentials.The question, should you choose to study this, is how much time you can devote to this, and how deeply do you want to study it given a lack of resources. If you can find some online courses offered through a reputable university (you wouldn't get credit, but you could follow the content), then that can help structure your learning.At this point, you need to pick an initial starting point, which is probably data structures and algorithms as that's the most pertinent and comes up in job interviews.",

It does not hold your hand and allows you to make mistakes and shows you really how computers work. After that, build difficult projects, don't watch step by step tutorials or copy code. It will be a struggle, but you will learn a lot when you force yourself to do these exercises. I suggest things like a web server in C, Building an ORM in any OO language. The truth is the more you struggle the more you learn, and at first it will be extremely frustrating, but it will pay off in the long run.",

One reason people get hung up on where to start is they don't know what road they are on or even where they want to go. Answering these question will narrow things down considerably. Once you know what road you're on, pick a destination that interests you, something that you would enjoy building and may even use yourself when you're done. If you want to get even more spicy then build something for someone else to their specs. Once you've determined your environment and what you're building then start small and keep building. Most big projects are a series of smaller projects that are fit together to form a whole. List what you need in the order that you will need it. For example, a website to provide a public bulletin board would need:1 ) A landing page that explains the purpose of the website2 ) A login page that consists of a page to create a login, a page to actually login once a login is created and a page to recover a forgotten password. 3 ) An admin page that allows a user create, modify and cancel their postings4 ) A postings page that shows the postings from the various users.That's a simple example, and far from complete, but you get the idea.

There are tester / Quality analyst for that But a good developer can able to think and run that steps in mind mapping to find potential bugs.• Bug Bounty : Early days practice is key to learning, later days it becomes less practical but more logical and thinking. Being able to find bugs just watching lines of code or a problem is the ability like a doctor looking at a patient.All of the above is a habit of skills which grows day by day but the steps are common among top programmers.",

        "body": "When you call a function, you are asking for something. Return is how the function gives you what you ask for.Take some code like:```function timesTwo(int i) int { return i * 2;}```This is a function, which means it can be called from other places. It has an `int` *argument*, `i`; this means that, whenever someone wants to call this function, they will have to supply some int to be used in place of `i`. The final `int` after the right parenthesis denotes the *return type*. In other words, whenever you call this function, you are *asking for an int*. So, in all, the function represents a sort of contract: I give you an int, and you give me an int back.Here's how you might use this function:```int x = 5;int y = timesTwo(x);```What's going on here? You have an `int`, `x`. Then you initialize another `int`, `y`, and assign it to *the result of the function call*. As we said, calling timesTwo means supplying an int, and then receiving one in return. Here we are supplying `x` - that is, `5`.`timesTwo` receives `5` and uses it in place of `i` in the function body, so we can read the return statement as `return 5 * 2` which evaluates to `return 10`.Now, timesTwo promised its caller that it would give it back an int, and that is exactly what `return` does - it gives `10` back as the result of the call and gives control back to the caller, which assigns the returned value to `y`.Essentially, the return type of a function allows you to use a call to that function *as* a value of the return type in most places in your code, because the return type is essentially a promise that the function will give you a value to use there. `Return` is how functions actually make good on that promise.",

This is used for storing things, and looking things up that need to be retained longer than the page is open. Frequently used to serve login systems, provide details about something pulled from a data source like a database and many more things.Those are all the bits you need to create a website you can run and test locally and covers the majority of things you'll want to learn if it is new to you.If you wanted to learn to build all the things for the website and understand how they work then that's all you need.If you are more interested in getting something up and running quickly without learning the basics then these options below exist. But these involve a bit more understanding of the operational side of websites and servers.There are also lots of tools available that can do what is called \"code generation\", like hugo, and they simplify and automate a bunch of the above to get you going without having to learn all the things, but the price you pay for using those tools is that it limits what you can change and do.Another thing used by a lot of websites is a thing called a Content Management System (CMS), a commonly used example of that is WordPress, this gives you a drag and drop visual editor to create fully fledged websites, again at the cost of limiting what you can do The last bit is putting the website onto a network or the Internet and that's a whole other kettle of fish with lots of options depending on what you built, so I'd advise you to not worry about this yet, just build it first.",

It allows you to create interactive and complicated websites that can take user input and then \"do stuff\". It has the same HTML/CSS webpages but twins it with \"code behind\" that is written in Python that makes the webpage interactive. Usually Django connects the website to a backend database like SQLite etc.I'd start by learning some HTML/CSS, build a basic site then do a Django tutorial.That's if you want to use python. The other option is HTML/CSS/JavaScript",

It doesn't matter how simple, or whether it has been used before. The first games I wrote were: A top down racing game similar to Rally-X. A top down shooter similar to 1942. A pong game with powerups. A pong game played on an elliptical playing field where both players could move around the entire ellipse and the ball changed colour when you hit it (so you lost points if the ball went out of the ellipse when it was your colour).These were all simple games, and some of them never got finished, but it taught me a lot about how to build things, and projects like these helped me land my first job as a graphics dev.For school, make sure you pass. Go to office hours. Find other students you can study with. There were times during my university days when I locked myself in my room for 2-3 days. No computer. Just a textbook and some paper. I read the textbook and took notes by hand. Then I read the textbook again and took more notes. Then I copied my notes and cleaned them up. Then I copied them and cleaned them up again, until I was at the point where I could probably write them out again without looking at the textbook. I did whatever it took to learn the material.It will take time. Find time every day to put some effort into it, even if it is only ten minutes. After I had three kids, I wondered how I would ever be able to learn something new again. Then I realized that even ten minutes a day adds up to \\~60 hours per year. The first year I realized that, I taught myself how to play the guitar just by spending 10 minutes a day practicing. Then piano the next year, then flute the year after that.The point I'm trying to make is that it will take effort and time, but you can do it, and it will be worth it in the end. But it starts by choosing a project and building it from scratch. Then rinse and repeat as many times as it takes until things start to sink in.",

I never did and I hate that I never did. Now, years later, I'm amazed that I had a person ready to answer literally any questions I have about the subject of computer science. Anything. It's crazy.If youre having trouble understanding what you don't understand, to the point where asking questions at all is hard, I do have one trick to take with a massive grain of salt: explain what you can to AI and ask it to rephrase what you say or point out what areas you're leaving out the most. Honestly, the act of explaining things to someone often shows me what I'm missing, but it also helps me when my brain is mush and I can't even begin to explain my lack of understanding. I'll do my best to explain what I can, even if it's between curses and insults and self-admonishment, and it's usually able to parse through the mess and pull out a bit of self confidence. It reminds me I AM absorbing something, but it also forces me to look at what I'm missing. Don't rely on it to spoon feed you the information because it's been proven that this negatively effects your ability to find the information alone, but having it rephrase your knowledge can help with your thinking of it, and, importantly, give you keywords to help your real searching, which you should always be doing outside of AI.",

You usually don't use classes in Python, but you will need to structure the classes. Think of the Service Class as the class that defines the functions you use in the Application Class. The Application Class is supposed to be the one that is run and will provide the UI and functions that are built on the Service Class. 2. Learn How to Use UML Diagrams. UML Diagrams will be very useful in the long run as they tell you all the functions you need to program with. Here's an example structure: \\------------------------------------------------ | Class Name | \\------------------------------------------------ | Variables in the Constructor | \\------------------------------------------------ | Functions in the Class | \\------------------------------------------------3. Think of the Language as Python, but instead of tabs, you use curly braces {}. You also must not forget to add the include for the scanner. The scanner is like the iostream C++ library. It provides functions used to take in input. Make sure to reference the scanner by using Scanner scannerName = new Scanner(System.in); So those are my tips. If you have any questions, please reply to this message or ask ChatGPT.",

Per the definition of big-O, that would mean that there exists some positive integers M and c₀ where c^(k+1) ≤ Mc^k for all c ≥ c₀.We can simplify this inequality by dividing both sides by c^k to give us c ≤ M. (Note that we don't have to worry about accidentally dividing by zero, since we can safely assume all variables are positive, per the definition of Big-O and our constraint on c₀).But, this inequality c ≤ M results in a contradiction: c can grow forever, so clearly cannot remain less then our constant M. Therefore, c^(k+1) ∊ O(cᵏ) cannot be true, which in turn means that O(c^(k+1)) cannot be a subset of O(cᵏ). Therefore, by the definition of set equality, the two sets cannot be equivalent.",

Here, **O(c\\*(k+1)) = O(c\\*k + c)**. Here, **c\\*k > c ie c\\*k** will be **asymptotically bigger** than **c ,** because c,k are variables and nonetheless will be positive, and since in Big-O, we care about the dominant term, therefore it will be **equal** to **O(c\\*k**). An example can be c = 10 and k = 10. c\\*k = 10\\*10 = 100. c \\* (k+1) = 10 \\* 11 = 110, which is asymptotically equal. However, for the other case ie **O(c\\^k) Vs O(c \\^(k+1))** ; here **O(c\\^(k+1)) = O(c \\* c \\^ k)**. However , c is a variable and **not** a constant. Therefore, **c\\^(k+1)** is **not** asymptotically same as **c\\^k**. Therefore, **O(c\\^k)** and **O(c \\^(k+1))** are **not equal.** An example can be c = 10 and k = 4 . c\\^k = 10\\^4 and c\\^(k+1) = 10\\^5 ; a **10 times** increase in the running time**.** This is my interpretation , I could be wrong as well. Please correct if my approach is wrong. (Also, note that though c,k are input variables, when we use them in Big O , it is expected that they are large positive values, because we care about the asymptotic growth as the input size gets large. So all inputs are expected to grow larger and larger. For people who are not familiar with the word 'asymptotic', in general it means that how fast the running time will grow when input size increases. Take two functions : n\\^2 and n , where n is the input. For some duration, n\\^2 and n will run in parallel, but as n increases, n\\^2 will grow rapidly compared to n , then we say that n\\^2 is asympototically larger than n. )",

So it's only meaningful when you specify which symbols are constants and which ones are variables. Usually, we use \"n\" as the only variable and all the other terms are constants, but your question doesn't have an \"n\" in it.O(c^(k+1)) = O(kc^(k)), so it's the same as O(c^k) if k is treated as a constant, but not if k is a variable.EDIT: whoops, I got the variables the wrong way around in a couple places, fixed. But the point is the same.",

You see learning things as a chore, one you have only limited time for, and you try to minimize it, focusing on it only when absolutely necessary.

You need to be learning a lot as a junior, and it's much easier to learn when you can just quickly ask the guy next to you instead of having to ping random team members on Slack and hope they make some time for you.

Just having a Sec+ and 0 actual work experience is worth pretty much nothing.Cybersecurity sounds entry-level because of titles like \"Junior Penetration Tester\" and beginner-friendly certs like CompTIA Sec+, but the jobs actually expect you to already have hands-on experience like from being a sysadmin, network tech etc. Sure, you can pass Sec+ with 100/100 points, and you'll still have absolutely no idea how to iterate over Active Directory and find attack vectors in a Windows environment, or how to securely set up a domain controller (random, not connected examples).Say you see a Junior pen tester job, and it requires a Sec+, OSCP and/or GPEN certs. You might therefore conclude that you can get it without much experience because 1. it's asking for a junior and 2. you can just obtain the certs.You see, \"junior\" is there because it's an entry to the role of a pentester, but not in an entry domain. It's a junior role for someone who has been an network administrator for 5 years, or a junior role for someone that did different levels of SOC support for 5 years etc. You will be expected to have x amount of years in lead up roles before you're hired as a pentester. You could for example get an IT helpdesk job, during which you can get your Sec+ or similar. From there you can try and move into a sysadmin role or similar, where you will actually be working in a real environment for a few years, during which you might try getting OSCP and similar certs, and only then would you be applying for a junior pentester job, only after you spent years solving issues and learning how things actually work in practice.You need actual experience working in real IT environments before you try to become an expert at any of its domains. You wouldn't be doing security audits on code written in C++ if you don't have years of experience working writing C++, similarly you wouldn't be doing network infrastructure security implementations if you never even set up an AP, a switch, a vlan, a domain controller etc. So say you do have 10 years of writing C++ in various areas, and now you want to shift to cybersec, only then would you be looking for \"junior\" positions in which you would do C++ code audits, not because you don't have experience with C++, but because you don't have experience doing audits in a c++ environment.",

There are two types of programmers: those who like the lower stuff (ex: people who mess with algorithms, kernels, optimizing aggressively to get even 1ms less runtime) and those who like the higher stuff (building unicorn and changing the world). You just might be the latter, since you put an emphasis on wanting to build something. Leetcode is most definitely for the former. Use AI. To learn (not to vibe code). Ask it what it needs to know, and learn what you don't know from there. Then ask it how to build what you want. But don't just copy and paste everything—read the code, understand it, and then type it out yourself. Repetition makes perfect. Also, everybody learns and understands the world differently. Find your own life. The only justice in the world is that it is unjust to all: if you really have passion, then fight for it.",

Identify something you want to create or solve using programming languages as a tool and then plan it out and develop it. You said you want to build everything you want - what’s one simple thing you can start with?

Avoid copy/pasting code and try to do your own version of what is being taught. My partner has been a dev for 10+ years and in his free time works on projects to continue to solidify fundamentals. Especially when he's learning a new programming language. 2. Use pair programming with others to practice your technical communication and problem solving. There's no pressure / learning quite like working with another person. You can join this slack group if you want to meet a community of developers who meet to pair program (https://join.slack.com/t/codesmithx/shared\\_invite/zt-344q2e9dd-HtR4EmgU5U\\_q3dBYgc28yw) Full disclosure: this is related to the company where I work, but I do feel it's an excellent resource and we have folks at various levels looking to pair program)",

Unless you have a reasonably powerful Nvidia GPU it can be a bit challenging but I can sum it up for you. Get comfy ui and watch a few quick tutorials about it. Then learn about something called \"IP adapter\". Basically, it allows you to take an image and upload it to comfy UI to create images based on the likeness of the uploaded image.The models you use are open free to download from within the comfy UI GUI. Most people use stable diffusion, but if you have a really powerful GPUs like 4090/3090 you can use Flux. Or, if you're looking for something specific (stylistic artistic styles) you can check out civitai.com (huggingface for image generation). You can find a wide variety of LoRAs (sort of like really fine tuned mini models) for exactly what you're looking for. After typing this out, I would probably avoid going too deep down this rabbit hole if you only have 15 days. As for the video generation, I don't have a lot of experience with video generation models, but diffusion generative AI (video generation) is very similar to image generation as far as I know. So, I imagine there are models that exist that can operate with IP adapter etc. However, image generation is very computationally expensive and video generation just takes it to another level. If you don't have access to powerful GPUs, look into some of the virtual machine services. They are fairly cheap, maybe a couple dollars per hour or find a way to use a free Google Collab for compute. Then, just spool up python and create a gradio web UI for the user to do all of this connected through API. It sounds like a lot, and it kind of is, but you could definitely pull it off in 15 days.This is a weird way to do a hackathon, IMO. Mostly because they're giving you what they want the result to be. I think a better approach would be \"Build a whimsical app that leverages generative AI (image and or video)\"",

It's absolutely easy to modify data sent by a client. If an attacker gets access to a database with the hashed passwords, they could just make a dummy client just directly send each hashed password and get access to every single account. If the hashing is done server-side and an attacker gets access to the database, the hashed passwords are useless since they don't know people's original passwords which will be put through the hash. If you really really are worried you can hash both client side and server side using two completely separate cryptographically secure hashing systems. However this doesn't add very much security - if a hacker compromises an individual's password they can still run the hash, or if they compromise the hash they can just send it directly as a dummy client. The only thing you're protecting is a potential client trust (e.g. what if they're storing the passwords in plaintext?). However regulations state that you can't store or print the passwords anywhere and any trustworthy company does not do this, just receiving the password as regular text, hashing to store/check, and immediately forgetting the text.",

Few things, though: \\- The system I have in place in my schematics has three parts: Clients, Private Nodes (Personal servers), and a Supernode (Global server). \\- Each server has a global identifier (to report to supernode and truly identify each user) and a local identifier to keep each user's identity hidden. Only time an admin gets to access serverside data is when a user is banned/suspended (because in this enviroment it means you either put the server's security at risk or repeatedly violated TOS/Server TOS) and the data is needed for the administrators (namely the owner of the server, for other purposes there is a separate security role called moderators, whom get lots less info for the exact reasons some of you pointed out) to debug what exactly did you break. My best guess was to save the password as the hash to prevent the server from knowing the exact password. \\- I'm not in the US, so my laws aren't the same, but this was a big oversight in my part and I'd like to apologize for it. Still, all shared info in that regard has been useful, so for that I thank you all.For one final question, though: If the server does not know the password, how do I actually check password veracity? Do I take the password, hash it again and check against the hash?",

Role Based Access Control is your friend here. Passwords could also be stored in a separate database with very restricted access. \\- access to sensitive data - this highly depends on what kind of data we're talking about and where you are operating since local laws and regulations apply.

For \"who can see data they don't need to\", it's largely industry based and based on legal restrictions on who can see what data. Though it's ideal that developers only get access to the information they need to test and debug their code, this isn't always necessary. Adding a bunch of restrictions will make it harder for the developers for a slight amount of added trust.For HIPAA compliance developers may see patient records and information to debug stuff and work on code and features, but the data that they see cannot contain personally identifiable information like name/email address/phone number/home address. Since there are also people working on the login portion and might need to see this information, there's a separation or \"iron curtain\" in place where the people who work with systems that handle personally identifiable information cannot have access to medical records or information. Other industries just make you \"promise really really hard\" under the consequence of huge lawsuits and financial repercussions. Like if you're working at a bank you might get information that Apple is executing an order to sell $1 billion of USD over the course of 3 days, or even non-public information about acquisitions and mergers. Not everyone has access to this information at the bank however, just the people working on the computer systems or on the deals. A person could potentially abuse this and frontrun their own trades or hand the information off to a relative. However IMO the stakes are too high to do this in nearly every case, and everyone that has access to this non-public information has a restriction on buying individual stocks, commodities contracts, or large amounts of any currency without explicit approval from compliance.I don't know about the realm of modern laws for social media, but I do know at one point in time there was a creepy Facebook employee that was using their position and access to data stalk a user. Since then Facebook has added additional restrictions on the amount of information granted to developers, and getting more information about someone specific had to be run through a compliance team to ensure it was for debugging/programming reasons.The one place where this material non-public information restriction does not exist, unfortunately, is for the US congress. They are given zero restrictions on stocks or products they can purchase or sell, and a huge ass 45 day window to report trades. It's concerning especially considering the amount of non-public information they deal with. Like if a congressperson knows that there is a huge deal in the works for a car manufacturer, they may buy the stock with no restriction, and only have to report the trade way after the deal has gone through and the stock has made significant gains.",

Start with learning how to set up the scaffolding for a minimal project (for example, start with an application that only prints \"hello world\" and then exits). Since you did not say what programming language you prefer or are somewhat convenient with, I would advise you to look up the documentation and check what they may recommend on how to get started. Explore what options there may be to start a new project.When you are confident with setting up new projects, you may add more complexity (for example, how you can get input from the user). As you get more confident, add more and more complexity, but do not rush.",

You’re a member of a team.Yeah, the work is hard and gnarly. Companies don’t get successful without accumulating a lot of lumpy and complex experience. In our trade, that messy experience gets crammed into our code bases. Academic approaches often make simplifying assumptions. Sometime, ask your professors about software they have to actually USE, not just dream up: grade reporting, grant applying, etc. When the heat is on, put on your anthropologist’s hat and observe how the org’s customs and taboos affect your workplace. And rest assured that they value you. I’ve had a couple of interns I didn’t value much, and they stayed far far less than a year. You got this! Hope and strength to you.",

What would you need to do in order to receive a full-time offer?IMO it's somewhat unprofessional/odd that you were not given that feedback: part of the job of a manager is to make sure every employee knows if they're meeting expectations/remove uncertainty about where they stand. But that's by-the-by -- I think the important thing here is to get direct info + directly ask for the feedback you're looking for.> I’ve been doing a programming internship at a big, globally known company for a year nowThe length of your internship is pretty unusual. Maybe this is a regional thing, but at least in my corner of the world (US west coast), most internships last ~3-4 months, typically during the student's summer break.In any case, I do think it's reasonable for you to be feeling burnt out. I don't think it's reasonable to expect you to juggle both schooling and work for this amount of time.> When I landed this internship, I had zero technical knowledge and was just starting my degree.I'm a little surprised by this, tbh -- somebody with zero technical background doesn't have the ability to contribute in a meaningful way in a programming role. It's an odd pick for an intern; usually you want somebody with partial experience so the intern mentor doesn't need to spend time covering the basics.Did the company know this when they hired you + ask you to go through some training program? Or was this more of a hybrid internship, where you applied some of your other skills in in addition to programming? What were their expectations?TBH my first instinct here was that the company did not set you up for success by hiring you at such an early stage in your career.> I made mistakes, of course,but no one really explained what I was doing wrong or how I could do better. Any internship program worth its salt should assign you a dedicated mentor. Do you have one? If not, can you ask your manager (or whoever is managing the internship program) to assign you one?> over time, I’ve started to feel like I’m being excluded. Nothing direct or obvious, but there are signs. I try to contribute, show interest, ask questions… but everything I do seems to go unnoticed. [...snip...] Despite being an intern, it often feels like we’re expected to deliver at the level of someone with years of experience.It's hard to tell what's happening here without more specifics.For example, maybe what's happening is that you rose to the occasion and people are treating as you as having roughly the same skill as a junior engineer -- and maybe they're leaving you alone since you seem to be doing fine and are not realizing you're actually struggling to keep up? Or alternatively, maybe they're disengaging because they need to focus on their own work now, or are burnt out themselves with teaching and mentoring? It's a bit hard to say.> Lately, I’ve been thinking that maybe I should try working at a smaller company—somewhere with a slower pace, less pressure, and where I might actually be able to learn and breathe.Usually an internship has a concrete end date; I'd try sticking it out until then. If yours does not, then I'm not quite sure what's going on tbh.Other things to try:- Quit to focus on your schoolwork. Find another internship next summer.- Add your current internship to your resume; use it to help you find an internship at a different but similarly well-regarded company.- Ask if you can transfer to a different team. Maybe the working culture will be different there?- Tell your manager that you're struggling to balance school and work and seeing if they can help adjust your workload. You're a student -- it's reasonable and correct for you to put your education first.",

And it never stops feeling awful when it happens, no matter how good you've become at the things that used to feel so difficult and complex.But I promise: you *will* get better at what you're doing right now. In a few years you're going to look back at what you didn't understand or what you've misunderstood and wonder \"why did that seem so hard? It's so simple, it's so clear to me now!\"And you'll also get better *at getting better*. That feeling of *none of this makes sense and it makes me so mad* might only last a few month, or weeks, or days.Now, to improving your current predicament. You mentioned not getting feedback or support. It might be time to start asking for it directly from individuals. Here are some tricks I use:* \"Hey, I did this way and it just feels wrong to me but I don't have enough context to know why or what would be better. Do you hav some time to go over it with me?\"* \"I'm about to start . Are there some other places in the code we've done something similar I could base my work off?\" Then see who wrote this and ask them for help too.* \"I could use some help just getting started. Do you have 30 minutes to [pair](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) with me to get me going in the right direction?\"If you don't feel comfortable asking directly, ask your manager similar question but ask them who would be good to speak to get answers. Then go to these people and say \"I'm doing and said you could help\" or ask your manager to ask them on your behalf.If your teammates and manager won't help, it might be time to start asking in more public forums at the company. There are likely helpful people on other teams or in other parts of the organization. If *nobody* can or will help you your company might be, and this is the technical term, *fucked.*It sounds like your career is already going to benefit from the reflected glory of the company. While money is nice, the most valuable benefit of working somewhere this early in your career is access to people who will help you learn and grow. It could very well be time to start looking around.Finally, once you're past this slump: work to model the behavior you wish you were seeing right now. Maybe someone is going to help unblock you or maybe you're going to power through on your own. Either way, hold that door open for the next person.",

You should also have someone working as your buddy / supervisor to help you out with learning and figuring out what you’re doing wrong. It sounds to me a bit like this company is trying to use interns as cheap labor. Also remember impostor syndrome is a big thing in this industry. If you feel you’re doing badly don’t be too hard on yourself. Remember you’re still learning and it’s going to take time. The industry is rough at the moment so my advice would be first speak to your manager to see how they view your performance and what you could do to improve / and also find out what support you could get from them.

It is way different a question with CS concepts, vocabulary and whatnot than a random question with whatever you think you are dealing with. During your junior years is ok too, to ask like that but not after 3-5 years.Start coding, face adversity and challenges, then read the manuals, then code again, look for examples in internet and then code again.I write it again **read the fucking manuals(RTFM)**, it would save you a lot of pain. You can use perplexity or this kind of forums.You really do not want to be like the senior guy who doesn’t understand the difference between standards, linking, compiling, embedded domain, application domain, OOP and many more. It just doesn’t inspire as the title.Believe me it is very different when you talk with both types of personas.This habit of reading and understanding the concepts is what helps engineers to be less anxious. Every second programmer is so anxious about this.",

Where do we start and where do we end.Let's start near the top, and cover the upper level bit.When you fire up your web browser, you basically get a blank canvas.You type in the Domain Name of the website and hit go/enter.That domain name is then looked up using a name resolution system called DNS (rabbit hole one) to get it to resolve to an address. This is very similar to you looking up your friend Bob in the contacts list on your phone, since names are easier than numbers.The browser then sends a request to the server(s) residing at the address it got to download your web page. (Another rabbit hole here). This is done using the HTTP protocol (more rabbit hole), the web page is then likely to be created using HTML as the markup language (more rabbit holes). The HTML might inform the browser it needs additional bits which require additional requests to the server or even other servers. These include things like stylesheets (CSS) to make things look pretty, code (JavaScript), pictures (PNG, GIF, JPEG, etc), videos (MPEG4, etc), sound/music (MP3, WAV, etc), and others.After the first HTML page is downloaded the browser will start to render the page and all the content and the code may start to be executed. The code might do nothing until you interact with the page, or it might send a request to a server for some dynamic data, which would be another HTTP request to some server somewhere.Each HTTP request might involve a different server which we don't have the address for yet, so that would be another set of DNS requests to look up those addresses.That's the near top level of how a website works with your web browser. Your next question might be how all these abbreviations, protocols, and the like work and how they all work together and for that we have a variety of central standards that specify how these work so everyone that needs to can implement their own. The majority of these are what are called RFCs (requests for comment) managed by the IETF (internet engineering task force) and we also have the w3c (world wide web consortium) and a few other organizations/groups made up of industry specialists like IANA (they're more involved in the DNS side).We have a generic model for a lot of this called the OSI model, and that allows us to navigate the rabbit holes and find the occasional breathable pocket.Hope that helps, Wikipedia has a lot of the extra information you might want to learn about, but beware of the rabbit holes (they're everywhere).",

        "body": "You might be jumping a bit ahead of yourself here... Here's a brief rundown of how this all works:Your PC has a network card. That NIC uses some black magic to establish itself as a given IP on your local network, let's assign it as 192.168.1.20.Any traffic on your network will be able to talk to your network card using that address, and if your computer talks to anything else on your network then the recipient will see it got a package from that address.One such device on your network is a router, which is also connected to your ISP's network.When your computer tries to make a request to something not on your local network, say.... 8.8.8.8, then it asks the router if it knows how to get to 8.8.8.8. The router then asks the ISP, the ISP knows and then tells the router which tells the computer, the computer then sends the packet to the router to give to the ISP to give to 8.8.8.8.A similar process works for resolving domain names to server IPs.So when you go to google.com, your browser asks your network card to ask your router to ask your ISP if that's possible. It is, and a request is sent to whatever address that google.com resolves to, \"Give me your home page.\"Google's server receives that request and after some processing sends back an HTML file, and probably a css and a JavaScript file. So an HTML file comes from Google to your ISP to your router to your network card to your browser, and a web page renders. Then your browser also executed the JavaScript that got sent and applies the css, not necessarily in that order. The JavaScript can then phone home by asking the browser to ask the card to ask the router to ask the ISP to give a message to Google, and so the cycle continues.TL;DR: By the time you get a webpage, a connection to the server has already been made at least once. The browser handles most of the details of connecting. The JS can make subsequent requests if the programmer deems it necessary",

I would (based on what I know) not consider it the equivalent of CS50x which is based on a Harvard course. That is, it's not aimed at a Stanford CS major (with Stanford being one of the highest regarded CS programs in the US), and therefore might be too challenging for a typical beginner. It feels like it's more beginner friendly and slower-paced.In that case, I'd probably do CS50x. CS50p you could even do along with CS50x but they have different emphasis. CS50p is more like a series of Python exercises and is not CS50x in Python. CS50x is trying to introduce computer science concepts including programming, but covers other topics (later on) beyond just programming.I would recommend CS50x. Search for `cs50x edX 2025` and you can sign up for free at any time, and go at your own pace.Because you've already had a year of programming, you should find the programming assignments (called problem sets) easier than most, but they are still fairly challenging. Most of the core material is in C though the first \"week\" is in Scratch which is a visual language aimed at beginners. Although the course is broken down in weeks, you can go at your own pace, either as fast as the course goes or much slower, depending on how much time you have available.That's my two cents.Otherwise, you can look for courses in data structures and algorithms.Many of the courses you've mentioned are aimed at beginning programmers with no experience. CS50x, admittedly, is fast-paced. The nice part is you'd learn some C on top of Python you already know, which could be useful.",

The reality is you earn college credit by paying for it, but as an admitted college student at Harvard (the yearly tuition is about 60,000 US dollars which is around 52,000 Euros). In any case, it's an introductory course at Harvard, so it's not worth a whole lot. But, as mentioned before, there are ways to get it for free once you've completed the course.There's a bunch of follow-up courses. You could even start CS50w which is by the same folks that made CS50x which is \"web programming\" in Python.

I found SwiftUI very intuitive and not hard at all. You may also find that Android has a lot of overlap with SwiftUI in how they handle things.Take a look at [HackingWithSwift 100 Days](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) It is free and a wonderful way to get a firm grounding on SwiftUI, imo. If you want to get a better Syntax grasp on Swift? Check out [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/swift) which is also free and an amazing way to learn, but note, this is for experienced people who have some background in development, thy do not show you how to code.Plug: I am a contributor to Exercism.

It’s often the simplest, cleanest way to avoid unnecessary complexity.Sure, you *could* publish a library and pull it into every project, but then you’re committing to maintaining that dependency — even when you just want to tweak a single line. Suddenly you’ve invented your own private tech debt.Especially in environments like Node.js, it’s often smarter to keep basic helper functions local. Pulling a tiny function from an external library just adds another attack vector to your software — sometimes over something you could write yourself in 10 lines.AI also plays into this now: it’s easy to just generate small helper functions on the fly instead of bloating your projects with unnecessary third-party libraries.Basically: keep it simple unless there’s a real need to get fancy.",

Coding is great for that because you can just install whatever you need on your PC and mess around. Then pick between some basic coding directions: web development? You could start learning HTML and CSS for text and styling. And then jump get into JavaScript language for more complex functions. Does data science interest you? Or game development? You'll likely end up doing some Python language. Read a bit about simple databases and start a common learning project like a note-taking app. What is your interest in coding?",

It’s still requests and responses.

For that one, if you want to self study (good luck) you'll want to study the equivalents of Calc 1-3, Diff Eq, Physics I & II, and then the CS and ECE course (details listed on various GT sites). You can find alternatives from other schools but they'll be roughly equivalent.https://ece.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/BSCmpEDegree_Planning.pdf - This one shows an order through the courses. And you can see the pages for the different threads (specializations) which gives a reccomended set of thematically related courses.Once you've examined a few curricula, you can visit sites like https://ocw.mit.edu/search/?d=Electrical%20Engineering%20and%20Computer%20Science&s=department_course_numbers.sort_coursenum to find open course material (GT isn't the best about that, or isn't consistent at least).",

But if you keep giving up, you end going nowhere.So you can be passionate about the idea of coding but not the actual coding itself because coding is not about the code or the computer, it's about solving problems.",

You might, for example, find work as a front-end developer that is not fussed about your API skills whatsoever. But more often than not jobs tend to be full stack. So aim for that if you can.

Also, it's a lot easier IMO to manage env variables, bash scripts, cron jobs, the list goes on. Linux and mac are just a lot more prevalent in the open source community and install instructions for libraries often assume you're using unix, or the windows instructions are an afterthought. That said, I wouldn't sweat it too much. Especially if this is just a hobby it probably won't matter at all, and if you're switching there is some learning overhead but it's not really a huge deal. tl;dir my 2c having 10 years professional experience, Windows is fine but I wouldn't personally use it unless i'm uninstalling malware from my dad's browser",

Explore things like:* Web Dev (Front-end, Back-end, or Full-stack), tons of jobs and tons of framework wars between devs* Mobile apps development (iOS/Android, or cross-platform app development (React Native or Flutter). Strong demand, because every company eventually wants to make their app* Game Programming (learning C++ or C# (for Unity)) if you're into games or computer graphics, but it’s competitive and may be not very paying, unless you land a unicorn gig.* AI/ML and Data Science — this is very much right now (obviously), but it’s quite different from regular programming, strong math skills required and, of course, interest in data.* Cloud/DevOps — there's and there will always be demand for maintaining cloud/server infrastructure* Cybersecurity — very underrated, but the need is massive and growing.Whichever direction you go, make sure it’s something you actually enjoy working with. High-paying fields can often be stressful and at times require a lot of grind, so it’s important not to get in the end burnt out.",

Python is normally a good choice: it strikes a good balance between being relatively beginner-friendly and relatively powerful.The real difficulty is going to lie in the fact that EPUB and PDF files are pretty complex things behind the scenes. Even if someone has done the hard work for you (e.g. there is a library that reads EPUBs and turns them into an easy stream of information for you, and there is a library that takes an easy stream of information and writes PDFs from it), it's not an easy first project, and you might spend a very long time digging through technical specifications of the file formats. If they **haven't** done the hard work for you, and you have to learn to parse the file formats yourself, that's an extra layer of difficulty.Don't let me put you off the idea, but if you're new to programming, I'd strongly recommend looking into some simpler projects first!

Translating from one file to another is difficult, as each file format contains a unique representation of data. You would need to go through the file format specification of both file types, then create a program that parses one file format, create an intermediate representation, and then outputs it into the desired file format. You would have to do this for each conversion type you want. Its difficult enough that there are multiple companies dedicated to making these programs, so you should approach it more as a possible learning experience rather than building something practical.You could make a simple program where you use a pre-existing library for the file conversion, but at that point it would probably be better to use another program entirely.",

That being said, I think Go would be a good language to write a lower-level implementation of these tools, it's jsut that it would require a deep understanding of the filetypes you're concerned with converting between. If you want the challenge, I'd pick Go, C++, or Rust (in that order because I've never used Rust yet). Also you can't beat Python's simplicity and elegance, if production level speed isn't a concern, or you don't expect to need to batch operations, then you can write these tools out fully in pure python. Writing your own conversion software in Python then trying to use it for heavy work might feel sluggish if you're not very particular about optimization.",

For example, a RESTful API endpoint is best written as just a standalone procedure rather than being a class method, since the API is inherently stateless and thus there is no state to encapsulate.

If you don’t already know people in tech, start building your presence: share your projects publicly (on GitHub, Twitter, LinkedIn), write about what you’re learning, and try to connect with others working on similar stuff. Collaborations or open-source contributions can also lead to real-world opportunities.Keep learning, keep building — visibility plus consistency is the cheat code.",

This way, it is closer to the function header, so everyone can see what kind of data is expected when looking at the header. Also, it reduces code complexity because. You will generally need less (nested) if conditions. In this case, the if-clauses are greatly simplified because you don't need to check for the lower bound.Secondly, you don't need else-if clauses. The return statement kind of has an implicit 'else'-effect. Everything after a return statement is unreachable code, so the program will only reach the next statement if it did not go through the return statement.Thirdly, this kind of code can probably expressed as a loop or even a one liner, because the if statements are very repetitive.

You start filling buckets when knob - bucket <= 0 (positive knob delays the start, negative knob does not affect the beginning) You stop filling buckets when 7 + knob - bucket >= 0 is false (negative knob cuts off the end, positive knob does not affect it)In total you would want to increment each time and round to the nearest int, and only fill buckets when knob - bucket = 0",

As you go past the halfway point, the 'return 7' becomes the most likely until you reach 100% at which 'return 7' happens 100% of the time. I almost think of it like holding a cylinder full of liquid on its side and tilting it to one side or the other. If the cylinder is flat, the liquid is evenly distributed, if it's tilted slightly it begins accumulating on one side, more with a greater angle. My thinking was that it was an 8 bit value being compared to give a finer granularity in determining the greater than or less than values.In practical application it's for a self-generating musical sequencer, like an algorithmic player piano, to determine the length of a musical step (analogous to how long a piano key is held down). If you turn the knob all the way to the left, the musical notes generated by the sequencer will only be one musical step long. If it's all the way to the right, it will only generate 8-step-long notes. If it's a quarter of the way, it will produce mostly one step notes, with some two step notes, less three step notes, even less four step notes, etc. Hope that makes sense!",

        "body": "I really admire that you're diving into HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and Python at 54—your passion and diverse background are definite strengths. That said, I want to be as candid as possible:Freelancing in programming typically comes after years of experience in the industry. While there's no formal barrier to entry beyond setting up a profile on a freelancing platform, this low threshold means you're competing against a vast pool of skilled coders—many with years of experience, advanced degrees, and robust portfolios filled with positive client reviews. Back in the mid-2010s, there was a surplus of tech needs, and companies were more willing to take on individuals with bootcamp training or certifications in lieu of real experience because the talent pool was scarce. In today's market, the situation has reversed—tech is high-paying and attractive, leading to a surplus of highly experienced, often laid-off programmers. Most companies have their pick of talent, whether hiring full-time employees or freelancers, so they have little incentive to take a chance on entry-level coders or invest time and money into training someone without a proven track record. It's not impossible by any means, but it will take several people willing to \"give you a chance.\" Until you build up those client experience reviews, finding freelance gigs will be especially challenging. It's the classic chicken-and-egg scenario: you need a job to gain experience, but you need experience to get the job.The alternative—landing an entry-level programmer role remotely—is almost completely out of the picture. Remote positions nowadays are typically reserved for those who already have a strong background because the market for remote roles is fiercely competitive. The COVID era, where remote work was the norm, is rapidly fading; everyone wants to work from home, but few get to. In many parts of the world, especially in regions like the U.S. (at least where I'm writing), remote experienced freelance or full-time programmers are still a thing—but entry-level remote roles are virtually non-existent. Even on-site roles face fierce competition. I'm not sure how things shake out in places like Albania or wider Europe, but the trend is similar: only highly experienced folks, often bolstered by a flood of laid-off talent, get those remote opportunities.On top of that, generative AI tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot are changing the game. These tools can handle many of the routine tasks that junior developers used to do—completing boilerplate code and similar work much faster than a human. As a result, the real value in programming today isn't just about writing code; it's about leveraging it to solve complex, real-world problems. The true edge lies in depth and creativity, where your ability to draw on years of industry-specific experience can help you harness generative AI efficiently—something AI by itself can't do. This shift leaves even less room for entry-level programmers, as companies lean on the efficiency of AI and the expertise of veterans.My advice? Keep learning the basics and enjoy the process, but once you have a solid foundation, jump into advanced tools like Google Gemini Canvas. This isn't just about using fancy new software—it's a reality check that shows how far generative AI has come and how it can outperform entry-level folks on routine tasks. It also reminds you that real value comes from using code to solve meaningful problems, something that only someone with experience and creative problem-solving skills can do. In other words, don't just aim to be a freelance coder; consider positioning yourself as a consultant who can merge your decades of industry expertise with your growing tech skills to solve niche, real-world challenges.Bottom line: You haven't missed the boat yet, but today's boat is more like a high-speed ferry crammed with highly experienced, AI-enhanced pros. Your journey will be challenging, but by being realistic and strategic—focusing on niche projects, learning the basics, and quickly adopting advanced AI tools—you can carve out your own path in this highly competitive, ever-changing market.Good luck, and keep enjoying the learning process!",

Simple code needs little to no comments. Complex code needs many comments to explain it. Don’t solve a complex problem when you can solve a simple one instead. Split a complex problem into multiple simple ones if you can. Don’t optimize unnecessarily. If a function doesn’t need to be fast, a simple, slow solution is fine. Each file in your project should be able to be read and understood by itself. Ideally no files should exceed 2000 lines and a competent developer should be able to read and understand the file within 1 hour. After reading the file they should understand what functionality the file provides, what libraries and other files the file depends on, how often the file’s functions are expected to be called (once an hour vs 1000 times a second), and be confident that the file doesn’t have bugs. Your code should be able to be read from top to bottom. A reader ideally should not have to jump around a file, or jump between multiple files for things to make sense. Use functions to eliminate/reduce similar code blocks. Inline most single use functions. Use single line functions sparingly. Reduce the amount of useless information that the reader has to see. Example: if a class’s field is the same 99% of the time, use a default value for the field in the __init__ function. If you pass that field in every time, you’ll waste space and you’ll make the more important set fields less visible. Use white space to separate code blocks. Too much white space can be a bad thing. Ideally a function should fit on one screen, so the reader doesn’t have to scroll up if they need to look back at a line. Code is great when it looks so simple and obvious that most readers would assume that it was easy to write.",

The 'continue to Gmail?' redirect is also very bad practice, you should never automatically redirect to a different domain like that without consent. There's no way to cancel the redirect, it loads no matter what you do. You also shouldn't assume everyone will use Gmail.I'd recommend using sans-serif fonts consistently for the UI. serif fonts can look ugly when mixed with sans-serif, and are harder to read at lower sizes and resolutions.I am curious about what the site actually does.Edit: I was able to make an account using a Gmail address, and it looks like a decent skeleton for a competitive flashcard site(?), but I wasn't able to create any training sets or join a game. The article features & profile customization are interesting, and this could probably be a fun learning tool when fleshed out.",

I have automatic login set up, so the chance of users accidentally sending a account creation message is less likely than otherwise. You mentioned fonts, which is interesting, as I haven't thought about font choice at all yet... In terms of what the site actually does... not too much sofar. It's a math site for people serious about improving their skills. Most maths websites are for kids, but mine isn't. Sofar, there is an elo based competitive math game, similar to chess( in the \"Play section\"). There is also a \"train section\". This is similar to flashcard-based spaced repetition tools like Anki or Quizlet. The idea is that you create a set of math problems, or use someone elses. You can also create math articles.

When I build a few silly apps like a custom flashlight, calculator, Todo lists, meal planner etc. I decided I want to make games.So I picked up C# (guess what, it was really similar), I was watching Brackeys and I learned a lot about Unity3D, I learned to 3D model my assets in Blender, texture stuff etc. I made a few games (tower defense, endless runner and then I even published one game on App Store where you had to draw symbols on screen in order to destroy stuff that was falling from the sky)Then I decided that I would like to build a web app so my friends and family can use it. So I picked up JavaScript, then React. Made a few projects and web apps. (I already had 1 year old kid at this moment)At that point I told myself. Man you're kinda good at this thing and you really like it, let's make a living out of it. So I started to apply.And here I'm, working as a fullstack from home for an awesome company with awesome people and a boss. This journey took me about 6+ years of my life.",

This time I decided to do web because of the creative side of front end. So I started with a really basic HMTL, CSS course on YouTube. Then began to build my own personal projects.",

Fundamental DSA concepts are applicable to basically any language, so although you will have to figure out how to \"translate\" other languages into Python (good learning experience and exposure to other languages), you'll still be learning DSA. I only say this because most DSA resources (the popular ones I'm aware of at least) are either in other languages (often Java) or are not in any particular language at all. That said, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hly31xKli0) is specifically in Python if you want, though it's a fairly intro-level overview of DSA.

That is so others can reproduce or at least understand your setup.You mentioned \"ue5\" toward the end, but I had to google that to figure out you were talking about unreal engine. So probably you are working in C++, if I am not mistaken.C++ uses low level system data types. This can actually vary between system or machine architecture! But for the most part you are gonna have signed or unsigned ints, either in 32 or 64bits. These may be referred to as int or long, but make sure to check your specs.But if you were working in python, integers support arbitrary precision by default. So 2\\*\\*1000 will spit out a number about 300 or so digits long, and 2\\*\\*(2\\*\\*1000) will just hang your system, because there's not enough memory in the universe to write that number down in base 10 format.So even with arbitrary precision, there are practical limits. That's why it's called arbitrary precision not infinite precision.There are one or more arbitrary precision libraries for C/C++. The one I have used is GMP. But it may be easier to just setup a python interpreter in many cases.",

If i used the minuteCount i would have to do them every second.I cant foresee any instance where the minute count would rise by more than 1 at a time.

Sometimes the names arent exactly as the name of the package so i recomend you find it in the [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) website and copy a text that appears in the top left of every module page.For example if you want to install pygame-ce you go to https://pypi.org/project/pygame-ce/ and copy the line \"pip install pygame-ce\" to your terminal and then the module should be downloading to then be used.After that, if you want to call the module from your project use import (module) in your code. The module name here can also change and you could have different ones for different things so you should check the documentation of that module to see what to call and use for your purpose.",

Something like Python is fine for productivity, but I don't think that you necessarily learn as much that's applicable to as many other projects than C. With Python, you mostly learn Python-specific stuff. And by the way, since Python is based on C, learning C also helps you understand Python better.",

If those are your areas of interest, Python may be the better path for you. You won't go wrong with either one. You'll learn how to structure your thinking to solve a problem using a logical methodology.

This method works because you are attempting to reproduce the coding style of another. You are learning how his code works. Just keep attempting to reproduce the web page. When you can reproduce the webpage without viewing the code contained inside, you have successfully accomplished your mission. Keep up the good work. Learning JavaScript/Webpages in this manner is effective. I would recommend spending 1/2 of your time working YouTube tutorials, the rest of the time, reproducing another person's web page.",

Our university library had the licenses for digital copies and enough physical books in case you really do want to read on paper.It's up to your personal taste if you want to buy it. These textbooks are quite expensive because of the publishers policies.As for the book itself, I see it as a decent reference textbook. It's rigorous and shows you the mathematical details. However, it's also super dense and kind of dry. You do need to have good math skills to go through it. I used it for example less for sorting but more for trees.Algorithms by Sedgewick for example I found much more approachable and modern but I felt like it was also much less detailed on the math part. So I learned by a combination of both books and lecture slides. Goodrich and Tamassia's book in Java is also ok, although I really did not do much with that book.Proper DSA courses do require you to have a solid grasp of math notation and foundational math knowledge, so it really isn't an easy course per se.",

Some of the introductory stuff is kind of okay, but it goes very fast, and takes huge strides through binary search, insertion sort and merge sort, to use as a basis for further, more advanced algorithms. Which I think is a mistake, because it is the simple things that are hardest to understand - once you get them though, it is fairly easy to understand the many different complex algorithms that the book goes through.Honestly, I'd suggest something like Grokking Algorithms to read to understand the basic principles, and then use Wikipedia articles for each algorithm that you have to study - often they quote CLRS, but add additional explanations or pseudocode.Check if your library has the book, and read some of the chapters in the syllabus - if you like their style of writing, by all means buy the book, if not, see if you can do without.",

They'll be hiring a replacement as soon as they can.Being *laid off* means the company is eliminating your position, probably alongside a ton of others, because either they literally can't afford you, or they're making some big, strategic decision about where they want to invest. And there's a better chance you get some kind of severance package.It's not as clean a difference as I'm painting -- sometimes companies use layoffs to get rid of people they wanted to fire anyway, and not everyone gets a good severance. But it's a difference that can matter to companies hiring, or to lawyers if it comes to it. Very few people ever got *fired* from Google. Thousands have been *laid off.*",

Ironically, one of those contractors was Indian and was promoted to a managerial role, then flown overseas to train people to replace us.I had been told to document all of my work and how to troubleshoot typical issues way before the conversation of offshoring even started, thinking nothing of it at the time since we were doing a shift from one note to confluence... not realizing I was writing the manual for my replacement. I genuinely loved what I did, even though it was often extremely stressful.Now, I’ve been unemployed for over a year and two months. I'm still searching for something, but no luck so far. I've been looking for Data Analyst roles and SWE roles and its been rough. I worked at a big pharma for 2.5 years",

The general concept is that you should enter a market that needs you, and not just do what your parents and grandparents did. Software engineering was a huge growth field in the 1990s, and people looking for a good career chose it. Manufacturing has been in decline for decades, and so people should look other places for a good career.Software engineering is still a good skill for people who have been in the industry. But, it's not growing anywhere nearly as fast as it was. So, people who are looking to enter the market should find another niche. The world changes. If you insist on treating the world as it was 30 years ago, you will be left out. Don't go into manufacturing. Don't write CGI scripts in Perl, or VB Forms or whatever. Do data science, or focus on highly scalable data processing, or installing green energy sources like solar. Whatever it is, look at what the world actually needs, and don't demand the world changes for you.Edit: it's been a long day for me. I said \"don't go into advertising\" but meant \"don't go into manufacturing\". I was talking about advertising when I wrote it :neutral_face:",

I started obsessively documenting everything I learn and build. If others can understand the problem, they can solve it. 3. Finding the right team culture matters more than the paycheck. Search for jobs that respect work life balance. A service like Applyre might be helpful here. I took a slight pay cut for a team that genuinely respects work-life balance.Tech doesn't have to be a trap. The industry has problems, but with the right boundaries and environment, it can still offer the flexibility and challenge that attracted us in the first place. Finding that balance took me years, but it's possible.",

Being always on edge is a problem. You need to learn to detach yourself a bit if that's how you feel 24/7. You sound burnt out. It's critical you learn to handle this cause it'll keep happening if you don't.1) Meditation, do it 30 minutes a day every single day. Unplug, turn off your phone, no computer alerts, no tv, just meditate for 30 minutes every day. Look up some videos how to if you don't know yet.2) Go into nature at least 1 day a week ideally but if you can take a walk in nature multiple days a week that's even better.3) You shouldn't be on-call all the time, there should be a rotation at the company. If there isn't an on-call rotation, find another company cause the one you're in is toxic and unhealthy or if you have some seniority implement an on-call rotation and refuse to be available when it's not your day/week.These are the strategies I use to manage it. Also, therapy and anxiety medication can help. Best of luck.",

Put away as much money as you can, and the biggest choice there is the house that you rent/buy and the car that you intend to drive. I would avoid thinking that you make X and therefore you should buy a house that corresponds to X. Now it may turn out that things in the US stabilize, especially if some court cases start going against Trump and we make it to the midterms.

Are you trying to get them to understand that you may not be able to achieve the goals set for the team? Are you trying to get help? Are you just venting?Your manager asked you to help fix the team. That means she’s probably already aware something is wrong with them and is looking for you to help come up with solutions or at least help identify what they’re doing wrong. If you need extra resources or to change the roadmap or need her to back you up on process changes, my guess is that’s all on the table, but she’s looking for your guidance and some semblance of a plan. Going back to her and just saying “this team sucks” isn’t helpful to anyone.If I was your manager and you came back to me and said, “The team is broken and I can’t fix it. Please move me because I don’t want this on my resume.” I’d honestly be pretty pissed and it would impact our relationship. I’m looking for your help with a problem at your current job and you’re telling me no because you’re worried about your next job. If you came to me and said, “Here are the problems I see. I think we need to focus on fixing this tech debt for a while which should allow us to deliver faster in the future. If we can get one more engineer on the team I think that would help too.” That would be much more well received even if I couldn’t make that happen.Venting to your manager a little bit is fine, but most of the time if you’re bringing a problem to your manager you should also bring at least one suggestion of how to solve it. If the problem is something that they’ve explicitly asked you to help fix then having some ideas on how to fix this is almost mandatory. You can almost always bring problems to your manager as long as you frame it in a way where you’re trying to be part of a solution.",

There are still a lot of issues with communication and collaboration.

Academic trainng is extremely just super helpful for any knowledge work jobOther than be extremely good at what you're currently doing, having a natural interest in CS, and trying out random things all the time, is a huge benefit. For the last decade plus of my career I've really just followed the oppurtunity, and each step was just a different role in the process of building web applications. So I have done several different roles, but taking a step back, my skillset is unified under a broad \"develop web technologies in emerging domains\". That said, for every transition, I've always narrowed in on one thing I want to do, and just apply to jobs of those types. Like my last job I was a team lead of an infrastructure team, and didn't really like that, so I decided my next job would be some sort of product engineering. That got me in to a big tech company, and now I get paid enough to just focus on leading a team, and besides a reading group and some side projects, I don't really stress about keeping my skills up.",

It became that way over a century of purely money-seeking individuals who value chasing $$$ way above sacrificing anything artistic, passionate, or human.Lo and behold, CS started becoming populated with such people. Now today our industry is flooded (especially in the junior levels) with folks who really would've thrived better in finance.That's a major part of why there's a massive rift between the high demand for actually skilled academically-minded technical folk, and the massive supply of generic dudebros looking to make money.",

A doctor can talk to NurseGPT all day, but something has to put in an IV and hang a drip line. A lot of robotics actually being used are incredibly simple, flat boxes that lift up 3cm and move pallets around for example. Robotics that can stand in one spot plugged into a wall and do the same thing over and over like on an assembly line, sure, but the power usage and overheating problems need to be worked out for autonomous units. And they need to do something about LLMs confidently giving you the wrong answer before anyone will trust them.But let’s say they iron out all the kinks; I’ve heard upwards of 60-70% of jobs could be replaced. Our systems are not setup to handle such massive unemployment. All these giant tech firms are not going to give up their earnings to contribute to any form of UBI, the line must go up! There are too few politicians that aren’t bought and paid for that will actually stand up and do something. In the long run this is all just another big tech bait-n-switch. They can run at giant losses for years, maybe even decades as they continue to subsidize everything with the parts of the business that make money. They will sell a restaurant a waiter bot with the latest wAIter model installed, but it can only stand at the hostess podium, and tries to seat people at already occupied tables 30% of the time. Human Robotics promises it will replace your entire wait staff in 5 years so a few people lose their jobs. But turns out the wAIter model was just a chatGPT wrapper making API calls the entire time. Human Robotics is running out of seed money, so now before the robot will seat your customers they must watch a 30 second unskipable ad for the McDonalds across the street.It just seems like if everything works out the way the big tech companies want it’s the worst possible outcome for humanity.",

I responded to his comment, but he was too much of a beach to respond back to me. There is definitely a lot of negativity online in these groups, though I have to agree, Reddit really is one big echo chamber as well. I see the same posts on here every day multiple times a day about people whining about the job market and giving up on the tech field and not getting hired. Idk.

Not much else to accomplish (EHS) but I figured it is different, I won't be bored for at least 1-2 years, maybe it will lead to a career change like I hope to eventually. 1st interview - great, went well, just like you, I was straight shooting.. I had nothing to lose so you can do that sometimes. 2nd interview - COO is involved.. Very open honest discussion, great discussion. Dude knew I achieved what I wanted in EHS, looking for an opportunity into business side (non-ehs), was bored, etc. He tells me I am overqualified and that I am better than Safety. While some may have gotten offended, I did not because I agree lol. Nothing against my EHS brothers/sisters.. I just have always been bored and found it not challenging enough (I am director level currently). He was just spot on with everything and we were just starting to converse.. At this point, my interviews are not your typical \"give me a time you had to use decision making in a high-stress situation\" but more conversational, management style, personality assessing, etc. At least in my experience the last 2 job changes. I get rejected, but while being rejected for role I interviewed for, they tell me there is another opportunity that they would love to discuss with me if still interested. I checked their website to see what jobs were listed, and it was only a handful and none of them would match any I would fill. I believe the COO I connected with is throwing me a lifeline for a career change. They know how much I currently make and that I would not take less (3 small kids, wife to support), but he must have seen or heard something that caused him to throw me a potential bone and transition into a new career. I am very much looking forward to learning more, but it feels good that this even happened and that my skills and abilities are easily recognized by the C-Suite in at least one company lolGreat post OP.. Glad I am not the only one going through this! I have never been in a situation like it so hoping I make the right decision.",

Many suggested that to follow Jeff Atwood's initial vision for SO the site would need to reduce duplication not through closing, but through merging content, and producing canonical content across multiple questions. These problems had dragged on for over a decade, and ultimately SO never learned from them. They focused more on power users over the overall vision.Alongside this, internal changes mean that Jeff left, eventually Joel left (IIRC?), the dev days died, and the reputation the site had kept dying out.I don't think it'll die, but it needs very strong leadership to become relevant again.",

Almost every meaningful question has already been asked, so any new questions just get referred to a previous question and closed as duplicate. The only questions that don't get closed are typically about niche technologies that not a lot of people engage withPeople still have questions and even if it wasn't allowed they could often get some kind of answer from StackOverflow.

You could be in any career, in any field, in any position and still get laid off. This is just the way of the world.With your YoE, you should be getting messages from recruiters on LinkedIn and other platforms that can easily land you interviews. Try premium for a month, spruce up your LinkedIn and add all the common skills you see across the job descriptions you are interested in. Even if you don’t have the skills, read up on docs and just get a basic understanding so that you can speak to it during interviews. Add those skills to your LinkedIn and Resume, I guarantee your profile starts getting hits from recruiters. Talk to the ones who supply Job Descriptions you’d actually consider taking. This is genuine advice that worked for me. I found a position after about a month and a half with 7 YoE (NYC area) which is really the same as 5 in the grand scheme of things.I’m sick of hearing people cry that CS careers are over. There will literally always be a need for SWEs. If you think AI will replace us, then you clearly haven’t used AI very much yet. It fucks up a LOT, and is really more of a tool than a replacement for people.The job market will eventually recover and you will be able to get a good job with good pay. Stop dick riding FAANG as well. FAANG is what made the market what it is because they over hired and over paid for people and set unrealistic expectations for what SWE careers should actually look like. They set a standard for unrealistic hiring practices that is not reflective of actual work we do on a daily basis. We’re grinding LC for months just to do a job where we do basic system design and basic logic. It’s absolutely ridiculous.Also, FAANG looks good on resumes, sure, but so does experience in any real job where you can back up that experience with technical knowledge. If someone is gonna hire you just because your resume says FAANG, then they’re an idiot and you probably shouldn’t work for them anyway.Lower your salary expectations a bit, you have to realize that you’re in competition with a ton of other people who were laid off and are all expecting to make more money than what they were making than when they were laid off. It’s better to have a decent paying job than no job at all.",

One things I recommend, is getting a credit card, or two, and calling them every couple of months to ask for a raise in your limit. If push comes to shove and you need money, that gives you access to cash well you sell investments to cover.The biggest hit so far with the economy is that I'm paid a lot less (-20% so far), so it's not that I'm saving more, it's just I earn considerably less because I get paid in stock.

We had inflation in 2023 and 2024 due to COVID supply chain issue that affected us then. Worldwide inflation was insane but the US handled it better than others.

You roll in around 10 am and do standup. Work for an hour then lunch for an hour. You'll stand in line for 30 minutes at a food truck if you don't go before 12. At 1 you'll work for a few hours then go home. Maybe ping pong or something once a week if you have coworkers who are into that and you want to play. That's your day. Somewhere in there you'll go get your free coffee and a banana and think about working at a company that isn't so cheap.As you get promoted, there are more and more meetings with every promotion and you get involved in all kinds of random email/slack threads but you're also expected to get as much coding done as the L4s.Most everything depends on your team and manager. Your manager has a very large role in your happiness and how horrible your deadlines are and your team will make it fun + help you... or they won't and you'll cry yourself to sleep because you can't figure anything out. Difficult to tell you if it will be good or not.You should pick waymo tbh. Amazon's mandatory firing bucket and current layoff outlook has had a corrosive effect on the culture and if you have a good option, you should go there.",

Feeling out of your depth sometimes just means you're growing. That said, it’s also okay to want something a little different. Some folks find their groove in more stable, documentation-heavy environments; others thrive on the chaos of building fast and figuring it out later. Neither is better—it’s just about fit. If you're unsure, try talking to other engineers (in or outside your org) about their day-to-day. You’d be surprised how many feel the same way you do, even if they don’t say it out loud.",

That ranges from marketing your achievements (resume and interview), Leetcoding better than most other applicants, etc.> Great, so educate us about what engineers do. Now on to the original question, there's actually **alot**. And it **varies**. Meetings definitely happen and they take a lot of time but meetings encompasses a lot of things we do. Meetings can be technical discussions or product discussions for instance. They can also be pair programming, debugging sessions, bug finding sessions... so many things. As to some things AI cannot do well compared to a mid level programmer? They are terrible at writing code that scales well and they are terrible at high level context (use them in big code bases). This is why when I use AI, I make it do more specific tasks that way it understands the context better and its more limited in scope so its easier to refactor to be good code. Or I use it for throwaway code for MVPs at which point it doesn't matter if the code scales or not.AI is still great though and is a good productivity boost but its nowhere near a replacement for any competent mid level dev.",

        "body": "IMO, SysAdmin as a role has been dying and their responsibilities have been folded into roles like DevOps, SRE, and Systems Engineering. If the company has a “SysAdmin” title, there’s a good chance it’s old school or tech isn’t their main focus. The lower salary band is very telling since they tend to get paid a lot more at true tech companies. The upper salary for SRE, DevOps, and Systems Engineering can easily be in the $200k+ range It’s considered mid-level because the responsibilities are generally critical and not something you want a junior to touch. They can easily take down your production infrastructure, create security vulnerabilities, halt operations, and all sorts of nasty things. It can (and often does) involve system design and other skills that take years to develop",

Practice answering behavioral questions like time management, communication, etc. Also practice programming puzzles because that’s generally apart of most technical interviews. If you get confident with these things, you’re massively increasing your chances.

Most positions do not care if you have a Master's, but you maybe you will learn something that will help you pass the interview?Another thing to think about is that the job market may get better, and then worse, and then better again, and then... etc. You don't know if the job market is going to be any better by the time you are done.Edit: I don't know about switching career paths however. You got a B.S. degree in computer science, and the job market is trash in general right now. I don't think switching career paths will help much right now, but at least you will be able to pay off student debt if you are one of the lucky bastards who can land even a fast food job right now without having internal connections.Edit2: Another option is to leverage your degree to find roles outside of software engineering/development (even though IT in general right now is also fucked unless you know people).TLDR: The job market is fucked.

I would say your undergrad degree is funky, idk what that even is, but companies want CS / eecs / or software engineering degrees (a newer degree). However you're getting interviews so I guess they don't care that much about the specific degree. Your issue is interviewing. Have you asked for feedback from every rejection? You don't have to be a good coder to get a decent job, you have to be a good interviewer though. Leetcode til your hands and brain hurt. Actually do and learn the blind 75. Use Blind as a resource, you can find posts about interviews at specific companies and tips on what they're looking for in interviews. Leetcode also has tagged questions that are similar to what you'll be asked in company interviews. Read grokking system design. As a new grad the focus will be on coding and some minor system design. If you know system design super well that will really make you stand out. Read tips on behavioral interview questions. Learn from recruiter feedback from failed interviews.Do practice interviews. It's especially useful for new grads. If you have friends in the industry ask them do mock interview you. There's also pay mock interview services -- never done that personally but ymmv. Research the company before you interview, have good questions about the technical aspects of the company-- read their engineering blogs and core values. Be excited about the company and job when interviewing.Don't lie in your resume about tech skills -- a good interviewer is going to discover it and rail you. Don't be afraid to say you don't know during an interview. If they ask a question and have no idea, tell them you're not 100% on it but \"this is how I would approach \" solving the problem. Think aloud, they want to see your thought process about how you approach the problem.Target swe jobs at non-tech companies (like banks, healthcare) -- the interviews tech to be easier. Good luck! The first job is always the hardest to get.",

It even made a suggestion for an improvement that I probably wouldn't have bothered to look at. That would have taken me half a day at least. Then I had it create tests for the new functionality and it did 95% of what I had to do. It also helped me update the user documentation, which is something I always dreaded.In the end, I did two days worth of work in about 4 hours. Sometimes I have a task that involves doing mundane stuff like create a function that displays the members of an enum as text. That's mindless work that I'm happy to offload to \"AI\".Here's where it sucks and you need to be very careful: Asking it to write code from scratch to perform anything complex. In most cases, the code will be nearly useless or it may sort of work but will have taken an awfully sub-optimal way to do it. That, you really need to do yourself. For example, I asked it to help me write an optimal bytecode VM. It wrote something that kinda worked, but was obviously awful in terms of performance. I already had one I wrote myself, but there was nothing I could do to make the model come anywhere close to that.",

Especially if you have been at your company a while. And if you trust your manager, you should tell them that you are going to. Here is how you can frame it: \"I have been pushing myself hard and accepting everything that's been thrown my way, and I've been trying to do things as quickly as possible. I think I need to stop doing that, and instead be honest about how much time and availability I have, otherwise I'm risking getting burned out.\"I have literally been told by my managers (as in, multiple have said this independently over time) that it's okay to go slower, and in fact, sometimes it's preferable. The only thing it's not okay to do is not communicate.So for example, if you get a Slack ping that's like \"hey, I'm seeing error X in app Y, can you please take a look?\", instead of saying \"I'm on it!\" and then frantically trying to chase down error X, say, \"sure thing, I can look in [a little bit/30 minutes/this afternoon/tomorrow/when I'm back from lunch]\". If that isn't good enough, the person asking is going to explain why. You can also literally just say \"sure thing, when do you need info by?\"The same is true about projects. If you are not particularly interested in a project, it is okay to step back and listen and only speak up when you have something important to say. As long as you are aware of what's going on, learning when your input is needed and when to let others speak is a valuable skill. (Personally, I still struggle with it.) People will notice if you are obviously disengaged, ignorant about what's being discussed, or making them repeat themselves. They won't think to themselves after a meeting, \"Boy, YonghaeCho sure was quiet,\" and if they do, it's only for a fleeting moment - and if you spoke once or twice because *you needed to*, they won't think that at all.Overall: It's not just okay to slow down, it's good to slow down. You will feel better and be better at your job in the long run.",

All you need is to get your foot in the door.The other approach would be to pursue grad school. A lot of companies seem to consider that equivalent to an internship and some experience.It’ll be tough and I don’t know that you’ll have any success in this job market with the current economic instability.

That probably doesn't help you right now at the moment you need a job, but medium/long term, I would definitely look at lateral moves to other functions. I think being early in your career actually helps you here because you'll be on the junior side for whatever you do. Do some dev work in your spare time if that interests you at all. Actually, even if it doesn't interest you, it's probably a good idea.There are two kinds of SDET jobs I see these days:One, what we used to call \"white box\" - someone who has dev-level skills and has written source code or close to it. These people can stand up a test framework from scratch and pipeline infrastructure for tests to run and report. These have a little more staying power and tend to have the opportunity to become other kinds of software engineering roles - devs, devops, release eng, etc. - when the business outgrows the need for dedicated QA.Two, jobs that are basically QA and mostly manual testing, but for companies that know they need to step up their testing game and need a stopgap while they either scale up their automated CI/CD efforts or offshore manual efforts. You can tell by the way I've described it that I don't think these roles have a bright future, but you might get to hang on for a while at a company that's struggling through that process.Observability, monitoring, and deployment tools have come a long way in reducing risk in software delivery since I started my career. Issues can be seen early and fixed quickly. Unit tests are fast and cover a lot of ground. There's still some use for end to end testing, but I see a drastically reduced need to have a specialized function for it that introduces additional process and the overhead of handing work off to different people along the way.",

You can either keep developing your skills as a mobile dev and be the expert that jobs will go to in this sector and keep looking, or broaden your skillset to have a greater variety of job opportunities.It seems that the unemployment rate among cybersecurity professionals is extremely low. If all you care about is job stability, it would probably be a good choice.",

There's less roles compared to backend generalists but recruiter friends have said skilled native Android engineers are amongst the harder people to findOf course, the market is tough right now, so your skillset might not even be the problem in the first placeI would probably not frame your resume in terms of react native when applying to Android roles, and would not frame it in terms of Android if you're applying to full stack / backend generalist roles. edit: And with regards to concern for the future: As a mobile engineer, I'd say you're likely better off doing native Android than React Native. React Native competes with other frameworks (flutter, mobile web) for a second-class mobile experience, whereas anybody who wants to build a premier mobile product will be doing so in native Android",

The one and only thing you should use them for is to help you formulate questions to ask during the reverse interview process, and so you know what you keep an eye out for. Then based on the reverse interview you need to form *your own* opinion on if the company sounds like it has any of those negative traits you read about.The obvious reason why you shouldn't take those reviews as truth is they're often by disgruntled employees, or employees pressured into leaving good reviews by HR while they're working there. Neither end of that spectrum is reliable. Rarely does a content employee just think unprompted to themselves \"You know what would be fun? Let's go write a fair, unbiased review about my very average employer!\"But beyond that, companies change over time. A review that was accurate even last month, might not be accurate today. All it takes is a single change in management, and a team's culture can shift literally overnight. So just because someone said they worked long hours, doesn't mean people are still working long hours. The reverse is also true, just because someone said the WLB is great, doesn't mean it's still great.Teams within companies also vary drastically. Even at small companies. I worked for a startup once that had \\~30 engineers, spread across a few teams. The team I worked on was super laid back, modern stack, essentially no red tape so we moved very quickly, etc. Even pre-pandemic, we'd only come into the office once or twice a week, and nobody was watching us so sometimes we'd just WFH all 5 days and it wasn't a big deal because we got results. But another team was the polar opposite of us. Their stack was older, they had a *ton* of red tape, they moved very slowly, produced very little, and they were straight up told by the CTO that they need to be in the office strictly 3 days a week because they needed to get their shit together.So if you read a bad review about Team A, it doesn't mean Team B will share those traits. You need to talk to *your* hiring manager about *your* future-team to figure out what that team is like.The startup I mentioned earlier had a fair amount of negative reviews on Glassdoor talking about nepotism, and it being a boys club, and that if you're not buddy buddy with the CEO you'll never have any career growth. When I interviewed with my hiring manager and the CTO I didn't get those vibes at all. The culture seemed amazing, which is why I decided to ignore those reviews and join them. Lo and behold, the culture was great. I was absolutely *not* buddy buddy with the CEO, or anyone for that matter, and my career skyrocketed at that place. I've gotten the biggest raises I've ever seen there. It was a great place to work. The person complaining about nepotism probably just sucked at their job and got fired, and decided it'd be an easier pill to swallow to blame nepotism instead of themselves. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯",

And being bored at work could easily make you feel kinda burned out, or lethargic, or like the spark is gone.I resonate with this a lot, because 3 years is about the point where I start getting bored on a team. The easiest way to cure this is to have a candid conversation with your manager, and see if they can either find you some different work, or transfer you onto a different team.Doing that usually reignites the spark for me. The longest I've lasted at one company is a little over 5 years, and the main reason I lasted that long was I switched teams after 3 years. Switching teams gave me a ton of new stuff to learn, it was in an entirely different tech stack, I had to learn all the business knowledge from scratch. It's fun, everything's new again. It's shoving you back into the \"honeymoon stage\".My new grad company was actually great with this. They *encouraged* internal moves at the 2 year mark for all employees. For me specifically it just sorta happened naturally, I worked on 3 different teams across 3.5 years. The only reason I left them was because I wanted to live on the east coast, otherwise I could've stayed there for life. And some of my friends have, I think there's 5 or so people from my new grad cohort that are still at that company, 12 years later.So that's what I'd recommend. See if you can transfer internally, or get a completely new type of work. If you can't, start looking for a new job .See if that fixes things for you. If it doesn't, then maybe you're right, this industry just isn't a good fit for you... but the fact you found your job rewarding *at first* makes me think you're just bored rather than being burnt out of the entire industry.",

I certainly used to like coding, and I think I would again were I not doing it so much already. And I would say I like my job, the company and people are cool. I think my only concrete complaint is that I wish I had literally anything else to do. They've trimmed so much fat in an attempt to avoid busy work or agile complaints that aside from maybe 2 hours of meetings a week my only responsibility is to work through my github issues and review other's work, both of which I feel like are relatively involved tasks. And I know most people can't/don't program for a full 40 hours but then I feel bad when I am just then doing nothing. It's a tension.",

As always with the US, the social services are lacking compared to Europe, though if you get a high paying job with great benefits, that difference is mostly mitigated2. Education in the Boston area is excellent, rivaling the Nordic countries3. Public transit is acceptable but easily the worst out of the 3 cities you’re considering, bike infrastructure kind of sucks, but the city itself is supremely walkable4. Boston is not a late night city, restaurants and bars often close quite early compared to other similar cities5. Most of the neighborhoods in Boston feel meaningfully distinct from one another, it’s something I love about the city but you should definitely shop around for a neighborhood you like before deciding where to live6. Food is good, not great for a city of its size - beer scene is arguably the best in the country though7. Quick access to New York via Amtrak is awesome8. As you noted, Boston is probably the safest major American city and rivals many European cities9. No shade, and I’m obviously biased, but I really prefer New Englanders to other Americans and Northern Europeans. I feel New Englanders are the perfect mix of being pretty friendly and kind without being obnoxious or fake about it10. Speaking of which, New England itself is awesome. Great vacation or long weekend opportunities all over the place for all seasons11. Boston is easily the coldest and hottest/most humid of the cities you’re considering, but it also gets the most sunlight. I prefer Boston winters to Berlin winters even though Berlin doesn’t get as cold12. The rental and buying market in Boston sucks, but I’m not sure it’s better in the other cities you’re considering13. Boston is absolutely the most “European-feeling” of the major American cities, but it’s still definitely an American city at its core.",

They would probably not integrate properly in swiss society with parents that barely speak swiss german.In Zurich normal German is enough and actually there's tons of expats who get by with English only, as everyone speaks it.> The problem in London is the tax system, as between 100k and 125k we are effectively taxed at ~61% and after 125k we are taxed at 45%.On 150k GBP you get taxed overall 33%, on 250k 36%, so I would not consider that as a big -> However, healthcare is private and I assume it would be expensive for an entire family.Similarly healthcare in UK w/ NHS isn't the best so you'd probably have a private policy.

If you can negotiate for higher pay from the startup that changes things, but I would probably lean towards Coinbase.",

Ain't no way you're seriously negotiating 50% more without expecting them to just rescind. And the reasonable-ness is relative to the *offer*, not the market. Even if they offer you 50% below market, asking for 50% more is not going to fly.That said, even though the risk of the offer being rescinded over reasonable negotiation is very low, it's still non-zero. There is still always a chance of the company going beyond playing hardball, and just fully rescinding. It happens. Not often, but it absolutely happens.So the question becomes, are you willing to take that non-zero (but close to zero) risk to get some more money? If so, negotiate. If not, don't.

You may be somewhere in between and that's totally fine.

        "body": "They shouldhabe salary bands—if they’re smart.As for the amount, it depends. Some companies apply a flat percentage for promotions; companies I’ve worked at, for example, used a flat 10%.Other companies have set salary ranges and will use comp ratios to determine the increase. They also consider your current compensation. Generally, managers and the comp/HR team aim to bring employees close to a 1.0 comp ratio. For high performers, they may go higher. However, some managers or comp/HR folks might think that bringing someone straight to a 1.0 is too large of a bump, so they might offer a lower comp ratio instead. They may also feel a candidate needs ramp-up time or isn’t fully qualified, which can also justify a lower comp ratio—though there’s usually a floor, such as 0.9.Comp ratio, short for comparative ratio, is a measure used in compensation management to compare an employee’s current salary to the midpoint of a given salary range for their position. It’s calculated by dividing the employee’s salary by the midpoint of the range and is usually expressed as a percentage. A comp ratio of 100% means the employee is paid exactly at the market or target rate. Below 100% may indicate they’re underpaid relative to the range, while above 100% suggests they’re paid more than the midpoint—possibly due to experience, tenure, or performance. It’s a useful tool for ensuring pay equity and making informed salary decisions.",

You can also learn most popular languages pretty easily if you understand C# well. Most software engineers change languages as frequently as they change jobs.Learning some JS, Ruby, or Python might help, as those are three extremely common languages on the backend.If you specifically want to build custom tools used internally (not client-facing), there are a ton of those jobs. These days web tools are probably more common than desktop programs, but in some industries the latter is probably still common. It might be hard to seek out “internal tools” jobs, because some of those roles involve building things for the core client-facing product as well. But basically every company with software engineers uses some of their time to build internal tools.",

Knowing how parts of a system work together is something you’ve already done, you just have to abstract that to other types of systems. 2. What type of system design question you’ll be asked will vary greatly on the scale of the company, the seniority of role, and the type of roll. You should not expect load balancing questions if you’re doing a front end engineering system design interview. If you’re doing backend at an established company, they probably won’t be asking about load balancing (because they’ve already solved that), but will probably ask about problems you’ll be expected to solve. 3. Unless you’re doing system design or architecture or tooling, they probably will just want to know that you can think in terms of systems. The specific database or asynchronous job or whatever other part won’t matter so long as you know how they interact or at a higher level what pieces are interacting. They care most that you’re able to grasp the whole system rather than that you remember the names of specific tools to build the system (unless they specifically list technology they use, then you should totally know about those technologies at a conversational level).4. ChatGPT is a great tool to prep for interviews. You can prompt it to create a series of questions for you for the seniority level and type of roll and company and interview type (systems design) you’re interviewing for. If you have the job description/company, that can help it be more specific. You can ask it to give you feedback or to help you fill in gaps in your understanding.",

There were live lectures each week and then breakout sessions each week where you work with small groups to build the skills. It’s a lot more engaging and fun than trying to learn it alone.At the end you get a certificate, but obviously those don’t really hold much weight with employers. The main benefit is the skills you learn (and I assume that in Web 101, you’ll build some pretty cool projects).And all of their courses are 100% free, so, yes I’d absolutely recommend it.",

        "body": "MBA is a pretty fine entry point into the business side of things in which an effective product manager will dabble heavily. An MBA by itself is very unlikely to secure you a job as a product manager. Experience in the markets the business is targeting (healthcare, additive manufacturing, law, etc), the model by which the business operates (SaaS, PaaS, b2b, b2c, etc), and domain expertise over the product/market (peripherals, infrastructure, HRIS/ERP/EHR/etc), is king.> I was considering MBA but then I came across LinkedIn profiles of people who shifted to Prod roles of different companies without an MBA.Those people probably have heaps of experience in one or all of the areas I described above.To be clear, \"I worked for a SaaS vendor\" does not automatically mean you understand the full lifecycle of sales, support, adoption, and development of a SaaS product. Cranking out Jira issues is not the same as sitting in contract negotiations with a big client, producing estimates/SOWs, planning/executing a multi-month/year implementation across multiple functional groups (sales, support/training, development, etc), planning a launch to expand/capture a market segment, dealing with a pissed off customer because milestones are slipping, etc.My experience prior to moving into product management in my current org was in b2b sales/contracting of IaaS and managed services as an owner/operator. That's roughly the same model and domain I work in currently. I had practically no prior experience in my org's specific market segment but picked that knowledge up over ~2 years as a software engineer and ~3 as an engineering manager at my current org.Product management as a functional role should be pretty consistent among your F-100s and FAANGs. But it's going to vary wildly between practically any other company. Product management as a discipline is very much a YMMV thing.> Can someone guide? Are there any certifications or courses that companies consider in place of an MBA.[Pragmatic](https://www.pragmaticinstitute.com/), [PMI](https://www.pmi.org/), and [IIBA](https://www.iiba.org/) all have certification programs which bear some weight.
