It also throws the poor clueless recruiters off. I had the following conversation recently:-So, how many years of experience you have with DataDog? -(Sir, this is a Wendy's) ... it's literally an observability tool? Why do I need years of experience? I trialed it for my last job along with others, but we decided to go with Grafana.-So how many years? -You don't need *years* of experience with an observability tool, you can set it up in a day and then it's rather intuitive. -So you don't have experience? -I've set it up and used it. -So should I put here one month of experience? -Suit yourself.",

I had experience on paper although over time I never really improved. It goes without saying this was well before the advent of AI and also chemistry is a field where all of the answers aren't on Google.One of the reasons I wasn't improving was because I didn't like the field I was in. I didn't have passion to improve and felt like I was entitled to more than I actually deserved just because I had X years of experience on paper. In the meanwhile, people who were much younger and less experienced came in and were smashing it purely because they had drive, passion, and a desire to improve.Lost my job during the 'rona pando, attended enough interviews for a chemistry job and didn't get any offers even though I felt the interviews went well.I thought I was a great chemist who was underappreciated. In reality, I was discovering in real time that I was a subpar, disgruntled chemist at best. Thought I was faking my way through the interviews, getting all of the technical questions right, but in hindsight, none of it mattered because even though I knew all of the answers, there's no point hiring somebody who doesn't want to be there which is the energy I gave off subconsciously.Offering this as an alternative perspective because sometimes the answer isn't necessarily trying harder.Paraphrasing although a famous MMA coach once said that there are a lot parallels between life and your style of fighting. Loads of people in the martial arts community start trying to emulate their favourite fighters without considering that style might be unsuitable for their physiology, essentially training on \"hard mode\" by doing something they aren't designed to do instead of putting energy into discovering their own style. Life is similar - people try and obtain success or financial freedom by copying others and wonder why they have to work so hard to achieve so little compared to the person they're trying to emulate, essentially being on hard mode by their own design.We are all designed to do something well and it is up to us to find what that is.>How did you push through? Or did you change direction?I have always loved computers and technology. I changed careers to DE. Much happier now.",

For Python I picked up [Fluent Python](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1492056359/) and that helped me get a deeper understanding of the language beyond just copying code or relying on AI. I think there's just still so much value in the textbook format for programming languages because they're written by experts and the authors spend hundreds or thousands of hours writing them, they put in much more thought into how they want to create a learning experience, more so than the alternatives at least.",

AI alone will need exponentially higher data integrity levels to operate off of than what's offered today. I imagine most of the point and click data engineering tools will go out of business as data engineering continues deeper into specialized built data systems everywhere.I'm not sure which skills will change, I just see DE getting harder and requiring more rigid systems like software systems.",

Especially when you work with things that are closer to ML, that have testable behaviours that only manifest when working on a huge dataset with specific patterns. This is not an intractable problem, though. You still can factor your code correctly and cover with unit tests as much as you can, and write queries for ongoing data quality monitoring (a good data analyst will be a very important ally in this activity). For more complex stuff, talk to your platform/infra/governance people about having a \"sandbox\" environment - prod data but all the sensitive parts masked. Nobody understands the complexity? That sounds like your org needs more \"less technical\" people like analysts, not less. And yes, you as a DE need to be in touch with them, because they will be able to tell you what to expect of your data.People questioning numbers when they don't match vibes? Honestly that sounds like something a data product manager/owner has to tackle. As an engineer, all you can do is deliver data quality assurance, and point to that. After this it's with the PM/PO to sell the value of the team's work.Version control issues? Yes, that happens when an org has a lot of DAs/DSs with more science/business background. I think the will to do git appears after one or two incidents when someone does a breaking change that nobody had a chance to review, or accidentally deletes some script on some server somewhere. If your data team is subsidary to technical leaders in the org chart, I think they're usually sympathetic to the idea, and you can go through them to push git adoption. You can also smooth things along by writing a \"git for dummies\" document for your DS/DA. No need to deep dive into advanced features, just teaching them commit/push/pull and merge requests should be enough. Do make sure your main is protected in all your repos, though.Stuff outside of your control, but you have to fix it? That exists, yes, but I don't think that's unique to DE.

You don’t want to make sure your 300 billions records are unique every time you add a new row.But the concept of unique identifier should be introduced into almost all tables. That unique identifier is normally a surrogate key. Surrogate key are unique identifier derives from other fields. For example a md5 hash of the concatenation of 4 columns. This give you a unique identifier.What’s great about surrogate keys is that they are not random. You get consistency in any systems, if you migrate to another platform your surrogate keys are still valid and that’s very powerful. Also you can reproduce the same results over and over again, which is not possible if you use a UUID generated by another system for example.Then depending on the tool you use you can validate the uniqueness of the fields yourself. There’s some reason you might want to do this yourself and not the system like you would have in a normal db and is that because you can have multiple time the same records or a different version of what you consider the same records.Since the DW is for analytics you might want to analyze those different records which are not unique in your raw layer but could be in your marts.So it’s a powerful thing to let you control de uniqueness of the fields yourself.Obviously if you don’t manage it you’ll probably end up with a lot of duplicates. But since the DW store all your data it’s better to avoid having the constraint on inserts and give the users more flexibility. Because he might need all version for what he is trying to achieve.TLDR; yep a surrogate key should be something you have in all tables (when possible)",

You could do that with a surrogate key, merge, or deduplicate on read, but I don't see how an auto-incrementing PK would help you here.

Nowadays, storage is so cheap it's practically free so it's compute that we must optimize for. Having to do dozens of `join`s to gain context on every record certainly doesn't support that. Usually, I practice some form of what you might call \"Star Schema Light\" in the silver layer where I create tables around business entities. So all the 'user' dimensions would be in one table (and it would probably have a companion SCD table), all the 'session' dimensions in another etc. Then these can be `join`d and de-normalized in gold to expose to BI tools as needed while analysts can still have some flexibility by using the silver tables. Having said all that, be careful. Myself and two colleagues were recently fired for suggesting this very thing and pointing out we shouldn't administer Snowflake like one would on-prem Oracle.",

You could add a date / calendar dimension to this fact and this would allow you to see how many users one tag have, which users have which tags...

We then implemented Keebo and saw another 20% savings, which I’m pretty sure most of it was them dynamically adjusting the suspend time on the warehouses. Most of that big saving though was we were using a warehouse that was way to big, and by sizing it down our refresh times are slight worse but it’s worth the cost improvement.",

From a Hudi angle, it is not just an open table format though. It is an end-to-end *lakehouse platform*, that integrates \"storage engine\" capabilities (much like a DBMS) with a table format (the metadata) on top of open file formats such as Apache Parquet.Hudi offers built-in services for ingestion (like Hudi Streamer), table management (clustering, compaction, cleaning, rollback), and catalog syncing. These services are deeply integrated and natively supported, allowing for fine-grained control over write-side performance (with the ability to run asynchronously/inline), recovery, and data quality. Work is also underway to add a multi-tenant caching layer that bridges fast ingestion with low-latency querying across engines. With just open table format (vs lakehouse platform), you outsource these services/capabilities to the compute/catalog layer. These literatures should shed some more light: \\- [https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/open-table-formats-and-the-open-data-lakehouse-in-perspective](https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/open-table-formats-and-the-open-data-lakehouse-in-perspective)\\- [https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/apache-hudi-vs-delta-lake-vs-apache-iceberg-lakehouse-feature-comparison](https://www.onehouse.ai/blog/apache-hudi-vs-delta-lake-vs-apache-iceberg-lakehouse-feature-comparison)\\- [https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2025/03/05/hudi-21-unique-differentiators/](https://hudi.apache.org/blog/2025/03/05/hudi-21-unique-differentiators/)",

Again I think folks don't use them properly and if they did they might like them better, but I guess it's more syntax than a simple while loop.Hot take, I don't like single quotes for both strings and to identify an instance, database, schema, object, or columns and much prefer the square brackets to differentiate one from the other.Despite best efforts to NOT be case-specific, I think there are places in SSRS or SSIS that still are (case specific). They also do weird things with instance names, like ServerName\\Instance becomes ServerName$Instance because it can't handle the slash character.SSRS went back and forth about how to pass \"All\" as a parameter between '08 and R2.I kinda fell in love with Snowflake and not having to care about strongly typing string lengths (and not having to care about SSIS crying for making everything varchar(max)).NULL and math or concatenate has surprising behavior.",

When you do, ask about the sales process, the role of vendor partnerships (this can almost singlehandedly determine your technical focus!), how they go about scoping, how satisfied clients generally seem, etc. If you get engineers to answer those questions, that will shed a lot of light on the kind of environment you might be stepping into (which is tightly linked to the kinds of clients your sales and marketing people are able to reach).(Edited to add: If those discussions make it sound like that firm is bent on pitching solely AI everything these days...huge red flag. Obviously I'm speaking from my own biases here, but IMHO it's a recipe for perpetual scope change at best, and completely unrealistic expectations at worst. Too many un-serious people selling to other un-serious people who are spending still other un-serious people's money for no clear reason. Naturally, YMMV.)By way of background, my data career has been solely in consulting. It's been about 10 years at a couple of relatively small firms (in the 100–200-person range) so I don't know what things are like at much larger ones. I have worked in-house before but in a very a different field. Overall, I'm satisfied with my career path, but it has its drawbacks, especially if technical learning is your *top* priority.There have been long periods where my technical skills stagnated. Once I've reached a certain degree of experience with our bread-and-butter projects, most of the work is on the business logic and requirements side, not the technical side, since I've probably done it a dozen times before.Obviously I'm always keeping up with developments from vendors we typically use (and what's new from others to some extent)...but it's not like I'm frequently taking on entirely new kinds of projects. That's not a bad thing in my book! All those less- or non-technical skills are extremely important. What's more, even if selling the same solution repeatedly isn't the most technically exciting, it's one way to keep increasing your effective hourly rate.Granted, my favorite clients have been smaller ones (like a few hundred staff members or less) who need all kinds of random data things solved. Sometimes that does require unfamiliar technologies, which are often equal parts fun and frustrating at the same time. But those more open-ended projects, where I'm sort of the \"data guy\" on call, are inherently less specialized, and often less lucrative as a result.",

A few years ago, these users would have made the transition from Excel to Alteryx/KNIME paying for the server and consultants with a smile on their face.* They haven't been acquired by industry giants. At the time of the recent acquisition of Alteryx, it was even rumored that Salesforce or Oracle might acquire it.

It's great for stuff like building a front end app where there are tons of examples on Github, but not so much build the revenue fact table for XYZ inc. with all their proprietary business logic and terminology. There's probably some agentic approach that could be developed to at least validate your schemas and stuff, but in the end it's probably not a huge timesaver as you will still need to define all the rules to feed to the AI, which is going back to the source to target diagram days.",

That way, once everything is planned out and you're ready to start, you can just tell the AI basically: \"follow this planning doc, and after you complete each step, update the doc and begin the next step\", and then you can just keep hitting the OK button until it's finished building everything.",

(Yes we do see cheating in this kind of coding test, basically, the hundsband help the wife). But for hiring a senoir or even intermediate dev, this is ridiculous. All employed seniors have tons of work to do, no one will spend more than 4 hours on this kind of test, especially, there will be hours of interveiw coming up potentially. Also we will be careful to not helping the hiring company solving their problem. Thus it is more difficult for us to finish an assignment (I assume you will give serious difficult take home assignment in this scenario) without helping the hiring company to solve their problem. I would say, if you are a junior dev, take it, learn the new knowledge, if you are a intermediate to senior dev, just pass by, don't spend time on it.

        "body": "Alright, this post can make good use of additional clarity.- Is primary_hash just a fancy way to say ID?- I hope you understand the implication of hashing, because in this context it is a trap, and you’re jumping right into it. First, order sensitivity: {a:1, b:2} and {b:2, a:1} can spit out different hashes depending on your algorithm—hope you’re normalizing inputs. Second, collisions: no hash is truly unique, so your primary_hash or payload_hash could, in theory, screw you over with duplicates. Third, compute cost: hashing big payloads (especially JSON blobs) chews up CPU. For large datasets, you’re burning cycles when a simpler key or checksum could do the job. Also, good luck debugging when someone tweaks the algorithm. Do stick to lightweight identifiers or deterministic keys unless you’re solving world hunger.- Your source system just yeets full or incremental loads at random? You're really telling us is just a coin flip? Scour their docs for a pattern—there’s got to be one. If it’s truly a coin flip, build a check (like record count or metadata flags) to detect load type. Then branch your logic: full load = overwrite or merge, incremental = append or upsert. A simple if-statement saves you from nuking 95% of your data.- Why the urge to slap a boolean is_current on everything? Your UPSERT logic already yells “this row’s alive!\". Regarding your last_loaded_ts: you just called it business_ts few words before!- Detecting deletions always come down to one of two. Check if the source emits delete events (docs, again). If not, periodically poll for IDs and just IDs. Another news: although a row is being deleted from the source system, it's not mandatory you have to delete it as well: just flag it (aka soft deletion). Overall, if you can ingest incrementally and poll for just IDs, you are saving money and drastically simplify the process.- Data retention: S3 (or Fabric’s storage) is dirt cheap for raw data and time travel queries (i.e., SELECT * FROM table VERSION AS OF '2025-01-01') have been invented in the 90s. If storage costs creep up, archive old partitions to cheaper tiers like S3 Glacier. Keep Silver/Gold lean for business logic and aggregates—don’t make them history dumps. Set a retention policy (e.g., 1 year hot, archive the rest) to balance auditability and your wallet.",

The delete logic with incremental loads is a nightmare we see all the time.**For the incremental vs full load problem:** Your boolean flag approach is on the right track. What works for us is having a `load_type` field (FULL/INCREMENTAL) alongside `is_current` and `last_seen_ts`. For incremental loads, we only update records that actually appear in the batch - never delete based on absence.The trick is tracking what constitutes a \"complete picture\" at the source level. We usually maintain a separate metadata table that tracks when each source last did a full refresh, so we know our baseline.**Storage and history management:** Bronze is the wrong place for long term history imo. We keep maybe 30-90 days in Bronze for reprocessing, then archive to cheaper storage. The real historical tracking happens in Silver where you can be more selective about what actually needs versioning.For cost control, consider:* Partition by load date so you can easily drop old data* Use Delta's time travel for short term history, separate archive for long term* Not everything needs full history - focus on business critical entities**Quick pattern that works:*** Bronze: Current state + recent changes (30-90 days)* Silver: SCD Type 2 for entities that need history* Archive layer: Compressed parquet in cold storage for compliancea reference of 3 tier architecture: Bronze, Silver, Gold layers: [https://cdn-cednl.nitrocdn.com/ZIEpBLjPiSWpOcIdsSTlIdzcQJzKTmWw/assets/images/optimized/rev-21cfb01/www.datatobiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Azure-Medallion-Architecture.png](https://cdn-cednl.nitrocdn.com/ZIEpBLjPiSWpOcIdsSTlIdzcQJzKTmWw/assets/images/optimized/rev-21cfb01/www.datatobiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Azure-Medallion-Architecture.png)What kind of data volumes are you dealing with?

Are you going to write a new pipeline to do that, or edit the existing one and re-run on the same input data?Another example I didn't see mentioned is data size. Your pipeline might be written such that it extracts a delta of changes in the input db table and writes them to the output. This is because just copying the whole table every day is too expensive, and the changes are expected to be small, so could instead use a smaller machine. Now what do you do if the processing logic changes?Of course there are solutions to write a pipeline such that it handles both entire data and deltas, but those solutions always depend on the specifics of the input.

To keep the momentum going, I'll spend XYZ time working with ABC people (if warranted) scope out the requirements to make this happen.\"The next stage is \"Requirements\" where you highlight the positives of their idea, but you also surface the potential risks that are inevitably overlooked initially. More important here when uncovering risks is getting a diverse set of perspectives as it just makes a stronger argument to have you, SWE, and DevOps bring forth risks and expected extended timelines to handle them.Once you have these well researched requirements, you then \"Iterate\" by going back to that initial champion who thought it's \"easy.\" You say something along the lines of \"I walked through the idea from a data perspective, as well as brought in XYZ teams. There is definitely excitement, but we uncovered a couple areas that I would love your feedback on in respect to tradeoffs.\" Here's the key, YOU DON'T DIRECTLY TELL THE CHAMPION WHAT TO DO (all caps because it's that important). Instead you provide them with a series of three paths forward with various tradeoffs for speed, robustness, and technical debt. You then let the champion decide AND OWN THE DECISION.Congrats, you have now turned into a partner for this champion who is not only enabling their idea, but also looking out for them to make sure mitigate any risks!The next steps are \"Build\" and \"Evangelize\" but I won't go into those as they are outside the scope of your original question.",

Based on what I've understood so far, this is definitely at least a few weeks of work for my team, because we'll first need to crank the wotsit then analyse the doohickey, before we can build the XYZ itself.If applicable, you also need to make the distinction clear between how long _once the project starts_, and the lead time _before you can start the project_. How you do that depends how projects/work items are prioritised at your place, but make sure to set expectations that the work isn't going to start right away, unless of course it can. **If you do this well, after enough repetitions, the \"easy\" people will learn more about how things work and probably won't say it any more.**### footnote(1) Honest doesn't mean as low as possible. Include padding for uncertainties, include time needed for adequate testing, documentation, etc. Honesty does include communicating the error bars on the estimate; I like Uncle Bob's approach of providing three estimates, a worst-case, best-case, and likely middle-ground. Honesty also means not being more precise than justified: eg \"a few weeks\" is better than \"3 weeks\" if you don't have enough information to be really sure it's 3 weeks.",

Big tech also uses hard interview questions to weed out not qualified or low skill candidates upfront to move onto good quality ones.The data landscape is evolving so fast and so architecture is getting more complex, they expect DE's to also understand the architecture area to some extent which makes it little harder to prep for interviews up front. Since your have 4.5 yrs under your belt, just prepare mostly for SQL and data modeling areas and if aiming for big tech then DSA which I hate the most.

These run locally on our machines and also in our ci/CD pipeline so that nothing gets merged to main or deployed to production unless these tests pass.This doesn't account for everything that can go wrong. In particular, we don't have a good way to run integration or end-to-end tests locally, but we do deploy to a dev workspace and require that any changes be run successfully there, which covers most of the rest of the possible error surface.Any remaining uncertainty comes from the possibility of upstream data sources shitting the bed, which we can't control, or from the complete unwillingness of data scientists, our immediate downstream consumers, to adopt anything resembling robust development practices, so we spend a lot of time putting out fires that don't arise from our ETL pipelines.",

Some code-heavy DEs might be able to to it, but most of us are using SQL or dbt or something like that. Traditional software testing does not work for us. We have to think differently. That pedantic message aside, we can take the concept of unit tests and apply to data engineering. We need three things. 1. Known input state (What data are we reading)2. Work (Query, task, function, something that transforms data)3. Know expected output stateDbt and SQLMesh do this with their own concept of unit tests. I'm sure other platforms have their own solutions. If you want to roll your own it is fairly simple in theory.... 1. Create known data that shows the characteristics of what you want to test.2. Run the portion of your pipeline that you want to test.3. Compare the output to the expected output. If it matches you are good. This is not that hard in small pipelines, but very difficult to maintain in big pipelines. Imagine a SaaS company with 10 subscription plans and negotiated contracts. New stuff being added every day. 800 data sources. It's really tough to maintain a test suite. This problem has not been solved in the industry and whoever solves it will be very rich. Personally, I think AI has to be part of the solution. I remember speaking with someone who is way smarter than I am talking about SQL proofs to solve this problem.",

This makes it easy to write unit tests where you pass mock inputs into transform functions and compare output to expectation. From there you just get better at breaking down these transform functions to make it easier to write unit tests for. You can also write your runtime data validations as functions in the same way and write unit tests for those to make sure they catch bad data.This separation of transform code and connecting/reading/writing code makes it easier to abstract and consolidate the latter and write integration tests for those.So in your hypothetical “process_data_to_silver.py”, assuming that’s an etl task will likely not need much unit tests of its own. It’s simply importing a dataset processing function, passing it inputs, and then publishing the output. You’ll be confident it’s processing and validating as expected because the function itself is covered.",

Ingestion handler is just single instance that handles logic related to reading/writing and storing references, if other downstream transformers rely on some data in those upstream.

        "body": "Howdy! I’m an Aggie (grad school in stats, not DE) and a Sr. DE working in Dallas. I was actually part of the industry DE group that A&M was talked to when they designed a bunch of the DAEN classes. I was one of five who chipped in on DAEN 323. They wanted folks who had industry DE experience as well as advanced stat training, which is actually a pretty small pool.The DAEN major is… fine. The small group of junior/mid-level CS faculty who pushed it to completion haven’t worked in industry, and they *really* wanted it to be more data science-y, which is why there’s a weird amount of semi-niche statistical topics (I love bayesian methods, but they’re generally a grad-level topic for stats, and they’re not really useful at all for a DE to be familiar with), and mandating that the DE students take the two required ISEN classes is silly. There’s too much statistical/ML methodology (which is awesome if you want to go into ML enablement, I’ve done it and can tell you that it’s a ton of fun) for the average DE, and especially the entry-level DE, and the tradeoff is that there’s not as much cloud education in there as I and most of the others thought there should be. They get you into databases early, which is key, but I’d like there to be more database coursework. Fortunately, you can do those extra DAEN technical electives.That said, you’ve got a few classes in there that rock for developing your practical skills. The DAEN project classes are a high point that have some good projects that would shine on any junior DE’s resume that I’ve reviewed in the last three or four years. I would strongly recommend augmenting those classes with more database coursework than the one required CSE 310 class. Overall, I’d say the program is about as good for getting you into DE as just doing a CS degree, and I’d strongly note the dual caveats that:1. your first job almost certainly will not be in data engineering. This is not an entry-level field, your first job will probably be in data analytics, and you’ll progress into DE like most of us did.2. This is a new program, and they’re still working out the kinks. I think they start their first cohort this semester.Feel free to ask any questions, I’m happy to answer where I can.",

Data engineering is very very rarely an entry level position. The two most common routes are: 1. Experienced software engineer gets experience with backend data systems and becomes a data engineer. 2. An analyst on the business side learns python and SQL to automate workflows, gets good at modeling data, and gets an \"in\" on the DE team when something opens up. My manager tends to hire type one as consultants and contractors that come and go. She hires type 2 as full time employees that stick around. So my advice is to pick a degree that sets you on one of those paths. Maybe it's terrible advice, maybe mediocre, maybe fantastic. I don't know.",

Now I personally was leaning into a DE major because I thought it would help combine data science/statistics with more computer science topics like databases/cloud computing. However, as you mentioned with DE not providing a solid cloud computing foundation, do you think it would be sufficient to add CS cloud computing electives. I have majority of the core curriculum taken away with AP classes which leaves decent spots for me to fill up? Also, you mentioned data engineering not being an entry level role. My original thought was by committing to a data engineering major I would be better suited to building infrastructure/data pipelines, but if that’s not an entry level role where does that leave me in the job market? I thought by having a DE major I wouldn’t necessarily have to compete with CS majors for similar jobs, giving me an edge. I apologize if these questions sound dumb, but I am trying to get the inner workings of exactly how this all fits in. Online sources are quite contradictory/weird and I don’t really have specific people to ask.",

One technical project manager I worked with was pursuing one, but he left before he finished it.The reality is CFA is an extremely difficult certification, each level has a sub 50% pass rate and the only reason you should pursue one is if you want to become a person who professionally is allowed to give investment advice or directly manage a portfolio.The technical problems we solve don’t require that intimate knowledge of investment vehicles and financial planning, so anyone hiring for technical positions would far value technical aptitude over whatever CFA would bring to the table. Even people who worked closer to the business side (product management, business systems analysis) didn’t have CFAs. Some management did, C levels definitely had it, except for technical C-suite who held PhDs instead.Imo spend your time on something else, and working at a place like that is really not as difficult as you expect, but your best path in would be going to a good school, doing well, interviewing well and living nearby. And I really found the work soul draining, you work to make rich people richer and have to wear a tie every day. People there drink heavily after work too.

A lot of folks in data look to deepen their finance knowledge, but the CFA might not be the most direct route if your goal is to stay in data engineering.CFA is a serious time and energy investment. It’s incredibly valuable if you’re aiming to become a portfolio manager or financial analyst who makes investment decisions—but for a data engineer, the overlap is limited. Most technical roles at places like Citi, JPMorgan, or Bain don’t require or expect a CFA. What they *do* value is domain familiarity: understanding how financial data works, how to build pipelines for it, and how to surface insights that support the business.A more practical route might be building out your finance knowledge in parallel with your engineering work. Things like:* Learning how to wrangle financial data (from market feeds, statements, or transactions)* Building dashboards for KPIs like revenue, risk, or portfolio performance* Working with time-series forecasting or valuation modelsThere’s strong demand for data engineers with finance context—it’s just more about hands-on skills than credentials. If you're interested, we’ve got some finance-focused tracks that lean technical: Python for Finance, Financial Modeling in Excel, and Financial Analysis in Power BI. They can give you the right foundation without going all-in on CFA.That said, if you’re considering a career shift toward investment roles or product strategy, the CFA might be worth it—but it’s rarely a game-changer on the engineering side.",

Now that you have that, figure out WHAT they don't have that they need. Every single one of these needs to tie back to a WHY. If it doesn't tie back to one, discard it or update the WHYs and get sign off again. I'm talking reports, dashboards, messaging, etc. Do not start coding yet. This is also where to start to identify if you have the data to achieve these items. Don't limit yourself to the current state of affairs. I cannot emphasize how important it is to tie these back to WHY items. \"Because we've always had them\" is not a reason. Validate existing data products to see if they are sufficient or even needed. This is where you start to clean house on all the crap that data warehouses collect. This stage will also start to get you thinking about the relationships between the types of data. Not a data model, but a bit higher than that in conception.Nothing up to now has been technical but these are by far the most important parts of the projects. It will be very tempting to jump into the weeds, don't do it. Your post already suggests you are starting at the wrong place.3. Now you can start to design the data warehouse. I would start with the data model. Figure out what type of model you need. Don't take what is already there unless it can be heavily justified. An operational data store is not the same as a data warehouse. You don't get too many opportunities to do this in any one company. Throw away all of those marketing terms. They won't help you. A traditional three tier DW has never steered me wrong. Activities, like data cleansing and data standardization, tend to happen as you move the data from one tier to the next. Stage is used for landing data. I tend to make my core in 3NF and any data products (stars, materialized views, etc.) in the semantic layer. You do not need to have everything built out before you start using it but do have as much as possible planned out and written down. Generate regular deliverables to the business and be able to show how they address the business needs you identified in step one. If they can't be tied back, ask yourself why you are building them. This is a VERY high description of how you refactor or initially design a data warehouse. It may seem overwhelming but just break it down into chunks and always be thinking about the future. These things stay around a long time.",

        "body": "As someone who had to do this for the first time about 6 months ago:- if your data volumes are small and you already have postgres set up as a warehouse, stick with it for now, it's probably fine- don't worry about an orchestrator yet if your views are working ok. Get your view definitions under version control on GitHub then use GitHub actions to push them to postgres when you make updates. If performance starts to become an issue, then look into an orchestrator as you might need to start materialising these into actual tables.- make sure your view definitions are under version control. Look into dbt to make this easier to manage.- on data viz, sure you can use tableau but I personally have found it a bit clunky when I've used it in the past and it can get very expensive. Recently started using Sigma computing - less pretty dashboards but I think way easier to use. But honestly if you use one of the usual suspects (Tableau, Power BI etc) management can't really blame you. I don't really know anything about Kibana but if that's working for you why reinvent?- on natural language querying - your job on this is to NOT implement anything and find a diplomatic way of telling management it's a bad idea. If they insist you try it, look at setting up AI agents where you can constrain their behavior to running queries you predefine, and prompt it to say 'i don't know' if non technical users stray out of those guardrails. I know the Google genai and openai APIs both have functionality to do this kind of workflow.Good luck",

If you are on AWS for instance, you need to build a Powerbi gateway to talk to Azure where the dashboards and data will sit, so you are paying probably for a scaling cluster depending on your projected usage. Then you need to carefully think through your BI architecture because you are paying to move data off AWS to Azure, so you want to minimize that as much as possible. If you do it by caching on the Azure side for performance, then it requires you to move all the potential data that people could use across to make it available. You could also use direct query, where it queries every time someone refreshes. You only pay for the same query compute once a day because Snowflake caches the results, but you still move the data to Azure every time. So it has an impact on your gold data architecture, how you develop your data products and the extent to which you have decentralized access to a variety of data. Personally after using Powerbi for about a year after migrating off another platform, I would pick a different one that plays nice with your cloud and is more accessible to the business at large.",

Incremental Airbyte syncs plus dbt’s stateful models keep data volumes down; full reloads should be the rare exception. Kestra can kick off a Snowflake task that flips the warehouse to Medium only for heavy transforms, then shrinks it back. Use resource monitors with hard fail at 80% of monthly budget and track spend with the Snowflake usage view piped back into PowerBI. For SharePoint pulls, land the files in cheap object storage first and stage into Snowflake external tables to avoid compute on every file read. After trying Fivetran and Matillion for finance data, DualEntry handled multi-entity consolidations without blowing up credit usage. Dial in governance early and the setup will stay affordable as they scale.",

Interviewers were FTEs doing data engineering so we'd probably scan the resume, projects, git repos in < 15min before the call. Some projects were referred to after the interview. But I wouldn't expect a senior position to provide projects, generally our work is owned by the companies and repositories are private; and we've stopped doing \"presentable\" projects outside of work. I have multiple friends in various industries looking for work, including a previously staff backend engineer from Instagram and they're all having a hard time. I know that doesn't help but looking for work is soul crushing, and legally it's in the companies best interest to give you zero feedback on why they went with someone else. Also if you don't mind shorter projects (still FTE) but 3-6mo projects don't skip applying for the major cloud vendor PSO companies. At those companies \"YOU\" are the product so they can often be hiring when others aren't. Hope something comes your way soon!",

It comes with GCP/Azure/AWS, the accounts are short lived but last I checked you could still spin up some pretty expensive products like GCP's Spanner, Redshift, etc. Another reason, if you do something \"stupid\" that would generate a massive bill. You only paid 35 bucks and it's in their sandbox. I think you're allowed 10ish cpu cores of raw ec2 instances at a time. When linux academy was bought by cloud guru the courses became a shell of what they were and became very heavily designed towards passing certifications so I can't vouch for any of the training that comes with it.

Pick one small goal (like replicating an ETL you’ve already built), and use your credits just for that. Document what you do—it’s great for your portfolio.* **Databricks Community Edition** is another solid option—it’s limited, but you can still get a feel for Spark + notebooks in a cloud environment.* **Mock cloud architecture projects**: Even if you can’t spin up real services, diagram out what you would build. Treat it like a case study: describe the data flow, tools you'd use, how you'd deploy and monitor it, etc. Interviewers love seeing your thinking.* **Volunteer work or open-source projects**: Some nonprofits or small data teams are happy to have help setting up basic pipelines. It’s a longer shot, but worth exploring if you’re on LinkedIn or GitHub.",

Our tech is oversaturated with buzzwords and abbreviations for no good reason.So I've read the article and I find it very interesting. I agree with many points, especially about idempotency. And I also have a few questions:1. From my experience, layered data platforms aren't made only for the sake of business. Materializing intermediate datasets with pieces of business logic can be necessary to maintain good cost/performance ratio. Especially when the data is big, and your ETL system can only handle data increments in a timely manner. At the same time, proper naming convention and an appropriate architecture (Kimball, DV) makes the data easier to navigate. Does this align with your vision, and if not, why is your way of doing things better? Or is it?2. Implement all transformations as pure functions - it makes me think you're advocating for ETL process instead of ELT (aka using compute engines like Spark for data transformations). I make this assumption, because implementing pure transformations using sql is much more tricky, and people with expertise in sql, but no expertise in OOP may struggle to do it consistently. Even tools like DBT require careful model design to achieve real idempotency. With this in mind, don't you think having all transformations as pure functions is too costly?",

The Semantic Layer (for tools like Power BI) is only in the Enterprise tier. dbt Fusion is a new engine combining SQL and Python, available only on dbt Cloud for now. So yes, dbt Cloud is the full premium product, and the tiers decide which features you get.",

        "body": "Hey, just wanted to give you a heads up about dbt pricing since we went through this recently.To answer your questions: dbt Cloud is the whole premium product (not just the web IDE). Developer/Team/Enterprise are all tiers within dbt Cloud, and yes, the semantic layer for PowerBI is Cloud-only. Fusion is a feature within the Cloud product.Here's the thing though: we were on the Teams plan and everything was fine until we hit 8+ people. Then dbt Sales basically forced us into Enterprise tier. The initial quote? $300/seat/month on a 3-year contract. Even after heavy negotiation we only got it down to $220/seat/month.For context, that's $26,400/year for 10 people, which feels pretty steep for what's essentially a task scheduler running on top of open-source dbt.If you're just getting started with the engineering side, I'd honestly suggest sticking with dbt Core + your own orchestration (Airflow, GitHub Actions, whatever). The semantic layer is nice, but probably not worth $20-30k/year for a small team. You could build your own metrics layer or look at alternatives for way less.Just something to keep in mind as your team grows. The jump from Teams to Enterprise pricing is brutal.",

They have released a new product with a rust based engine called fusion that has a modified license to avoid other companies leveraging and reselling their work. There is supposed to be both a free cli version (registration required but no cost) and the premium version through the cloud or premium cli. Yes semantic models are gated behind the premium license. They also are sort of limited in that you can't build a full model with multiple tables, each semantic model is 1:1 with a dbt model, which is one table or view. If you use an obt data structure then you are good. If you have a star schema or something like that that you want to represent semantically then it doesn't work. We wanted to to do a PBI on top of dbt thing too, but ultimately just built a big model in PBI because it did what we needed it to. There are a few other options out there right now like Cube and Snowflake just released a few options if you use that platform. There isn't Snowflake to PBI integration yet though.[https://www.getdbt.com/blog/new-code-new-license-understanding-the-new-license-for-the-dbt-fusion-engine](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/new-code-new-license-understanding-the-new-license-for-the-dbt-fusion-engine)",

But since they announced fusion they still work on core.Also their DBT-fusion licensing is quite complexe. It’s like you can use it for like an open source software but not too much. Not sure the community really likes what they did with this.We will see how they manage this but currently they have those 3 products (core, fusion, cloud) which they support.Their cloud thing is good to have some extra feature that they didn’t include in core like DBT mesh and catalog, but it’s quite bad for orchestration, so you pay for something you will try to orchestrate another way….

However, my first reaction to your department/location example, is that if there are (relevant) properties of the intersection between these, they are not two separate dimensions. They are one dimension. Are you familiar with the concept of Junk dimensions? That might be what's relevant here.

Talking about your example, I would split them up, keeping one change per changeset. Also, createTable and createIndex should not be considered a single operation. It is very common to create indexes sometime after the table is created. e.g.. Create the table, ingest the data, then create the indexes.2. Again, I would not keep them in the same changeset. Having the CREATE OR REPLACE clause helps make the change idempotent, but the function and the trigger are still two different objects.3. I believe in this case, you should add a rollback for the trigger.Again, as I mentioned earlier, I don't have experience with Liquibase, and I'm aware that following the guidelines strictly can make everything more laborious, so please take it with a grain of salt. I don't think you should be so strict if you are creating the database from scratch, for example. In that case, I would develop changesets to create multiple foreign keys and indexes, for example. However, on an already ongoing application, that solution would not be optimal.",

It's probably currently better described as a \"SQL query engine\", than a full database.Warp skips: \\- transactions \\- updates/deletes \\- indexing \\- joins (although it could one day) \\- writes are also currently append onlyThe idea was to strip it down to a minimal feature set to unlock extreme speed. That's really all that's required for dash boards, real-time searches and fast lookups etc. I'd imagine people would output a pre-processed table from a daily pipeline, ingest it into Warp, then query it throughout the day.",

For example, Warp is benefiting greatly from the OS caching disk data: \\- Cold reads (from disk) hit around 5GB/s \\- Warm reads (from cached pages) can hit 200GB/s+Curious how large you're thinking? If a single column fits within memory (say <32 GB) this should run extremely well on repeat queries on similar data (eg when a dashboard is loaded). The data used so far is \\~100GB per example (individual columns are a fraction of this).It's not designed for truly massive datasets (> TBs) yet, that'd require NVME raids and/or distributed nodes. I've tried to keep it small so it's cheap to run (I suspect a lot of cloud users are paying more than they need to for their small/mid data sizes). However, def keen to learn more about what real users expect!",

I suggest reading some database literature; definitely room for innovation and quality of implementation improvements, but no need to reinvent all the theory. And there's different philosophies of design (\"in memory\" or not, distributed or not, etc, etc).Some (many) algorithms degrade poorly when the amount of data is larger than the system's available memory. It's not just about the size of data; it's also about whether there's a performance cliff (or a point where you outright start failing).You're not wrong, a single machine can do a lot. One of my colleagues posted this recently: https://datamonkeysite.com/2025/07/21/does-a-single-node-python-notebook-scale/Single nodes have gotten very powerful. But then again, smalk workloads don't always stay small. Having room to grow is good too, as is not having it be \"works on my machine\".I work on a distributed, autoscaling OLAP database engine (Fabric Warehouse) that's capable of efficient single node execution, or scale out, depending on what the query needs. So I'm not necessarily convinced one really has to choose between small scale efficiency and being capable of going distributed. But at the same time, you've already got a huge project on your hands as it is. It's a very interesting space, with lots of hard problems and competition. Good luck!",

Our official SLA is 3 hrs but in reality we process the data in around an hour tops end-to-end. The input is approx 500 JSON files a minute, essentially a new version of each business object in each file, and the output is 280+ delta tables. We use only custom-built pyspark notebooks to accomplish this, no DLTs, with a combination of continuous batch job workflows and ADF-triggered readstream workflows that run for 24 hrs then time out using a query listener to recycle and restart during off-hours.The first crux of the data feed is to transform the incoming JSON into a collection of 280+ tabular and relational “bronze” tables. This first crux is the essential schema transformation from an object-oriented data view to an analytical and relational-database view of the data. No data contents are modified, only the schema representation.The second crux is the creation of a merge statement from the collection of “bronze” tabular tables to the final collection of “silver” tables. We have 6 workflows that run this second part with about 75 tasks for the big ones, 20 for the smaller ones, that all use a status table as a readstream to know when parsed, tabular data is ready to merge into the final silver tables. Each task is responsible for keeping one final silver table updated. Think of it as laminar data flow.Not sure this helps since you seem to be receiving tabular data from the start, but seemed like our situation might have enough commonalities to describe here.Good luck!",

If the schema changes or more columns are available, *as I remember it* you get a warning/error, that something has changed in your profiling. Not the actual change I think. But again, not sure.As for point 4, it generates a report that you manually have to click on and open. Actually quite nice overview in the automatically generated reports with stats on all your metadata in your profiling. It is annoying that you have log in to a different system to see them, but you can extract the metadata through the API if you want to collect it in your regular data warehouse and do your own reports.But it is expensive. And I believe a lot of other proprietary expensive data quality tools can do the same. It is just not available in any cheap/open source way.

Read blog posts (same as reading books - but there's even more crap out there). Bookmark the good ones.4. Today? Ask Chat-GPT for advice. Seriously. But don't just ask for the answer - ask it about the approach and zoom in on an interesting point and ask for more detail. \"Tell me more\" is one of the best questions /statements you can type into Chat-GPT.5.

If you don't know how that works you can starve other processes really easily.3: The GUI authoring tool. Whatever other benefits or drawbacks NiFi has there are always going to be engineers who will reject it based on that alone.3.5: Because of the GUI and the resulting config files most dev tooling e.g. git & CI/CD don't play well with NiFi making review and deployment a more difficult process.",

        "body": "For operational use cases - take the data, do something to it, send output to some downstream system - your instinct is correct in that trying to shoehorn the “medallion” concept into this sort of flow can be counterintuitive. My team and I went through a lot of back-and-forth on whether we wanted to support such use cases in our Databricks environment, or wanted to keep them separate. There were arguments to be made for separate - the data volume of these use cases is lower than our analytical workloads, and so Azure Functions/Logic Apps could be sufficient. However, then we would need to use a non-Databricks orchestrator, which would be a bit annoying for some of the multi-step operational workflows. Doing it in Databricks meant that all of our data jobs live in one place and are orchestrated through one set of tools, regardless of whether they’re operational or analytical in nature. Databricks Asset Bundles have been great for us in this regard, in terms of allowing us to define our job configurations as code. Once we got past that, we came back to the medallion. We landed the operational data in its own schema in our bronze catalog, but rather than moving it to “silver”, we created an operations catalog that serves as the use-case layer for all of these operational pipelines. They’re still sourced from bronze, and in the future, we might source analytical “silver” tables from either the bronze or operational catalogs, but this approach has been working well for us.We leverage Databricks secrets (backed by Azure Key Vault) for all of our connection secrets, and give our service principals READ access to the scope in each environment. We have also modularized our code for SFTP/FTP into a helper library so we don’t have to maintain the same logic in each pipeline. We try to stick to asynchronous patterns for our downstream writes (e.g. we drop off a file somewhere and some downstream system picks it up), but if we had to, we could also make a direct API connection and write our data that way. We just haven’t really had to do that for our use cases thus far.",

The anon ID should be stable for that customer session at least. Better if stable across sessions. When you get the customer info, you would hopefully have a stable user ID from your core database so you can link the anonymous ID and the user ID. This way, all the events from before you identified the customer can be attributed to that customer.Look up identity resolution or identity stitching to read more about it. I would keep all transactions in the same table, just have user ID or whatever as null when it’s missing. If you are able to assign user IDs when you can, then you should be able to join all the different data together via the user IDs.",

In the gold layer you'll show only this field to analytics teams because the answer to questions like \"how many clients did we have in the last month?\" can only be answered with `CUSTOMER_ID_DEDUP`.Customer deduplication is very common in CRM systems, sometimes you are asked to apply logics to deduplicate customers coming from different systems: not only POS but also CRM, newsletter, loyalty systems, referral platforms, social media, contact centers, e-commerce, ....",

If you were doing fuzzy matching on names, you might be able to match Jon Smith to John Smith if the addresses were matching too.You may need a specialised identity/entity resolution system to do this. Important is that it doesn't matter what order the data arrives - identity records can be matched later, but in real-time as they arrive.I'm co-founder of an identity resolution company (Tilores).

Not knowing how to do something causes a lot of novices to freeze up and panic, but for a programmer, every problem always starts with \"I don't know how to do this.\" Programming is about where to go from that common starting point.

        "body": "What is it that people generally struggle with? It took me about a month (full time) to go from understanding practically nothing about programming, to being a passably competent junior developer, back around 10 years ago.I did spend a lot of my teen years building and tinkering with computers, and I was able to make static websites, but that was all I knew going into it. Perhaps having that basic understanding of how the hardware worked helped.I knew I had to learn C#, and that I would be doing web app development for work, so I just set myself the goal of building a social network site, not one that would be live anywhere or with scalability, just one that technically worked.I wrote out the list of features I wanted, profiles with personal info, picture uploads with compression, posts with comments and likes/dislikes, a friend list with the ability to add or remove people, and a search to find people on there.I looked up how entity framework worked, and followed about 30 mins of a tutorial for setting up a code-first database, but made models for my own project instead of copying the tutorial ones. I do remember having a little confusion on how to store and model references for comment chains, but google and a stack overflow post helped with that.Then I did something similar for authentication, integrating it with the models I had already made. After that there was some googling on how MVC worked, and how to pass models around. I’m pretty sure I went overkill on that, as I didn’t know just how much ‘just worked’ and how much I had to manually implement.After that it just sort of snowballed. I’d move from feature to feature, working on each, and googling very specific things when stuck to find stack overflow or random blog posts, which I could just read through and then implement myself. The second half of that month was a lot of fun seeing everything come together and work. I’m sure if I could find the codebase today, I’d shake my head at the quality, but at the time, I was very proud of it.Honestly, I never found any struggle at all when it came to learning the basics and putting something together. I didn’t hit a brick wall until I was getting into things like trying to implement algorithms directly from academic papers, and that’s mostly because I don’t always follow the terminology or notation correctly. There’s also usually a couple of times a year I come across some incredibly elusive bug that takes me a week to figure out. I find the hardest part of the job is looking at large projects written by other people with a differeng style, and having to unpick everything and figure out how it works. I know when I was a teenager, I always wanted to learn, but never did because I wanted to do everything perfectly first time and not waste even a second of time by picking the wrong thing, but as soon as I needed it for work and just had to figure it out look for a new job, it turned out to be so simple I wish I could have gone back and slapped my younger self for all the delaying.I’m curious, which part in the process is the challenge that makes it harder? This post is interesting, but it definitely feels like there’s a degree of overkill to the process!If someone can really verbalise what makes the whole thing a challenge to them, perhaps I can help? I know it sounds weird, but I’ve been doing it for so many hours now that it’s hard for me to imagine not being able to, but I would very much like to help if I can somehow!As for your conclusion about shifting mentality, that is one thing I do try to reiterate to people, nobody in tech support or software development really ‘knows’ it all, we just know that if you sit down and do some searching, as well as thinking through each problem step by step, you’ll get there in the end, there’s not much to it. Yes, some stuff gets passively memorised over time, but other than a handful of keywords and simple logic, you don’t need anything else to start working on a project. You’ll be slow, sometimes it takes a while to find the correct answer online, but overall, you can fundamentally do it.I do think some people believe we’re joking when we say that 50% of the job is figuring out what to google, but it is mostly true. Programming languages are not actual languages, you don’t need to converse in real time, and therefore you don’t need much stored information to do it. It’s far more like a trade skill, like plumbing or carpentry, anyone can do it, the difference between a new learner and an experienced developer is simply how quick and how well polished the result is. If I give you some wooden planks, a saw, a hammer, and some nails, you can build a table. It might be a shit table, it might collapse as soon as you put weight on it, but you can do it. After you do it once and find the flaws, you’ll do it again better the next time. The same is true here, if you have an IDE installed, and have a web browser and a list of keywords, you can build an app, it might crash, or be slow, but you can build it, then you go again and you’ll do it better and faster next time.",

        "body": ">I'm completely unable to \"think like a programmer\".But it can be learned.>They're right, thinking like a programmer IS the hard part. Yes, it is, but as said, it can be learned. What you do is make a list of tasks. If you can't think of how to solve the task, you split it up again. If you can't solve the individual parts, you split those up again. And again.You wanted a way to 'describe it in English', and this is possible. You distill the core of the problem by focusing on what you want to do and the nouns in the problem description. You must first clearly state your problem. For example:- Problem: \"I want to know how often a word appears in an array of words and write this to the screen.\"Distill the core:- array of words- count how often- word- write to screenTo do this, I need:- An array of words (so I must define this).- A way to keep count (so I must define some data structure for this).- A way to look at each word in the array. (Thus I need a loop to pass by each word in the array.)- A way to decide if I already counted the word before (if yes: increase counter; else add word and set counter to 1)- To Write the result to the screenSimple code (pseudo; language is not important yet):```define array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana]define keep_count = objectfor every word in array_of_words {decide if you counted the word before}print_result(keep_count)```Now you have the array of words, and a way to keep count. The thing you didn't work out yet was \"decide if you counted a word before\", so that's what you do next:```if word is in keep_count {increase counter for word by 1} else {add word and set counter to 1}```So now you put that solution into the previous block of code:```define array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana];define keep_count = objectfor every word in array_of_words {if word is in keep_count {increase counter for word by 1} else {add word and set counter to 1}}print_result(keep_count)```Then refine it a bit:```define array_of_words = [apple, banana, orange, banana, kiwi, kiwi, banana];define keep_count = objectfor every word in array_of_words {if word is in keep_count {keep_count for word: increase by 1} else {keep_count add word: set to 1}}print_result(keep_count)```And you're done. You've written your program. Now you only need to translate it into the language you are using. A large part of the starting year of a computer science education is actually learning to do this, starting with small things like this and increasing the scope of the problems you're solving. Alongside this you'd learn about often-used data structures and algorithms.Repeat this again and again for years and years on end and you'll get good at it.This is a skill that can be learned, but not in \"Javascript bootcamp\". The above is programming; \"javascript bootcamp\" is writing code in Javascript. That's trivial compared to actually thinking up the solution.You always start with a problem, which you'll break down in smaller and smaller parts (where each part can be a function, which is also broken down into smaller parts), and in the end you'll be left with a (very long) list of tasks to do.",

I’m hearing more and more from career services and from friends in the field that these kids are getting fired, if they are even getting jobs at all. I know the peer pressure must be immense, but keep away from that shit. At least while you are learning. Making use of tools that are magnifiers are really only going to help experienced software engineers. You can’t amplify nothing and expect that to go well. College assignments are designed to be bite sized and have rails. We design them so most students can figure it out and learn. Of course AI can do an ok job at those. Your classmates are losing the chance to learn how to learn and believe me, look at what tech looked like in 2005 and see if you don’t agree that the one skill you need to get in college more than any other is learning how to learn things on your own so you can adapt. If you are so dependent on a tool, that you cannot do anything without it, and you cannot problem solve or think for yourself, then why is someone going to hire you. What value do you bring. What education did you acquire. So longer answer yes. Your classmates are cooked.",

        "body": "If AI can write code, it can run a company.If there's ever a point where you lose your engineering job to AI, everyone in almost every industry that touches a computer will.Currently AI writes dog shit code and the people that love it write dog shit code.The issue with the job market right now is that the economy is absolutely fucked and particularly the CS industry. A lot of venture capital dried up post covid and the value of the american dollar was cut in half almost overnight.There's also billions if not trillions in AI startups that haven't even turned a real profit yet. That money invested in AI isn't going into proven tech like solar, wind, electric cars that are a future trillion dollar industry.So it's really convenient for large companies (like amazon, meta, and microsoft who all have gigantic investments in AI) to say they layed off 20k employees because \"AI could do their job.\" If that's true, show me a video of AI doing all the coding and customer service. I don't believe it.These companies are probably tightening their belts in a bad economy, pinning it on how awesome their AI investment is doing, framing it as profit and saving money, boosting their stock price. And when interest rates on loans go down, they can hire everyone back.A lot of these companies were also \"benching\" people. Hiring top talent employees just so that they don't go build a competitor product.Realistically they probably laid off a ton of benched talent and other people they didn't need. The economy is awful so it will be harder for them to find a job. There's less access to capital so they probably won't be able to find investors. They can blame it on AI, watch their stock price shoot up. Save a ton of money on paying humans, and make their minimum corporate loan payments.Meanwhile your classmates are drinking the AI kool aid that startups have been pumping out for decades.If an LLM can code better than a fresh graduate, there will be no reason to hire young computer scientists. I doubt your friends are thinking this far in advance.That said, there are tons of papers on how LLMs and ML are close to the limit on how effective they can be. I think all large AI companies summed together are taking about 1 Great Britains worth of power to run. That's an insane amount of energy. Elon is using coal to power Grok which is mind blowingly stupid. It's causing health problems in the surrounding community near his data centers.I think every time you want a significant improvement you need an order of magnitude training data increase, as in add another 0. 1b > 10b > 100b > 1t. One trillion is 1 thousand billions. It's not just a big number. It's a number so big that there may arguably not be enough data to train it at a certain point.When AI trains on data that AI generated it fucks itself and starts outputting shit. This is a theory as to why so many giant LLMs like claude and chatgpt are getting worse. One reason might be that the nicer version is behind a paywall, but the other is that these llms might be consuming so much AI generated text that it's degrading them permanently and there's no real way to separate human from AI generated content on a platform that has billions of users.You may actually get to watch an entire industry enshittify in under 5 years, which is pretty cool IMO. It might be a once in a lifetime event.Advances tend to be S curved in the sense that you logarithmically increase a plateau of improvement, and then you get a material advance in conditions or approaches that allow you to exponentially increase towards another limit. Vaclav Smil's book on growth is basically like reading the back of a screwdriver but it's great at illustrating this point. It's almost a law of progress given enough resources.Realistically AI will increase, but it's largest limitation is energy consumption and training data requirements. These two things are kind of inherent in ML from what I understand and a lot of what people are doing to improve ML is incrementally improving it.My theory is that there will be a new AI paradigm that will be cheaper and require less input. Remember your brain can pitch a baseball, play chopin, cook a 5 star dinner, drive a racecar, and fuck elons mom and it only runs on the amount of power it takes to run a lightbulb.My recommendation would be to recognize that your friends are idiots, the hype is a smokescreen, and to just get good at coding and pass your classes. You will more than likely struggle more than your peers in school. As the problems get harder, you will struggle less and they will struggle more. And when it comes time to get a job you will be extremely rare in that you can actually code and your peers cannot. It will probably be easier for you to get a job.",

This is all very valuable.\\> What can I actually *do* with these skills? Is there any career path that values competitive programming? Or should I just start from scratch with web dev like everyone else?Well, new flash for you. There are essentially no applications out there that are not fundamentally web applications. Today anything that is user facing is either a mobile app, a game, or a webapp. Every other kind of development are essentially in support of application developers. Why do we make operating systems? So that we can make applications to run on them! Why do we make databases? So that we can make applications better. Why do we make AI models? So that we can use them in applications.So should you learn webdev. Yes, you absolutely should. Because most applications will be web apps. Now you don't necessarily need to be extremely good at it. Especially if you are going to work in more inner layers of computing. But no one will take you seriously if you don't seem like you can cobble up some application up.I personally never really do front end work. I hate it. But the easiest way to share what you do is to set it up as a webserver of some kind. I tend to focus on the back end pieces where most of the interesting computation happens.What should you do? Where should you go? I don't know. It depends on what YOU want to do. But it seems to me that you want to solve deeper problems than making a cute applications. And good for you, I hate that shit too. How are you going to get a ob, well, you are going to need to find company that does this kind of work. You need to figure out what you care about and what you want to do.There are plenty of database companies. There is plenty of work in server administration, cloud, and infrastructure. There are plenty of needs in AI, model, development, optimization. There are plenty of jobs in various kind of data mining. We still need compiler people. I had a student hired to write kernel modules. There are a lot of \"systems jobs\".To qualify for them, you need good system understanding. Often that does not happen until people focus on that in grad school. But it is possible out of a bachelor.",

Learn to recognize patterns and extract relationships from data. it doesn’t take a 1000 Leetcode or blind 75. You learn by doing and you get better by failing.

Competitive programmings only benefit is learning how to write algorithms in the most efficient way possible which is great, but when you've got a team of 5-10 other developers working on the same code base, the last thing you want is your code to be difficult and hard to understand. In 90% of the jobs out, saving 10ms of execution time isn't a goal (unless your in trading software for example).I'd much rather have someone who writes clear, understandable code and help them understand performance than the other way around.>I don’t even know where to use the problem-solving and coding skills I built upThe reason why is the problem solving skills you learned are not the problems you face in the real world. You figured out how to write some algorithm in the fastest execution time possible and out in day to day life people are writing integrations to make 2 systems talk to each other, aggregating data from 3 different databases into one export, building API's with infrastructure that scales based on user load.>Or should I just start from scratch with web dev like everyone else?Yes, its what is in demand and jobs are looking for. You are more than welcome to say \"well i don't want to learn web dev\" and attempt to land jobs on old stacks no ones taking (like winforms) but if you limit yourself to just c/c++ your options become even smaller (game dev, embedded dev...etc) as a new grad.There are backend, front end and full stack roles. Look at whats in demand near you but i imagine you'll see more full stack/backend than just dedicated front end roles these days (At least i do in my area).>Anyone else been through this? How did you figure it out?If you enjoy programming and building stuff, you should stick with it and learn a more marketable skill within the domain.

        "body": "I've tutored coding for almost 10 years (both as main job and as side gig). Here's some of the things I found from students who were in similar situations (1 hour a week schedules).I saw a comment below that said to teach them ABOUT the world of programming and computing, rather than actual programming, and I think that is the way to go given the constraints. That being said, here are some opinions/advice for IF you have to go through the programming route:\\- Language Choice: Don't use Unity if they aren't going to be doing things on their own time. I tried with a student once, who specifically asked for it. The result was that nothing got done, and nothing was learned because there isn't enough time to understand concepts without homework / self learning. Sure, he could memorize some scripts, and make something move, but at that point, is that really programming? I eventually convinced him to move to Python.\\- I would center my approach around the concept of \"how computers work and how to think systematically\". If you make the content of the class enjoyable, and make the learning fun/interesting, then they will want to do more on their own time. Instead of making a curriculum around \"how much can I get them to learn in this time frame?\" (As other users have said, that is no where near enough time), make it be \"How do I get them to learn a few cool stuff and develop an interest in wanting to learn more?\\- The above point is why I would pick something like python, or even html/css/javascript (yes, 2/3rds of those aren't \"programming\" languages). The reason being the lower hurdle of entry to getting something they can make working, and they can see they made. I used to believe that if someone wanted to learn properly, start them in C. Nowadays, my viewpoint has changed to \"Start them in python so you can hook their interest with a lower bar of entry, and THEN dump them into a language like C#/Unity/Language of choice once they understand the basic concepts and are interested in the next steps\". Heck, if they are interested in AI, staying in python is great.\\- You said you tried before and it was too confusing for them. I don't know how you explained it, but I'm going to give 2 extreme scenarios as an example. Look at this from a students point of view. \\- Scenario 1: You go to class, you need to either learn what int main(int argc, char \\*argv\\[\\]) means, or be told to memorize and learn it later. The former means needing to learn functions, args, arrays, return types, and more. The latter is encouraging not critical thinking. After that, you do printf(\"Hello World\");. Then you need to learn what compiling is, and how to run the program. All that for Hello world. \\- Scenario 2: you go to class, you type print(\"Hello World\"), and it shows up on your screen the line below. You made something. Your teacher can now introduce concepts one at a time, each with you making something. For example, maybe you introduce variables next, and create a Hello, name. Then functions, and create a print\\_spam. So on. Since I was tutoring, I was able to tailor projects to each student's interests (Instead of random number generator, I can do random kpop member or something), but for a classroom, it should be more generic, and maybe more open ended as a project.\\- Going to say this point again: with so little time, The best curriculum in my opinion is one that gets them interested and learning how to think critically, rather than one that dumps as much info as possible that they may or may not retain.",

Now I do more tech strategy and communications on a team that is not really technical. You’ll be surprised at the opportunities that can come from having these skills, so I like to think of programming as a skill, not a job. With a basic understanding and a desire to put it to work, choose your areas of focus carefully. It’s tempting to dive into a little bit of everything, but in my experience, especially with newer people, they offer more to a team when they come in with some capability in a certain role. You can always learn what you need to about other areas on the job, but if you decide you like front end stuff, dive into it and do it strategically. Maybe ask an AI what front end frameworks are in the highest demand right now… pick one, like react, and learn it well. The sooner you can start contributing something to a team, the better. Too often we see juniors in our world who are smart and capable but need too much handholding, so coming in with a real understanding of what you’ll be contributing to and you’ll be shocked at how grateful senior people are to skip the handholding phase.",

For example: put(stderr, \"x = \"); put(stderr, x); put(stderr, \"\\n\");> The type of the argument determines which \"put function\" will be invoked for each argument. However, this is too verbose. The C++ solution, using an output stream for which `<<` has been defined as a \"put to\" operator, looks like this: cerr << \"x = \" << x << \"\\n\";> [...] The idea of providing an output operator rather than a named output function was suggested by Doug McIlroy by analogy with the I/O redirection operators in the UNIX shell (`>`, `>>`, `|`, etc.). This requires operators that return their left-hand operand for use by further operations.So basically, the stream operators exist to allow a convenient and concise way to output multiple values.In modern C++ you could accomplish the same goal with a variable-argument function using templates, but early versions of C++ didn't have the advanced template features needed to make that work.",

As a result, print calls are no longer atomic and proper formatting of the output is a nightmare. Boost overloads the % operator for formatting (get it?), and chrono uses the / operator for dates. Yes, auto date = 2025y / 7 / 23:face_vomiting:. These are all terrible, hard to read and hard to use. Absolutely awful designs, all of them. Anyways, now since C++23, you can use std::print and std::format instead, and I actually like these quite a lot (despite some minor quirks that will likely get fixed in time).",

Printf is really annoying since you have to match placeholders to variables. And you cannot overload a function with all combinations of types and lengths. And you don’t want to call print separately in each piece of output. Almost every language struggles with it and does smth strange.Scripting languages and similar use all kind of var interpolation. And rely on checking var type at runtime - can’t do in c/c++. Java uses weird trick with + which suddenly calls toString() behind curtains. How is that reasonable - it’s the only implicit thing in Java. At least in first versions. Python secretly calls `_repr_` but Python does many strange things. Also, notice how Python moved from print with commas separating args (and ugly way of controlling formatting with `sep=` to variable interpolation with `{}`. C++ found a pretty clean way to do it using operators. And it’s more reasonable to put `cout <<` at the beginning. I think technically you can put cout at the end of expression by using right associating operator but why bother. Assignment works right to left, why not output.",

I’ve also been using Codefinity, and I totally agree it’s a solid platform for beginners, especially if you're starting from scratch or looking for a structured way to learn Python and other programming skills. What I appreciate most is that it's very hands-on. You can write and test your code in-browser without needing to install anything, which makes it super convenient for people who don’t want to mess around with IDEs right away.In terms of beginner-friendly platforms, Codefinity definitely ranks up there. The lessons are bite-sized, which helps with consistency and reduces the feeling of being overwhelmed. I also found the AI assistant to be surprisingly helpful. It’s great for quick explanations when you're stuck or just need something reworded. That kind of interactive support is something a lot of other platforms don’t offer, especially not at this level of integration.However, the pricing model is a bit of a downside. Like you mentioned, it’s not very transparent upfront. You get into the lessons and then suddenly find out about a subscription. I think they could do better there. And yes, some of the early Python lessons are very basic, which might not be ideal for those with prior experience. But if you push through the first few modules, the content does become more challenging and engaging.What I’d love to see from Codefinity is more intermediate and project-based learning paths especially for things like data analysis, web development with Python, or real-world app building. That would make the platform not just a good starting point but a long-term learning tool too.For anyone searching for a Codefinity review, wondering if Codefinity is good for beginners, or looking for online platforms to learn Python, I’d say give it a shot just go in knowing the pros and cons. It’s especially helpful for people who like learning through doing, rather than watching endless tutorial videos.",

I’ve been testing out Codefinity myself, and I think it’s a pretty underrated option for learning to code especially for anyone starting out with Python or just dipping their toes into programming. If you're searching for an honest Codefinity review, here’s my take::check_mark_button: **What I liked**:* The platform is clean and beginner-friendly. No need to install any software—you can code right in your browser, which saves a ton of setup time.* The course structure is well-paced. Lessons are short, interactive, and easy to digest without feeling overwhelming.* The built-in AI assistant is a nice touch. It’s not perfect, but when I got stuck or needed something explained in simpler terms, it actually helped me move forward instead of getting discouraged.:magnifying_glass_tilted_left: **Things to be aware of**:* As others have mentioned, the pricing model isn’t super transparent. You’ll probably get into the learning groove and then be hit with a subscription prompt, which can be frustrating.* The early lessons might feel *too* simple if you already know the basics. It starts very slow, but it does pick up and get more practical.:bullseye: **Why I’m using Codefinity**:My goal is to learn Python for data analysis and later move into web development. I’ve tried platforms like Codecademy and Udemy in the past, but Codefinity has been the one that’s helped me stick with a routine. The gamified elements and instant feedback really help with motivation.Overall, if you're searching for the best platform to learn Python for beginners or wondering is Codefinity worth it, I’d say yes with a few caveats. It’s great for building foundational skills, but you may eventually need to supplement it with more project-based or advanced content from elsewhere.Curious to hear what others think have you used Codefinity for longer than a few months? Did it help you move into real-world projects or jobs? Are there better alternatives for learning Python step by step?Let’s make this a helpful thread for anyone researching Codefinity reviews or trying to choose the right coding platform in 2025.",

Absolutely. Are they written in Go? Nope.Are there MMO servers I could *attempt* to bend to my will? Yes. Are they written in Go? Nope.I used to help write the net code for MANGOS project 15 years ago in C++, so I'm leaning heavily on that to implement most of those functions in my Go server, as for the client, a good amount of Engine logic can be taken from others and used in my project.At the end of the day, it's just how much drive you have to want to learn. Someone made a wooden wheel, then someone else took that wheel, made it metal, then someone else developed a tire. Everything can be incremented on to be made better. If you're not looking at starting a whole new project, maybe look into projects you can try to contribute to instead to get the juices flowing.",

JavaScript has many more sharp edges that can easily trip a new developer up.JavaScript is mainly used in front end UIs, backend APIs, and FaaS (ie. Lambdas)Python is used in backend APIs, SSR websites (where you most likely need to use both), integration systems, automation, data science, data processing pipelines, FaaS, devops tooling, CLI tools, scripting, black box testing, telephony, and so many many more. There's no real \"main\" use cases for Python, out of the box it is a swiss army knife.Get to know the basic programming concepts and constructs and you will be set to learn another language relatively quickly.",

Take notes afterwards about what went well and what didn't.* Keep in mind your perception of interviews and their perception could be quite different. You could have done really well in your mind, but maybe they had no plans to hire and so you didn't get picked, or they nitpicked on a resume.

If yes, you might reasonably say that you \"know\" Python, but you still might want to explain your skill level by explaining how much experience you have or what you've done with the language so far.In short, \"know\" in this context is fine for a basic description, but you'd usually supply additional information if your skill level is important.",

In my own fields of work python was also commonly the language of choice for API access to proprietary engineer software (biomedical field). More recently, AI and Data science have become two key trending areas in tech. A lot of startups and spin outs are coming from university research groups. Much of the tools developed by these academic groups just so happens to be written in python. As people filter through the university and inevitably go on to work (either as employees or startup founders) it makes sense that they would stick with the languages and tools they know well.That's my 2 cents anyway.",

        "body": ">my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going onThis sounds like what people call a \"mental block\", and I think learning to defuse that involves a lot more learning *how to learn* than it does learning how to do computer science. Heads up, this is probably going to sound more like I'm trying to give you therapy than anything else.**Step 1:** Validate yourself. *It is totally normal to struggle learning this*. It's a hard fucking topic, half the resources online are dogshit, and significantly more than half the people you meet online trying to talk about it are probably going to call you dumb and/or lazy. You're not. You're allowed to struggle, and in time you'll come to learn that failure is positive; but I full appreciate that it doesn't look that way right now.I'm a senior dev and data scientist. I've dropped out of multiple degrees. There are some leaderboards on leetcode-esque sites where I'm in the top 100 in the entire world. Sometimes I make mistakes that a child would laugh at.The struggle is just part of the journey, and comprehension will come with practice and time.**Step 2:** When your mind is settled and ready to be curious/compassionate, think back to that feeling of \"my brain automatically tells me that I don’t understand what’s going on\" - what's *actually* going on there?What's going on is your brain throwing up barriers; an anxiety response, not necessarily a cognitive one. \"It's better to stop trying than to risk failure\", or something along those lines. I bet you do know a bit about programming. I bet you could tell me what a variable is, how to make one, probably what a function is, and so on. Remind yourself of the things you *do* understand and try to connect them to what you're currently struggling with.We beat anxiety by breaking things down into tiny little pieces until they seem surmountable. We win by starting very very simple, and going very very slow, if we have to. Every time you don't understand something, every time that \"I don't get it\" response pops up, *stop struggling*. Tend to it. Take a breath. Talk it through with yourself - break it down into the smallest, silliest subproblem you can. Address just that one tiny subproblem. Didn't work? Break it down even further. Take a break the moment you feel like you're making negative progress, because that is a real threat in these kinds of situations.**Step 3:** The real outcome we're looking for here is a mindset change, because (as much as it sucks) coming up against frustrating or overwhelming problems is just a part of doing programming. It's tempting to think \"how do I avoid this?\" but it's more productive to instead think \"how do I process this and learn from it?\" - because it is gonna keep happening.When your brain wants to say \"I don't get it\", try to reframe: you don't understand *yet,* you're still in the process of learning. What tool can I use to get past this obstacle? How have I managed these situations before? Am I hammering my forehead against a wall here; and if so, can I change strategy rather than getting more upset it isn't working?",

Learn the wrong way to do things too, it'll help you figure out the right way to do things. Write shitty spaghetti code. You'll improve over time.Try something simple like building a number guessing game. Add features to it: make it so you can select a difficulty which sets how wide the range of numbers are. Implement a limited number of guesses. Etc etc.Take what you learned from that and do something more complicated. Try making a shopkeeper for a fake rpg game. Add items to buy. Make them have descriptions, and a cost. Give yourself an inventory. Give yourself a wallet. Make it so you can list items in the shop. Buy said items. Maybe use CLI-style commands to buy the items. Make it so you can buy multiple at once. Add ways to earn money. Make them more complicated. Eventually turn it into a playable CLI game.There's just so many ways to learn how to code that are better than staring at tutorials all day. Learn how to think like a coder first. When you have all these requirements/constraints, sit down and think about how you might write code to make it happen. Look up how to actually do that thing you need. For the guessing game, clearly you need a random number, lets say between 1 and 10. Look up how to generate a number between 1 and 10 and store it. Look up how to get user input. Look up how to compare values. Look up how to let a player guess again if they are wrong (aka how to loop). Etc. Figuring it out yourself is ALWAYS better than following a tutorial.",

        "body": "It's definitely a shift when you go from an intro programming tutorial where you to have a sequence of things to learn to building a project where you learn as you go. I'll give an example:My first project was building a game. This wasn't web (I used Python), but the same idea should apply. A bit of Googling led to me learning there was this nice Python library called Pygame. I poked around at tutorials just enough to figure out how to display stuff on the screen, and then I started designing my game - thinking about how I needed a hero, platforms, monsters, etc., how to represent those in classes, and how to draw things on the screen. A bit more Googling revealed that a game typically has a \"main\" loop with a delay at the end where the goal is to get user input, update various things (hitpoints, etc.), and draw the next frame. So I mostly figured out how to do that but had to turn to tutorials for a few things like animation and how to make jumps actually look like jumps.So you're still using tutorials, but you're using them **as needed** rather than following a long tutorial beginning to end. I do find when looking at a tutorial to help with a project, it's useful to first try out a few simple examples in a small program before incorporating into your project. So in the example I gave, maybe I'd make a small program to display images or even little filled-in circles on a screen and then try to make them move in some pattern.If you want to try full stack, Flask and sqlite are pretty beginner-friendly for the backend if you don't mind picking up Python. (If you want to stick to Javascript, there's NodeJS on the backend, but I've never used it myself.) You could also do something that's pure frontend but still fairly involved like making a single-player game.",

Aside from that, a mindset that has helped me in my work is to think about side effects. \"If I change a thing in part A, what does that do to part B?\" and working to better encapsulate logic/steps so that generally doesn't happen, as it's generally a bad thing that makes debugging much harder.",

Spending an afternoon learning how to use your IDE's debugger will save you hundreds of hours later.* Trace the execution path systematically - step through your code in the order it actually runs, not just how you think it should run. Use the debugger's \"step over/into\" functions or add print statements to follow the flow and catch where logic diverges from your expectations.* Use 'Rubber duck debugging': explain your code line by line to someone (or a rubber duck). You'll often catch the issue while explaining.Debugging - like programming - is systematic. Don't approach it like guesswork, but like a detective or scientist: observe the symptoms, form hypotheses, test them one by one, and let the evidence guide you to the root cause.",

Debugging is all about critical thinking.Learn how to use a debugger, and add logging to your program. A debugger, especially, is a powerful tool for gathering information about an error, because it allows you to set breakpoints, change variables and step through your code to see exactly what it is doing, line by line.",

        "body": "That's the wrong approach. Randomly changing things will likely break stuff.Here's the analogy. Imagine you have a car (and I'm no mechanic), and it's having some issues. You open the hood of the car, and start randomly doing stuff, hoping the problem will go away.Do you think that's a solid approach to fixing the car? Would a real mechanic do that? No, they would try to figure out what the problem is. Of course, being experienced, they have a series of tests they can do to isolate the problem and the confirm it is the problem, and they have an idea how to solve the problem.In a way, you need to do the same. Randomly changing your code is not going to fix it just like randomly doing stuff to a car engine won't fix it. You need to understand your code.Because I've taught beginners, I've seen this \"I do random stuff and hope to fix it\" before. Why do beginners try this approach even as they would admit, it won't likely work.It's because the code looks daunting. If I say, tell me what each line of code does, one step at a time. Be the computer. Do each step. To a beginner, that seems like crazy slow. It would take forever to do that (even though they wrote the code). Random fixes is a lot quicker. Do something rather than do the right thing which is slow and tedious.OK, so some steps.**Determine why you think your program is broken**I've had students who tell me their program doesn't work. When I press them, and ask \"what's wrong\", they just say it doesn't work.What they really need to say is, \"I think this is wrong because when I put in value X, I get answer Y, when I expect Z\". Those three parts are key. What input (X) did you use? What answer (Y) did you get? And what answer did you expect (Z)? This is the first step to debugging. Why do you think it's wrong?**Try a smaller input**The next step is to put in the smallest input that causes the problem. Sometimes, we'd give students some sample inputs that were pretty lengthy. Their code would break, but it was hard for them to figure what was going on because the input was so lengthy, they didn't know what part was causing the problem (imagine the input is an array of numbers).The first step is to see if it can handle the smallest input possible (say, an array with one element).**Test your functions**A smaller version is to test functions. Determine* what are the input parameters* given certain input values, what are the output values**Write more small functions**Instead of writing one big `main()`, break things up into small functions. Then, you can test each function.Write a comment for each function and give some sample inputs and expected outputs for that function.**Test as you go along**Don't write all the code with no testing, then test after you wrote all that code. This won't help if the code is already written, but can help in future coding.",

I figure that at this point, people will look at the work I've done and what I can do, because I've had a decade to produce things, but perhaps if I hadn't made anything yet, it'd be much more helpful to indicate I had a vague idea of what I was doing at least.Some members of my family like that I have it for some reason, but personally, if I could go back, I wouldn't bother. I didn't learn anything I wasn't familiar with already from work and personal research, and some aspects of what was taught would actively hinder my job if I tried implementing them as it would slow productivity to a crawl.I did mine part-time, I can't imagine doing it full-time. If you have already got the ability, and you have some way to show it, I really don't think a degree is going to change things any more than spitting in the ocean. The times I've had bigger offers have all been because they've seen something I've done and liked it, but I've never had anyone stop to mention the lack of degree, or ask about it since I got it.Of course, I imagine different goals and different locations might change that, from my understanding, large multinationals tend to like degrees, but I'd rather switch to a different career than work for any of them.",

The entire course was done with me spending maybe 5 hours on it, because I already knew it.There isn’t any homework in each class, just lesson material and optional practice work and labs. The final is the only thing graded, some courses are exams, others are projects",

I haven't really heard about people extracting data and editing the code though, just playing the games with the ROMs..In some cases, it sounds like you can save (AKA \"dump\") game cartridge ROMs directly on a console and save them to an SD card. For instance, for a Nintendo 3DS, I found [this guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide/dumping-titles-and-game-cartridges.html). For older systems,To look at the code though, you could use a disassembler and load the ROM into it - but it would only show you the assembly language instructions; you can't extract the original higher level code (i.e., C) from that. Reading assembly code and understanding what it's trying to do takes significant effort, as it's about as low-level as you can get. And if you want to make changes, you'd modify the instructions and re-assemble it (it doesn't get re-compiled like a higher-level language does).",

No one of those people has ever bothered to look. Which is a shame, because my personal projects display much more in depth knowledge than anything I made on the job.I swear, companies have completely lost the plot, when it comes to hiring talent.So my personal projects only helped indirectly, because I can claim expertise in things, that I didn't do on the job, but learned in my free time.",

Immediately disable those secrets so they provide no access to any of your services.For the people who believe GitHub trains on your private repositories:GitHub's [privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement?utm_source=chatgpt.com#private-repositories-github-access) explicitly says:> If your GitHub account has private repositories, you control the access to that information. GitHub personnel does not access private repository information without your consent except as provided in this Privacy Statement and for:> - security purposes> - automated scanning or manual review for known vulnerabilities, active malware, or other content known to violate our Terms of Service> - to assist the repository owner with a support matter> - to maintain the integrity of the Services, or> - to comply with our legal obligations if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law.> GitHub will provide you with notice regarding private repository access unless doing so is prohibited by law or if GitHub acted in response to a security threat or other risk to security.And there's no mention anywhere else in the privacy statement about them training Copilot on your private repositories. So unless you believe one of the most valuable companies in the world (Microsoft) is outright lying in their privacy statement, then you can not worry about this possibility.Legal policies can't play games like assuming everyone knows Copilot training on private data is part of \"the integrity of the Services\" - they have to be explicit.If you think they are outright lying or twisting words, then I guess you should immediately stop using any Microsoft products, and consider any information you've ever entered to be public.Similarly, GitHub once mentioned that \"no human eyes\" will ever see the code from your private repositories. A lot of people immediately assumed this means that they are obviously training Copilot on your private data (not human eyes). But again, it's not worth the risk to a company as valuable as Microsoft to play these kinds of games. Your private repositories are reviewed by some kind of machine, because that's how GitHub indexes your repositories for you! That way you can search for keywords and symbols, and so on. How else would they do that?Ultimately: your code isn't worth the risk to Microsoft. There are already hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of public repositories for them to use.",

I don't want to say things aren't bad - they are - but things are **always** bad in one way or another. Tech-related jobs have been in constant flux for at least decades, Your aim should be to make yourself as employable as possible **even as** the world changes around you, which it will continue to do. The best way to do that is to avoid jumping on bandwagons and to learn the solid skills necessary to adapt. You are already doing that with your engineering degree.>Should I start learning Python just to keep up with everyone?You should start learning Python if you're interested in it, and not if you're not. Python is a great tool. But also, not everyone will be a Python dev in the future, and **not** learning Python frees up valuable time for you to do something else. (You can also learn Python later if you want to. What's stopping you picking it up at age 50 if you need to?)>Any advice or roadmap would mean a lot right now.My advice is: everyone's roadmap looks different. Yes, you should work hard - but whether that means \"get a paid job\" or \"aim to get a high grade\" or \"learn Python\" or \"learn French\" or \"brush up on your maths\" or \"do some volunteering\" or \"learn interview skills\" or one of a million other things depends on you. All of those things are good, and different employers will value different skills, and no one person can do them all.You also shouldn't forget about the rest of your life - family, friends, relationships, hobbies, rest, eating well, sleeping well, etc. No point in being the most skilled engineer in your company if you burn out at age 30, or have a heart attack at 40, or regret not starting a family at 50, or whatever.It's a lot to juggle.

One project which I still don't know after like 20 years how I was able to pull of was a keylogger on Windows.

Instead you should focus on making sure you have the foundation to learn the ***engineering*** ahead of you. You are an engineer, not a programmer. Most practicing engineers I know know practically nothing about programming and the older one can barely use a computer properly. In fact, the older ones have already forgotten calculus --- they still remember the jargon like ODE but they could care less. Here is the thing about the universities these days. They have to have a schedule so they can keep charging you or your government for money. I am not against a liberal education, I think it is great, but I do not believe in taking people's education hostage to make a dollar. In fact, you as an engineer have no reason to learn programming at all, unless you find it fun and want to learn it. And, if you do need it, you can learn it on the job or right before interviews, or just fake it. Trust me engineering firms do not care, they only care that you understand engineering principles, that you have developed your gut feeling through apprenticeship at various firms. Even if you don't become an engineer, there is still no reason to do programming because engineering is where the work will be at in the future, not programming. Programming is technically dead at this point. It will be back just not in its current form. As long as you have a good understanding of the engineering principles and practices, you can carry that knowledge into any field and use that unique perspective to solve things that only you can solve with your own perspective.",

That said, it's a good language to learn if game design is your ultimate goal.As for tips:- Don't use AI.- If you use AI anyway, don't ask it to generate code and paste it in without understanding what it does.- Don't be afraid to make mistakes. Just try things.- I wouldn't jump straight into game dev. Try to get a basic understanding of the language with console apps or Windows Forms first.C# is a \"typed\" programming language. Every variable you define has a \"type.\" IE: ints are numbers, strings are text, chars are letters. You can use or define more complex types. For example, you could have a variable called \"player\" with a complex structure to represent the player's position, velocity, health, etc.C# is a \"managed\" programming language.

It can be assigned or unassigned, but it's perfectly well defined - it's really just a number anyway.- Unicode in itself has no \"byte\" range. The encoding UTF-8 has variable lengths, and some of them are 4 byte long.- Unicode is much, _MUCH_ more than just the assigned characters. For each character you also must support all the properties, case foldings, categories, NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD, different collations, sortings, glyphs etc.. Range checks on the codepoints alone are almost always wrong.All of the languages with support I know of just implement the actual algorithms and then import the lists from the Unicode standard verbatim each time they do an update to not have to deal with this particular headache.Edit: In case you don't know it, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6162484/why-does-modern-perl-avoid-utf-8-by-default/6163129#6163129)'s an old rant about Unicode support in Perl back in 2011 when most browsers couldn't even properly render the rant, including a lot of gotchas.",

And a block always start at a number divisible by 16, meaning that the last hex-digit is 0. So if a block doesn't have a multiple of 16 characters, there will be some empty spaces. Often there's a system within a block of some sort, so that characters either match between lower and upper case, having the same number of codes between them, or so that variations of a character have numbers close together, and if one character has 8 different variations, and another only 7, then the eightth character might be left empty (or \"reserved\" to allow for the system to make sense.I have no idea about the specific ethiopic characters, it could also be that there were some characters that weren't added, because there were \"controversies\" in how they should be interpreted, and rather than wait forever, they just added all the characters around them.Remember that unicode is a living standard, and new characters are added all the time, sometimes in existing code-blocks, sometimes entirely new blocks.It would be a terrible mess if they just started at 0x0000, and added a new character to the end of the list everytime they encountered one!",

The first, at U+1E7E7 is in keeping with the Ethiopic encoding principle in the Unicode Standard whereby eight positions are allocated per syllabic family. Most, but not all, syllabic families will have a member occupying the eighth position. Past experience found that the eight position may later be populated when a corresponding syllable is found in a language when it begins using Ethiopic script for its orthography. Accordingly, U+1E7E7 may later be populated with a HHYWA or HHYOA syllable if its availability is later found to be required by another language. The remaining unassigned positions, U+1E7EC, U+1E7EF, and U+1E7FF have correspondence with syllables still in use from the prior orthography that might have otherwise occupied these syllabic and code positions (U+1380, U+1383, and U+138F accordingly).",

This is an important rule because you don't want the code point U+0045 to mean the letter E in Unicode Version 3, but the letter W in Unicode Version 4. Code point reassignments would invalidate all earlier documents.If you accept this rule, then the following three desirable properties are incompatible:1. Related code points are grouped together in sets.2. Sets can gain characters in future versions.3. All assigned code points are contiguous beginning at 0.If you break rule 1, then you lose sets.If you break rule 2, then it means that if you need to add a related code point, you have to start a new set (which will probably have just that one code point in it). This basically makes sets pointlessSets are useful because they let you check things like \"Does this code point require a font that supports Cyrillic?\" more conveniently, as well as allowing those checks to continue working even when a new version of Unicode is released. Any new Cyrillic characters will take a previously-unassigned spot in a Cyrillic set. You need to update your code only if a new relevant set is defined, like \"Cyrillic Extended-B\".Sets are also useful for parallel development. If Team A is working on a new Cyrillic character, and Team 1 is working on a new Ethiopian character, they can each choose an unassigned code point from their respective sets and start writing documents with it to see how well it works. If you didn't have sets, then maybe Team A gets unofficial number N and Team 1 gets unofficial number N+1. But Team 1 gets their code point approved first, so now they have official number N, and this disrupts both Team A and Team 1 as they both have to go back and re-encode all their documents. (And we don't like re-encoding documents. See first paragraph.)Rule 3 isn't important. You shouldn't be rejecting unassigned code points anyway (except perhaps for those marked as \"permanently unassigned\"). The Unicode Standard has recommendations for [Unassigned Characters](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L1999/99191.htm), namely, to treat them as generic characters with default properties. This allows your code to continue working when previously-unassigned code points become assigned.So the question is based on a false assumption: That it's important to be able to reject unassigned code points.You don't want your program to reject a person's name because it uses a newly-assigned CJK character, or to reject a product description because it uses the newly-assigned Rupee symbol *₹*.",

Moreover, If you don't use something, you'll forget it because your brain trims it out. When the time comes for you to use a concept you can simply read up on it to refresh your memory and use what you need. You say you hit a plateau doing LeetCode questions which is definitely to be expected, learning is a bell curve and as difficulty increases the rate at which you progress decreases. This is a good sign that you're at the end of that bell curve, and that you should keep at it even if progress feels minimal.

Find a process that works for you and hammer it in with repetition. This way, when time comes for you to perform it's automatic and requires little thought. Second, create a cheat sheet for you to easily reference hard to remember concepts. I would suggest you physically create this sheet to help solidify terms and concepts and/or but it in a spreadsheet for quick referencing. Once you feel you have a concept, command, and/or process down, remove or archive. Third, pace yourself. This is your race. Your race is different from mine and everyone else's. Comparison is a thief of joy. You should be disciplined and motivated in your race to reach your goals, but don't compare my race to yours. I may have jet boots compared to your flip flops , but I may have a lead backpack on while you're wearing a linen shirt. Finally, be honest with yourself. Our profession isn't for everyone. This portion of our profession may not be for you. And that's alright. Find what works for you. Also just because it's difficult doesn't mean it's not for you.

Now, it depends greatly on what your project is, but in a typical project there's just a few scenarios where you'd use recursion. The fundamental one is when you're working with a hierarchical data, especially with arbitrary number of levels (so a tree topography basically). This can happen with stuff like tables (where row can have sub-rows) or file system.I would personally try implementing a flattening function (i.e. turning a list structure where there's a few top level elements to begin with, but each can have some children, of which each can have some children..) and the output should be a flat list of elements (flat list of all parents and all children, of all levels). When you're done you can move on and you'll probably forget about recursion for a long time. Also, keep in mind that most conventional (i.e. not purely functional, like Haskell) languages are not necessarily built to deal with recursion natively, and using recursion can cause stack overflow (due to every call being put on stack, instead of simplified/ignored, like a language natively supporting tail-call recursion would). In short, you generally don't use recursion unless you have a very good reason to, and you usually don't.",

Also, when you start applying, do as much digging as possible before interviews—dig up old interview reviews, check out \"prepare.sh\" or leetcode.Full disclosure, I’m a contributor at prepare.sh now, but I used it as a regular user for my own prep long before that, and the questions were spot on for the roles I was targeting.

And if its the latter, consider thinking about what are you really curious and passionate about. I spent 7 years studying law and 6 years working with it. It's always been easy for me, I got highest grades in school just by reading a paper 30 minutes before I needed to talk about. Never had my notes with me, it was laying clear in my head, always ready. But law is something you need to be passionate about, always digging and thinking about it, even at home. I on the other hand spent 6 years clocking out at 6pm and it left my brain until the next morning. Everyone thought I was a beast, always coming to me for the advice. I did in couple hours something that other's struggled with for several days. Everyone said I was soon to be a big deal. I was bored out of my mind. And when the opportunity presented itself, I left everything and never looked back. Because the thought about changing career was far less scary than the thought that I have to do this for the rest of my life. Now I'm getting ready for my first job in tech. People telling me I'm pretty good too. Because you can get good at anything if you put your mind to it. But this time I'm actually curious and digging. And never bored.",

I don't have a desire to learn something without a purpose. If I am not going to use it, it's likely that it won't be a good use of time as the knowledge will likely erode over time unless it's used.So I guess I would say that if you're looking to expand your knowledge, put yourself in a position where you need to learn something to do your job if that's your goal. That being said, if you're happy being very efficient at your job even if you're not growing your knowledge then that's ok too. It depends where your job is in your list of priorities. If you go this route though, you might want to occasionally, learn something new to see whether you're still capable of learning something pretty easily.",

Add a RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) into the mix, start with SQLite and maybe later extend to MySQL/MariaDB or to PostgreSQL and you're good to go.Currently, *Humble Bundle* has a great book bundle on SQL from O'Reilly - a well respected publisher in the domain. Highly recommend that you get it if you can afford it. Also, there is a great course bundle from Zenva currently available that goes in exactly your direction as well. Zenva offers very good courses.For web dev, the usual recommendations are [*Free Code Camp*](https://freecodecamp.org) and [*The Odin Project*](https://theodinproject.com) - both are free.",

I'm selling it for low prices, and if you are interested (I am a teen web dev and could use any support I can get to improve my courses), I would really appreciate it. Don't feel pressured, I can't tell you what to do, but I just recommend my course if you want to learn JavaScript anywhere, from basic console.log() to classes and data structures.

Etc.) and the token stored with the session data is used during the web session to call APIs or connect to data stores, etc. For SPA or single page applications, a short lived sometimes single use external access token (EAT) may be issued, often derived from the login token, that allows very limited API access through a gateway that does not live on the web servers, but is accessible within the website domain. Can the login token simply be handled by the SPA ? Sure, but often an SPA is hosted within a larger site that already has dynamic content and session management. To your question, The cookie or token is returned to the calling client as the response to the authentication attempt. A server does not \"imitate\" a return message.",

It's 10 contexts either way.This does get messier with things like quic & http2 that pipeline requests within a single connection, but the mechanism that unwraps that pipeline should still split them into individual requests.The easiest way to see this is that whether by auth, cookie, header, etc, you still have to authenticate every request - every context needs to be authenticated. The previous request being authenticated means nothing because that was a previous context.",

This is quite easy to hit, even if you don't have many concurrent users. Fortunately, this is easy to test as well — just make a test script to write recipes to the database, and then use your website — see if there any issues when pulling out a specific recipe, or searching through recipes.The next \"10k\" limit you'll reach is 10k regular users. This is not too difficult; any scalable, modern, hosting provider — like Vercel — should be able to handle this with no issues. You'll simply want to check that you can afford whatever they are going to charge you, so this simply involves being familiar with their pricing structure.Finally, we come to what you said — \"10k concurrent users\". This is a *really* rare situation — this is going to be getting close to a really popular website on the Internet. At this point, there's no guidebook on a guaranteed, step-by-step way to handle this. You'll need to have a lot of logging in place, so that you have visibility into load times, and exactly *where* are the slowdowns. Once you know that, you can start figuring out solutions to speed up those specific slowdowns. However, it's important that you know *where* the slowdowns are first, because it's a bit waste of time to optimize something, only to find out that that wasn't the true slowdown.To test this, you can use one of the many load-testing software tools out there, once you have appropriate logging in place.",

You say you want to avoid scratch, but note that the first week of cs50 is a gentle intro via scratch. Scratch is great for beginners though if he hasn't had any experience. I've introduced a 10 year old to scratch and it's pretty phenomenal to see them get their head around basic programming concepts and talk about them without necessarily having to take on a text based syntax. It's excellent preparation for taking on that text based language because you already understand how things work conceptually, learning your first text language is just adapting the concepts you know to new syntax.",

For those who may not know, it's like highlighting a column in a spreadsheet, but for text. Imagine you've copied some data from a log file where a timestamp begins each line, and you want to delete just the timestamps. Hold down Alt (in many Windows apps) and click and drag to select the timestamps only. Now you can just hit delete and it's done. I've also used it to add a comma after each column name in a long list before copying back to SSMS or whatever. Sure beats the comma key - down arrow key - repeat 30 times method.",

If so, maybe you want to clean it up some in order to make life easier for future you. Or, and I’d go this route, when future you has to make changes, refactor it then and make that time part of your estimate. Don’t work for free.

A TTF contains curves representing the *outlines* of characters, [like in this example.](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/101761/the-description-and-interpretations-of-truetype-font-points-and-curves) If you click that link and look at the diagram of a lowercase letter `a`, you'll see that it consists of two closed curves: one defining the outer boundary of the letter, and another one for the \"hole\" inside the loop. There's no straightforward correspondence between those outlines and the pen strokes a human might use to draw a letter that looks similar. (For instance, a lowercase `t` consists of a single outline but would be drawn with two strokes. A capital `H` has one outline and is drawn with three strokes. An `O` has two outlines, and is drawn with only one stroke.)For the kanji diagrams you're talking about, somebody had to manually draw each character's strokes in a vector graphics program. This data was released for free by the [KanjiVG project](https://kanji.sljfaq.org/kanjivg.html) and now lots of other websites and apps use it.A bit of googling turned up [this project](https://github.com/brownvc/decoupled-style-descriptors) for the Latin alphabet. It includes a dataset with letter strokes from a bunch of actual people's handwriting, plus a data-driven algorithm to generate new variants by interpolating between them. You might find it useful as a starting point.Once you have the strokes, animating them is fairly straightforward e.g. by varying the SVG `stroke-dasharray` and `stroke-dashoffset` properties over time.P.S. In principle, you could imagine using various computational geometry algorithms to extract the [\"skeleton\"](https://scikit-image.org/docs/0.25.x/auto_examples/edges/plot_skeleton.html) of a letter in a TTF font, and then try to reconstruct a set of strokes from that. But getting something that works reliably and gives good-quality results would likely be a very challenging project, IMO. Certainly much more difficult and time-consuming than just redrawing the letters by hand.",

You'd then animate the percentage from 0->100%.You didn't mention what platform you're on, but on web Snap.svg has the `getSubpath()` method which can perform that operation, and on native, Skia has the `SkTrimPathEffect` API that can do the same. There are likely other libraries out there that have an implementation of a similar API.If you're interested in how this works, typically the input Bezier spline is chopped up into a bunch of tiny linear segments, which have very simple closed-form length and interpolation computations. To get the overall length of the spline, sum the length of the tiny linear segments. To get a % length of the spline, grab all the tiny linear segments up to that % of length.",

That's why courses like Odin Project are crucial, it should be one of the first things they teach you.There is the front end code - the HTML, CSS and JavaScript that gets sent to and parsed by the user's web browser.Then there's the back end code - the Python, C#, PHP, or whatever language you like running on a web server, that takes a browser's HTTP request, does stuff, then sends a response back to the browser (usually in the form of a web page or some dynamic data to render).You can't run Python code directly in a web browser, they don't understand it.GitHub Pages is designed for hosting documentation for your GitHub projects, as such it has limited capabilities. There is obviously a web server involved, but it only serves front end code (aka static content), it can't run custom Python code or a database or anything like that.Instead what you need is a web server that supports Python code. Probably using a Python-based web framework like Django. Or at least something that can run Python via CGI, a protocol that allows standard web servers like Apache or Nginx to call external runtimes. Very few companies are giving this kind of functionality away for free, it costs real money to maintain the infrastructure. You can run a web server from your own machine, but that has its own caveats.",

Sure the capabilities you have will land you the job. But once you have the job, use everything at your disposal to own some serious projects at the company. Make it so those projects practically rely on you for development and would cost to bring anyone to replace you. This gives you leverage and the ability to negotiate your salary to what you need.Now in terms of either learning MERN or data science or AI/ML, do all three. MERN gives you the ability to create apps. Data science gives you the ability to analyse and use large quantities of data. ML/AI gives you the ability to create more autonomous applications. You can combine all three and having all three gives you more leverage and flexibility when you want to land jobs.I speak from experience, I did an AI and robotics degree at uni. I’ve done ML and worked with current LLMs. While doing my degree I learnt the MERN stack. However my current job is a senior full stack software engineer where I use primarily next.js with sql and other tech stacks. But it can shift from different languages like Python some times too for data analysis etc.I mainly learn the MERN stack from Brad Traversy on YouTube he has great free tutorials.I believe everyone in the tech world should have at least one front-end and back-end tech they’re comfortable with so they can build stuff quickly and MERN can be the one for you. Don’t limit yourself to one stack though. Try to learn the basics for a few others so you know what you like best. For example Angular, Vue, etc.(My bias is for react and next.js though :squinting_face_with_tongue:)",

It's a bit of a complex topic, so I'd suggest watching a YouTube video about it, but here's a short explanation:Imagine you have a library of books. You could store those books in a `list`. If you store those books in a list, though, you have to check every single book to see if you have `Harry Potter` in your collection. Instead, you can put those books in a `set`. Books in a set are stored in piles. Each pile contains all the books starting with the same first two letters. So, to check if you have `Harry Potter`, you go directly to the `Ha` section. You don't have to go through the entire library.Now, let's say you only want one copy of each book, and you are given another copy of `Harry Potter`. You go to the `Ha` section and check for `Harry Potter`, if it is there, you just toss your new copy. If not, you add that copy to the `Ha` section.",

As an example, take a string \"Hello world\", which you want to add to the set. We call hash(\"Hello World\") and it returns the hash for that string (lets just say it is number like 66457). Then, we use that hash to determine the index the string belongs in, in the list. An easy way to do this for this example is to use the modulo operator. So say, our set implementation has 10 \"buckets\" (each bucket is an element in the underlying list), we can do 66457 % 10 = 7 so we place the string \"Hello world\" in index 7 of the underlying list(i.e. we place it in bucket 7).The core idea here is that we never had to iterate through the list of buckets, we derived the index from the value \"Hello world\" itself. We dont have to look at any index other than index 7 for duplicates because (assuming our hash function is deterministic), \"Hello world\" *always* maps to index 7.However, there is a problem. Say there are 10 buckets, but we input 20 elements. Since there are more elements than there are buckets, its inevitable that some buckets will have multiple elements in them. Because of this, it is actually true that we have to do some iteration to find duplicates. If there are multiple elements in bucket 7, then we have to search the bucket to check if \"Hello world\" already exists. I'm not completely sure datastructure python uses to represent buckets though, if its lists then yeah there would be iteration but technically it could be any data structure.",

        "body": "Others have answered the question of *approximately* how Python's sets are implemented using hash tables, as a high-level overview.If you want to see how they are *exactly* implemented, the source code is all there for you to read, but it's in C rather than Python.When you call `set.add()` in Python, the corresponding chain of C functions is [`set_add`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/clinic/setobject.c.h#L435-L445) → [`set_add_impl`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L2144-L2151) → [`set_add_key`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L365-L373) → [`set_add_entry`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L122-L208). And `set_add_entry` is where the actual work happens to find the object's slot in the hash table and insert it. Python's hash tables use [open addressing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_addressing), so the function needs to try multiple slots until it finds either an empty one or an existing object that's equal to the one being inserted. Sets are fast because on average, this loop will terminate after a small number of iterations, *if* the hash function gives random-looking output *and* the fraction of occupied slots in the table is not too large. In order to make sure that second condition holds, the code calls [`set_table_resize`](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/v3.13.5/Objects/setobject.c#L253-L330) to rebuild the table with a larger number of slots whenever the table gets too full.",

I have a hash function that reads each byte in a value as an integer, adds them together, and then performs % 100 on that value (the remainder after dividing by 100. We'll say that this evenly distributes values across 100 possible output values. Then I have a contiguous array of 100 pointers. The result of hashing a value tells me what index that pointer is, and since I know where the array is in memory, that means the hash function tells me the exact memory address of the pointer. The pointer takes me to another memory address for a list of values. It's a list here in case I have collisions - multiple things hashing to the same value. I can reduce this by having more \"slots\" by, like, doing % 500, or % 1000, but that would be overkill if my set was only to hold 5 things. Or even 100. The chance that after I hash I need to loop through 3 values that hashed to that value isn't worth overallocating.So in a set, every value has a specific place where it belongs. It's like looking for Harry Potter in a library, where one shelf is labeled \"HA\". Even if Harry Potter was the only book there, it would be on that shelf.",

        "body": "First off, it's good that you are even interested ahead of time. You don't typically need to prepare much for college courses ahead of time, but if your goal is to become a programmer then it could be time well spent.I would simple start dabbling with Java a bit on your own. Lots of ways to do that.Try to find out which editor will be used in your course, and then learn how to set up a barebones project.A few things to poke around with:* Find cheat sheets for Java, and the editor. Sometimes these are useful just to focus your attention on some useful subset of those things.* Learn how to create and run a barebones project (often IDEs will have templates for this, e.g. File -> New Project > Application, or something to that effect).* Learn how to print arbitrary things to the console.* Learn about the fundamental data types. * Learn what the major options are, learn a bit about the nuances between integers and floating-point values and what the limitations are in a computer and why. (Other courses will likely cover this in greater detail, so don't get too stuck here if it's confusing at first). * Learn about `null` in Java, and its utility, risks, etc. * Learn about boxed vs unboxed types. (boxed types can be null, unboxed cannot, which can create issues that are good to know about sooner than later). * Learn how variables work, and how the values are passed around. Fundamentally all variables are copying something, but what's being copied varies based on whether you're dealing with an object or not - so as a newbie programmer you need to come to grips with this so you align your expectations, especially when you start using functions.* Learn how to use a debugger in your IDE. * This is probably my biggest tip for any programming-heavy courses. Knowing how to use the debugger will be extremely useful. It lets you stop the execution of the program at a specific line, and gives you a birds eye view of all the data that's in scope at that location, as well as the \"call stack\" (and variables in scope at those locations). Being able to see the call stack and the data in scope is your way to see a good slice of what's going on at a moment. * Another tip here would be if you have code that's doing a lot of work, or perhaps once you get to recursion, you don't necessarily need to have a specific line of code in mind, you could also simply hit \"pause\" to see where the program is at that moment that you hit pause. Sometimes this comes in handy to diagnose why something is slow. I recently used this at work to quickly diagnose a source of slowness - I reached the point in the program where there was some sluggishness, I hit pause, I looked at the call stack which gave me the first clues, and then I looked at the data in scope which explained everything. * Saves you from wildly guessing about what code changes to make when things go wrong. New programmers in college will often save assignments until the night before, and then end up pulling all-nighters because they needed more time and they run into bugs along the way and try to make changes slowly through trial and error. Using a debugger will shave off many _hours_ from those sessions of work out why something is not working.* Learn how to use assertions, and how to write code with good \"functional cohesion\". This doesn't mean using functional languages necessarily * Programming is fundamentally about \"execution\" and functions are the units of execution. So it makes sense to write code where you have really simple, crisp, easy-to-understand functions that don't try to take on too many responsibilities. * Write testable functions. A little tip is to just slap \"assertions\" at the beginning of your `main` function. That's a poor man's test suite, and a huge boon to you as a student. Have your code assert that the outputs of those functions are correct, given certain inputs. This alone will prevent you so many headaches when doing your programming projects. It will prevent a lot of instances of even needing to use the debugger, letting the debugger come in only when needed. Where people often hit walls as students is having to untangle their own mess, so the idea is that assertions on functions will be your early warning system for problems that show up as soon as you modify your code in a bad way. Lots of projects or homework will have you start coding something simple, and then ask you to make certain changes that complicate your code. Those changes can be a source of headaches for new programmers because you don't have enough hard-won foresight yet.* Knowing how to use the debugger and how to write simple assertions will supercharge you in programming classes and you will run circles around the other students who don't know those concepts. It's a very practical thing that, at least when I was in school, wasn't taught until certain courses, or was very easy for students to overlook because it's easy to get overconfident and think you don't need those things.* Use an LLM _wisely_ as a guide tailored to your exact situation. Be a proactive student here, be an \"active learner\", get the LLM to teach you, not just dump whole solutions onto you. * Another smart thing here is using the LLM to guide you through things that don't matter quite as much and that you'd have to look up anyway. For example, there's no way you'd know or easily figure out certain Java APIs. Maybe there's utility in trying to figure some of that out yourself, in terms of the ability to read docs, e.g. reading through the list of functions available and their params, but the fact is a lot of APIs are the result of someone making arbitrary naming choices.",

Whether or not you pass the object (or a pointer/ref to it) down multiple layers of the call stack isn't too relevant here I'd say, same pattern.

Even a big successful private company either won't offer you any stock or the stock will be worthless without some kind of exit event that lets you cash out your options.Even for big public companies outside of FAANG, you're not likely to get much stock:[https://www.levels.fyi/companies/capital-one/salaries/software-engineer/levels/software-eng](https://www.levels.fyi/companies/capital-one/salaries/software-engineer/levels/software-eng)Capital One: $150k for mid level[https://www.levels.fyi/companies/walmart/salaries/software-engineer/levels/l2](https://www.levels.fyi/companies/walmart/salaries/software-engineer/levels/l2)Walmart: $112k for L2One of those is going to be closer to the average salary for a developer with 2 years of experience in the US. Out of the millions of developers in the US, most of them do not work for FAANGs.Landing a job at a FAANG has always been very competitive and requires specific interviewing skills, in this market it is even more competitive. About 40k software engineers work at Meta across all levels and the company makes about $150 billion a year in revenue, so they can afford to pay their developers a lot.",

And then you’re looking at candidates working at some of the most profitable companies in the world. To get into these companies they’re doing 5-6 rounds of intense interviewing. To even get their resume looked at they are competing with thousands of other candidates many of whom are also from other FAANGS and top tier colleges.In America we can be fired for no reason at all without warning, so our salaries have to compensate for our potentially long and unexpected job searches. South America appears to have considerably more protections here.You also likely have public healthcare, low cost education, and/or pension plans, none of which we have (we have social security but it’s only for folks who worked and every election there’s talk of getting rid of it). So our salaries have to offset that and other basic social services that we lack. The market is horrible right now. Getting interviewed at one of these jobs without connections or a top tier degree is basically impossible. Partially because there are not nearly as many openings now as there used to be, partially because these jobs have always been somewhat like that. Even if you got the interview you’d need near perfect performance to pass as employment shortages mean they can be pickier. And after all of that most of the FAANG companies will be looking to heavily overwork you and then push you out or PIP you within under 3 years. I worked at Amazon, happens all the time.",

        "body": "> petroleum, agricultural, metallurgical all have less than 500~ graduates per year, each.> but you'll have a great job and consistent demand.Petroleum Engineering is **THE quintessential example** of a boom or bust engineering discipline that has had WILD swings in enrollment.https://jpt.spe.org/us-petroleum-engineering-graduation-rates-keep-falling-but-oil-execs-are-not-complaining-yetI throw up petroleum engineering for the /r/cscareerquestions machine all the time as the cautionary tale for their discipline, and it falls on deaf ears every single time. Including here. **This sub has learned nothing from history.**When oil prices are high relative to extraction costs for extended periods of time, petroleum engineering ranks SWELL. When prices sit at commodity levels above extraction costs, petroleum engineering ranks dwindle fast within 2 years. The median petroleum engineering graduate becomes UNEMPLOYED.In the boom times in the 21st century, petroleum engineering grads were walking out of school to 20 offers in the 195k-225k range with a large bonus potential. They'd go bust their ass many many hours a week out in some rustic environment somewhere. There was all kinds of \"what should I specialize in\" conversations like should I do wireline, or logging, or MWD, or be reservoir side, or whatever.And then POOF. Prices fall... extraction costs rise, and that project you were paying the PE 225k to babysit no longer makes money and STOPS. STOPS.Petroleum engineering had 2600 +/- BS grads (and don't forget several hundred MS students too) in 2017. Less than 600 now, and what looks to be about 600 in 2024. 7 years to fall. Using the broad numbers you posted, this is like the 100,000 CS grads in 2025 becoming 23,000 by 2032.**Does this REALLY make petroleum engineering look attractive to you?** A major that's seen 80% drop in enrollment in 7 years because the industry cannot support its graduates?> With the massive datacenter boom, this is pretty hot right now.Datacenters employ so few people once built; you can build 100 more of them, and they're still a minor player. Design of datacenters is mostly electrical, mechanical, and structural engineering, there might be ONE or TWO IE on a major datacenter design project. Hell there's going to be more architects than IE's. If you want to WORK in a datacenter, good luck. If you want to DESIGN datacenters, electrical, mechanical, or structural. I literally work for a company that does MANY data centers for companies we've all heard of, and I am a chemical engineer. I LITERALLY WORK HERE, and for $1,000,000 I couldn't get on a data center project. Mechanical, electrical, structural, and architects, or GTFO.> These engineering fields: Nuclear, naval...GAH... horrible. Do not study nuclear engineering. You do NOT do what you think you do. The nuclear side of the nuclear world is a solved issue and even a large new nuke plant requires very few nuclear engineers. I do firmly feel that there will be a nuclear renaissance in this country as people figure out that nuclear power is safe and can help with a lot of power issues in this countries, I am very excited for this, and actually personally would love to get in on the action given I live close to one of the major SMR players main office.HOWEVER, in a new nuke plant... the majority of engineering design hours will be spent by mechanical engineers, structural engineers (which come out of civil), electrical engineers. If you want to work in that industry, THOSE are target paths.",

        "body": "I have worked at Microsoft for around 20 years. I have one child because of the hell i went though, and honestly, the career tradeoffs I made to get here were massive. I got into computers in the 80s and 90s because I loved tech. It wasn’t for money. It was about building real things. My first job I made very little with a master degree, and houses were 700k in my market so what choice did i haveToday, it feels like that’s mostly gone. The environment is toxic. Long hours. Metrics over mission. Leadership focused on checkins and politics. AI is treated as a silver bullet, but it can’t support production systems, do system-level architecture, or even explain tradeoffs. Meanwhile, junior devs are skipping fundamentals.The deeper issue is consolidation. I’ve been saying since 2010 that tech consolidation is killing innovation. Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia — they’ve absorbed everything. These companies hire away the best talent, buy or kill their competitors, and dominate infrastructure, tooling, ads, and now AI.And it’s not just technical. These same firms dominate lobbying. They block regulation, slow down privacy reform, and sideline competition. The result is fewer paths for meaningful work, less room for diverse ideas, and an industry stuck in its own gravity.If you are early in your career, ask yourself — what are you building? What will still matter in 10 years? What kind of work do you want to look back on? I’m almost 50 and only now able to pivot toward something more meaningful. Not everyone gets that chance.Big Tech is locked in a late-stage consolidation loop. The real risk isn’t that AI will take our jobs — it’s that these companies already own everything that matters.I recently spoke to an intern that quit biotech to come to microsoft because of the money. Bio tech was too long of an education for a small payoff. I did the same thing i told him decades ago (ironically it was machine learning at the time for me). Examples of consolidationMicrosoft buried Netscape in the 1990s and early 2000s. They bundled Internet Explorer with Windows and effectively crushed Netscape. The DOJ sued Microsoft for antitrust violations.Google crushed the independent web between the 2000s and 2020s. They bought DoubleClick YouTube and Android. Promoted Chrome through their services. Changed SEO and AMP to shift power away from independent websites.Amazon destroyed retail margins between the 2010s and 2020s. They used AWS profits to subsidize logistics. Cloned successful sellers. Took over cloud pricing and APIs.Facebook bought Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014. These were classic defensive acquisitions bought to prevent competition.Apple locked down iOS during the 2010s and 2020s. The App Store became a monopoly channel. A thirty percent fee was enforced. Alternative payments were blocked. Global antitrust cases are still happening.Microsoft acquired GitHub in 2018. They took over a neutral developer platform and deeply integrated it into VS Code Copilot and Azure. This ties directly to the subject here. Google Meta and Amazon now dominate digital ads. They control over seventy percent of US ad revenue. Independent publishers lost funding. This led to lawsuits and legislation.In the 2020s the AI land grab began. Microsoft gained exclusive rights to OpenAI. Google folded DeepMind into its core cloud and search. Meta released controlled open models. Open labs cannot compete on compute or data.Regulatory capture and lobbying is widespread. These firms lead global lobbying budgets. Amazon and Google each spend around 20 million dollars per year in the US. They consistently resist antitrust data privacy and right to repair efforts.These companies buy all the AI tech. Absorb the talent. Fold it into their own platforms. The same thing happened with general tech talent. They inflated salaries and pushed smaller companies to the margins. This is not just a tech problem. Comcast charging for Netflix access is the same idea. This is why we had to fight for net neutrality.At some point hyperscalers need regulation. I am not anti capitalist. I believe in markets. But capitalism only works when it is balanced. Capital should flow to where it creates value. When one player has too much it is like poker. They just buy every pot.",

California public schools ( I think it was the state university system) Paid by taxpayers, replacing American workers with non-American workers and rigging the system so that the American Taxpayers money wasn't given to American workers, in spite of some rules/laws that they were supposed to.I remember the Disney one went before the US House and they told about how their lives were turned upside down.Make no mistake about life: YOU ARE A TARGET.

AI: You are absolutely right, putting your dick inside a mixer will not work. The reason why is because bacteria are very small for it to have any effect. Instead what you have to do is to set your dick on fire, that will killl all the germs, first of all, get a gallon of gasoline... Me: Wait, but what if I just wash it with water, could that also work? AI: You have nailed it! Now you are getting into the intrincacies of dick cleanlines. In order to get your dick clean you need to get some water. The first step is to go to the nearest river and get your dick out Me: What about using the faucet's water? AI: You are absolutely right again! The faucet's water is all you need for dick cleaning purposes. On and on for 7 hours.

Can't read API docs. Software engineering isn't just writing code, its about knowing your tools as well. The frustrating part with these new grads is that they blame everyone except themselves. Colleges are guilty of not properly teaching CS as well.",

I can confidently say that I know when you're cheating. Software Engineers are not Actors, and they ALWAYS make stupid mistakes in how they answer a question when they have the answer as opposed to when they're working it out. In cases where I can't, you probably didn't need the tool anyway because you would've got it eventually. It's also very telling because you don't see it in any other job role. I interviewed a set of executive assistant candidates for a GM, and even in role-skill exercises, the cadence of answer, the breaking down of a problem, all is very similar. If it's a SWE and they're cheating, they're getting it right immediately, are unable to describe a solution (and then immediately turn into a CS professor), or they can explain something perfect, but cannot tell you any other way to do it - even when another approach is taught hand-in-hand and is basically a pair with a given algorithm.You would be shocked at how common cheating is. I'd say maybe 5-10%, with more new grads cheating than experienced hires. I've even interviewed people that have so blatantly cheated that they've either quit an interview mid-way despite getting the answer \"right\", because they couldn't explain an if statement or why they've structured a for loop in a specific way (it's a for-each).",

People tend to overweight their recent experiences psychologically, and thus make broad generalizations about the future based on what's been happening in the last 2-3 years.In 2021, tech had basically been in a straight upward boom since the Great Recession, and most people in the field now entered during that boom. This means they have no memory of past bust cycles, and they're experiencing one for the first time now. Because they assumed the party would never end, they were extremely shocked in 2022 when the market suddenly reversed course and layoffs began.As for the people saying \"but this time is different because AI\", it's important to remember that \"this time is different\" every time. In the mid-2000s, people had a panic over offshoring destroying the American tech industry, a fear that clearly never materialized.

It honestly doesn't make much sense looking at the state of the tech market in general, there are other things in play - outsourcing, fictitious hype gravy trains, etc. Where every company was and should still be upkeeping their legacy systems, adding AI functionality, and the startup scene should be kicking full tilt (now more than ever). But it's not. The upper execs and boards are still increasing their take home and ownership at or above the same rate. It's really a tear in the system. Something is very wrong - and no I don't believe it was due to 'over hiring' during covid. It's probably more-so that they have been sitting and have so much pride in their infrastructure/office-space, their ping pong tables, etc. where those buildings were a massive shit investment (hence enforced RTO), where they were absolutely hemorrhaging money for years. They own other office spaces they were renting out to smaller companies - which if you drive around and peek at those alt-office spaces, they're still dormant. A lot of exuberant waste, where everyone could have been WFH the entire time (and likely more productive imo).",

For one, a lot of the core userbase of this sub come from tech hubs that have both the greatest abundance of jobs, the most investment into new tech startups, and are the most shielded from layoffs. Someone in SV will naturally have a more positive outlook than someone in Indiana or Slovakia.To build on the above, this sub falsely equivocates career success with being knowledgeable about the industry or even being a good developer, which is laughably untrue. This article is flawed, because contributions are more complicated than just commits, but it is true that something like [10% of developers contribute nothing](https://shiftmag.dev/ghost-engineers-stanford-study-4643/) (hint: they're on reddit instead, posting comments about how to get a job in the industry).As with all subreddits, this sub is a huge echo chamber, with people voting what they want to hear to the top. There are even periodic calls to ban or flair or otherwise discredit new grads or junior developers for being too pessimistic due to \"not having enough experience\", even though they are, by far, the largest part of the industry and the greatest indicator of it's health.Even today, anyone who dares complain about the state of the industry is often derided for being mediocre, told that \"there are no problem for goOd dEvelOpErs\" and fed other pointless misinformation. Most developers are somewhere around average. This average has risen a lot over the past ten years. If these people can't find jobs, the industry has a problem. It's really that simple. Tech isn't going to die as an industry, but macroeconomic trends mean that it's only going to become more competitive for developers.",

Blessing means you have a lot of people who like to reach out to you, you have become somewhat of a unofficial SME in whatever area they are asking about.I had this issue of just saying \"hey\".

I worked at a fast paced job and many seniors made it clear they would not repsond if you just said hey. If you were new theyd let it slide and tell you something like \"if you want a quicker response from me you should get in the habit of saying hi, but then also stating in your initial message your question.\". I knbew people who would not repsond at all if you kept with the \"hey\". To combat it or encourage people to say more they would always have the same status message that said something like \"For quicker responses please state in your initial response your question.\" or some would put a lighthearted message o rthey would link [https://nohello.net/en/](https://nohello.net/en/) on their status message.",

For example, for one role, it was supposed to be about modernizing COBOL code to Java, but I was interviewing for just the Java part. The recruiter said I wouldn’t have to worry about COBOL. Then I got into the interview and the hiring manager asked how I would interpret COBOL code if I needed to on the job. He also gave me a mini-system design exercise and asked if I would use a noSQL or SQL DB. But then he wanted me to drill down and give sample SQL queries. I don’t have any experience writing queries so I couldn’t answer that.I had another interview with a bank where the recruiter said it would be a call with the manager, and “maybe an engineer” would join, and it ended up being 2 engineers joining and doing a panel-style interview, which didn’t go well. Most recently, I had another interview interview for a test automation role, and I tried to ask the recruiter for more info about what the team did but she didn’t have any. I thought the role had to do with the tests that run in the CI/CD pipeline but it was a completely different world, I didn’t recognize any of the testing technologies the manager mentioned (because I never worked in testing) and it was awkward when he asked why I wanted to join that team when he hadn’t told me what the team did and neither did the recruiter.",

You network so over time, your \"brand\" (you, your work, etc) increases in value.Then later, when a company wants to fill a role, employees with connections will typically refer people from those connections first. This gives those candidates a significant advantage in the market.Networking also builds a repertoire of trust.It's much much easier to land remote jobs with a good network, since the gained trust can be converted in to more flexible working conditions (since companies will have an easier time trusting you to get your work done).",

Had to relocate (to a lovely area so there's at least that), and for a really junior leadership role but it's just getting back in into employment at this stage.My advice is that the big engineering corps are still hiring, just not the SW ones so much.Also, if you've used AI on your CV check it for the tell-tales as you will be getting pre-filtered, I ran mine through just to tune it, couldn't hurt right? Fecking thing replaced all the dashes with m-dashes, took me 9 months of ever decreasing volume before I realized, calls started coming in again with greater frequency after fixing that... Doh!Oh, and if you get an interview and are asked about AI don't be honest just lie like a champ and say it's the best thing since sliced bread, fantastic, able to deliver in minutes, blah, blah, everyone loves it, etc.",

        "body": "Agile.Edit: my answer sounds flippant so I’ll add a little context.I predate Agile by quite a number of years. Whatever process we used to use, you can call it Waterfall or something else, GANTT chart based projects… they had a very different progression.You’d have long periods in the beginning of a project where you’d read and write documentation, do planning, research, exploratory code. Then things would ramp up, and you’d start getting the real work done. Towards the end of the project, the deadline would loom, and the real problems would start to appear.You’d enter “crunch mode”, which truly sucked, deeply sucked horribly. This could go on for a month or two. Eventually you’d launch and settle back into the beginning phase of a new project. This was a HUGE relief. Then you’d do it all over again.Sounds bad? Well enter Agile which aimed to solve these problems, supposedly. How? By turning everything into a constant drip of 2 week sprints. Every sprint is a deadline. It’s all a micro version of the old way, you never get into the massive crunch time (maybe), instead you trade it for a constant, unrelenting stress. It never lets up, not for a second - and you spend your entire career this way.It’s far worse.",

How do you justify your level then? Especially when much of tech firms today are well matured from the past decade and half growth?And so many bull crap projects which you know is liability to the company but is done because of the latest fad like 'crypto' or 'AI' or what not.

Being close to promo at your current company usually means you are operating at L+1 though, which is why I think that’s ideal. I would only stay at Google if you see guaranteed promo toward L4 in next cycle, scope after that for L5, and strong support from your manager to get you on those projects.

They have people working with them that they get a cut off the work from those people. They all work overtime (50+ hrs), usually in unpleasant weather, because most customers procrastinate on repairs until it starts to hurt them. This pay level usually happens decade(s) into their careers when they know basically everything they need to and have connections with wholesalers and inspectors.This is all contingent on there actually being work in their area, which is not a given. SWEs can break 200k a few years into their career by taking 2 shitty contract jobs that pay $50/hr and being willing to work a few extra hours to do both. Most won't because it will suck. I guarantee it would suck less than waking up at 5am to drive across town to push gigantic cables through a conduit outside in 94° heat for 12+ hours.",

I literally wrote code snippets and notes for these contractors to read up and they still made the same bullshit mistakes over and over again. If you work in companies like this, it's every man for himself. Learning can always be done outside of work, better pay, etc can be chased outside of work. My mistake was giving a shit, falling for the bait and burning myself out. Don't make the same mistakes I did.",

At first I was being kind and tolerant, but these people are making mistakes that literally no one with actual development skill should make.I've had many of them replaced already, and 90% of them are the same. I ended up with two decent contractors which try to keep the others in line.Their boss has actually made attempts to hold them accountable, and things have slowly improved.Anyway, yes, try to push for better code if possible.

For now, I don’t see AI agents performing well with large and complex codebases or the economics of tokens/infra being sustainable, but the problem is that non technical stakeholders are the first to jump in to the possibility of reducing the technical workforce to save money. A few of them referred to data engineers as “code monkeys” that only push code. They clearly do not understand the roles of technical staff which is why agents are doomed to begin with. Unfortunately, us technical people are in their eyes a liability and not an asset. AI is not the problem, non technical management is",

Focus on foundational skills that AI can’t easily replace: strong cloud fundamentals (like GCP or AWS), designing robust data pipelines, and understanding data architecture at scale. If your org is drifting from technical depth, it might be a cultural issue more than a personal one. You're not behind just caught in a moment where leadership is reacting more than guiding.",

Many jobs do not require a specialized degree, just the fact that you have one gives you an advantage. Once you start your career, you’ll start building your network for real. You could meet the right person at the right time and have a foot in the door into a SWE role down the line.Besides, there’s no rule saying that you must work a fast food job until you land that dream job. You can start in something else and continue applying for SWE roles. Maybe you’ll end up doing something else you like more, shit i see SWEs on reddit all the time talking about how much they want to pivot to something else.In any case, this is the unfortunate reality for many, many recent grads; and for many more to come.

Our RTO policies changed and I started coming in every day and it made a huge difference. Beyond that, nothing helped more than becoming a subject matter expert. Try to find a niche that you can learn more about than anyone else. Is there a part of your job processes that feels like toil, or takes a long time, or nobody seems to fully understand? Spend some time trying to improve that thing. Research alternative tools, try to write documentation (the kind you wish were there for you right now), see if you can reverse engineer it.You will probably get stuck early on, or feel like you're missing some fundamentals, but that's okay. Ask questions when you can, and keep chipping away at it. Eventually, when you have something that you think is an improvement over what's there (probably won't be all that hard to get to that point to be honest) you can let it be known that you've created a new resource or process, and get some people to review it. Chances are good you'll end up being a go-to person for that thing in the future. You'll have very experienced devs coming to you for help/advice/best practices in that domain.From there you'll probably incidentally pick up a lot through the process. You'll recognize things in the codebase as being in some ways similar to the thing you took ownership of. You'll get a request to integrate your thing with some other unfamiliar thing, and then you repeat the process until you understand that thing really well too.Bit by bit, you'll start feeling pretty confident. Source: my own experience, feeling like a bad developer for many years and then having my confidence grow as a contributor once I figured out this mindset",

The remote work aspect can amplify these feelings since you're hyper-aware of your productivity throughout the day.The standup charade is unsustainable and probably contributing to your stress. Consider proactively approaching your manager about taking on additional responsibilities, proposing process improvements, or contributing to other teams' projects. Frame it as professional growth rather than admitting you're underutilized.Start exploring other opportunities before this situation damages your skills or motivation further. You can use a service like Applyre to passively search while still employed. Look specifically for roles with clear project pipelines and established team structuresRemember that not all tech jobs suffer from this problem. Your fear of repetition is understandable, but asking detailed questions about day-to-day responsibilities and team dynamics during interviews can help you avoid similar situations.",

I would also say if anyone needs help I have some capacity, sometimes that led to more work but sometimes I was just given then good optics of Im getting my work done + remaining available for more work.I think I got away with this bc I was a junior. I could see this working again as a senior doing more deep dive or complex tasks that no one can rly question, but as an aspiring mid level I think I'm just gonna have to get stuff done, maybe delay it by a day or two and be transparent im testing my ticket.I got average/good reviews most of the time. I got a bad performance review twice in a row, that taking it easy caught up during crunch time.I stepped it up and cleared my name, just didn't matter bc we got mass laid off anyway lol. I consider myself successful, because the same boss that gave me the bad review got laid off with me - and ultimately gave me referrals + was a strong testimony to help me get my new job.I would use that free time to up skill now though. I would study whatever it takes to be successful for interviews in devops, or even just see if you have interest in learning any kind of tech in a deeper setting like reading books/documents or building out small little projects (way easier to do that now with AI as a starting point). Otherwise go the company route and start looking around with coworkers, your manager, or even some sister teams and explore what work is out there.

There will be winners, losers, and companies that were just along for the ride during AI. Have you been looking at switching companies rather than switching fields? Not every company has the same view of AI as your current company. You're probably suffering from burnout, from the mix of surviving three rounds of layoffs and how unpleasant your current working environment has become. Out of curiosity, how much have you been thinking about this switch? Part of why I mention this is that other fields aren't necessarily better. Nursing comes up often in this sub, but if you ever look at the nursing sub, they are pretty miserable there. They are understaffed, and we're just 5 years off from a pandemic where lots of nurses were dying.I saw a video recently that said Private Equity firms were buying out plumbers in cities. Once they've bought out enough, they will drop their rates to put the others out of business. Then, they'll drive rates up. There are a lot of fields going through change right now. I'm personally in the camp that AI will be another tool we use, and there will be blowback when the bubble eventually bursts. It's just not sustainable, and eventually, there will be callout for actual results. Then all that money being invested will have to be invested elsewhere.",

It's not walking into a tech conference, exchanging business cards, and aggressively shaking hands. It's not cold messaging people asking for some awkward \"coffee chat\" even though you both know you're just trying to milk them for a job.That feels fake as hell because *it is* fake as hell. But it's also not networking.Our network is made up of our *friends, family, and colleagues*.That's it. So in order to \"network\" you expand upon 1 of those 3 categories. The family category's tough to expand, you're kinda stuck with it. The colleagues one you expand throughout your career as you work with people. The people you've met and worked closely with in college also count as colleagues (even if they're *both* friends and colleagues). The professor you saw weekly in office hours, or the TA you had a good connection with are colleagues.The \"friends\" category is by far the easiest to expand. You expand this category by.... making friends. That's it. There's nothing more to it. They don't need to be technical either. Someone working in sales is able to refer someone to SWE. They're character checks for the company, not skill checks, that's why they still interview you. Hiring unknowns off the street is risky for companies, because character-red-flags are easily hidden and don't come out for months. Hiring someone that an employee they already like is vouching for is significantly safer.The reason meetups are so commonly suggested is because getting into a room with a bunch of people that all have a shared interest is a great way to *make friends.* If you go to those thinking you're gonna get a LinkedIn connection, you're not going to make any friends *or* connections. Go into those because you're interested in X, and the friends will follow. Doesn't need to be technical either. Go to a rock climbing meetup, go to a model train meetup, hell, go to your local dive bar and buy a stranger a drink and get to chatting. I've made life-long friends that way.The bad news is none of this is a quick fix. Making friends takes time. We're not disposable one-time use napkins that you toss in the bin as soon as you get what you want from us. If you form a *genuine* connection with us, over the course of months, we'll refer each other because we want to, and we're doing so becaues we're friends, not because we're using each other.",

I got hired at age 40 for my first job with no CS degree at the time(I've since completed it) and no experience in the industry. But one thing I did have was that I was far better than most junior devs coming out of college, because I put the work in for several years prior. Now you don't need to take several years to transition. In my case, I always assumed wrongly that those people with CS degrees were better than I was, but as I continued to become better and better and take code challenges and pass with \"professional level\" code grades, I started to believe that I was good enough and started applying to jobs. It took me a few interviews to land my first job but it's been like a rocket ship going straight up in my career ever since.",

I think a lot of people get into this annoying grindset of leetcode and projects Your daily breakdown should be like this. Set a time to prep for interviews. Prep for stuff like fizzbuzz, SOLID, refresh your basics like polymorphism, interfaces, code reuse. Writing Unit Tests. Study for behavioral questions. Develop strategies for addressing issue i.e if I'm taking a task how would I approach it. Set a time to work out and eat right. Maintain your fitness and stay healthy Set a time to apply for jobs each day Set a time to leetcode. Don't do this for 6-8 hours a day. Do like 2-3 hours a day. Set a time to learn new technologies. Learn about splunk, docker, new relic, cypress, copilot, etc. Consider doing some courses on coursera or edx. You don't have to do all these in a day but maybe like each week.",

I'd go so far as to say it's only a matter of time at every company.It's a very common pattern for management/upper-management to get replaced, and for a company to tighten the belt and shift their culture to the toxic-side.That part's out of our control.What's in our control is how we react to it.WLB is my #1 priority. Even if a company tries to turn up the heat, and introduce toxic expectations.... I don't let it alter my WLB. I do the best work I can from 9-5, M-F. That's non-negotiable. Management can scream about deadlines, ping me after hours, etc all they want. Doesn't change anything about how I behave. At most a 5:30pm text will get is a \"OK, will take a look tomorrow morning\".There's an extremely clear divide between my work life and my personal life. This divide lets me disconnect after 5pm, no matter how much BS is going on during the work day, no matter how stressful it gets. That stress waits around for 9am the following work day.I've had companies \"tighten the belt\" before, but I've always stood my ground. If they fired me over it? Oh well, the culture was toxic anyways and I was already looking for another job. But in reality they never did. The last time this happened I even got a pretty massive *raise*.Toxic management *loves* to take advantage of people that don't establish any sort of boundaries. Really they'd be stupid not to, it's free labor. But when you establish boundaries as the employee, more often than not, nothing's going to happen.So whenever this happens to your company's culture, firstly establish boundaries and stick to them in the short-term to keep yourself sane. In the medium/long term find another job ASAP. It's a sinking ship culture-wise.",

Now a round with a recruiter, then one with the hiring manager, a homework assignment, a leetcode technical round, a culture fit round, and if you did not fail at any of these steps, you can still be rejected because there was someone better. And this is for one company, and you rarely got hired from one application, you need to go through 5-10 if you are lucky. And do this beside a 9-5 job.

On the down side, he has to worry about paying farm labourers and making sure the ends meet and he's pretty much spent what he sold the house in England for. They're in it now, they have to make it work. On the plus side, apart from a few initial bad starts which cost them a good few quid, the last time he came back to visit in the UK, he had a brand new Toyota. OK it's not an Audi or a BMW, but a brand new Toyota in Ireland is roughly equivalent. Especially a diesel with a Dublin plate! Seriously, in Ireland, that's doing pretty well!\\- Another bought a van, a bunch of cleaning equipment and became a carpet cleaner. On the plus side, the amount of hotels and function rooms that immediately gave him business and even rolling appointments is definitely helping to pay off the equipment he bought through hire purchase. On the downside, he's cleaning carpets at 55 years old with a 55 year old back. He likes the work but it's obviously a lot more physical than he really thought.\\- The last one now works three days a week doing minor admin stuff for an office. Filing, sending stuff out, packaging, doing the odd excel sheet stuff, fixing printers, any odd jobs. It doesn't pay well. But the mortgage was paid a while ago, no real debts, kids are off to university, his wages pay for the monthly bills easily, the wife's wages pay for the family holiday every year though kids may or may not come. If you have no heavy outgoings, you sort of don't need to chase the wage anymore. So yeah, none of that is helpful or answers your question. Or does it?",

My last two jobs (both very large companies) were both offshored. Not just me, but my entire team. I’m friends with a lot of former co-workers struggling right now.For me, I just realized I want a field of work where I don’t have to be around Indians anymore. I know it sounds racist, but I’ve come to terms with it. Watching them slowly suffocate the IT industry since I joined it in 2013 has been like watching a family member slowly dying to cancer.I’m considering everything from digital forensics to trades work to just finally pulling the trigger and angling to move into product mgmt or architect. Tired of the dev rat race and companies building generic APIs but wanting to do Google interviews. Tired of grinding leetcode problems every few years after another layoff. I just like building and integrating stuff and seeing it all work, like finishing a painting.Ready to be accused of being bad at my job or not passionate enough or something by people who want to virtue signal about the reality of things. Some people, especially younger people, will feel a knee-jerk reaction to what I said, but I feel bad for you. You don’t remember how enjoyable this work was before Cognizant took over and every remote job posting had 7,000 applicants from India within the first week. Before COVID killed socialization. Dev work used to be a bunch of nerds talking in the office and enjoying happy hour specials afterward.",

That was my first 2 jobs.I did college recruiting at my new grad company as well... our focus was absolutely not on finding local candidates. That's why we recruited all over the country at big schools. Our focus was hiring people that would be willing to relocate to our HQ. That's what we cared about. Will they move here, and can we retain them.The answer to your 2nd question has nothing to do with the first. Even if locals are preferred, moving to a single city without a job already lined up is not a smart move. Especially if you're a new grad. You need to be applying country-wide, and relocating to wherever will hire you. Not the other way around.",

Also in your practice you need to sort of streamline the thought process along with the toolset.Think of it like branch prediction in computers. The computer just guesses what it's going to need to do next and it starts prefetching data and executing instructions. It might guess wrong sometimes and do some wasted work, but overall things happen way faster than if the cpu was just waiting around.Another analogy is like competitive games/sports. The way you get good at these things is by internalizing the playbook so that you can make snap decisions in the moment based on the scenario. Obviously you get there by lots of focused applied practice. LC is pretty similar. When you first start it's normal to sit around brainstorming and headscratching a problem and that's fine but realistically that's just not a viable approach in an interview, so you have to internalize the playbook.",

The real value today comes from understanding a business problem and applying AI and software engineering best practices to solve it.Software is a tool, not the end goal. The true goal is value creation, solving real problems in ways that generate revenue or reduce costs. The closer you are to understanding and shaping those revenue streams, the more valuable and resilient you’ll be in today’s engineering job market.So while the market is tough right now, this could actually be a good time to pivot or upskill toward roles that give you exposure to business domains, how companies operate, make money, and serve customers. A contract role as a consultant may be easier to land in this environment, and can help you build exactly that kind of experience.At the same time, starting a side project or business, something where you have to identify a customer need, build software for it, and try to monetize, can help you develop the kind of product thinking and entrepreneurial mindset that employers and clients increasingly value.",

But the biggest consideration is do you like the people in the team? If not, don’t waste your time and just work a different job and build projects on the side.It’s rough out here, but definitely consider building software “for fun” while getting a part time job. If you have professor connections from university, try to apply for volunteer research assistantship. Search for open source projects to contribute to.At least research labs provide authorship if you provide significant contribution and open source contributions are recorded. Unpaid internship is just going to be a bullet point in your resume that tells recruiter “I did this, trust me bro”.",

It is sometimes hard to do as a researcher since your incentives are misaligned - publishing frequently is often incompatible with writing clean, maintainable code. But trust me it will help in your own research, especially if you standardize your setup to launch, track, and report experiments in the first 1-2 years of your PhD.

If you are doing it cause you heard you can make a ton of money or its an easy gig you can skate by in because you watched some dork's day in the life of a SWE where they worked 45 minutes out of an 8 hour day, I'd look for something else.Don't buy into the AI hype train. AI has a lot of flaws but if used properly, its a tool to augment a developer...not replace. People hyping AI like its going to replace people either have a vested interest in seeing AI succeed (and we are using AI loosely here, they are hyping up LLLMs), parroting the hot takes they see online for engagement, or haven't really ever coded anything beyond a basic todo list app.Also, my advice is to not utilize AI while you learn. Just like lifting weights, your brain is a muscle and if you never learn how to learn, and AI can't figure out the problem, your going to be SOL. Utilize your time in college to learn how to figure things out and think critically, don't let AI do that for you. I tutored online for 3 years and the number of students that utilized AI for their learning but had no clue what was going on was huge, they are likely now running into issues finding work because if they manage to land an interview, they certainly aren't passing them.My view, there is going to be a lot of work in 5-10 years fixing applications built utilizing AI because everyones mandating it be used in the work place to make devs more effective. Theres already been studies where usage of AI has been a net negative in productivity. Personal annecdoate, worked on an application where a guy vibe coded an integration into sales force in c#, in order to find a patients next appt date, it had to look back through all 35 years of patient data (all patients) in order to find one patients future appt date. Took 10 minutes to run 150 patients worth of data because it was churning millions of row for each patient because chat gpt coded the query.",

I have years of experience, and I’ve had conversations with someone who was working at Hobby Lobby a few months before. Don’t let someone lacking emotional intelligence get you down. I had a recruiter start harassing me on LinkedIn because I was being considered for a contract-to-hire role at Chase that was a higher rate than she was used to seeing. She kept trying to insist I was lying. I just blocked her. No good advice on how to network. You need to find people willing to talk to someone, effectively a stranger, for very little in return. It’s a challenge. I recently accepted some LinkedIn invites from random new grads from my college, but I had too many personal things come up to follow up with them. It’s a very hard market right now. You know that. It just takes more time and effort than normally. One thing I’d encourage you to do more of is learning and expanding your skillset. You say it’s been 7 months. You can learn quite a bit in time like that. Maybe you should try learning some things to make yourself a stronger candidate. AWS had a free tier. You could get exposure to cloud services that will help you grow. I encounter a lot of experienced people who still don’t have a lot of cloud experience.",

Also, there truly are people who want to help, and feel sympathy for people like us. Also, they admire the dedication we have to keep going.Well first, take some time to take care of your mental health. We need money to survive, but this career path should not determine the embodiment of your soul. Balance hobbies and hanging out with friends, forgetting about anything career related during those times. This should give you a boost of confidence. Also, you have to attend networking events in your area. The point of building your network is to get connected to people in the industry, ask them questions about their career and get advice, and share what you’re currently working on / your experience. Not necessarily asking them for referrals right away. Jobs for people like us are very scarce now, but in the meantime, practice interview / technical skills, work on projects, build your network through the advice above, always be on the lookout for open positions, etc. The most important thing right now is to stay consistent, but also have a life. Get a coffee shop job to be around people and pay the bills while you do these things. It’s really hard I know, and I’m proud of you for still working at it / searching for advice after 7 months. But after taking my life back and following the advice above, I feel more confident now in my 14 months of post grad to find opportunities, then I did many many months ago. Sorry for the ramble but we will prevail!! Keep going and most importantly, take care of your mental health, and soon you will find people who want to help you.",

Most of these places weren’t advertising their roles online, the hidden job market is a real thing (hell one interview I got because I got to know someone on my street, and their son was working at a place that was looking for an engineer, they called up their son and I had a chat with them, they went back to their leadership team and considered starting a grad program that didn’t exist before and gave me an interview for it, I didn’t get it, but then they recommended me to another place that then did similar). Because they were small they didn’t have specific recruiters, it was the head of development usually interviewing me. I did have a personal project I had been working on and was excited about it. It wasn’t a standard tutorial or project that everyone had done. I like to think it was that my excitement about my project shined through, because at several places I pulled out my laptop to show the project, and each time it usually ended up with me doing 15 minutes of pair programming with them. A side note: learning pair programming skills is super useful! Not just professionally useful, but great for interviews. Talking through what you are doing as you do it. AMA!",

I'm sick of people calling you a Gen Z entitlted brat just because you didn't want to take bullshit from that CTO. Yes startups are weird, yes you gotta bite the bullet sometimes, but to me that means chewing off more work than you can handle or working longer hours. That's what I think hard work means, hard work should ***NEVER*** mean taking shit from some dumbfuck who can't even conduct an interview or onboard someone new. Yeah maybe you would be 2 months deep in work experience or w/e but fuck that man, the reason this industry is cooked (like my one in EE) is because these old bastards thought they were in the trenches back in the day (they weren't) and expect us to get abused by some dickhead so they feel better.

It was more or less a dead-end job since there wasn't a lot of room for advancement/salary increase. Mentorship was non-existent as was training and pretty much everything else. Things were siloed and if you did what you were told you would get the job. I'm thankful I had the job because at least it was a foot in the door into IT. The second job I'm at is better in some ways and worse in others. We're very understaffed and are on a hiring freeze with a lot of technical debt that is overdue by years. Like a lot of organizations we want to be proactive by reacting to the latest trends in IT-- if you guessed AI, you'd be correct. We have a Github that's there more or less for some kind of version control, but it's used kind of rarely. Yes, the technical debt is to that degree. However, I'm lucky to have someone that's at least willing to work with me, and help me out and provides me some advice of things I should be doing-- that's when I buy a book on that topic and read it. I try to do a book a month when I have the time. My advice would be to do that, talk with someone you trust or who is willing to help a little and research on your own. People will take notice and be happy you cared. If there's other IT departments you work with, I'd also ask some questions what they do, their responsibilities and at least understand them from a cursory glance so if you know of something is their responsibility you can articulate yourself in a manner where people will at least see you're taking yourself seriously as a professional.",

If a chance presents itself, mention that you're looking for a role in $tech_stack.Your networking will have a greater effect if you attend a recruiting-focused meetup. For example, HackerX hosts events in multiple cities and they match you up with different companies for 5-minute speed-dating-style chats with a chance to mingle over pizza or drinks afterwards. They sell tickets but give me a free pass every time. I don't know if anyone has to pay or if it's just to make it seem exclusive.

Is usually 2-3 weeks, was 1 week once due to background check delay. I got blackballed, oh well. You want to give 2 days notice out of paranoia, you sure can.Negotiation, some companies refuse. Others, you need leverage in the form of another job offer, which they can match or give you a signing bonus instead or maybe 1 extra week of vacation. They just aren't going to give you more for the sake of it. That looks bad. Your pay was set from experience, job title, work unit and pay bands. No one rolled a d20.Other thing in negotiation, standard time to accept or refuse the offer is 1 or 2 weeks. I've asked for and received an extra week when given 1 week and explained I wanted to be fair and finish the rest of my scheduled interview with other companies. I've also asked after a final interview if I could get a verbal decision in less than a week.",

I'll have a lot to talk about if someone asks about them, but it has done nothing to catch any attention, even on entry level listings.For those that are curious so they can judge for themselves; the first project is a WebSocket based chat server written in Go. It has message caching with Redis(Valkey), long term message storage via PostgreSQL, and an admin panel via React where admins can create chat channels, ban users, and search message history. The server was containerized with Docker compose and used Caddy as a reverse proxy with TLS. I did a basic chat client in Qt/QML and C++.The second project was a basic audio DAW/tracker where you could cache audio samples, sequence patterns, and play them back. It was in C++ and Qt/QML with RtAudio to create the audio stream. I had to explore multi-threading and lock-free design for this project and genuinely learned a lot. I even separated the gui from the audio engine and made my engine a static library, in case I wanted to switch away from Qt in the future.I know it's not a replacement for job experience, but they did nothing for me. I figured going off the beaten path would benefit me, but no pay off yet.",

The only issue was the new job was in a completely different part of the city.I didn't have a car yet, my previous job lined up nicely with the bus routes ( although coming home I usually just Uber'd to save time). With the new job I usually just Uber'd to work, this was fine. But I literally had some days where the Uber home would take so long I'd just fall asleep. We're talking about 45 minutes( one way) turning into 80 minutes on a bad day. Eventually I just moved within 10 minutes or so of my new office. It was a great job and a major stepping stone for me, but there's no way I could have done it without moving. Since you own your house and probably don't want to move, just take the shorter commute. That 32 minutes is probably going to average 45 minutes in reality. Which isn't the worst thing.",

Also loads of Keene alumni in the area as well so don’t dismiss it as the price for 4 years tuition is lower than one year at some private colleges at the same academic regard and level. Contact them directly and ask them for advice. If you don’t have drive or ambition going to a top tier school won’t get you hired for long. My suggestion is that you figure out an area of focus that’s likely close to the tech stack you’re doing for work as a test engineer ( if possible but if it’s cobol or some old spaghetti just take the mulligan )and then use that to jump into a dev role.",

        "body": "So to start, this can vary a lot from person to person, but this may take a fair amount of time to pan out. With today's market, you got to be pretty competitive (4-5 years ago, you had a better chance of \"getting lucky\"). Working full-time is a pain, and even putting just 10 hours a week into transitioning into SWE can be hard. All-in-all, I wouldn't be surprised if it took you over a year to line up your first job.I will say though, as a self taught dev with no degree, you got some strengths here: You have a CS degree and you've been working a job that will generally look respectable on a resume. I do think you have a pretty healthy shot at transitioning into SWE, but the market is bad and it's pretty rough out there.I'll assume you have some rough experience with programming (how to reasonably use classes, functions, if statements, for loops), or at the very least, all that will come back to you pretty quickly.If you want to get into fullstack, I would start off by focusing on Java / Springboot for backend, JavaScript / React for frontend, and use Git. I would ***probably*** recommend taking a Udemy course (I never personally tried Udemy, but I often hear good things) for both React and Springboot. You can just watch a YouTube tutorial for Git. Try to get to a point where you can work on a project pretty consistently. Just have one project you're pretty committed to.After that, there's interview prep. Go through the roadmap on https://neetcode.io (mainly focus on the video explanations, don't waste a ton of time trying to solve questions yourself at this stage). After the roadmap, do some random questions LeetCode, and try to get to a spot where you have like an 80% chance of solving an unfamiliar medium-level problem in under 60 minutes (if you haven't solved it after 2 hours, just look up the answer and try to think where you went wrong).More than anything else though ***talk through the problems***. You wanna be good at \"solving\" problems because sometimes you get \"assessments\" (basically you have to solve a LeetCode problem before getting to interview anybody), but for \"interviews\" you need to be good at talking technical. You should look up \"mock coding interviews\" on YouTube interviews to see what mean here.You should start applying before you're 100% confident with anything though (you're never going to be 100% ready to start applying). In fact, I would honestly recommend you just start sending out like 3 applications a week ***right now***. Just half ass it, get it out of the way, and get used to it. Don't waste too much time \"waiting to feel ready\" (I wasted a lot of time on this back in 2021).For your resume, skim through the wiki on r/EngineeringResumes. You'll have to adjust a bit though because of your background, but do what you can to leverage your current work experience (be detailed), and mainly try to sell yourself as \"an important team member that holds some key responsibilities and/or accomplishments\". I know that can be really awkward, but again, I think you got quite a respectable role.And finally, as far as applying goes, apply to any role that looks reasonably relevant, doesn't look too \"specialized\", and asks for less than 5 years of experience. Don't be too picky, just focus on playing the numbers game more than anything else.",

I've actually done a few uDemy courses over the years but I think that approach doesn't work for me as well because I don't really feel like I'm retaining any of the stuff just from watching a video and regurgitating. Maybe I'm taking the wrong courses. But yeah, I just started learning Java with Spring Boot tonight. Decided to do a common project (Making a Letterboxd \"clone\") , but rather than watch a video tutorial, I'm using chatGPT to learn. At first, it's been giving me a bunch of code snippets to paste and I'm going through with that to learn the process in how to make a project from start to finish with a backend and frontend, but I think moving forward, I'll ask it to give me less code snippets and more just explain concepts and theories with examples without the code directly related to the project I'm working on. Perhaps I'll try to get the fundamentals down again, maybe make a solid project or two (Nothing too crazy) and then start applying within the next week or two. Thanks for being encouraging about my chances. I'll try to leverage my science/healthcare background and maybe look for more niche roles in the biopharmaceutical industry related to tech/SWE. Obviously, they won't pay as big as tech or finance companies, but I'm just trying to learn and get my foot in the door ASAP to gain more relevant experience. Thanks again for the advice :)",

I'm just going to dump my thoughts on the interview process and how far I have to go still.I refused to accept I'm not good enough for this industry despite failing so much. It took me 1k+ applications, 20+ different position interviews, to get 1 decent offer (that is still a pretty big downgrade to my last 2 jobs).I have anxiety and have a low stress tolerance, so I was fighting twice as hard because I couldn't make myself study more than 1-2 hours a day + I would get super nervous during interviews and it made it very hard to recall what I studied for.Maybe it was because I took it easy for most of my work life, maybe I just was supposed to be interview prepping during down time. For whatever reason, I could not adapt to what it took to pass interviews.The random trivia questions just get me. I don't have memorized small little stuff like making random SQL queries verbally or specific syntax or concepts for coding languages. I've gotten better at it studying and getting live interviews for months - even then I'm still missing questions sometimes. I HATED that feeling of completely blanking out on something that sounds easy, but the pressure and the fact I just Google this stuff when I need it at work made it so hard for me.Part of it was me stretching the truth in my resume, but early on they wanted me to be able to talk more deeply about CI/CD, and cloud/devops + QA experience. I just didn't know that stuff and lost a lot of early interviews bc of that. After I studied some major concepts and talking points - it was good enough for most interviews but some people would DIG in and expose me.I'd get a small coding live assignment that would be similar to a homework you'd get in first/second year college - but you have 10-15 minutes to do it. I immensely struggled with the pressure even if it was \"easy\".  I started timing myself doing LC easies and pretend to try to simulate that pressure.I'd get Leetcode, the worst I saw was Mediums in interviews. I wasn't that good at it, but at least that one is straight forward on how to improve even if it's many hours and hard.I got a take home once + did one personal project, and used AI to make it. I then went back and revised it after it was working to make it feel more like \"my code\", and then studied the code base with AI until I could defend the entire codebase. I did end up passing that specific interview. I will admit, making a personal project in my stack did help a little when I was discussing trivia questions and concepts bc it was more fresh.I got system design in 2 dif interviews, failed them both. Maybe the landscape is changing with AI but I felt like system design for 3 YOE was very unfair. I did not study this stuff, I'll work on it studying on the job in addition to this other shit above.I think I got a lot better at behaviorals, but I don't think I had the best stories about what I accomplished at work at first. I will literally be on the lookout to hunt for good project stories at my next job, whether it's work I did or it's my coworkers. As long as you can reasonably explain the STAR and talk at a high level about the coding and the decision making and paint a good story - I think you can get away with it even if you are borrowing someone else's stories.",

        "body": "I'm based in the US, studied Math, and am transitioning into CS. I would say definitely go the CS route. If your country has a bias towards math degrees that's something to consider, but CS is prolly just a lot easier to convert into concrete/hard skills than math especially with respect to getting a job out of any of this. I actually really love math and theoretical CS, if you angle your CS course load correctly you could essentially study the overlap of both fields (Type theory and functional programming in CS has strong relationships with Logic and Category Theory in Mathematics). If you at all consider moving to another country, CS will prolly be a lot more immediately transferable.Unless you're interested in some specific fields of mathematics that don't lead into the CS route/lead into other career routes (analysis, probability theory, etc), go the CS route.Also as someone wanting to one day go into CS grad school, getting into CS grad school from math may not be impossible but it feels like it's definitely not as direct as having a CS bachelors ;-;Honestly, to me, CS and programming feels like applied algebra. Especially if you go in the functional programming direction and have a nice, strongly typed language with things like algebraic data types, designing a program getting statically analyzed by a compiler feels like algebraic mathematical thinking. Even if you're more of an imperative programmer or like low-level stuff, math actually is even farther away from that. So if you want to learn mathematics in some sense to widen your perspective, a well thought out CS course load and maybe some reading on the weekend can definitely do that. CS isn't really that far mathematics if you look at it the right way.",

I'm not saying you should never use AI or ask other people for help, but I think you should also consider what other ways you might be able to go through to find the answers to some of these things. In particular, if your question is whether or not a piece of code works, there should be a way to test that out without AI or asking someone else.",

I graduated from a 3-4th tier uni in 2023 and only work at a Fortune 500 company in enterprise right now. I'm in the process of job searching and hope to land a job at big tech or adjacent within 6 months (fingers crossed) so I can work on more interesting problems and to relocate.I also have already applied to OMSCS and am awaiting decision for Spring 2026, but due to the aforementioned goals, I'm planning to defer my start date for a year to get a chance to job hop as well as to sit on the thought for a bit. I imagine you're also wishing to do the computing systems specialization as well? My main concerns with a masters also align with yours too - between the gym, hobbies, my gf - and the idea that I can simply redirect the time commitment to get hands on experience with my interests at work anyways.I've emailed a Meta Staff engineer who also had a masters and he mostly concluded with the popular opinion that it wasn't much useful outside of having a good time. I think for my case I can see that it can be a backup option for me in terms of better job security given a pessimistic market: for you, I feel that landing in Meta out of college is all the opportunity that you need :) If I was in your spot I think I'd forgo the masters and focus on the other important things in life, we spend too much time inside anyways. At the end of the day do you think you'll gain fulfillment out of it? If you're already at Meta the ROI probably isn't that high",

The bootcamp/self-taught path (even if it's associate degree) rarely works anymore unless you're exceptional.It's almost impossible without a CS or Computer Engineering degree. Every entry level job gets over 100 applications so HR filters by degree for a sanity check. I like your plan.>as eventually staff/principal SWEI don't think that's what most people really want. At Team Lead, I was working 50 hours per week with 15-20 hours of meetings. I had responsibility to my team and the whole business unit such as tracking work intake and discussing if defects could impact other departments. For 10% more pay. Then it's a pyramid, rank in Top 10% of employees at your grade for a chance of making Principal. You made it that far? Now get 5 DMs per day of people asking you for help who will blame you if you don't. Be married to the job.>That said, I enjoy the field (I genuinely like math, I like coding (just not obsessed)) Me too. Coding isn't my hobby. I like it but it's just a job. I'd rather do most anything else in my free time. I don't know an accountant who does accounting for fun when they go home. I stepped up my math and statistics knowledge. I get more out of that.",
