You're likely conflating professional experience with job title. Data Engineer is typically not an entry level role. Data Analyst typically is.> Whatever language you're using should have some kind of built-in testing capability.

Extract logic: Python, could use some higher level framework like Meltano or dlt.4. Transformation logic: DBT, could be replaced with SQLMesh.5. Orchestration: Dagster.6.

But I’m curious—when it comes to tracking hallucinations and response quality, how do you balance the trade-off between over-monitoring and performance overhead? Also, have you found a solid method for managing token costs while still maintaining response quality in production? We’ve had some success using a platform that integrates monitoring and evaluation in a more streamlined way.

Analytics focused pipelines and business logic (more advanced dbt models such as mrr models). Technical overlap with the data engineers and business logic overlap with the analysts. Not so much focused on optimal usage of compute and so on but more focused on business.Data analyst -> data modelling in dbt to the specifications of the analytics engineers and data engineers and most importantly of course: analytics. The analysts in our company also write similar models to the analytics engineers but usually with less of a focus on complex models and more of a focus on analyses. Though that can vary on a need by need basis.The data engineer never does analytics or visualisations and neither does the analytics engineer. However, all are required to work with git and dbt. We also require knowledge in these technologies for analysts but most analysts would no know how to set up a dbt project or how to structure it. That's not their focus. But they still need to understand dbt well enough to create models and run tests, for example.Data engineering is definitely still viable. Basically, they are the people that keep the data sphere clean from a technical point of view and most knowledgable when it comes to setting up infrastructure (the analysts will never set up a dockerized dagster ec2 instance to orchestrate pipelines, neither will the analytics engineers, at least no in our company). And everything downstream hinges on that technical ability. For example: I, as a data engineer, run around the dwh and pick up queries to optimise. I can often reduce runtime from something like 1 hour to 2 minutes by configuring materialisation and implementing proper requirements for partition pruning (snowflake). Analysts usually don't know how the systems work under the hood in order to effectively do this themselves.",

Like depending on your jurisdiction scraping may not be considered fair use.Even if you could win a legal battle you may not be able to afford the lawsuits that can start piling up if others feel like you are monetizing their user data via scraping.Additionally, you are building on a weak foundation. Every source can change their format, content, data structure etc. at their own pace. They don't care or want to support your scenario, so you have a dependency on something that can change at any time. This is really rough for a business.By far the best way to handle this is via data brokers or paying for access to the raw data with provided APIs etc.",

Sort of lucky in the way that CS folks who got started in the late 90s were. There just weren't insane degree/experience requirements because the field was fairly new. All that mattered was whether you were good. So I just worked hard to be good.It's a very different world now, though. I work in a niche industry so maybe this advice isn't as helpful for people looking for generic \"careers in tech\", but for me by far the biggest thing that enabled me to get ahead and move around the organization was domain knowledge.

I knew cloud services and python would be important in the future so I taught myself those skills over the next few years in my free time. Mostly online and creating my own projects. You always have to be learning because trends change every 2-3 years. But everything can be self taught in my opinion. I'd say about half or more of my colleagues are self taught and the rest are CS majors. DE isn't very appealing to most new CS majors though so it's a good path for smart folks who just didn't choose that degree.Edit: I should add that my title over the years has been ETL developer, BI/SQL developer, data analyst, Data engineer.

We are running express routes with MEs and all that jazz. We have production workloads on both AWS and Azure. I know that this is going to draw a lot of downvotes, but I am yet to see how a cloud setup outperforms, both on cost and performance, a well tuned SQL Server. DevOps and infra are much more efficient, easier and natively supported on the cloud products, but other that, I am yet to see the tangible ROI of these projects. The same goes for storage, cold archives and so on. I am speaking only data platforms here, application deployments are a whole another story. That being said, I love working with the thing!!",

One thing that isn’t talked about enough here is that if you have on-prem it has its own costs that are slightly different from being cloud based, such as physical maintenance of the equipment as well as purchasing the equipment. I view it in the same way I do a legal capacity in a company, not every company needs to have a dedicated legal capacity available to them at all times, so they outsource that bit (in our case use a dedicated consultancy to run it all, likely cloud based for access). Over time they may bring in a singular lawyer to coordinate things and deal with the majority of the paperwork, but they’ll still need advice or capacity help (singular data person with consulting support probably still cloud based). Then you have a mix of stuff where the legal department expands all the way to a full blown department with dedicated head count and seat at the board (everything from a small data team who are cloud based to a dedicated data department who have at least one person for every role including maintenance because they’ve brought it on-prem) but even then that legal department won’t be able to cover every single base and will have to bring in external help on occasion, probably keeping someone on retainer (there’ll still be some workloads cloud based).We all look at this as a purely technical and budget problem whereas you need to take a far more holistic view of the requirements of the individual business.",

Probably the data markets is one of the worsts to do it since pretty much all big platforms focus on either only supporting the cloud only or being cloud first.But in the two sectors I worked the most, banking and logistics, they were returning to hybrid and having some local-only stuff with federation.The reason are many, they are sectors where you need to ensure access to data in real time and with extremely low delays and you need to keep it being available at all times.Since most companies are far from the petabyte-size data lake, running your own cluster is still very feasible, especially for development and staging environments too, where you don't necessarily need the machines to be the most modern or having licenses.Also most companies don't fully use all features that Databricks, Snowflake and others offer, so even using the open source versions of their solutions is more than enough.",

And Kafka is excellent for the right job, but sometimes he is really overselling Kafka as one-tool-to-rule-them-all.Scalable - absolutely. Easy to query - not so much. Cheap way to store data - probably not.Instead of seeing Kafka as a viable solution for this use problem (which I really don't think it is), then I would ask about like what are the characteristics of the data, size of data, the query patterns (raw data or aggregated) and who's gonna query data to determine the right strategy.Other solutions could be to load (aggregated) data to a warehouse or use a lakehouse architecture with S3 as the storage layer and a table format like Delta Lake or Iceberg on top of that. Just examples. Depending on requirements there may be other solutions that are better.",

First, it has a couple of key differences:* Dataframely does not introduce a new runtime type: while `dy.DataFrame[Schema]` exists for the type checker, the runtime type remains `pl.DataFrame`. This makes it very easy to gradually adopt dataframely in a code base (and, similarly, to get rid of it again).* Dataframely natively implements the definition of schemas instead of \"dispatching\" to pydantic. This allows for much more flexibility in the schema definition.Second, dataframely provides a bunch of features that patito does not currently implement:* Support for composite primary keys* Validation across groups of rows (i.e. grouping by one or more columns, ensure that the _group_ satisfies a condition)* Validation of interdependent data frames with a common primary key (dataframely introduces the concept of a \"Collection\" here: invalid data in one data frame can then also remove rows from another data frame)* \"Soft-validation\" via `filter` which allows to partition data frames into rows that satisfy the schema and rows that don't* Structured info about failures that can be used e.g. for more debugging or advanced logging* Integration of the schema with external tools (e.g. export to SQL schemas)* Automatic data generation for unit testing, both for individual data frames and collections (in this case, dataframely takes care of generating rows with common primary keys to allow rows to be joined)",

It’s not that these “old” tools did somehow prevent you from these nice things to happen but instead the org applying and using them prevented it before you even started.I can easily build domain driven individual truths and have a flexible ops and governance model while using a traditional data warehouse approach on a single storage and compute layer (e,g. Bigquery).This whole end to end data delivery value chain mainly is blocked and attacked by organizational issue, issues of leadership ownerships beyond tech and a lack of authority of technical people over the big picture.So I am convinced that nothing about this lake house thing (1.0 or 2.0) is new or never tried before but just yet another path to fix people and organizations issues through tech",

It's built specifically for real-time data movement and supports Iceberg as a destination with minimal setup. It can run merge queries for you and soon do maintenance as well.Under the hood it handles schema evolution for you, deduplication, and exactly-once delivery.

Sure, spark sql can work as a general query engine, but it wasnt really designed for that.There’s some differences under the hood, particularly around how spark executes in stages, and uses more I/O steps than Trino.Essentially, for ad-hoc queries that change frequently, or you rerun things to change and shape results, Trino will nearly always be more performant. You can make some tweaks with a spark application (and then run it interactively to try and do the same), but tbh, Trino’s entire design, really, is for extremely fast reads on object storage datalakes.Spark is better places for wide ranging transformations, that are potentially more complex in nature. A good example here is the fault tolerance nature of spark, which matters way more in big batch pipelines, than analytical ad hoc queries. Sure, data loss and the task fails, just re fire the query. In a pipeline, you cant manually do that if its all running automated. Again, different horses for different courses in my opinion.I see it a bit like:Spark was a natural successor to Hive, for better big data transformation.Trino was a successor for something like Impala, as a faster query engine over datalakes",

A zoo of tools is indeed something one wants to avoid but at the same time forcing all your work through one tool just for the sake of having only one tool forces you into compromises that are not worth it against the benefit of the smaller stack Spark also works well as a “just in case” tool instead of the general go to thing depending on your platform.

In my opinion, the key differentiating feature between Trino and Spark is not the speed, but support for fault tolerance, which is required for batch workloads. As such, many organizations deploy two separate systems, despite the increase in complexity, added infrastructure costs, and the overhead.I think Starburst is well aware of this trend, and they are promoting Trino with fault tolerance suport. You can find some report that Trino with fault tolerance enabled works well in production and even saves the compute cost. From our own testing, however, Trino with fault tolerance does not work well for large queries (which it is designed for) because Trino coordinator crashes repeatedly. In any case, even Starburst recommends two separate deployments of Trino, one for interactive and another for batch. So, I think it is (and will remain) common to deploy separate systems for batch and interactive: Trino + Spark, Trino + Trino with fault tolerance, Trino + Hive-Tez, and so on.That said, we offer a solution that simplifies operations and reduces costs by eliminating the overhead of maintaining two separate systems, with a single unified system. It's based on, well, Apache Hive (with the MR3 execution engine). If you are interested, please visit our website: [www.datamonad.com](http://www.datamonad.com)",

Our primary offerings of Starburst Enterprise (you install wherever) and Starburst Galaxy (SaaS) do NOT have Apache Spark in the stack.

It missed that Trino has native file readers and writers for all relevant file formats ([and has had some of them for half a decade](https://github.com/trinodb/trino/pull/2004)), and [I'm particularly unsure what's going on here](https://i.imgur.com/SBqUvU7.png) - are we giving Presto a higher score for using a deprecated Delta reader? If you're between the two in 2025, Trino's had so much more work done on it since the fork and is a better choice than Presto for basically any workload.",

I thought I wanted to be a data scientist and a company hired me as a junior data scientist because of my clearance (not my experience haha). The data was terrible and I quickly became the lead data engineer with absolutely no experience simply because I could tell when things weren’t right and took time to research. Easy to find your real passion when a team structure allows for this type of flexibility.Edit: To more directly answer the question, ask about the role and team to see if you will be able to try new things and tools (specifically to learn/help the DEs).

You have experience, and you'll continue to build work experience,  so you have a leg up coming out 3. CS will complement your BI degree. You have experience working with data already,  but you probably have less experience writing good software. 4. DE and DS degrees are, IMO, garbage.

This works fine for daily batch and is reliable if PKs don’t change.To make it a bit more robust, consider soft-deletes downstream. In your warehouse, mark missing records as deleted rather than removing them. This way you keep history and avoid accidental data loss.To “optimize”a bit, you can do a hash-based comparison. If tables are huge, and full PK comparison is too slow, you can hash rows or chunks of data to detect changes and only diff those chunks.Also, some teams snapshot the full table daily and treat it like slowly changing dimensions (SCD Type 2). Storage-heavy, but you get full history without needing to touch the source.Re: tooling, Python with Pandas or even dbt (as an SQL option) can handle the diff logic but it will be kinda complex to maintain.Now, the issues with this are:1. Late-arriving data can look like a delete if yesterday’s extract was missing a row that shows up today.2. Extract gaps (like job failures) can cause false positives.3. High-churn tables can make diffing expensive or slow.So keep these in mind.That said, I definitely recommend pushing for log-based replication though. It will make your life 100x easier. If you want something more automated, [Estuary](https://estuary.dev) can do snapshot + CDC streaming with minimal setup. (Disclaimer I work at Estuary)",

In your DWH, update all the records with the deleted PKs to flag them with is_deleted or something like thatThis approach went quite well for me. Another tip, you can take a look at Fivetran's teleport sync and try it out. If your company has a budget to use it, good for you. If not, try to use the Fivetran teleport sync on a test DB where every query is shown in the log. You'll see each query that Fivetran uses to do their CDC. You can try to reverse engineer it. I tried to do that but I couldn't understand their approach. Maybe you can, or just go with the approach above. Good luck",

I typically make small changes to fit the use case. Python I use regularly, but never more than a handful of lines per day. Then what the heck do I do?

While abstractions take away some of the more complex aspects of the work, their purpose is to allow for greater breadth and a focus on specialization in other more complex areas of the stack, business, etc. Back when I started my career my team was responsible for supporting a large global messaging platform. This was the mid 2000s with an infrastructure involving distributed across thousands of machines in multiple regions. The entire product was developed in house and I knew it all, individual component features, large scale architecture, how things broke, etc. I could draw the entire 40-50 distinct component infrastructure from memory and describe all of the different flows within the system as I did it. I loved being able to do that, but over time the business direction changed and I ended up moving on to other roles. I've forgotten nearly everything to do with that specific infrastructure, save a handful of things that still rattle around, but what I have noticed is that whenever I need to learn something about distributed infrastructure, be it k8s, cloud platforms, spark, whatever, I start on second base.You're going to forget a lot of the specific over time, but you will carry your experience with you, and when you take advantage of it, you'll likely take it for granted. A lot of those specific come back pretty quickly if you end up getting back into the day to day of it as well, just fyi. It doesn't hurt to keep some of those skills sharp, but also take note of the problems you solve for your juniors and others. I suspect you're only looking at one side of this trade-off.",

Focus on high level info (like this query takes transaction data and joins with customer information and customer returns info or something). Drawing chats can be really helpful, i use lucid chart through my company but theres free alternatives out there, or use a pen/paper. There's not really an easy answer (that I've seen) but you'd be surprised how much progress you can make slowly and steadily. Once you understand the whole thing, then I'd create a new/optimized process in parallel so you always have the old one running in the background and can compare results over time. It can also be helpful to understand the sources of the data to get an idea of what each section is doing. You mentioned that there's no incremental processing, maybe look at some of the larger tables to see how you can process those incrementally or check if there are any obvious bottlenecks in the query logic and fix those",

At my last company I had a similar task to fix a bug in a table in our reporting layer that was a complete hodgepodge of crap from within the reporting layer, master data, snapshot data, truncate and load info, everything under the sun. Oh and it was built using a proprietary internal framework involving pyspark scripts that invoked logic stored in oracle tables. Kinda like stored blueprints. The stuff of nightmares. So I just took my time and started with the FROMs and JOINS , subqueries and CTES , drawing out where each table came into the picture and then drawing out the bigger diagram trying to understand how everything linked together. Then I tried to recreate the logic so I can understand what outputs each sub query or CTE or transformation was trying to get. From then I looked to re-write and optimize. Rome was not built in a day. Good luck soldier",

Write, unit test, regression test loop - as you increase in complexity test, and test, and test.6. Pre cut over - run in parallel with production and see if results are consistent.Anything you miss here by this point would be isolated cases and can be dealt with much easier and faster since youve documentEd and refactor to be much easier to modify After that resign and become a farmer",

Append-only + latest view: Just write every change and use views or queries to pick the latest version (row_number() over pk, updated_at). It’s simple and scales ~okay.2. CoW vs. MoR: For update-heavy workloads, merge-on-read is usually more efficient with Iceberg. But frequent small writes still hurt performance (you’ll want to buffer and batch). [Here’s](https://estuary.dev/blog/apache-iceberg-cow-vs-mor/) a detailed article about the two.3. Event stream + materialized views: Send CDC to Kafka, then process and materialize into your lake in micro-batches. Works great if “near-real-time” is good enough and you have the resources to manage Kafka, Kafka Connect and Debezium yourself.If you want to stay open source, something like Debezium + Kafka + Iceberg + Flink/dbt can do the job. But it can be a LOT to manage.If you’re open to managed tools, [Estuary](https://estuary.dev) handles full load + real-time CDC into Iceberg out of the box (and runs merge queries for you!), and deals with all the tricky bits like ordering, deduping, and schema changes. Worth checking out if you want to simplify the stack. Disclaimer: I work at Estuary - happy to answer any questions!",

But I personally felt that the skill set he has with his past experiences is transferable and it will benefit the team . Turns out I was right. Best hire ever . So to answer your question, your recruiter may have an unconscious bias wrt to age but maybe use your older job experience to explain how it can benefit this new career path you are choosing",

If your company is just starting out, I recommend databricks for cloud storage plus compute. And Databricks in my experience will pair your company with a solutions architect that can provide some basic coaching and training. That's how I've learned most of my data engineering stuff after I started. However, databricks is probably overkill for most small companies. I assume other platforms offer similar training though. And of course make sure that you know SQL. Spark/pyspark is very helpful too. Otherwise, the biggest problems I typically see with SWEs in the data space is that they really struggle with the tabular concepts, the business needs, data definitions, etc. Usually technical skills are not the problem.",

        "body": "Infrastructure: Is your data on-prem or on cloud? The overwhelming trend is that most organizations are either already on cloud or planning on migrating. I recommend sticking to the big 3 - AWS, Azure or GCP. Platform: You have Snowflake and Databricks as the major ones. Use Snowflake if you only care about data warehousing and BI. It's easy to learn and quick to get started on. Use Databricks if you also want machine learning and a few other neat features like advanced analytics and big data processing. The learning curve is a bit steeper in my opinion, but it's worth it because of better flexibility/control.Tools: look into are dbt, SQLMesh, airflow, kafka, fivetran, terraform, pyspark and the list goes on. I highly recommend dbt because it allows you to easily abstract data modelling and transformations while remaining (nearly) platform agnostic. SQLMesh is also proving itself to be quite good, outperforming dbt in certain things like write operation times and incremental models, but has a much smaller community than dbt. You can use fivetran for integrating a gazillion sources. I won't go through all of them, but I definitely recommend looking into pyspark if you're working with large data sets. It will significantly boost your pipeline performance! All in all, there are so many decisions to be made. My advice is to keep it stupid simple. Pick only what you need and nothing more. Data platforms have an uncanny way of ballooning in complexity as new teams, use cases, and business logic start piling on. Choose boring, proven tools. Build clean, modular pipelines. Scale complexity only when you absolutely need to.Good luck!",

In my org, we have a lot of M&A, dozens of source systems, lots of necessary data transformations to get the data usable, warehousing requirements, data science requirements, and outbound requirements to other systems. Building these with low code tools would be a nightmare. Databricks provided us with a comparatively high code option. Databricks charges based on storage costs plus compute costs. So very low volume data isn't necessarily all that expensive. But there is a lot involved in setting it up, lots of required skills to maintain it, and plenty of other options. I'm guessing if they are hiring an SWE, they are looking for a pretty high code environment though.",

For managing non conterized workloads, Functions and app service can be great, otherwise you'd be better off with ACA.Also, are you sure you want to use streamlit for your frontend? You may not know that with streamlit you run a backend as well. Your client communicates with this backend which then communicates with your FastAPI backend. That's 2 apps that you need to run. Instead you could choose a framework in Python (if you don't want to touch JS) that's a little more flexible and allows you towrite the client logic in python but also the API endpoints with FastAPI?",

For example, I’d like to get notified (e.g., via email) when a sensor value crosses a certain threshold, so I can keep an eye on whether the sensors are functioning properly.In that case, I might need to look into the data around that event, but most of the time I wouldn’t be constantly querying the live data. The system doesn’t need to be real-time either – near real-time is absolutely fine. On average, I might just visualize a handful of values per day unless there’s an issue.What is important, though, is that I’ll download each day’s data as a file for later analysis. I plan to convert the raw data into an MDF format with a daily job and then process it elsewhere. So everything I store, I will at least once download.That said, it’s really hard to estimate how often I’ll query or access the data, since that heavily depends on whether problems occur or not.",

Meta should be paying considerably more considering cost of living. You'll likely take a pay cut to go to meta based on what you said here. As far as future career prospects go, Meta will send you more towards very technical DE positions. Smaller companies might allow more opportunities for management. Though this is highly variable.

Tooling in this case is probably irrelevant - you just need careful engineering and separation of groups of tables that are being synced. Typically migrations are handled by modifying writers which temporarily write to both DBs. I'd probably stay away from Kafka/other queues because they will increase your synchronization lag. I can probably say more if you provide more details. What maximum latency are you looking for? I'm looking at a similar setup in production right now (MySQL -> PostgreSQL) and I see that under load P95 latency (time of write in destination minus time of creation of item in source) is about 850 ms.

The bidirectional sync challenges you mentioned definitely resonate.My situation is a bit more complicated though - I don't actually control the legacy Oracle system or its codebase. We're building a new Postgres-based system while the old one continues running, but I can't modify the legacy application to write to both DBs.Given this constraint, it seems I might be stuck with CDC or similar approaches despite the risks. If I'm forced down this path, what specific precautions would you recommend to avoid the circular updates and consistency issues you mentioned? Is there a particular pattern for table grouping/separation that worked well for you? And did you implement any specific conflict resolution strategy when dealing with environments you couldn't fully control?I'll definitely check out your RT pipeline tool too",

The challenge I'm facing is that I don't have access to modify the legacy Oracle system's code - it's a third-party application we're migrating away from module by module.Would you recommend using one-way CDC from Oracle to Postgres for changes happening in the legacy system, combined with the dual-write from our new application? My concern is implementing the schema transformation layer correctly, especially with the completely different structures.For the historical data migration, your async transfer approach makes sense. Did you use any specific tools for handling the schema transformation during this initial load? We're looking at about 8 years of historical data that needs to be mapped to the new structure.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

Sometimes it's impossible to avoid, like for example when you're developing a new version of an EHR system and medical personnel of both systems should see fast updates to the orders table to avoid double administration of a drug to a patient. Perhaps you can mitigate this by having a filter table for order IDs that has information about which system created an order to break the loop. It will be a difficult project :)",

What this mean is that you would have new “schemas” and “tables” in snowflake that are technically never loaded in Snowflake but only lives in S3.Reason for snowflake to do this is that they want you to use their query engine to load the data and do anything else with it. And since they will allow writes to iceberg table, someone could just use snowflake engine instead of spark for example if they don’t want to spawn a spark cluster themselves.They also all have their own catalog which will have “more” feature then the other which would lock you in a little because anytime you derive from the default opening table specification you list interoperability with other catalogs.",

The code is written and pushed into a dev branch on github from local machine of devs2. That triggers Github action workflow which creates a docker image for the code on that branch and publishes into our internal image repository. The image is tagged in a way that separates my teams images from others and also provides info about GitHub repo, branch, developer, team, etc3. Using airflow we trigger that docker image into a containers in our test environment. The image is triggered on Kubernetes using our internal api tools and airflow action.4. The code is now tested through the running container on the test environment. If there are issues, the code is fixed and the above process is triggered again5. The test environment is a mirror image of the prod environment so we monitor the behaviour of the pipeline, check logs, analyse observablity metrics on datadog to ensure that the pipeline works as per expectations6. To test the data, we have an testing module which acts as a defence layer named lighthouse. Lighthouse automates running test sql scripts on our spark dataframe. The queries are written in a way that negative issues can generate rows. If all tests pass, the dataframe is ready to be written in data lake.7. In the data lake, we do another round of adhoc testing to double check if everything works well8. Once done, a PR is raised and the code is merged into the main branch. This triggers another github action workflow that updates the production docker image of our data pipeline.9. The same image is triggered via our production airflow. Since we already have tested on test environment, it’s just the same code running on production so we are mostly sure that it would run.10. The final dataset on production as scheduled data check and alerts using collibra. This helps us getting issues beforehand and fixing it.11. For logging we use splunk and for incident management we do pagerduty. The github action also handles linting and formatting of our code. So, yeah, we do a few things for testing our pipeline.",

Developers should have a de environment in the cloud, with data striking a good balance between being:- representative (you'll develop faster if you catch problems earlier)- safe (masked/hashed, or something alike for sensitive fields, synthetic for company-sensitive data, etc)- small (for cost and performance, dev should not usually be as big as production)And it should be accessible. If that is local, partially or totally on cloud, it depends on the technologies and capacity of your machines.Then there should be a test environment - I usually refer to it as INTegration. It should have data enough to test volyme/stress, and it should cover all cases - both success and failure cases. Most companies that have this just make a snapshot of production (depending on technology, a virtual one), but that leaves security issues (may need some maskung/synthetic data as well), and really doesn't guarantee that all possible edge cases are covered, only the ones that happened in the past. This is the hardest dataset to curate and maintain.It's common for INT to not be directly accessible, just via CI/CD or by a few controlled accounts. That's mostly OK, the test results should give deva the info they need.And then there's pros.Some companies have more (an UAT Env, separated unit, integration, stress test envs, etc), but these 3 are the minimum to give devs productivity and peace of mind.",

However, the overarching point is that we can do these types of workflows because everything is designed to be composable. The composability is enabled by the expression system in Ibis and Arrow standard that we can build interfaces around. Our primary usecase is portable UDFs (backed by datafusion engine) and optimizing workloads based on the engine choice. The asof join usecase just happens to fit really nicely and has an added benefit of performance and guarantees provided by the semantics (not just functionality) that is common in ML. In ML, you may require asof joins to safeguard against data leakage, particularly useful if you deal with time series data at an organization level. Here is the duckdb blogpost on how they optimized it We currently support a handful of engines but Ibis (the expression system xorq is based on) support 20+ engines. It’s really easy for us to add support for another engine (SQL or Python) so let us know if something that may benefit your workflow is missing. We believe this work is necessary to build pipelines that can be easy to reason about and optimized without tying to a single engine/ecosystem. Also, composite workflows are super common so might as well do it right!",

That way if you mess anything up in your pipeline, you don’t need to find the hard drive again. Use dd to create a disk image, and build a pipeline off of that. Parquet is a good general purpose way to store time series, and also works well for logs and images (hint: use zstd compression for large blobs, not snappy). Importantly it is fast and compact, and this data is optimal for your analytical/ML workflows. You can also set up batch reading/writing if your dataset gets bigger than available memory. Then records can be loaded from parquet to your OLTP database. Depending on how your data is stored on disk, duckdb could be a good tool here - especially if you have a larger than memory workload. It supports reading data in many formats, including raw blobs or text data (for images/logs). It can then store the data as parquet or in a .duckdb file - the export to parquet can even be batched, which is where it comes in very handy for larger than memory workloads. It supports connecting to/from some OLTP databases like Postgres, so you can insert data.",

Alternatively connect the hard drive and do a distributed copy to a cloud store and point your OLAP to it. The main pain point was ensuring that the data pull ran fully (retry logic, DLQing failed chunks), while ensuring that I didn';t take down any production systems.You could try cdc, but that will require a lot of infra. You can also use a tool like dlthub for incremental loading (https://dlthub.com/docs/dlt-ecosystem/verified-sources/sql\\_database/advanced#incremental-loading) if you don't want to write the chunked pull yourself.

        "body": "For a sneakernet use-case like you just showed, Parquet is likely a pretty safe option that gives the best of a couple of worlds:1. Compression (this is especially useful for highly compressible data such as sparse sensor feeds)2. Very portable — Arrow is basically a first-class citizen from Parquet at this point, meaning that Parquet as an intermediate checkpoint maximizes portability of your data into any subsequent systems. 3. With proper partitioning, storing and accessing this data into the cloud is likely going to be extremely cheap. Any other always-on database solution is going to be really expensive :(4. For multimodal data, you can most likely get away with storing a URL pointer in Parquet, and the raw data as a file with an appropriate encoding (e.g. JPEG). These encodings work best because they’ve been honed over the years for compression ratio and compute required to decode the data. As for the engine, check out Daft (https://www.getdaft.io) which is built for multimodal data like images that you mentioned! It also handles all the bread-and-butter stuff like numerical data etc of course. Also with the added advantage of being able to go distributed if you need to (at the upper end of your data scales in the terabytes).",

If you can steadily get this happening, then next step would be conversion to a file format that's readable by most systems, like parquet or JSON. Then capturing this to a data warehouse for centralised analytics workflows. For example, snowflake can read S3 data using the 'external tables' quite well - this is good where files are just added over time and records don't change.I used to be a mass spectrometry researcher so I understand what you mean about the closed source export methods. Be careful about vendors like Thermo trying to sell their cloud solutions, unless you like paying for a suite of contractors and a funky proprietary cloud solution.The interpretation can be left to the scientists. If it's clean and in one place, it shouldn't be an issue for them. Though it's worth testing at least one pipeline with them to ensure it's fit for purpose. And honestly even just getting data into S3 might work for some, as many researchers I knew (myself included) were comfortable using python to analyse cloud data - otherwise probably R.",

Do you want to produce a weekly calibration report and dashboard to show the machines are in spec? Do you have a particular kind of analysis that is repeated multiple times a day that you'd like to automate?For the use case of calibration reports, we collaborated with lab management to have a technican use the machine's proprietary software to export the raw data and a standard analysis to a csv report, and we stored these csv's in a specific network folder. Periodically, a scraper searched the networked folder for new data and loaded it to the warehouse. An ETL cleaned the data and formatted it so that it could be displayed on the calibration status dashboard. The cleaned data were also available on the self service abalytics platform. Lab data is challenging because it's ofte less structured than data from an API or service backend. At all times you need to make sure the extraction and transformation process is representative of something physical that really happened. It involves a lot of conversation and buy in from stakeholders and lab management to do this right. So, I'd recommend to start there.",

I'd recommend having a folder structure by instrument name, date, and split it either by user, by the test, or by both e.g:`FTIR/01Jan2025/Test/file.csv` or `FTIR/01Jan2025/User/file.csv` or `FTIR/01Jan2025/Test/User/file.csv`(I label dates like this because for my sins I have spent time working in QC where I sent samples around the world and we needed a universal date format everybody understood)This will be on your local network so all computers connected to instruments can dump the data there and then you have a single location to point your data processing tools to.> The output files are typically in a binary format. Instrument vendors usually don’t provide parsers or APIs, as they want to protect their proprietary technologies.This is a huge ballache. You'll want to put all unprocessed binary files into their own folder and convert them into a digestible format if absolutely required. Bear in mind each file might need it's own process, hence, the ballache.> In most cases, the instruments come with dedicated software for data analysis, and the results can be exported as XLSX or CSV files. However, since each user may perform the analysis differently and customize how the reports are exported, the output formats can vary significantly—even for the same instrument.One potential way is to have a standardised output. I get this massively depends on the instrument and testing although if that's possible, it would make everybody's lives easier.> Even if we can parse the raw or exported files, interpreting the data often requires domain knowledge from the lab scientists.Which makes complete sense. What happens to the data after you parse it? i.e. do you email it to specific users, do you have it printed out? etc> Given these constraints, is it even possible to build a reliable ELT/ETL pipeline?I'd say yes, although there's a high level of complexity.",

In my previous life I was a molecular biologist and I quickly found out that essentially all of the devices I used “proprietary file formats” were literally just XML. Obviously I don’t know your equipment, and I might be saying something very obvious to you, but reiterating that you should actually check this, don’t assume proprietary format = binary. If they are readable, you can either write custom parsers, or find some online.That being said. It is quite ambitious to try and reimplement a whole bunch of specialised lab equipment software at scale. I think that a lower (but probably achievable) aim to set yourself would be to just try and centralise data storage, put in place good metadata, versioning, etc. I reckon the “T” in ETL/ELT will prove difficult.",

People like to think if they can touch their server or hug their storage, it is better than hosting it in the cloud. It just isn't true. There are more controls in the cloud for access control and security than I have seen in anyone's data center and I have seen many Fortune 100 companies data centers. Starting from physical security to data in flight & at rest to designs clouds are almost always able to be more secure. The issues come with knowledge and implementation. This is the same no matter the location.I have secured data in cloud providers where not even the CSP can get to them and they remain very performant. It just takes a bit of creativity on your part.From an architectural standpoint, splitting your analytic workload across a wide area network is a bad idea. The physics just work against you. The bandwidth between on-premises and cloud is never enough. Consider bouncing a 1TB table at one location against a 1TB table at a different location. Even with tricks like predicate pushdown and column reduction, you will still end up moving quite a bit of data to compare/join the tables. That has to happen over a WAN instead of an internal bus. It just doesn't fly. Like I said, the physics doesn't lie and can't be bargained with.The term \"Lakehouse\" is a Databricks marketing term and not a technical one. I try not to feed marketing monsters. The concepts behind their particular flavor of DW have been around for a long time. Don't get confused by a new coat of paint.",

If I may make a suggestion, if you're not dead set on your current strategy; is record the sensor readings natively (which would usually be a KVP/time series data shape), then in a separate pipeline/application use pandas to aggregate it the way you want and store *that* data separately. (FYI this is what 'historian' applications historically do, pandas and the cheapening of digital storage just kind of made them dinosaurs).This would usually take the shape of defining integers as indices to correspond to each sensor reading, then storing the human-readable name of that sensor in a different table. Maria will have no trouble keeping up with that. I think my most taxed maria instance handles 8k inserts a second, and handles just fine performantly on query.All depends on how you want to look at it on the front end. Influx/Grafana is designed to look at time series data; PBI to look at relational (it can *technically* portray KVP data but it's distinctly terrible at it)",

Key technologies are Debezium for CDC, Kafka, Flink.The industry is moving aggressively in this direction. The operational and data worlds are getting closer and closer, and what I'm seeing happen rapidly is that a lot of data engineering work is increasingly being done by software engineers. What this means is that data engineers who are only skilled in ETL are going to be left behind rapidly. And it's not just because ETL is \"different\", it's also because traditional ETL workflows usually don't adhere to the same standards of CI/CD, testing, etc. as services written by software engineers.What I've witnessed was that a huge part of a financial platform that used to be owned by DEs, was completely replaced by services owned by SEs. The DE's had a bunch of messy scripts in all sorts of places, typically Spark jobs, that were orchestrated by airflow and run once a day. About half of all of that was replaced with near realtime Flink jobs, that were adhering to the highest CI/CD standards. The costs more than halved, and no-one was woken up in the middle of the night anymore.So this doesn't mean everything will (or can) be replaced. But it did mean that there was a hiring freeze for DEs, while more SE positions were made. The story I'm telling is from a company a friend works at. But the same is happening at mine, albeit a bit slower.Read about shift-left with an open mind.Apart from all that I'd look into Iceberg. It's gaining momentum at a rapid pace.",

Having an understanding of data modeling can help shape how data professionals approach data applications and is what sets us apart from a Software Engineer “building a data pipeline”While those two may seem boring, gaining a mastery in each topic will be key to progressing as a Data Engineer.Lastly, just to throw out an actual newer technology is open table formats (such as Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Hudi).

        "body": "*This is long, feel free to TLDR and move on.*Here's the problem with interviewing programmers. Most of us work with a large codebase that can take quite sometime to learn and work with, partly due to its size, partly due to its organization, and partly due to knowing what the program does. Consider a tax program. How long would it take for you to learn the various tax codes used to determine how much taxes you owe? OK, maybe if the software was well-designed, that part would be isolated to areas where tax experts could work on that logic.But in many other situations, as part of building the software (or, more likely, maintaining it), the programmer becomes the de facto expert.If I'm interviewing you, I can't have you look at our production software. Let's skip past the fact that it might be proprietary. Simply put, in an hour interview, you can't learn enough to absorb even a fraction of the details (which is often why people feel completely insecure when they're hired and have to deal with software that they don't understand).In the past, sometimes the key was graduating from a top university. If you went to Stanford and could answer basic questions, then that degree could get you hired. The reputation of the university was enough. It was also common to ask people brainteasers (I'll give you one in a moment). It was thought if someone was intelligent enough to solve brainteasers, they would be good coders. Turns out, not so true. Some people love and are good at brainteasers (for example, I liked brainteasers) and this can make such people feel perfectly qualified. After a while, the so-called FAANG companies realized brainteasers didn't really help.The technical questions that were often asked in interviews were often confined to intro courses up to data structures and algorithms. That's because the typical CS major takes a bunch of optional electives in their 3rd and 4th years (in the US). You can't assume a person knows SQL or neural networks or undecidability or even NP completeness (at least, proofs of such problems).They'd ask basic coding questions, instead.But with leetcode, they can ask similar kinds of questions that rely on data structures and algorithms. These problems are self-contained, and more importantly, can be programmed without learning much and done in around 100 lines or less.This is clearly not the kind of programming most people do which is why you're not so good at it. This skill is kind of important, but it's like learning knife skills and being able to chop something quickly. Maybe a working chef needs this skill. Maybe it's nice if a home chef has this skill. But you can make a great dish without this skill. It's a nice to have that may come in useful in certain situations.You can do a simple search `how to solve leetcode problems`. There's even a leetcode subreddit /r/leetcode. There's a YouTube channel called neetcode where the guy tells you strategies to solve leetcode style questions. It's popular enough that there are lots of resources out there.These questions have become today's brainteasers. They share similar qualities, but they are also unrelated to most typical programming.Finally, I mentioned a brainteaser, so here is a common one.> You have eight seemingly identical balls. One ball out of the eight is heavier than the other seven identical balls. Your goal: find the heavier ball. Your tool: you have a scale that tells you three pieces of information: the left side is heavier than the right side; the right side is heavier than the left; the two sides have equal weight.> Next piece of information: If I put an uneven number of balls on either side, say, 2 balls on one scale and 1 ball on the other scale, then the side that has more balls is *always* heavier.> One restriction. Each time you use the scale, I will charge you money. You want to save as much money as possible. What's the fewest number of weighings you need to find the heavier ball? And, tell me how to find it?The other kind has to do with estimation or weird mental puzzles. * How many gas stations exist in the US?* If a commercial plane had its wheels on super treadmills that could go very fast, but the plane stood still (just as a runner on a treadmill doesn't go anywhere), does the plane lift off? Explain your answer.Sorry for the long reply. It was meant to show why leetcode questions are being asked and to explain that it has little to do with your ability to program, but has become this necessary evil (it's not evil, to be honest, as it's useful but not essential to know this) in programming interviews.",

The plans can be way too ambitious trying to duplicate a CS degree.A CS degree takes four years, and that's with help: friends, teaching assistants, professors, tutors. Plus, there's pressure taking classes. You have to get assignments in or get penalized. You have to prepare for quizzes, exams, and finals. This means a typical CS major has to work at an accelerated level.I've always thought that you keep your plans much shorter, like a few months at most. It may feel daunting to learn as much as a CS major, but you don't have to. If you can't get past the first few months, then a 3 year plan won't matter.Some feel making the roadmap is the end of the story. You have to follow the roadmap, but it's like learning anything. It takes perseverance. For example, let's say you want to learn to skateboard. You're going to fall a lot. Some will decide that falling a lot is too painful, and if they don't see any signs of learning the trick, then they quit. The same could happen in programming.As long as a person realizes that, much like learning to skateboard, it may be painful (not in a physical way) or frustrating and that they need to be patient, then maybe they can achieve their desire to learn programming. Knowing it can be a tough road can help, but you need to get started.",

That said I've only \"been consistent\" since January, which is a relatively short period of time but still way longer than I've ever stayed focused on it.I had dabbled in Python in the past, played around with an Arduino, but never really went beyond following instructions, and I got bored. For me, this kind of approach meant I never really could work out what to do on my own when faced with a problem, nor could I creatively think of how to apply concepts.I know this isn't just \"programming\" but I went the other way and bought some electronic components, then worked backwards trying to understand how to get my devices to work together. That made me encounter issues with memory (as an example) and led me down the rabbit hole of all kinds of concepts - some of which would never have been a part of any of these tutorials. So now, I find myself more engaged, more ready to even experiment in my programming and with a list of things I want to try/make.I'd also note that I'm a hobbyist, so I'm not looking (at least for now) at learning programming as a way to carve out a career, which allows me to take it easy and not feel too down when things aren't working.

Not that I didn't want to, but when I did, I'd freeze at my keyboard. I knew I didn't know something but I didn't even have the words to say what it was, so it was just a slog trying to know what I didn't know, but with enough determination I got there and it snowballed. I knew more each time and started recognizing things I'd already learned as being useful for a problem I was trying to solve.Some people pick it up really fast, others, like me, don't but that doesn't mean they aren't smart enough to figure it out",

You have to be baptized by fire.A Senior Dev shines for their reliability, good judgement, critical thinking and work ethic. All of these stem from vast and diverse experience.",

Do you know about semantic versioning? What constitutes a minor or major change?* How do you write your new features so that it is backwards compatible with older versions of your project?* Do you consider running cost of your code? Think about scalability? Security?* Is your project's code monolithic or does it make more sense to have a micro service architecture?These are just some of the things a good senior developer should be aware of that a solo hobby programmer usually does not (need to) think about in my opinion.",

Make it known to the seniors around you that you're really invested in learning, ask to take on harder tasks, be willing to say \"I don't know how to do that but if you give me a chance I'll figure it out\" and sincerely mean it.I think the big thing that stops juniors from becoming seniors is a lack of ambition - some people, a lot of people even, are content to just do their job and not stretch themselves to learn or do anything new. But if you show you've got intelligence and motivation and are eager to step up, the opportunities to do so are usually there - they just usually aren't handed to you.A lot of this depends on the specific work environment you're in, of course. Big tech focused companies tend to put more thought into how to develop talent, but if you were employed there you'd probably already be asking whoever you report to during a performance evaluation instead of asking us. But at smaller companies or non-tech focused ones, you might have to be more forward in hunting down opportunities to grow.I am writing this assuming you're already professionally employed as a software developer. If you are not, work on that first before worrying about what being a senior looks like. :P",

When I first started programming, all of the programs I had to write were for things that didn’t interest me or were not practical at all so I didn’t really care.One of my interests is investing in the stock market. One day I was wondering whether there was a way in which I could predict the direction in which a stock could go and whether I could achieve this with a program. I found a tutorial online that did it with one stock, but I changed it slightly, so it worked with another stock I wanted to see.It didn’t really help at all because you can’t really predict anything in the stock market with absolute certainty, but it was still really cool to write a program that accomplished this.TLDR: Think about something you really care about/are interested in and try and find ways to write programs that help you understand more about that topic(s).",

Let me throw my opinion.You're asking yourself how a \"programmer\" thinks as in, what's the type of mentality you should be following to produce proper code.But the truth is the code and good coding practices is just one of the many tasks one actualy has to think of about because being a \"programmer\" almost never means _just coding_.The actual job involves a lot of aspects, to name a few potential examples: finding customers, understanding what they need and want, planing resources like time and money, concepting about data transfer, data quality, user experience, security aspects, documenting all of the above... and endless others.You can study all you want, do plenty of tutorials and watch a dozen YouTube videos but without a proper project this all means little, and this is the reason many people fail to find a job or gather experience to begin with.So here is what you should be doing: simulate projects. Find yourself either a friend or family member. Inform yourself about their daily tasks, their interests or hobbys and figure out where there could be need to have an application or automatization process to make their daily routine easier.Or, at last resource _pretend_ that you have a hypothetical customer, take up on different and role-play with yourself (for example, pretend that you're Person ABC, a developer, DEF, a customer, GHI, a project manager, etc, and even send emails to yourself).Now that you have a _reason_ / a project to code, research about all the steps that a project usualy requires from start to finish (GPT can help you if you don't undergo a specific training) and go through all of the steps.Yes, this will triple or quadruple the actual effort rather than just coding, but this is essential for your experience, professionalism, and ensuring you've concepted and properly planned the actual development phases and don't end up stuck in a loop of overcorrecting your implementations, because you also must set yourself time and hypothetical budget deadlines.There is only so much information I can provide here in a few sentences but I hope this helps you understand how a \"programmer\" works. Being \"just\" a programmer doesn't realy exist. You will in most cases be at least a team member, preferably also a Consultant, potentionaly even a project manager or even a freelancer. Grasping all the involved roles and being able to understand their minimum requirements will help you understand what's actualy important.Also, last tip, start very small, with little apps and \"customer expectations\". Stuff that seems easy done and implemented can add a lot of effort and grow the project exponentionaly because each part of the project needs some extra time for that specific aspect to consider. Keep it small, keep it simple. You can always add more to it when the basics are established",

But with that said I'll give you the advice I give to devs.If you really wanna get good, start from the ground up and learn C. It does not hold your hand and allows you to make mistakes and shows you really how computers work. After that, build difficult projects, don't watch step by step tutorials or copy code. It will be a struggle, but you will learn a lot when you force yourself to do these exercises. I suggest things like a web server in C, Building an ORM in any OO language. The truth is the more you struggle the more you learn, and at first it will be extremely frustrating, but it will pay off in the long run.",

What language, and libraries do you have to or want to use? Systems development? What tools do you want to build and what hardware will you be supporting? One reason people get hung up on where to start is they don't know what road they are on or even where they want to go. Answering these question will narrow things down considerably. Once you know what road you're on, pick a destination that interests you, something that you would enjoy building and may even use yourself when you're done. If you want to get even more spicy then build something for someone else to their specs. Once you've determined your environment and what you're building then start small and keep building. Most big projects are a series of smaller projects that are fit together to form a whole. List what you need in the order that you will need it. For example, a website to provide a public bulletin board would need:1 ) A landing page that explains the purpose of the website2 ) A login page that consists of a page to create a login, a page to actually login once a login is created and a page to recover a forgotten password. 3 ) An admin page that allows a user create, modify and cancel their postings4 ) A postings page that shows the postings from the various users.That's a simple example, and far from complete, but you get the idea. Each of those steps can be a separate mini project on your way to creating the whole project.",

There are tester / Quality analyst for that But a good developer can able to think and run that steps in mind mapping to find potential bugs.• Bug Bounty : Early days practice is key to learning, later days it becomes less practical but more logical and thinking.

It’s something I could easily do without AI but I wanted to see how AI would do. That being said, our project owners and our testers here couldn’t build an app on their own in a million years with current technology. This is definitely something that requires a prompt driver that understands the underlying technologies. The main app I work on uses Oracle for a backend database and it’s a very complicated setup.

Having a cheat sheet is helpful.So, work with git is done locally in your local folder where you store your source code. When ready, you explicitly send your changes to the master copy on the remote git server. To open a code project (and any of its branches) locally, you need to copy it down to a folder on your local machine. That’s what git clone does. It makes a local copy of a remote repository that you will then work in. You generally use it once when you join a team working on a codebase or if you get a new laptop or something.Once you clone, you get to the second command: checkout. In every other source control system I’ve ever used, checkout means you want to edit something and want to prevent or inform other users of that. In git it means either you want to switch to a certain branch or you want to make a new branch from the current branch. Just remember that. Checkout is for local branch switching and changes nothing in the remote repository.Here are the basic commands for doing local work and explicitly communicating it to the remote master copy:Fetch - I want to update my local list of branches and their history so I can view what my coworkers did and maybe checkout someone else’s branch if needed.Pull - I want to update my current branch with the latest changes from the repo. This may prompt a merge if there are conflicts. You often do this to update your local copy of a main develop branch and rarely the one you’re actually working in.Push - I want to send my committed changes to the repo for other people to use. This may trigger build automation.Stash - I want to preserve select changes in a local side store while rolling back the files for tracking purposes. You do this to preserve a draft for future use.Merge - I want to move changes from my current branch into another (e.g. I’m done with my feature and want to merge it into the main dev branch). This is done locally. You pull dev first. Then commit and push the merge into it. That merge btw, is often done using a process called a pull request which puts a review request in front of the merge.",

It doesn't matter how simple, or whether it has been used before. The first games I wrote were: A top down racing game similar to Rally-X. A top down shooter similar to 1942. A pong game with powerups. A pong game played on an elliptical playing field where both players could move around the entire ellipse and the ball changed colour when you hit it (so you lost points if the ball went out of the ellipse when it was your colour).These were all simple games, and some of them never got finished, but it taught me a lot about how to build things, and projects like these helped me land my first job as a graphics dev.For school, make sure you pass. Go to office hours. Find other students you can study with. There were times during my university days when I locked myself in my room for 2-3 days. No computer. Just a textbook and some paper. I read the textbook and took notes by hand. Then I read the textbook again and took more notes. Then I copied my notes and cleaned them up. Then I copied them and cleaned them up again, until I was at the point where I could probably write them out again without looking at the textbook. I did whatever it took to learn the material.It will take time. Find time every day to put some effort into it, even if it is only ten minutes. After I had three kids, I wondered how I would ever be able to learn something new again. Then I realized that even ten minutes a day adds up to \\~60 hours per year. The first year I realized that, I taught myself how to play the guitar just by spending 10 minutes a day practicing. Then piano the next year, then flute the year after that.The point I'm trying to make is that it will take effort and time, but you can do it, and it will be worth it in the end. But it starts by choosing a project and building it from scratch. Then rinse and repeat as many times as it takes until things start to sink in.",

It's crazy.If youre having trouble understanding what you don't understand, to the point where asking questions at all is hard, I do have one trick to take with a massive grain of salt: explain what you can to AI and ask it to rephrase what you say or point out what areas you're leaving out the most. Honestly, the act of explaining things to someone often shows me what I'm missing, but it also helps me when my brain is mush and I can't even begin to explain my lack of understanding. I'll do my best to explain what I can, even if it's between curses and insults and self-admonishment, and it's usually able to parse through the mess and pull out a bit of self confidence. It reminds me I AM absorbing something, but it also forces me to look at what I'm missing. Don't rely on it to spoon feed you the information because it's been proven that this negatively effects your ability to find the information alone, but having it rephrase your knowledge can help with your thinking of it, and, importantly, give you keywords to help your real searching, which you should always be doing outside of AI.",

For coding I find it too difficult to condense notes into really short fragments that you can quickly glance at over and over again to drill concepts from short term memory to long term memory. If the notes are too long, I'm not gonna end up returning to each of them 20+ times.Notes work so much better for something like language learning or philosophy. For language learning you can write word lists where you feasibly will return to every word 20+ times and reach that long term memory. And for philosophy you can do the same with 1-2 sentence long quotes.Also, (for most of us) coding is our profession and not our hobby, so in a good way we are kind of forced to get that long term exposure to CS concepts anyways through our work that will lead up to the concepts sticking in our long term memory.",

Identify something you want to create or solve using programming languages as a tool and then plan it out and develop it. You said you want to build everything you want - what’s one simple thing you can start with? Some of my earliest projects were simple things like a Spotify playlist generator, a text based RPG, a very simple image based RNG anime battling game, and this was in addition to projects I did in school for my degree. No other way to start than to take an idea and apply the software engineering process to it!",

Avoid copy/pasting code and try to do your own version of what is being taught. My partner has been a dev for 10+ years and in his free time works on projects to continue to solidify fundamentals. Especially when he's learning a new programming language. 2. Use pair programming with others to practice your technical communication and problem solving. There's no pressure / learning quite like working with another person. You can join this slack group if you want to meet a community of developers who meet to pair program (https://join.slack.com/t/codesmithx/shared\\_invite/zt-344q2e9dd-HtR4EmgU5U\\_q3dBYgc28yw) Full disclosure: this is related to the company where I work, but I do feel it's an excellent resource and we have folks at various levels looking to pair program)",

There are two types of programmers: those who like the lower stuff (ex: people who mess with algorithms, kernels, optimizing aggressively to get even 1ms less runtime) and those who like the higher stuff (building unicorn and changing the world). You just might be the latter, since you put an emphasis on wanting to build something. Leetcode is most definitely for the former. Use AI. To learn (not to vibe code). Ask it what it needs to know, and learn what you don't know from there. Then ask it how to build what you want. But don't just copy and paste everything—read the code, understand it, and then type it out yourself. Repetition makes perfect. Also, everybody learns and understands the world differently.

Google if not. Okay, now you need to draw something. Do you know how to do that? Google if not. Rinse and repeat. You will be doing a lot of googling. This is normal and expected. Be patient.

You usually don't use classes in Python, but you will need to structure the classes. Think of the Service Class as the class that defines the functions you use in the Application Class. The Application Class is supposed to be the one that is run and will provide the UI and functions that are built on the Service Class. 2. Learn How to Use UML Diagrams. UML Diagrams will be very useful in the long run as they tell you all the functions you need to program with. Here's an example structure: \\------------------------------------------------ | Class Name | \\------------------------------------------------ | Variables in the Constructor | \\------------------------------------------------ | Functions in the Class | \\------------------------------------------------3. Think of the Language as Python, but instead of tabs, you use curly braces {}. You also must not forget to add the include for the scanner. The scanner is like the iostream C++ library. It provides functions used to take in input. Make sure to reference the scanner by using Scanner scannerName = new Scanner(System.in); So those are my tips. If you have any questions, please reply to this message or ask ChatGPT.",

        "body": "Hello, I am a little late to the party but will chime in here... From a hiring perspective, especially for junior / entry level, \\*what\\* your project does is almost irrelevant. I do quite enjoy asking candidates \\*why\\* they worked on this particular problem because hearing about how people have scratched and itch that they have found is usually quite interesting and clue to how they think about the world. However... it's 98% about how they have structured a project and how their code looks. I'm afraid, as an apparently satanic friendly Russian has already pointed out, there is quite a lot of issue with the code itself and this, I feel, probably would work against you. When I am reviewing code I am expecting to see some consideration of 4 groups of people... 1) Your usersI don't mind that there is not a UI, there are plenty of technical, command line utility projects out there, but why are you telling me what I need to call my files? You have a CLI tool, where are my flags and options? Why do I have to accept all your hard coded values like 'chat.txt' and all the thresholds and things? Why can't I configure these on the CLI and experiment with the results? This is a CLI tool for technical users right? Who are they? What are their skills and what might they need? 2) Future developers looking to understand your codeThere are plenty of improvements to be found here. Separating the files, and not doing things like calling regular expression variables 'pattern', which can be clearly seen by the fact that you assign it a.. well... pattern. What pattern? What is it for? You had an opportunity to provide a descriptive name here, and you went for the most 'technically correct, but useless' option. This is a microcosm and applies all over your code. Go through it, and refactor giving consideration to other people who will want to understand what you are doing. 3) Future developers looking to \\*extend\\* your codeWhere are your hooks? You don't have to have a network accessible API but where are the places in your code that future developers might hook into to provide additional or improved functionality? I'd like to see that you have thought about where things might go next and left the code in such a way that somebody other than you might pick that up and run with it. 4) The reviewer This, in some sense is an extension of number 2, but if you are submitting your code for review for job applications you want to be applying number 2 here to a more elevated degree than you even might in other projects. I don't see a single comment in your codebase. Comments are a bit out of a fashion on some professional codebases right now because people have the (correct and noble) goal of writing 'self-documenting code'. Few who attempt this can do it effectively honestly and you definitely can't right now (not a dig, this might be the hardest coding skill to actually learn and takes many years). Without self-documenting code, you need to be documenting with comments. As a reviewer I don't have a huge amount of time to spend on each application (especially at junior where there are, these days, potentially hundreds), so if I don't 'get' your code within a few minutes, I will probably put your application into the 'maybe' pile to come back to if other applications are not better. I need to return to the 'maybe' pile for an applicant perhaps 5% of the time... because there is usually something better. Your energy and drive is great, and you have picked a problem and solved it. Really good for you and don't be disheartened. Many, most, juniors have \\*nothing\\* to submit, you just now need to take what you have done and think about the 4 groups I mention and consider their needs and interests and you will have something very valuable to put on your resume. Good luck.",

The larger companies will not analyze this, but instead put you through competence tests that they themselves devise, so I disagree with the reasoning behind some of the other comments here. The projects on your CV at your level are to demonstrate domain interest and active learning.For higher level roles, your current project would not count as a large project that holds the same weight as an employment entry on your CV. The closer your project is to a product then the more likely you would be to gain/pass a product-centred interview stage(s). It's perfectly fine to gain product development experience primarily through employment though. So you should really be focusing on being valuable over pretending you are a highly experienced product developer.From here, in my opinion, you've got two options to continue your active learning - develop this project into something closer to a product, or begin a new project that fits a target domain. The point being, don't spend time upgrading this project at the expense of genuine interest, by for example; appending unit tests onto it. If you want to genuinely learn about test-driven development then begin a new project. Adding unit tests onto a project after the development stage would skip some of the development process insights you could gain from doing it properly.",

C could be a great second language to learn low-level programming, but not to start with. Ruby would be great for things like web development, but it's also getting up there in age. Unless there's a \"library\" (someone else's code they've put in a package for you to use) that's only available in Ruby, I would stay away from it.Also, it may be worth looking into Anaconda and seeing if that doesn't do what you want to do. It may be a great place to start coding, and it also may be everything you need. Also I could be wrong about what you're working on, but you may end up finding R to be helpful at some point (it's pretty easy to pick up though, especially after learning something like Python).",

Assume they all have a deviceA, deviceB, deviceC etc.Then you learn that the pairings are wrong. So personA should have some other device like deviceB, B==>C etc.- No person can at any point be without a device.- You can immediately swap a device for another device from warehouse (so you can not swap from person to person).- you have 1 temp device0 to work around the first rule.Your goal is to minimize the amount of swaps to as low as you can, and handle all pairing orders.Maybe a list of 350 people only needs 10 swaps. Or maybe it needs 200 swaps. Figuring out that was fun.",

The good news is, once you realize how one language runs with editor and the relationships of editor,IDE, library and framework. U know everything. I spent on c# for two years. The rest languages I only spent 4 months. Of course you should know how to interact with AI and recognize the error of its answer. You should know read the doc by yourself and find what's going wrong with your code. It's a long road but I hope you can insist. Day by days training is very importantFirst, insist 1 hour per day.

The first time I learned block chain knowledge is November last year. Including what is EVM, vscode, wsl. I started to learn Solidity and javascript. Use javascript p5 to make nft and solidity to deploy contract. Then I turned to learn Move and nextjs, for development on Sui chain. I saw my comment is minus but i didn't lie. AI gives big help. Accelerating the whole process. If u don't believe me you can check my own community . There's link about my coin on Sui and if you know about this you can check the deploy time of that contract. Chain record can not lie. It's just few days ago. I didn't remember what language Solanna uses but I'm sure spent some time on that. The key point of learning is you like it.

That’s what LLMs lack. They can “reason” but they can only hold so much context. While humans can do this almost indefinitely and switch contexts at will without having to be instructed. That’s what makes humans so adaptable. We can kind of change our brains instantaneously to solve a problem. We can come up with solutions on the fly while LLMs are essentially just looking up the answers to things stored in a database quickly and telling you what it thinks you want to hear. Human best guesses with little information even when we’re off the mark often put us closer to the answers we’re looking for. We humans can teach ourselves by copying others 1:1 and then reproducing the steps to solve similar problems.",

I would (based on what I know) not consider it the equivalent of CS50x which is based on a Harvard course. That is, it's not aimed at a Stanford CS major (with Stanford being one of the highest regarded CS programs in the US), and therefore might be too challenging for a typical beginner. It feels like it's more beginner friendly and slower-paced.In that case, I'd probably do CS50x. CS50p you could even do along with CS50x but they have different emphasis. CS50p is more like a series of Python exercises and is not CS50x in Python. CS50x is trying to introduce computer science concepts including programming, but covers other topics (later on) beyond just programming.I would recommend CS50x. Search for `cs50x edX 2025` and you can sign up for free at any time, and go at your own pace.Because you've already had a year of programming, you should find the programming assignments (called problem sets) easier than most, but they are still fairly challenging. Most of the core material is in C though the first \"week\" is in Scratch which is a visual language aimed at beginners. Although the course is broken down in weeks, you can go at your own pace, either as fast as the course goes or much slower, depending on how much time you have available.That's my two cents.Otherwise, you can look for courses in data structures and algorithms.Many of the courses you've mentioned are aimed at beginning programmers with no experience. CS50x, admittedly, is fast-paced. The nice part is you'd learn some C on top of Python you already know, which could be useful.",

The fact is, despite being a Harvard course, you don't get college credit. The reality is you earn college credit by paying for it, but as an admitted college student at Harvard (the yearly tuition is about 60,000 US dollars which is around 52,000 Euros). In any case, it's an introductory course at Harvard, so it's not worth a whole lot. But, as mentioned before, there are ways to get it for free once you've completed the course.There's a bunch of follow-up courses. You could even start CS50w which is by the same folks that made CS50x which is \"web programming\" in Python. As you know Python already, learning some web programming is generally useful even if you decide, later on, that you dislike web programming. It's just so common in industry, but they often don't teach it at unis which prefer a more classical, formal approach to computer science.",

Where do we start and where do we end.Let's start near the top, and cover the upper level bit.When you fire up your web browser, you basically get a blank canvas.You type in the Domain Name of the website and hit go/enter.That domain name is then looked up using a name resolution system called DNS (rabbit hole one) to get it to resolve to an address. This is very similar to you looking up your friend Bob in the contacts list on your phone, since names are easier than numbers.The browser then sends a request to the server(s) residing at the address it got to download your web page. (Another rabbit hole here). This is done using the HTTP protocol (more rabbit hole), the web page is then likely to be created using HTML as the markup language (more rabbit holes). The HTML might inform the browser it needs additional bits which require additional requests to the server or even other servers. These include things like stylesheets (CSS) to make things look pretty, code (JavaScript), pictures (PNG, GIF, JPEG, etc), videos (MPEG4, etc), sound/music (MP3, WAV, etc), and others.After the first HTML page is downloaded the browser will start to render the page and all the content and the code may start to be executed. The code might do nothing until you interact with the page, or it might send a request to a server for some dynamic data, which would be another HTTP request to some server somewhere.Each HTTP request might involve a different server which we don't have the address for yet, so that would be another set of DNS requests to look up those addresses.That's the near top level of how a website works with your web browser. Your next question might be how all these abbreviations, protocols, and the like work and how they all work together and for that we have a variety of central standards that specify how these work so everyone that needs to can implement their own. The majority of these are what are called RFCs (requests for comment) managed by the IETF (internet engineering task force) and we also have the w3c (world wide web consortium) and a few other organizations/groups made up of industry specialists like IANA (they're more involved in the DNS side).We have a generic model for a lot of this called the OSI model, and that allows us to navigate the rabbit holes and find the occasional breathable pocket.Hope that helps, Wikipedia has a lot of the extra information you might want to learn about, but beware of the rabbit holes (they're everywhere).",

        "body": "You might be jumping a bit ahead of yourself here... Here's a brief rundown of how this all works:Your PC has a network card. That NIC uses some black magic to establish itself as a given IP on your local network, let's assign it as 192.168.1.20.Any traffic on your network will be able to talk to your network card using that address, and if your computer talks to anything else on your network then the recipient will see it got a package from that address.One such device on your network is a router, which is also connected to your ISP's network.When your computer tries to make a request to something not on your local network, say.... 8.8.8.8, then it asks the router if it knows how to get to 8.8.8.8. The router then asks the ISP, the ISP knows and then tells the router which tells the computer, the computer then sends the packet to the router to give to the ISP to give to 8.8.8.8.A similar process works for resolving domain names to server IPs.So when you go to google.com, your browser asks your network card to ask your router to ask your ISP if that's possible. It is, and a request is sent to whatever address that google.com resolves to, \"Give me your home page.\"Google's server receives that request and after some processing sends back an HTML file, and probably a css and a JavaScript file. So an HTML file comes from Google to your ISP to your router to your network card to your browser, and a web page renders. Then your browser also executed the JavaScript that got sent and applies the css, not necessarily in that order. The JavaScript can then phone home by asking the browser to ask the card to ask the router to ask the ISP to give a message to Google, and so the cycle continues.TL;DR: By the time you get a webpage, a connection to the server has already been made at least once. The browser handles most of the details of connecting. The JS can make subsequent requests if the programmer deems it necessary",

Turns out, there’s no solid iOS app that can play MP3s from iCloud easily. So I went full overkill and decided to build my own music player app (with SwitfUI), purely for personal use.It ended up being a really solid learning experience — plus I actually solved my own problem instead of waiting for someone else to. That’s usually how most of my projects start: small frustrations turning into something to build.",

If you understand that concept, you pretty much know all that you need to to make an Application Programmer's Interface.

        "body": "POV: I've taught CS for many years, including general programming and APIs.APIs are a specific style of data transfer, which is a variation of input and output. So what you're wanting to learn is a particular style of programming. That's a good goal, but you need to learn general programming concepts before you can comprehend a specific subset of coding. There are two distinct ways of thinking about APIs, and both depend on some knowledge of core programming ideas. First, you can write a program in any language that *consumes* an API. That is, you can write a program that uses an API to find the current weather in Barbados. This is a relatively straightforward process in most languages, but typically you learn this after you've learned more fundamental things, like how to get information from the user or from local files, how to handle looping and branching, and how to write functions.The other way to think about APIs is to *produce* an API. In that sense, you are writing a program that lives on some type of server that produces data in some kind of machine-readable format (usually JSON, but other formats are certainly viable). This is also not a difficult process, but it requires knowledge of essential programming concepts, and typically you'll also want to write a front-end package to test your API. I would say start with any good programming course. There's a good reason Python is taught as a first language in most CS courses. It's reasonably straightforward, and is excellent for a number of use cases, including working with APIs. You can read and create APIs with Python out of the box, but for creating an API, you'd probably be better off using a library like flask, bottle, or rapidAPI. I would definitely learn standard programming ideas first before digging into libraries. Express.js is fine, but it's a specialized form of JavaScript that doesn't make any sense if you don't already know how to program in vanilla JS. It seems to me that CodeAcademy has a more organized curriculum. It doesn't go straight into using APIs, but that is fine. If you can't drive yet, race cars don't matter. Learn to program in a language, then we can focus on the particular skills you want. FreeCodeCamp is great for looking up a specific skill, but it often makes a lot of assumptions about what you already know. I have some videos of my own I can send you, so DM me if you want that.",

It doesn't help for add or subtract operations. And constraining its errors is hard for multiply and divide operations.It's mostly the kinds of functions based on mathematical series (square root, cosine, that stuff) that might have a significant power or time savings from allowing reduced precision. But the processors have gotten so good at this stuff that almost nobody needs that. And memory has gotten so cheap that lookup tables are often a decent way to speed up those functions, once your code gets to the point where you're ready to use some kind of reduced-precision function evaluation.tl;dr no.",

        "body": "This is an interesting topic. But usually no they don't, because they're implemented in hardware which only supports a few precisions.Traditionally, those have been 32 bit and 64 bit. With machine learning, we're seeing a lot more interest in really, really low precision because it still works \"pretty dern good\" for big fuzzy matrix multiplies. So you'll see FP16, FP8, BFLOAT16, and other variants. But those are mostly confined to GPU tensor computing, not general purpose processing. For 99.X% of general purpose applications, the hardware is super super fast and you don't care that much about precision. If you do care, you should probably be using fixed point.A good way to think of floating point is as a fraction between powers of 2. So for numbers between 32 and 64, you get 32 \\* 1.XXXX. That [1.XXX](http://1.XXX) fraction is the \"mantissa\" and the power of two is the \"exponent\". The number of bits in the mantissa gives you your precision. It's very precise near zero, and it gets a lot less precise for really big numbers. You can simulate any arbitrary precision you want in software though by just storing all the mantissa bits and simulating the floating point operations with fixed point.Another interesting bit is that for machine learning, they do care a lot about the buildup of errors from layers and layers of floating point. They normally fix that by normalizing the output to be between 0 and 1 at each layer rather than messing with the precision of the multiplications.",

That is necessary whether you are fresh out of school or have decades of experience. So don’t let your fear of that situation lead you to irrational choices.It is a good idea to work on projects larger than yourself. That’s because a big part of professional programming is devoted to maintaining existing code and adding features to it, and that kind of work is very different from starting new projects.But keep in mind that each open-source project and company has their own customs, processes, and taboos around all this stuff.

Try to find out what are variables(int, string, etc), loops(while, for), conditionals (if/else). It takes a while to get comfortable with these key concepts so learning a bit over the summer can make the first few semesters less painful.For math it helps to figure out if you had any gaps or weak spots in highschool and try to improve on those. Or go and find some youtube channel that makes math fun as the university lectures can be quite plain.I personally had a hard time with math. So on the side I completed courses on Khan Academy before trying to learn the same subject in my university. Maybe nowadays ChatGPT would be a good alternative.",

It’s still requests and responses. Also make sure you understand the Ruby syntax trend of leaving off method argument brackets as well as omitting the hash brackets if the last argument is a hash. As far as networking, you can network with any developers, go to other language meets and just say you’re curious, there shouldn’t be any gate keeping. Think about how you’d implement whatever they talk about in Rails.Job wise, if you can show you built something and answer questions about how it works and the decisions you made, you’re halfway to being hired regardless of language.",

        "body": "Well, two things! Or actually three ...*(Disclaimer: I've been teaching DSA to CS college students for the past couple of years)*Networking has always been a bit of a badly treated step-child in most computer science educations - the curriculum varies wildly from school to school, sometimes even from teacher to teacher. Some like to dive into using Wireshark to view packet-information, some like to talk in abstract terms about routing protocols, and some focus mostly on the application layer. And I don't really think there is a correct way - I mean, I've seen students being examined in the DHCP and ARP (without understanding which layer they were in), and I've seen students talking in extremely generic terms about DNS, but unable to resolve a hostname to an ip-address, and I've seen students proficient in Wireshark, but unable to use the Network-tab in the browser ... So, it's all kind of bad :)But, I also think that networking, as soon as it goes beyond the simple use of existing application protocols, like for web programming, is much more of a domain specialty, than fundamental knowledge that every programmer should have. I mean, as long as you understand that packets can be lost or damaged, everything else is depending on the specific application you are working with.And unfortunately, I think that students and teachers alike, forget that programming is more about understanding the domain, aquiring new knowledge, and adapting to work in whatever environment you encounter - than it is about storing fundamental basic knowledge of a random selection of systems and algorithms. And then the topic of DSA has had a lot of exposure in later years, especially as companies turned from fizzbuzz to leetcode interview-questions, and at the same time there is a lot of cookie-cutter courses in DSA that a teacher can just take and reuse - make the students buy the book, and verify their solutions with the examples given by the author. Easy work, not like checking if they have managed to understand a domain. So - yes, freshers don't know a lot, if anything about networking, but they shouldn't be expected to. However, they should be ready to learn on the job, and no amount of DSA will help them do that. DSA is a fascinating topic, and gives a lot of good insight into how to understand the challenges of programming - but it has hardly anything to do with the domain outside of the programming language, and it is very easy to fall into the trap of just learning/teaching DSA for DSAs own sake.)**Help your new hire learn the networking topics! Make sure he understands that he isn't done studying!**",

They whiteboard the high level solution and we pair the implementation with me at the keys and them driving. I also have them explain key concepts to a non-tech to see how they interact with others.

Then write code that allows you to flip, rotate, invert, greyscale, crop, magnify, etc... but write those functions yourself (don't use a library). What happens if you try to open something that isn't an image?What happens if you try to save the changes to a location that doesn't exist?What happens if you mark a file as readonly (via the operating system) and then try to save using your application? You might look at writing a simple text editor as well, that allows doing the basics of formatting (font families, colours, sizes, etc). These seem like simple concepts, but if you really sit down to write them, you'll find you need to analyze issues and work out solutions.Good luck.",

However, it is generally a slow process, maybe much slower than you think. For example, if you were a computer science major, you might not be able to take a game programming course (if it even exists) until your 3rd or 4th year (in the US).That's after you've had two years to learn a language and other topics that CS majors learn.You're probably hoping to get there much sooner, like a few months, right? There are some simple-ish games you could start with that are text based such as tic-tac-toe and Connect Four. You'd be surprised how hard it is to program such simple games. You say it's easy to play, but not so easy to code.But yeah, first get better at Python. Spend at least six months before thinking of another language. In particular, learning these other languages (if you find Python hard) won't lead to magic success. You could search for `cs50g edX` which is a game programming course offered by Harvard (for free). It has a predecessor `cs50p edX` which is a Python course. The course is Python programming and the followup, I believe, uses PyGame.",

If for now you are still learning and dont need very fast programs just use python, and when you are gonna need eventually a faster programming language that is still pretty easy try Java.

You might, for example, find work as a front-end developer that is not fussed about your API skills whatsoever. But more often than not jobs tend to be full stack. So aim for that if you can.

If you made a ___ program go see how other people wrote theirs. But you're never going to not make (sometimes incredibly dumb) mistakes. Part of doing anything.It sounds like learning SOLID may help you a lot. Organizing, maybe write out the project in psuedocode first if you struggle.The wiki/sidebar here might have some good suggestions on programming principles as well.As a small aside, I learned web dev from the odin project just to make some web projects.

It is equivalent to asking lawyers \"Is there a way to see that all my arguments are correct and I'll never lose a case at trial?\"You absolutely will learn over time ways to design better (if you have not looked into the concept of \"design patterns\" that's probably a good starting point), and while experienced developers won't make the same dumb mistakes beginners make, they'll still have to go back and redo things pretty frequently. And that's not even including the times it is completely beyond your control, like a client making a dramatic swerve on their requirements after your team has already completed a lot of work!A chief skill you'll have to develop is the mental toughness to keep plugging away even when it gets frustrating.",

Thing is, if you're afraid of doing that, then it's tough to get started. Chances are, you don't know what your program should look like when you're beginning.Rather than spending hours upon hours on planning something only to later change your mind(or even worse, get attached to your initial idea because you don't want the effort you put into it to go to waste), instead try things out, see what doesn't work, figure out how to make it work better, and so forth, until you arrive as a cohesive whole.Framing the early stages of your project purely as a exploratory learning experience is quite liberating. I think that you should only begin properly implementing the project when you're ready and confident with your design, and I believe that you can only get there by trying things out and figuring out everything that can give you trouble, first hand.",

There are more if you get into a big thesis level discussion with theorists and such, but your average coder probably thinks in terms of 3. Those are the machine's actual language: ones and zeros, the computer is wired electrically such that circuits have power or not, if they have power its a 1, if not its a zero, and these 1s and 0s represent actions and data. The next level are low level languages, which humans can work with but are extremely tedious. Most of the low level languages are considered \"assembly\" languages and that looks something like move data from memory to a cpu register, perform an action on it, and move the result back to memory, possibly with other things like jump to a different next instruction if that result was not zero. Its explicit, step by step telling the cpu what to do. High level languages are the third, and those gloss over the tiresome details by providing a way to express a bunch of those tedious actions in a simple, natural way. Instead of moving memory to a register and a result to memory, you can just say x= a+b or something akin to that. In all cases, the code you write is rendered to machine language eventually. Machine language is what you think of as a 'binary' or 'executable' program file -- you can look at those with a hex editor if you know what it means, but its largely gibberish if you are not an expert at dealing with machine language. Assembly is almost, but not quite, one to one conversion to machine language. High level code has two major approaches, compiled (turned into an executable file, a runnable program) and interpreted (turned into an executable program in memory instead of into a file on the disk, which is executed and discarded, but can be modified on the fly to some extent as it is running, and observed as it is running). This is grossly oversimplified, but maybe it gets you something about what you are asking?It seems like you are confusing the operating system and computer programming. They work together, but are totally distinct things.",

It's not what is really a high level language, it's \"how it's the abstraction even realized\"? I stopped on the surface of the question, wrongly.But that's a question for a cs degree path, hardly for a reddit post",

        "body": "So, basically, I've realized my issue with getting started in programming (which I've tried to multiple times) is that I've always thought in terms of my individual files in a text editor, and never beyond it; I wasn't thinking in terms of an environment, for terminals, programs, file systems, etc. I was thinking wayyyy too myopically. So my question was two fold: what is the information that a program is? from another comment, I now know the terms \"source code\", and what that information is in the computer's 1's and 0's distinct from post compilation (machine code). I ask this, because I wanted to see what the actual process it is I am doing is here. Plus, because I don't know what it is I am not knowing, this is an active attempt to organize my information into a conceptual synthesis, which is hearable in how rambly this is (I am self aware). With that, I didn't know what a developer environment is, with CLI, what commands actually are, and how this integrates across the file system of the computer, so when I get told by VS Code that something didn't work, well that's just that, because I didn't know what a command even is in terms of what's happening in the computer when I tell power shell something. So I am trying to learn each part here, and make sense out of a full picture I, in the past, didn't realize I was missing. Now I see it clearly. I am trying to understand my local environment, developing on my own laptop here, and how these different pieces are speaking to one another across my local system. So when I try and get an SDK to be knowable to Powershell and usable in VS Code terminal, now I understand that what it is I am trying to do is, across the local system, how these components get to know each other, that I know what it is Powershell is and what I am doing when I execute a command, so if something with say, Dart, doesn't work, now I can actually troubleshoot, because now I have any semblance of what it is that it is I am trying to do. I am trying to execute a command, getting windows to look for a program and do something with it (based on the command). I am attempting to learn how these pieces, miscellaneous without an understanding to structure them, actually integrate into a system, and that system is my local environment, so now knowing that, I can move fluently throughout my local environment and actually get things going here. TL;DR a lot of my trouble was outside the code I've written over time, and I never thought in terms of an 'environment' when programming, and now realizing that, I am trying to understand my environment, as that is the next step in becoming skillful in the world of computer science.",

Based on what I studied: You learn C++ to learn how to program stuff, then you learn OpenGL to learn how to work with 3D using C++. With that, you already can make a game engine. Based on Udemy courses length, in 2 months you can learn both. If you want to make it even easier, maybe learning Python before C++ could help. Because it will teach you programming logic, you can make some games (and 3D engines with it using OpenGL too) with it, and when you learn C++, you will basically already know the majority of it, will only need to learn the syntax.Also, I don't know your experience, but if you didn't made games before and/or used game engines, creating a new engine as a study projects will be complicated because you won't know exactly what does a game engine needs to have. Maybe a game engine focused on a type of game would be easier to make, and better for portfolio, because you won't be making a generic game engine\", you would be \"solving a problem\", for example, an engine specific for creating demakes and PSX style games. This is hard to make in Unreal, where everything is so realistic and modern. Or a game engine for TCG and board games. I want to make card games and play/test them. We can prototype an RPG or FPS game really fast in Unreal or Godot, but not a TCG.Those are the \"problems\" I have, so I personally would love an engine for that. There is one on Itch.io that is a pokemon-like game maker engine. If you want this project to go further, maybe conquering a niche like this would make it easier to stand out.",

The overall look and feel are on point. The way you’ve implemented functionalities, like task clearing intervals, is really smooth, and the light/dark mode toggle works flawlessly. Seriously, great work—I'm genuinely impressed!Now, just sharing some feedback and more of the approach I usually take:Once the design is finalized and everything’s working as expected, I like to take a step back and imagine I’m just a user—not the creator. I try to look at it from a fresh perspective and ask myself: *What could I do differently? What can I learn from this?*So, doing that here—on the initial “The Toh Do!” screen, I noticed the white space is quite prominent. The left side is dedicated to a vector graphic, while the right side houses the task list. If it were me, I might consider removing the vector and instead using that space for something functional—like a dashboard or a timer countdown panel, which could add value and balance out the layout.One cool thing I picked up from your code was the use of Redux Persist. I’ve typically just used localStorage directly, but seeing how you’ve integrated Redux Persist has definitely piqued my interest. I’ll be exploring that for sure—thanks for the inspiration!Keep up the awesome work—this is a solid project and you’re off to a great start!",

Commit the stable files to the repo by running `git add $FILENAME` follewed by `git commit`.Now you have a snapshot of those files saved in your repo. If you edit them from that point, you can see how they changed from the time they were committed with `git diff`, or you can revert them to how they were with `git checkout $FILENAME`.The point is, you don't need the Testing subfolder any more. You can safely modify the files in situ. More importantly still, you can back-up the repository to a remote host like GitHub, GitLab, or a self-hosted solution.I don't know if it's game changing, but I really like Fish for its programming language. I think it's much nicer to use than Bash or Sh. I also find Groff really good for producing documents",

I don't actually use it for that because I rely on some old-school features it doesn't support, and I'm too set in my ways to ditch them.However, it also has a scripting language that I find much more intuitive and consistent than Bash or Sh (which is what most people use for shell scripting on UNIX systems). It's really easy to learn and I prefer it for any shell scripts I want to write for personal use.> From git, since i have more than 10 programs i made that i use everyday, and they run locally (the production folder is literally what is being used) and cant work on testing in the production folder, cause it will repercute in the execution of the scripts locally.So I'd just keep the production folder out of the repo then. I do something similar to you, but I copy scripts to `$HOME/.local/bin` when I consider them stable. Again, this presumes that you're running Linux, but you can create any directory for your production scripts and add it to your PATH in Windows or macOS as well. (I'm sure you're doing this already anyway)",

There is also functional programming, and several others.Object-oriented programming has some hate, which I think stems from the fact that a lot of courses teach OOP using very bad examples - things that should just be done procedurally - and the fact that Java in particular makes it hard to do procedural programming even when it makes sense to do so.OOP is excellent for encapsulating state and methods to act on that state.Procedural programming is better for things where you don't need to - or can't - maintain state. For example, a RESTful API endpoint is best written as just a standalone procedure rather than being a class method, since the API is inherently stateless and thus there is no state to encapsulate. However, during the lifetime of that API request, you may be creating and manipulating objects as needed to generate the response.",

Then, record it using something like Zoom. If you want to save space, it could just be audio. If you have a lot of disk space, then video is great.The idea is to simulate teaching. Why is teaching great? Because it forces you to come up with explanations that make sense to you and for you to think about it on the fly. As you're writing the script, you may struggle with how to explain a concept. That's where the learning happens. Coming up with a good explanation helps solidify the concept in your head. Then, lecturing about it helps you reinforce that. It has the added benefit that you can explain things to others. Speaking is a key part of this.If you just learn it, it may be muddled in your brain how you know what you know. If you write it, that forces you to organize your thoughts into words. If you speak it, that helps you discuss the concept NOW. There's an immediacy to speaking.This is a lot of work, but it takes a lot of work to help put the stuff you learn into long-term memory.",

After writing down a concept, annotate your writings with personal notes with your thoughts/understanding of a given topic (e.g. relating the topic to something else that it reminds you of) 3. Consistency: rarely does any user of programming language understand ALL of it (this isn’t specific to programming, but instead ANY area of expertise). A data scientist might understand every facet of Python’s Pandas module because they have to use it every day. But if you asked them about AI training, they may not have much to say. A programming language is just that: language. Use it to solve a problem. The particular problem you have will determine the types of things you learn (and hopefully retain). As such, you will be using the same tools over and over again - the same way a carpenter uses a power saw and a mechanic uses an impact wrench: perhaps the other person isn’t good at using the other tool, but is good at using his/her own. 4. Having a community (like this one, or preferably an in-person one) where you can share your thoughts on your interests and have discussions with others is a HUGE way to retain knowledge. The truth of the matter is that you’ll learn a lot and probably forget just as much. But to think you need to know everything is tantamount to memorizing a phone book",

If you didn't have that stack, it should have been in you to acquire it in the time you were unemployed. Also, \"wrong cloud\", AWS is all you need really, vast majority of companies are predominately in AWS. Again, if you didn't have the basic dev AWS certs, then that was on you to acquire it. Also, 2 years @ 20 apps/day = 7300 apps. That, combined with a rigerous and well-thought out leetcode, sys design and tech stack knowledge acquisition, mock interviewing and resume refinement via professional reviews should have gotten you over the finish line, so there are some strategy gaps as well. But I don't think that the strategy or the technical gaps are the primary issue here. The fact that you are too ashamed to tell your own parents that you were In the worst emotional and financial state of your entire existence, and the fact that you feel ashamed about getting a job from someone in your network (yes your family counts as your network you butt), tells me that you have some deep cutting emotional well-being and self-esteem issues, and you need to start openly talking about with your significant other, your parents, your best friend and a therapist, all at once and right now. Your emotional well-being underpins everything, how you pursue your goals, what your goals are, whether you succeed at them or not, you're technical ability, quality of work, job performance, etc... it is the bedrock of a human being, and just from reading your post I can tell that there are huge flaws in your foundation which undoubtedly has resulted in your extremely abnormal turmoil. If you need anything from me whether it's technical or emotional, feel free to reach out to me anytime, but regardless, I would very strongly recommend to you that you start to really talk to your parents and your friends and family more about your feelings and your life and start to rebuild your self-esteem, because any emotionally healthy person would have immediately told their parents/inner circle minutes after losing their job, and any person that is emotionally healthy would have immediately reached out to friends and family and past coworkers for support in times of need and wouldn't have generated much anxiety at all about taking a job from a family member in a time of an absolute dire financial and emotional crisis.",

The downside of this role type is that when revenue falls or growth stalls, this is where the first layoffs occur.If your work is not tied to revenue generation, it's seen as an operating cost and companies are always looking at finding ways to reduce operating cost. This role only exists because they can't fire you...yet. The upside here is that these roles are more protected from layoffs since your work is required for continued operation.If you want work-life balance, stability and security, publicly funded work or unionized/protected work is (or was) your only option.If you think things are different in other fields of work, think again.

In two seconds, I found some statistics on the program I did, OMSCS: [https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/surveyed-alumni-nearly-unanimous-saying-omscs-program-worth-investment](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/news/surveyed-alumni-nearly-unanimous-saying-omscs-program-worth-investment)You can also find more granular data, like payscale: [https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-type/bachelors/engineering-schools](https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/best-schools-by-type/bachelors/engineering-schools)If you study computer science, the data says you'll have access to high paying jobs. The issue, is that all the statistics were collected and students enrolled when the job market was as hot as it's been in 20 years. What can schools do about that? If you enrolled in a CS degree program in 2021, checked the statistics on matriculation, you'd be in quite a surprise today. A university has no course of action they can use to help that",

Everyone flaunts about how being a generalist is the way to go when in reality, big tech are the only companies who dont care about what tech stack you use or experience. Every other company that is not big tech wants someone well versed in the stack they use.Its not about the market being good or bad, its always been like this. No one wants to hire a front end dev with 5 YOE to work backend unless its node.js if their backend is in java they will just hire a java dev.Its the similar principle to people who say they have 6 years of experience but in reality its a 2 2 2 model where they have 2 years of experience in different stacks and then all of the sudden you aren't qualified for a senior role because they want someone in that particular stack with the experience to match. I will die on the hill that specialization is the way to thrive in this field if you are not targeting big tech.",

Overall, it has been a struggle to hire the numbers of engineers desired, and then for the teams there to perform adequately.Management thinks of it like India without the timezone issues and with few cultural/language issues, but it doesn't really work out that way. There are still a lot of issues with communication and collaboration. Teams there feel left out and can end up disengaged.It's much easier for Mexicans to work in the US on TN (NAFTA/USMCA) visas, which means the strongest potential hires are already working in the US and not interested in taking a pay cut to work back in Mexico. Unlike India, there aren't as many graduates produced either, so the hirable market is probably even smaller than in Canada even though there are more people there overall.",

Academic trainng is extremely just super helpful for any knowledge work jobOther than be extremely good at what you're currently doing, having a natural interest in CS, and trying out random things all the time, is a huge benefit. For the last decade plus of my career I've really just followed the oppurtunity, and each step was just a different role in the process of building web applications. So I have done several different roles, but taking a step back, my skillset is unified under a broad \"develop web technologies in emerging domains\". That said, for every transition, I've always narrowed in on one thing I want to do, and just apply to jobs of those types. Like my last job I was a team lead of an infrastructure team, and didn't really like that, so I decided my next job would be some sort of product engineering. That got me in to a big tech company, and now I get paid enough to just focus on leading a team, and besides a reading group and some side projects, I don't really stress about keeping my skills up.",

Got canned end of 2023 after taking a month-long parental leave. I took most of 2024 off to raise my newborn. I tried to convert to Data Analyst, didn't get much success, one place rejected me after I passed their leetcode because I lacked biomedical signal processing knowledge; did 4 interview rounds with an industrial imaging company before getting a reject (I passed their take-home programming test in round 3 but failed their coderpad test in round 4. My programming speed is my weak spot, I'm great at applied math/stats/machine learning, not so great at cooking up timed leetcode solutions). I'm also fed up with the grind mentality in tech and the frankly vexing way a startup runs. So I decided to change career back to engineering. I registered as engineer in training with my provincial regulatory body. I'm already getting more replies and interviews. I just did round 2 at a firm in the energy sector. That's the final round. If I pass it, I'm in.",

A doctor can talk to NurseGPT all day, but something has to put in an IV and hang a drip line. A lot of robotics actually being used are incredibly simple, flat boxes that lift up 3cm and move pallets around for example. Robotics that can stand in one spot plugged into a wall and do the same thing over and over like on an assembly line, sure, but the power usage and overheating problems need to be worked out for autonomous units. And they need to do something about LLMs confidently giving you the wrong answer before anyone will trust them.But let’s say they iron out all the kinks; I’ve heard upwards of 60-70% of jobs could be replaced. Our systems are not setup to handle such massive unemployment. All these giant tech firms are not going to give up their earnings to contribute to any form of UBI, the line must go up! There are too few politicians that aren’t bought and paid for that will actually stand up and do something. In the long run this is all just another big tech bait-n-switch. They can run at giant losses for years, maybe even decades as they continue to subsidize everything with the parts of the business that make money. They will sell a restaurant a waiter bot with the latest wAIter model installed, but it can only stand at the hostess podium, and tries to seat people at already occupied tables 30% of the time. Human Robotics promises it will replace your entire wait staff in 5 years so a few people lose their jobs. But turns out the wAIter model was just a chatGPT wrapper making API calls the entire time. Human Robotics is running out of seed money, so now before the robot will seat your customers they must watch a 30 second unskipable ad for the McDonalds across the street.It just seems like if everything works out the way the big tech companies want it’s the worst possible outcome for humanity.",

Basically having in house engineers is expensive unless you know how to keep them working and getting them what they need to stay coding instead of getting wrapped up in planning and other bs.

This is true of pretty much everyone - it's hard to truly value what someone does if you don't understand how it gets done, and specifically what's hard about it.People who don't code think that coding is just writing instructions for a computer like you'd write instructions to another person. Or they think coding is just like excel. Executives? Whole different breed. To them, all work is menial. The only thing they get to see is results. PowerPoint decks. And I think when you do that long enough, you start to very quickly forget that people need to actually do the work.So when the work is not getting done - deadlines are missed, the product isn't good enough, whatever - your first thought isn't \"I need to get in there and figure out what's going on\". Your first thought is \"I need someone to get this department's ass in gear\".A lot of people hate on middle management, but that is literally the role of middle management - to both be close enough to the work to understand what is and isn't getting done and why, while also being above the work enough to be able to tell executives what they need to know (and what they want to hear).",

You could be in any career, in any field, in any position and still get laid off. This is just the way of the world.With your YoE, you should be getting messages from recruiters on LinkedIn and other platforms that can easily land you interviews. Try premium for a month, spruce up your LinkedIn and add all the common skills you see across the job descriptions you are interested in. Even if you don’t have the skills, read up on docs and just get a basic understanding so that you can speak to it during interviews. Add those skills to your LinkedIn and Resume, I guarantee your profile starts getting hits from recruiters. Talk to the ones who supply Job Descriptions you’d actually consider taking. This is genuine advice that worked for me. I found a position after about a month and a half with 7 YoE (NYC area) which is really the same as 5 in the grand scheme of things.I’m sick of hearing people cry that CS careers are over. There will literally always be a need for SWEs. If you think AI will replace us, then you clearly haven’t used AI very much yet. It fucks up a LOT, and is really more of a tool than a replacement for people.The job market will eventually recover and you will be able to get a good job with good pay. Stop dick riding FAANG as well. FAANG is what made the market what it is because they over hired and over paid for people and set unrealistic expectations for what SWE careers should actually look like. They set a standard for unrealistic hiring practices that is not reflective of actual work we do on a daily basis. We’re grinding LC for months just to do a job where we do basic system design and basic logic. It’s absolutely ridiculous.Also, FAANG looks good on resumes, sure, but so does experience in any real job where you can back up that experience with technical knowledge. If someone is gonna hire you just because your resume says FAANG, then they’re an idiot and you probably shouldn’t work for them anyway.Lower your salary expectations a bit, you have to realize that you’re in competition with a ton of other people who were laid off and are all expecting to make more money than what they were making than when they were laid off. It’s better to have a decent paying job than no job at all.",

There's a lot of people willing to take a pay cut, or work longer hours to be part of something they are passionate about. So people get into it thinking it's going to be a fun job. Then the reality hits - a lot of the time, you might be on a huge team, just working on a very small part of a game without a lot of say in how the game is put together. It becomes the kind of work you'd do anywhere else, it just gets plugged into a game at the end. Ultimately, I think the gaming industry is kind of past it's prime. There was a time when a team of 1-10 people could build a ground breaking AAA game. Rollercoaster Tycoon was built by one dude, for instance. Now, AAA games are made by teams of 100+ people. But the games don't cost 10-100 times more just because they required an investment of 10-100x what they used to. Game Studios are much less likely to take risks, it's just like games like \"Call of Duty 153, Ultra Future War\" or whatever, there's not as much innovation which I think is why a lot of people are drawn to the work. So people who love gaming get into the industry. They are smart enough to make 50-100% more doing any other corporate job, but the game companies know they can get top talent for a fraction of the price, and in fact, need to, because of how expensive development has gotten.

They are stuck grinding it out while thier passion slowly leaves them, and they not only don't like their job, but they also don't like video games anymore.",

Companies know full well that the people working for them are doing so because they have a passion for it. These people aren't going to quit because of a bad culture because they have a \"passion\" for what they're doing.There's a very powerful power dynamic there. For a SWE that isn't tied to an industry, they can just find another job if they're ever unhappy. When you've tied your entire career to a specific industry, you don't have those options. You get to go to another company that also has a terrible culture. You have no bargaining power. Companies are very aware of this.I'd argue most passion careers suffer from this same issue. When there's a niche passion fueling your career choices, you will be taken advantage of.",

Talent is seen as less important, both in number and quality.

Feeling out of your depth sometimes just means you're growing. That said, it’s also okay to want something a little different. Some folks find their groove in more stable, documentation-heavy environments; others thrive on the chaos of building fast and figuring it out later. Neither is better—it’s just about fit. If you're unsure, try talking to other engineers (in or outside your org) about their day-to-day. You’d be surprised how many feel the same way you do, even if they don’t say it out loud.",

First week in they give me work for their critical release which touches 4 different repos and e2e testing responsibilities to ensure the release goes smoothly. All to do within a week…like wtf. Basically no onboarding, just giving me tickets they would give to someone more experienced. Prob been the most stressful 2 months so far of my life. Never faced anything close to the understaffing and pressure when I was in finance. Got told we would be getting a senior on the team but that me and the other junior would onboard them lmao",

Well, I did once when we were getting wiped out by L1 visa abuse. Have job stress if you aren't creating it.Everyone got problems. A bad day at a restaurant is being stiffed on tips or being too sick to come in and getting paid nothing. You can have a better life than most people if you buckle down and keep applying and interview well. Selling yourself is a skill.

Now on to the original question, there's actually **alot**. And it **varies**. Meetings definitely happen and they take a lot of time but meetings encompasses a lot of things we do. Meetings can be technical discussions or product discussions for instance. They can also be pair programming, debugging sessions, bug finding sessions... so many things. As to some things AI cannot do well compared to a mid level programmer? They are terrible at writing code that scales well and they are terrible at high level context (use them in big code bases). This is why when I use AI, I make it do more specific tasks that way it understands the context better and its more limited in scope so its easier to refactor to be good code. Or I use it for throwaway code for MVPs at which point it doesn't matter if the code scales or not.AI is still great though and is a good productivity boost but its nowhere near a replacement for any competent mid level dev.",

If you don't believe in the mission, you aren't going to have the dedication to be successful there. You also need to know when it's time to jump ship.If you want a stable 9-to-5 where you can plan your life, startup life unfortunately isn't it.If you want to stay at the startup, you need to create boundaries and enforce them else that startup will consume your life and your health. If your boundaries clash with the company, it may be time to move on. Your health is going to be important to you long after the company goes out of business or gets bought by another company.Every startup is 6 months from shutting down. You are one heartbeat away from dying every moment of every day. As long as your heart keeps beating, you're alive to wait for the next beat, and life goes on. It's the same way for startups. Instead of heartbeats, it's customers and funding rounds.Don't let the startup drama sink you. In the end, it's just a job. We want it to be a lot more than that, but at its core, it's a way for us to pay our bills and hopefully more our careers forward.",

It sounds like your team isn't taking ownership and that they are happy being dependent on you. It could be that you just didn't hire strong candidates, or it could be that something in the company or team dynamics isn't helping people flourish. It sounds like you are pushing to upskill others, rather than others being the driver of their own growth. This means management needs to get to work. It's their responsibility to create a healthy team dynamic, where everyone is pushing to be better every day, actively trying to upskill themselves. But fixing this situation isn't your job - it's the job of management. So my question for you: what is management doing about this? Do they see the same issues? Do they have a plan? Do you have confidence in their plan? If the answer to the questions above is \"no\" then I'd start looking around for other opportunities, because the situation is likely to persist until some crisis happens that forces management's hand.",

Practice answering behavioral questions like time management, communication, etc. Also practice programming puzzles because that’s generally apart of most technical interviews.

You don't have to be a good coder to get a decent job, you have to be a good interviewer though. Leetcode til your hands and brain hurt. Actually do and learn the blind 75. Use Blind as a resource, you can find posts about interviews at specific companies and tips on what they're looking for in interviews. Leetcode also has tagged questions that are similar to what you'll be asked in company interviews. Read grokking system design. As a new grad the focus will be on coding and some minor system design. If you know system design super well that will really make you stand out. Read tips on behavioral interview questions. Learn from recruiter feedback from failed interviews.Do practice interviews. It's especially useful for new grads. If you have friends in the industry ask them do mock interview you. There's also pay mock interview services -- never done that personally but ymmv. Research the company before you interview, have good questions about the technical aspects of the company-- read their engineering blogs and core values. Be excited about the company and job when interviewing.Don't lie in your resume about tech skills -- a good interviewer is going to discover it and rail you. Don't be afraid to say you don't know during an interview. If they ask a question and have no idea, tell them you're not 100% on it but \"this is how I would approach \" solving the problem. Think aloud, they want to see your thought process about how you approach the problem.Target swe jobs at non-tech companies (like banks, healthcare) -- the interviews tech to be easier. Good luck!

The hiring manager isn’t spending more than 25 seconds/resume, they don’t have the time to fact check everything. If you get a more in depth interview, and they try to look for the company online, you can shrug it off as a super early project or some other BS. It won’t matter though, by that point you are in the interview and can shine regularly. Did this with my Capstone project and it’s the pinnacle of my resume. It’s always brought up in phone interviews, and I actually DID the project so I can talk about it in depth.",

In the meantime, work on your own projects that you can showcase (if that’s applicable for the type of roles you are aiming for). I work in tech myself and my bf is a senior lecturer at a university - he can never put enough emphasis on the fact that his students needs to do whatever it takes to stand out from the rest.

Especially if you have been at your company a while. And if you trust your manager, you should tell them that you are going to. Here is how you can frame it: \"I have been pushing myself hard and accepting everything that's been thrown my way, and I've been trying to do things as quickly as possible. I think I need to stop doing that, and instead be honest about how much time and availability I have, otherwise I'm risking getting burned out.\"I have literally been told by my managers (as in, multiple have said this independently over time) that it's okay to go slower, and in fact, sometimes it's preferable. The only thing it's not okay to do is not communicate.So for example, if you get a Slack ping that's like \"hey, I'm seeing error X in app Y, can you please take a look?\", instead of saying \"I'm on it!\" and then frantically trying to chase down error X, say, \"sure thing, I can look in [a little bit/30 minutes/this afternoon/tomorrow/when I'm back from lunch]\". If that isn't good enough, the person asking is going to explain why. You can also literally just say \"sure thing, when do you need info by?\"The same is true about projects. If you are not particularly interested in a project, it is okay to step back and listen and only speak up when you have something important to say. As long as you are aware of what's going on, learning when your input is needed and when to let others speak is a valuable skill. (Personally, I still struggle with it.) People will notice if you are obviously disengaged, ignorant about what's being discussed, or making them repeat themselves. They won't think to themselves after a meeting, \"Boy, YonghaeCho sure was quiet,\" and if they do, it's only for a fleeting moment - and if you spoke once or twice because *you needed to*, they won't think that at all.Overall: It's not just okay to slow down, it's good to slow down. You will feel better and be better at your job in the long run.",

I was laid off as a mid with 8+ years of experience and decided to increase pay which automatically put me deep into senior territory.

        "body": "Never take Glassdoor reviews as truth. The one and only thing you should use them for is to help you formulate questions to ask during the reverse interview process, and so you know what you keep an eye out for. Then based on the reverse interview you need to form *your own* opinion on if the company sounds like it has any of those negative traits you read about.The obvious reason why you shouldn't take those reviews as truth is they're often by disgruntled employees, or employees pressured into leaving good reviews by HR while they're working there. Neither end of that spectrum is reliable. Rarely does a content employee just think unprompted to themselves \"You know what would be fun? Let's go write a fair, unbiased review about my very average employer!\"But beyond that, companies change over time. A review that was accurate even last month, might not be accurate today. All it takes is a single change in management, and a team's culture can shift literally overnight. So just because someone said they worked long hours, doesn't mean people are still working long hours. The reverse is also true, just because someone said the WLB is great, doesn't mean it's still great.Teams within companies also vary drastically. Even at small companies. I worked for a startup once that had \\~30 engineers, spread across a few teams. The team I worked on was super laid back, modern stack, essentially no red tape so we moved very quickly, etc. Even pre-pandemic, we'd only come into the office once or twice a week, and nobody was watching us so sometimes we'd just WFH all 5 days and it wasn't a big deal because we got results. But another team was the polar opposite of us. Their stack was older, they had a *ton* of red tape, they moved very slowly, produced very little, and they were straight up told by the CTO that they need to be in the office strictly 3 days a week because they needed to get their shit together.So if you read a bad review about Team A, it doesn't mean Team B will share those traits. You need to talk to *your* hiring manager about *your* future-team to figure out what that team is like.The startup I mentioned earlier had a fair amount of negative reviews on Glassdoor talking about nepotism, and it being a boys club, and that if you're not buddy buddy with the CEO you'll never have any career growth. When I interviewed with my hiring manager and the CTO I didn't get those vibes at all. The culture seemed amazing, which is why I decided to ignore those reviews and join them. Lo and behold, the culture was great. I was absolutely *not* buddy buddy with the CEO, or anyone for that matter, and my career skyrocketed at that place. I've gotten the biggest raises I've ever seen there. It was a great place to work. The person complaining about nepotism probably just sucked at their job and got fired, and decided it'd be an easier pill to swallow to blame nepotism instead of themselves. ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)\\_/¯",

If you become a SWE, you'll probably end up as a people or project manager later in your career anyway. You are very young and have plenty of time. Here's what I would recommend:1. Get a BS in computer science. Any accredited program is sufficient. You don't need to go to an ivy league. 2. Apply for internships, your sophomore and junior years. They don't need to be a top-tier companies, but it helps a lot if they are reputable, household names. Doesn't have to be a tech company, but that certainly helps. (I've recently seen FAANG hires who interned at IBM, FedEx, Walmart, Uber, etc).3. Build s***ty software in your free time. It doesn't need to be elegant perfect code. Just think of a very simple idea and write a solution in code. Then add simple features to it. Refactor and improve your code as you go. This is the foundation of every SWE job. A lot of University students over index on solving LeetCode Hard problems. Then struggle on the job because they've never built an app or system before. You need both skills to get into FAANG.Regarding your IT career, those skills will help you navigate the workplace more efficiently than a new grad. However, it may not give you a leg up in the interview process.",

Maybe you want a bit higher base - maybe you want a one-time bonus to help with relocation. I think if the company rescinds their offer over a reasonable negotiation attempt, I think it's not that great a loss.",

On that last point, it really drives me crazy, but when you have managers/stakeholders in the room, you need to speak to them with a language they understand, about concerns they care about, and at a granularity level that matters to them.I have one guy on my team, great developer, who spec'd out an EPIC level feature set, and wanted to present that to a manager. The only problem with his presentation is that it was way to granular, and talked about tickets in progress, focusing on the details of the how, and not the what/why. That's going to confuse the shit out of any manager whose trying to make sure the high level plan of the team is aligned to what they believe should get done.That's one thing, another is example is someone on my team shipping a feature without good product rationale, like the feature was just sort of garbage and we couldn't tell either way, and not backing down or and providing weak evidence that the feature was useful. What they said was basically: \"since we don't have data it's not good, we should keep it released and just observe\". Lol, I don't have data that my Greyhound can't drive a car, you think I'm letting him drive?Finally, the last thing which drives me completely crazy, is when people don't understand the purpose of meetings, and use the time in the meeting for something else. This just happened, where I was trying to run a planning session with the team, and an engineer goes: \"oh one more thing, u/justUseAnSvm can you navigate to the dashboard so I can show u/\" No brother, if you want a meeting to discuss this, schedule. Anyway, these are just some examples of things I notice in ambitious and competent engineers, that will otherwise be leadership material someday. I'm a real stickler for keeping things on track and not wasting peoples time. Your approach, listen, observe, and write it done, is a good one. Next step is to just ask for larger feature work. Don't forget, these skills take years and years to develop, so don't compare yourself wit any one else, just focus on making progress!",

But now, a lot of companies want near 24/7 availability and demand our prime hours, and a bunch of non-prime hours, too. Anyone working their monthly rotation knows this feeling right now. So fuck 'em. If you have a job which is chill enough where you have a few hours of slack a day or week, build during that. It can be difficult to do that stuff after hours on your own, but is considerably more compelling if you have to sit at your computer anyway during the day and pretend to be busy. You're inherently going to get slanted answers here, though. 1.5 years ago everyone would've told you to just job hop. Now most are saying \"hang onto your boring job for the love of God, please!\" We also used to have a lot more people aiming for extremely competitive FAANG-level jobs so their answers will/would reflect that. But if you want a career you can live with? And one which isn't going away after years of stagnation? I say enjoy your job as much as you can especially in this market, and work on things in your downtime.",

Highly rated competitive programmers use C++ because it provides you with fine-grained control over memory (pointers and such), which allows you to develop the most efficient solution to the problem. If your goal is to just get good at algorithms, then you don't need to concern yourself with those optimisations.Any language whose standard library implements arrays, hashmaps, priority queues, stacks and references will get you to the level where you want to go. This is why many people use Python for competitive programming because the code is more readable, and you don't have to type as much.However, if you are already good at Java, then don't learn another language just for CP. Stick to Java and master it. Personally, I use C++ and Python, but only because C++ was my first programming language, and I had to learn Python for a project I was doing 13 years ago.",

That probably doesn't help you right now at the moment you need a job, but medium/long term, I would definitely look at lateral moves to other functions. I think being early in your career actually helps you here because you'll be on the junior side for whatever you do. Do some dev work in your spare time if that interests you at all. Actually, even if it doesn't interest you, it's probably a good idea.There are two kinds of SDET jobs I see these days:One, what we used to call \"white box\" - someone who has dev-level skills and has written source code or close to it. These people can stand up a test framework from scratch and pipeline infrastructure for tests to run and report. These have a little more staying power and tend to have the opportunity to become other kinds of software engineering roles - devs, devops, release eng, etc. - when the business outgrows the need for dedicated QA.Two, jobs that are basically QA and mostly manual testing, but for companies that know they need to step up their testing game and need a stopgap while they either scale up their automated CI/CD efforts or offshore manual efforts. You can tell by the way I've described it that I don't think these roles have a bright future, but you might get to hang on for a while at a company that's struggling through that process.Observability, monitoring, and deployment tools have come a long way in reducing risk in software delivery since I started my career. Issues can be seen early and fixed quickly. Unit tests are fast and cover a lot of ground. There's still some use for end to end testing, but I see a drastically reduced need to have a specialized function for it that introduces additional process and the overhead of handing work off to different people along the way.",

These companies hire the candidates. And after few months they'll fire most of them4. Now as per contract candidate have to pay because candidate was placed by consultancy but due to his inability got fired. In 1st step they'll even try to convince you to get loan for their affiliated agencies.I'm not saying that this happens for all. But such things happens often.If you are desperate and decide to go through this, make sure to thoroughly investigate the consultancy before investing.",

        "body": "Hi Op, I just want to say I went through something like this recently. Here’s what I did: 1. No mention of it on resume. I put the accurate dates of when I was employed but kept the reasons why I had a gap to myself unless someone asked me. 2. Prepared a rehearsed answer to why do you have this gap? Something along the lines of:“I had a great experience in my previous role, it allowed me to grow a lot as a developer and accomplish xyz (keep it brief) however I had some personal circumstances that forced me to make the very difficult decision to step away from my job to take care of my personal life. I’ve used the last x amount of time to fully take care of everything and now I’m ready and excited to start my next adventure.” You can just run your own circumstances through ChatGPT and make it better for your specific situation. What I would NOT do? 1. Give any specifics about why you took the break (you should not be sharing medical information with a prospective employer to avoid putting yourself in a position you could be discriminated against due to health reasons). 2. Make it sound like you’re not ready to get back to work (it’s okay if you need accommodations later on, but for the initial conversations you want to give the impression that you’re ready and excited to get back to work). 3. Don’t sabotage yourself by offering any of this information unless explicitly asked. In my recent job search I spoke to almost 20 companies. Out of all of those only 3 actually asked me about the gap. I gave my scripted answer and they seemed satisfied enough with the answer to not bring it up again. Only 1 recruiter was kind of rude about it (Amazon) but he still moved me forward in the process so it didn’t hurt my chances at all. Don’t believe them if they try to neg you for having a gap. It’s not your fault, you’re doing your best and you WILL get back on your feet soon.I was open in my language about my “previous experience” and “in my previous role” but for most interviews nobody even brought it up and they have your resume so they know when you were employed it’s not up to you to over explain and if anything I think that would hurt you because you want to focus on what you bring to the company now, not what’s set you back before. One last thing, if you do have negative experiences with any company due to your break, you want to make sure you take that into consideration before accepting any offer from them. If they’re rude to you based on a gap on your resume, I can only imagine they’ll be worse if you ever have issues in the future and if your problem is something like ibs you want to make sure your next company is fair and understanding about medical accommodations. So take all that into consideration before accepting any offers. Best of luck! It was thought getting back into the industry as a mid level engineer with a gap, but everything worked itself out and it was so worth it to focus on my health first and foremost. Everything’s going to be okay!",

Some companies apply a flat percentage for promotions; companies I’ve worked at, for example, used a flat 10%.Other companies have set salary ranges and will use comp ratios to determine the increase. They also consider your current compensation. Generally, managers and the comp/HR team aim to bring employees close to a 1.0 comp ratio. For high performers, they may go higher. However, some managers or comp/HR folks might think that bringing someone straight to a 1.0 is too large of a bump, so they might offer a lower comp ratio instead. They may also feel a candidate needs ramp-up time or isn’t fully qualified, which can also justify a lower comp ratio—though there’s usually a floor, such as 0.9.Comp ratio, short for comparative ratio, is a measure used in compensation management to compare an employee’s current salary to the midpoint of a given salary range for their position. It’s calculated by dividing the employee’s salary by the midpoint of the range and is usually expressed as a percentage. A comp ratio of 100% means the employee is paid exactly at the market or target rate. Below 100% may indicate they’re underpaid relative to the range, while above 100% suggests they’re paid more than the midpoint—possibly due to experience, tenure, or performance. It’s a useful tool for ensuring pay equity and making informed salary decisions.",

Yeah, some people will claim that some subset of programming (usually frontend) isn't \"real\" SWE (usually in a derisive manner), and FWIW there are people that like to point out that professional engineering (PE) is a certifiable designation in some countries (e.g. Canada) and that those without it can't call themselves engineers (just like you can't legally call yourself a doctor or a lawyer without meeting the respective criteria).In practice, if you work with software professionally as your main duty, you typically qualify for SWE roles that are relevant. Nobody's policing where the line actually is, and yes, frontend SWE is a thing that people hire for.Personally, I find the labeling thing a bit silly given that the tone is usually along the lines of \"you can't call yourself X because you can't do [insert hard thing] (and I am better than you because I can)\", but that makes no sense because junior SWE who don't know how to do [most hard things] obviously exist and are, well, SWEs.",

You don't even have to like or enjoy tech.What I mean is when you're working with a system, technology, or even code snippet from Stack Overflow you actually care enough to understand how it works. You don't just consider it black box you can't peer inside and must take as a given. And you don't do this because you love it, but because you recognize this is part of your job.When you're more experienced this gets easier because you have a larger body of knowledge to fall back on. It's most painful when you're new, and to be honest a lot of people never get over the hump. This is because it's possible to get by for a while without this curiosity at lower levels. You have to actually choose to put in more work than you necessarily have to at some point.However you reach limits of what you can do without it because at a certain point your job is no longer about doing well defined widget-adjusting tasks, and furthermore this comes more suddenly than you'd think.Most of the times I've seen people flame out in this industry is because they precisely fell into this trap. They got comfortable doing simple things at lower level that didn't require curiosity and ended up digging themselves into a point where it was either psychologically or practically impossible to get up to being a \"grown up\" eng in the timeframe they needed to, because so much of what they were doing was just learning to invoke what may as well have been magic spells by rote.",

Welcome to being a reasonable adult. You will never be ready for everything an internship or a job will throw at you. You figure it out as you go.The joke used to be \"fake it till you make it\". Not exactly true, but not exactly false either.There are things that I need to learn every week in my job and I've been doing this for close to 20 years. There's always some new change to a tool or a framework or some new thing that just go introduced, a business process than changed, new requirements from the clients, new compliance consideration, etc.If you are fully qualified, you have a boring job which is very repetitive and you should leave because that type of work will rot your brain.So, words of encouragement:1. Don't have impressive projects? Well, do something about that. Make something. All the tools are free at this point. The only thing holding you back is you. Don't know how to do something? Learn it and then use it.2. The job market is rough, but if you keep at it, make a reasonable plan that lets you have a roof over your head and food in your belly while you search, you will be OK in the long term. You career is decades long. Can you point out the last time we've had a multi-decade economic downturn? No? Good, because that's never happened in the history of this country.",

It's analogous to civil vs electrical, they have some surface level commonalities early on but you have to fully commit to one in order to achieve a minimally employable skillset (and then commit to some amount of effort again if you're going to switch).Within SWE, there's a lot of variance, from the super-competitive big techs of the world to startups that are hungry for scrappy go-getters to \"boring\" F500 industries to the consulting world. Some don't even do DSA questions. Some don't even have recruiters. If you're worried about employability, it's going to be less about which tech field you decide to pivot to and more about how well you can conduct your job search; that in itself is a whole skillset on its own",

I’m worried that without an internship/job offer before graduation, I won’t be considered for these positions either.Starting in IT seems to be discouraged nowadays as it can “trap” people, or it can be a blemish on a resume if transitioning to development. I don’t see much talk about people attaining CS degrees with the intention of getting into IT. I wish I could more clearly express my thoughts, but I’m basically asking if I can take time to up-skill after graduation while working in IT and still be considered for a dev job in the future, or if getting into IT is a death sentence.",

Ain't no way you're seriously negotiating 50% more without expecting them to just rescind. And the reasonable-ness is relative to the *offer*, not the market. Even if they offer you 50% below market, asking for 50% more is not going to fly.That said, even though the risk of the offer being rescinded over reasonable negotiation is very low, it's still non-zero. There is still always a chance of the company going beyond playing hardball, and just fully rescinding. It happens. Not often, but it absolutely happens.So the question becomes, are you willing to take that non-zero (but close to zero) risk to get some more money? If so, negotiate. If not, don't.

High TC (especially if combined with #1) think Architects/Staffs/Sr. Staffs3. If you were on leave (maternity/paternity/medical/sabbatical).

Knowing how parts of a system work together is something you’ve already done, you just have to abstract that to other types of systems. 2. What type of system design question you’ll be asked will vary greatly on the scale of the company, the seniority of role, and the type of roll. You should not expect load balancing questions if you’re doing a front end engineering system design interview. If you’re doing backend at an established company, they probably won’t be asking about load balancing (because they’ve already solved that), but will probably ask about problems you’ll be expected to solve. 3. Unless you’re doing system design or architecture or tooling, they probably will just want to know that you can think in terms of systems. The specific database or asynchronous job or whatever other part won’t matter so long as you know how they interact or at a higher level what pieces are interacting. They care most that you’re able to grasp the whole system rather than that you remember the names of specific tools to build the system (unless they specifically list technology they use, then you should totally know about those technologies at a conversational level).4. ChatGPT is a great tool to prep for interviews. You can prompt it to create a series of questions for you for the seniority level and type of roll and company and interview type (systems design) you’re interviewing for. If you have the job description/company, that can help it be more specific. You can ask it to give you feedback or to help you fill in gaps in your understanding.",

First of all, medicine is fucking terrible. If you aren't in love with medicine, then you made the right decision. I literally just talked to my friend, 30F with Chinese immigrant parents, who said, and I quote: \"I honestly think I just hate being a doctor.\" She feels trapped because after 8 years of schooling and 3 years of training (residency), not to mention all the debt, what else is she plausibly going to do? **Do not consider med school** if you aren't in love with the prospect of becoming a doctor.Second of all, you don't have to particularly like coding. You have to not hate it. I'm blah on coding, I never spent a minute doing it outside of what I had to do and I'm going to keep it that way. But I'm not miserable doing it.Third of all, in terms of being an incompetent coder -- no offense, but you don't have the right to say that. If you spent the last three years using ChatGPT and not really actually applying yourself, then is the problem that everyone started earlier, or that you didn't actually build the skills in the foundational classes? As an analogy, if you didn't pay attention and learn stuff in algebra classes, then are you struggling in calculus because you don't have the aptitude, or because no one is born with an inherent knowledge and you need to build up the foundational pieces?Finally, no I do not think going *back* to school is a good idea. School is expensive. Take any data science electives while you finish up your degree. If you're *actually* interested, you can self-study most of data science. Even 10 years ago there were tons of online resources. A 3.15 GPA is not really the end of the world but you'll need to actually be hireable, and that means building skills. And if you can show that your last semester (or whatever) that your GPA went up, that'll assuage a lot of GPA concerns.",

I sacrificed everything for my parents and it was NEVER ENOUGH, so you do the things you feel that will benefit you and your life the most. You are 22 and still in school, so your parents still view you as a kid and not a young adult. Hearing you say you were having suicidal thoughts, I hear your pain. I’m glad you’re still here. Illness tells us, we are dumb, not enough, not smart enough, I am telling you, you are capable of anything you put your mind to.As for your school dilemma, I have a couple of thoughts. GPA matters way less then people realize in the workplace, how well you did in school has no bearing if you will help businesses make money or not or being effective at your job. The whole \"coding since childhood\" thing is pretty irrelevant too, we're adults now and no longer 8 lol. EVERYONE in the workplace uses ChatGPT and LLM's now. I can see just by the steps you are taking and trying to control things, shows me you are growing as a person, the same cannot be said for others lol. You also did not get a fair shot at pursuing CS properly. Even if you absolutely sucked at everything CS, you are in the 4th semester almost done. Starting over in different schools may not be the best idea tbh, job market as a whole sucks right now, and you could potentially land those jobs you are targeting with a CS degree, as what degree you have does not matter as much as people make it out. If you feel like a restart is what you need, then by all means. As long as it is YOUR decision, explore the other career path, make mistakes, do whatever you think is necessary to take controlReading that last bit about your mom is rough, that gaslighting is crazy. It is probably your moms way of trying to control you, and I am sorry you went through that. Anyways, hope you figure things out and we can get a post about you doing something great instead. Good luck in life.",

It’s not hip anymore, and is less likely to be used by newer companies, but there are still a ton of C# jobs.I would definitely look at learning .net / backend web development if you haven’t, because that’s probably more common than client-side C# work.Also, C# is very similar to Java, and pretty similar to Objective-C (for iOS / Mac applications). You can also learn most popular languages pretty easily if you understand C# well. Most software engineers change languages as frequently as they change jobs.Learning some JS, Ruby, or Python might help, as those are three extremely common languages on the backend.If you specifically want to build custom tools used internally (not client-facing), there are a ton of those jobs. These days web tools are probably more common than desktop programs, but in some industries the latter is probably still common. It might be hard to seek out “internal tools” jobs, because some of those roles involve building things for the core client-facing product as well. But basically every company with software engineers uses some of their time to build internal tools.",

Something realistic for a mobile dev to start learning and building towards an AI-related role. Any roadmap or resource recs would be super helpful.",

Then I reached out to some former teammates, and it turned out their team was hiring. They knew my background and thought I’d be a good fit. I interviewed, beat out a few other candidates, and landed the job.Those next couple of years were rough—definitely some of the toughest in my life—but I was working with friends and making solid money. Eventually, another former teammate told me about a better opportunity. I went for it, got the role (with even more money), and some of those same friends ended up joining that team too.Long story short: networking works. It’s been one of the biggest game-changers in my career.",

That said, it's not as if a Masters is *bad.* At worst the employer considers it equal to a bachelors, and at best they view it even more positively than a bachelors. There's nothing inherently wrong with bridge programs so long as they guarantee you entry into their associated masters program. I wouldn't go to one that didn't guarantee entry though. You'll have to put in more personal effort with a bridge + Masters, because you need to learn the entire CS undergrad curriculum in only 2-3 semesters and also Masters are obviously inherently harder than bachelors. I would also imagine it would take longer + cost more. But you do get a better degree.I think either are fine really, would decide based on other factors like which schools you're deciding between, their costs, how much you'd want to attend that school, etc. FWIW some schools (eg [UPenn](https://online.seas.upenn.edu/degrees/mcit-online/)) offer a CS Masters aimed at students from non-CS backgrounds (it's also entirely online at UPenn), so you wouldn't even have to do a bridge.

Some companies have a leetcode type exercise as the first step before even talking to a recruiter. I wouldn’t waste my time with those companies. 5)Your application is getting lost in a sea of fake applicants. With ai bots scraping all job sites, companies are reporting that most of the applicants are fake. Be that foreign nationals trying to fake their locations and identities to just spam applicants that meet no qualifications.
